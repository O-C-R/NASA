Astronautics and Aeronautics  for  1985 continues the series of annual chro- 
nologies of  events  in  aeronautics, aviation,  and  space  science and  explora- 
tion  prepared  by the  History Office of  the  National Aeronautics and  Space 
Administration.  A  compendium  chronology  covering  the  events  between 
1979 (the date of  the most  recently published Astronautics and Aeronautics 
chronology) and  1984 i s   in  preparation. 
The  present volume  introduces a  new format designed to make the  series 
more  useful  as  an  historical reference work.  Events  are  arranged  by  major 
subject categories and subcategories, and chronologically  thereunder. It was 
written by  Bette R.  Janson under the editorial supervision of the  Director of 
the NASA History Office. Items for  inclusion in this volume were collected by 
Eleanor H. Ritchie and  Lee  D. Saegesser of the NASA History Office. 
As  w i th   any  work  of  this  nature,  its extensive scope  has  made the  use  of 
primary sources  prohibitive. Thus  entries are  based  largely on  normally  reli- 
able secondary sources.  A l l   entries are  followed  by  their  sources  to  provide 
serious  researchers  points of access for  further  investigation. 
A chronology of this size necessarily involves considerable seiection;  read- 
ers are  invited to notify the NASA H is tory  Office of any serious omissions, as 
well as errors,  for  possible correction in subsequent volumes.

AEROSPACE  INDUSTRY 

March  78:  In  its  aerospace forecast and  inventory  issue,  Aviation  Week  re- 
ported that aerospace sales  would  continue  to expand in  1985 as  a  result of 
business that was  already on the books, with  reviving commercial transport 
orders expanding on earlier  rebounds in the military and space segments  of 
the  industry.  However,  as  strong  as  the  expansion  was,  sales  were  not  as 
robust i n  some markets as  had been predicted the previous year. 
Among the factors affecting the sales  picture was  Congressional trimming 
of military funding in  the  FY 85  budget. But Aviation  Week predicted that to 
trim  outlays  the  Pentagon  would  go  after operating  funds  rather than  hard- 
ware  money  that was  spent over  periods  longer  than  a year.  Thus  the  aero- 
space  industry  experienced  moderately  slower  but  still  firm  growth.  Also 
international  and  domestic  competition  was  intensifying,  particularly  be- 
cause the Pentagon sought to use competition as  a primary tool to hold down 
weapons costs. 
The  magazine forecasted  that  total  aerospace  sales  in   1985  would  reach 
$99  b i l l ion   and  over  $100  b i l l ion   in   1986. Military aircraft would  produce 
$32  b i l l ion   in   sales,  compared  with  $27.5  b i l l ion   in   1984;  missile  sales 
would  rise  to  $15.7  b i l l ion   from  $13.8  b i l l ion   in   1984;  space  technology, 
rebounding  from weak  sales  in  the  1970s,  would  reach  $14.8  b i l l ion  com- 
pared w i th  $12.5  b i l l ion   in  1984;  commercial transport orders would  revive 
from  the $6-billion  level  in 1984 to $9.2  b i l l ion  in  1985;  and business flying 
sales would  remain flat at  about $1.8  billion. 
Both transport and corporate aircraft had a common problem: the high cost 
of  relatively small  increments of new technology and the drop  in  fuel prices 
that had placed a premium on modest improvement in  fuel efficiency. How- 
ever,  all-composite turboprop aircraft for the business market were flying and 
might  begin  to  change that  situation  in   1986 and  87.  Also,  new  ultra-high- 
bypass engines ( in  some situations a euphemism for  propellers) were  under 
test  and  might  h i t  the  commercial  transport  market  in   the  early  199Os,  as 
would  increased  use  of  composites,  lighter  and  simpler  subsystems,  and 
more flexible cabins in  terms of seating,  galley,  and  lavatory layouts. 
Military  sales  levels  depended on  what  happened  to  President Reagan’s 
defense  budget  in  Congress.  Although  orders  on  the  books  would  carry 
industry  sales  for  1985  to  forecasted  levels,  a stalemate  in  Congress  would 
affect the  longer term outlook.  (AvWk, Mar  18/85,  10) 

August 8: The  Washington Post reported that  Fairchild  Industries would sell 
its 50% interest in  American Satellite Co.  and Space Communications Co.  for 
$105 m i l l ion  to Continental Telecom Inc.,  which owned the other half of the

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

two  joint  ventures.  Observers considered the  two  satellite  communications 
subsidiaries Fairchild’s  leading growth opportunities. 
American Satellite of Rockville (Amsat) provided private and general satel- 
lite  communications  services.  It  transmitted  regional  editions  of  The  Wall 
Street Journal, The New  York  Times, and  other  newspapers  and  had won  a 
large number of government contracts. 
Space Communications of Gaithersburg (Spacecom) owned and operated 
the tracking and data  relay satellite system  for  NASA,  provided communica- 
tions to  the  Space  Shuttle,  and was  building a $122.8  million  communica- 
tions  network for  the Air  Force. 
Fairchild president Emanuel Fthenakis said the company decided to sell  its 
interests in  Amsat  and Spacecom to consolidate i t s  other businesses. “We are 
addressing the  same  market  with  more than  one  company,”  he  said.  “The 
main  reason  i s  to consolidate o u r  activities  and address  these  markets with 
our wholly owned  subsidiaries.” 
Analysts said the move showed Fairchild was  unwilling or  unable because 
of  troubles  in   i t s   other  operations  to  invest  the  large  amounts  of  capital 
required to continue  to expand the two companies. (WPost, Aug 9/85,  B1) 

August  79: Martin Marietta Corp.  completed  an  agreement  giving  i t  a  2 5%  
stake  in   Equatorial  Communication  Co.,  a  provider  of  satellite-based  data 
communications networks,  the  Washington Post  reported. Under the  agree- 
ment,  Marietta  acquired  about  3.6  million  shares  of  Equatorial’s  common 
stock for $13.87% a share and warrants to purchase an additional  1.8  m i l l ion  
shares  for  $17.50  each.  Marietta  would  assume  two  seats  on  Equatorial’s 
board, which would expand to seven members. 
Equatorial,  which  provided  small,  low-cost  microearth  stations,  satellite 
transmission  capacity,  and  other  services  that  let companies construct  and 
control  their own  private data communications networks,  said  it planned to 
use the funds to  reduce debt and provide working capital. 
Marietta and  Equatorial said  they  planned to  pursue joint ventures  in the 
information  systems market. ( W Post, Aug 20/85,  E4)

AEROSPACE  RESEARCH A N D  DEVELOPMENT 

April  75: NASA  announced  that  Edward  Taylor,  a technician  at  Langley Re- 
search Center,  modified an  existing system,  the uresco ultrasonic  immersion 
testing  system,  by  adding a  holding device  that  permits accurate  ultrasonic 
testing of small diameter polymeric tubes used in  research programs, particu- 
larly small graphite fiber reinforced epoxy specimens, testing which formerly 
had to be done by  hand. 
The  existing  uresco  system  could  not  test  curved  or  cylindrical  shapes. 
Taylor’s  device  rotated the  tubes  about  their  longitudinal  ax is  while a high- 
frequency sound wave,  transmitted through the tube wall,  checked for  flaws. 
This new method would permit nondestructive testing of  tubular specimens 
without altering the electronic or mechanical configuration of the system. 
Engineers checked graphite tubes  for  defects,  trapped  gases,  void  spaces, 
or  foreign elements  like a  piece of  metal.  If  they  found  a  defect,  engineers 
then decided i f  the tube would  perform as one homogeneous material; i f  not, 
i t  was  discarded.  (NASA Release 85-57) 

lune  7 9  Dr.  Raymond Colladay,  NASA‘s  associate administrator  for  aeronau- 
tics and space technology,  said  in an  interview that  NASA was  developing a 
set  of  “technology  roadmaps”  that  would  provide  the  framework  for  the 
government, military,  and  industry to  implement programs that would  allow 
the  U.S.  to   meet  the  national aeronautics  research  and  development  goals 
proposed  in   a  White  House  report,  “National  Aeronautical  R&D   Goals,” 
Aerospace Daily reported. Dr.  Colladay said the  report, written  by the White 
House Office of  Science and Technology,  had charged  NASA with develop 
ing  the quantitative performance levels and technology steps  that  would  be 
required to achieve three major goals  in  subsonics, supersonics, and transat- 
mospherics. NASA hoped to have the  roadmaps,  being developed  in cooper- 
ation  w i th   the  Defense  Department  and  industry,  completed  in   July for 
review at the next planned interagency meeting. 
The  roadmaps “w i l l   represent a national consensus” on what  needs to be 
done  to achieve the aeronautics goals outlined  in the  report,  Colladay said, 
although they would  not spell out specific programs or funding  levels. 
The report had three goals: to advance technology for a new generation of 
fuel-efficient, affordable U.S.  subsonic aircraft;  to develop the technology for 
efficient,  long-range supersonic  cruise  capability  for  military  and  c iv i l   air- 
craft; and to develop options in aeronautics and space technology for  routine 
cruising  and  maneuvering into and out of  the  atmosphere with takeoff  and 
landing from conventional runways.  A fourth major national R&D goal,  Col- 
laday  noted,  was  to  maintain  the  basic  research  and  technology  that  s u p  
ported those three goals.

Colladay  singled out the  transatmospheric vehicle and  hypersonic speeds 
as  developments that would  be "the  biggest driver" with the "biggest  payoff." 
Observers  had  identified  hydroglen-fueled  scramjets  as  holding  greatest 
promise  in producing  substantially  improved propulsive efficiency over  cur- 
rent  rocket  technology.  Colladay  added  that  both  NASA  and  the  Defense 
Department were  "very  interested"  in  the hypersonic area. 
Vehicles of  that  type depended on further  technological developments in  
propulsion,  materials,  and  intelligent  integrated  flight  controls.  Colladay 
pointed out that  NASA  had made substantial progress in  all those areas over 
the  last decade. 
When  questioned  about  future  funding,  Colladay  indicated NASA  might 
not face  problems such as  those created  by  the Office of  Management and 
Budget when  reportedly  i t  had attempted  to delete  part of  the  NASA's aero- 
nautics budget. Colladay said,  "I think  that the content of the program, when 
we  focus  on these  national goals,  w i l l   not be subjected to the  same  policy 
disagreements that we have had in the past,"  which centered primarily on the 
role of  NASA  in  support  of  "civil  aviation oriented  research.  In the  case  of 
supersonic  cruise  research and  transatmospheric vehicles,  there  i s   no  long- 
term commercial driver  . .  .  that  industry would do on their own   . . . it 's 
a clear example of where  the government needs  to take  the  lead to make  i t  
happen,"  Colladay concluded. (MD, June 19/85,  1)  

Aeronautics 

During lanuary:  NASA  announced  i t  was  testing a concept,  called  laminar 
(air)-flow control,  which  removed the  layer of  air  molecules nearest  an  air- 
craft's  wing  surface  to  increase  transport-aircraft flight  efficiency.  Since air/ 
skin friction during a subsonic flight's  cruise phase caused  about one-half  of 
the  total  drag  on  an  aircraft,  the  laminar-flow  control  would  use  suction 
through porous w ing  surfaces to remove the turbulent air,  reducing drag and 
fuel consumption. 
NASA  contractors  had designed  and  fitted  two  laminar  flow-control  sys- 
tems on the leading edge of each wing of a JetStar four-engine light transport. 
Gloves,  perforated  either  by  more  than  a  m i l l ion   tiny  suction  holes or  by 
narrow slots, encased the systems.  Lockheed-Georgia Corp. had de'signed the 
test article on the Jetstar's left wing;  Douglas Aircraft Co.  the one on the right 
wing. 
Lockheed's  construction was  a  sandwich  of  nomex-honeycomb core  and 
graphite epoxy-face sheets,  covered by a thin sheet of titanium bonded to the 
surface.  Slots  i n  the  titanium  sheets,  .004  in.,  ran  the  length of  the  section 
and were  the openings that  drew air  through  the  surface,  directing  i t  down 
ducts  in  the  w ing   into  the  fuselage.  The  Douglas  test  article,  instead  of 

4 

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

slotted,  was  perforated by an  electron beam that  drilled 800 precise,  nearly 
microscopic holes per sq.  inch of wing surface. 
Both concepts had built-in systems to keep the w ing  surface insect and  ice 
free. The Lockheed system  pumped a cleansing fluid through the slots to the 
surface,  making  i t  too  slippery  for  insects  to  adhere.  The  Douglas concept 
used  a  retractable insect shield  deployed  in front of  the  leading-edge panel 
during takeoff,  climb,  descent, and  landing. 
After  tuning the  leading-edge systems for best  performance,  NASA  would 
flight  test  the  airplane  at  various  locations  around  the  country  at  different 
times of year  to  record effects of weather  and  insect conditions. 
Langley Research Center (LaRC) researchers managing the project pointed 
out  that  one  energy-saving  transport  configuration,  already  efficient  by  to- 
day’s  standards,  would  be 22%  more efficient with  the addition  of  laminar- 
flow  control.  (NASA announcement, Jan 85,  7) 
NASA announced that up to 20% of all fatal  light-airplane accidents might 
be preventable with  a  LaRC- and ARCdeveloped w ing  modification,  a care- 
fully designed “glove”  placed over  the outer portion of a wing’s  leading edge 
and covering about  the first  6  in. of  the  upper surface and  first  18  in. of  the 
lower surface. The glove was  lightweight,  had no moving parts, and required 
no maintenance. Wind-tunnel and flight tests of reshaped wings had revealed 
greatly  increased resistance to  airplane spins,  which could  result  in aircraft 
stalls. 
Before modification,  three  test  airplanes  would  enter  a  spin  about  18  of 
every  2 0   times  pilots  stalled  wings  and  applied  pro-spin  controls.  With 
LaRC’s  wing  leading-edge design,  the  same  planes  had entered  a  spin  only 
once  in  every  20   attempts. The spins  that d id  occur  had  required  improper 
airplane  loading or  extremely aggravated  pilot  inputs. And  the  pilot usually 
had three to four  times as  long (measured in  seconds)  to make a correction 
before the plane entered a spin. 
NASA  hoped  ultimately  to  provide airplane designers  with  the  ability  to 
incorporate the  modification  as  an  integral part of a wing,  rather than as  an 
add-on,  and the analytical tools  to determine amounts of spin  resistance for 
new  planes.  NASA  was  expanding  the  research  beyond  the  series  on  un- 
swept,  low-wing airplanes to include high-wing planes and those with differ- 
ent airfoil shapes.  (NASA anno Jan 85,  12) 

March  7:  NASA announced a demonstration at Lewis Research Center (LeRC) 
of  a  convertible  gas  turbine  engine,  which  could  operate  in  turboshaft  or 
turbofan modes or both simultaneously, that would enable future rotorcraft to 
operate either as  rotary or fixed-wing aircraft capable of speeds equivalent to 
commercial transports. The demonstration was  part of a joint  NASNDefense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program using a TF-34  engine 
modified under a General Electric Co.  contract. 

5 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

Such an engine would provide future X-wing  (Cbladed) rotorcraft with the 
necessary  shaft  power  to  take  off  vertically.  After  reaching  the  conversion 
speed,  near  200  knots,  the  pilot  would  disengage  the  transmission of  the 
rotorcraft and lock the rotor blades in  an “ X ”   configuration for operation as  a 
fixed-wing aircraft. The engine would  convert from shaft to fan mode in 15  to 
20 seconds to power the craft at speeds near .8 Mach. Landing would require 
reversing the conversion process. 
During the  past year,  designers  had evaluated performance characteristics 
of  the engine and  in  Dec  1984 accomplished successfully the  first  transient 
operation  simulating  the  conversion to  and  from  rotary-wing to  fixed-wing 
flight. The conversion had required  18 seconds,  with the engine responding 
as  predicted  throughout.  These  tests  had  represented  the  first  successful 
operation of a 5,000  hp-class convertible engine in  both fan and shaft modes 
and the first dual mode operation for an engine. 

The  new  engine would  make  possible a class  of  c iv i l   and  military  high- 
speed rotorcraft that could operate efficiently from hover to transonic speeds. 
(NASA Release 85-30) 

March 21:  NASA  announced  that  i t  had  scheduled  for  March  27  the  first 
government  flight  in  the  joint  Defense Advanced  Research  Projects Agency 
(DARPA)/U.S.  and the Air  Force/NASA X-29  flight  research  program. The X- 
29 was  a high-performance research  aircraft  incorporating a wide variety  of 
advanced  technologies,  each  aimed  at  producing  a  better  fighter-type  air- 
craft. As  a  technology demonstrator,  the X-29  was  intended to provide engi- 
neering  data  for  future  design  rather  than  to  serve  as  a  prototype  for 
production. 
The  flight  research program  followed  four  recently  completed contractor 
demonstration flights  flown  by  Grumman Aerospace  Corp.,  builder  of  the 
experimental  craft  for  DARPA.  A l l   flights  were  at  Dryden  Flight  Research 
Center  (DFRC). 
NASA,  Air  Force,  and Grumman  pilots would  fly  the  first  phase  or  initial 
concept  evaluation  of  the  government  flight  research  program  and  then 
would gradually  increase the performance of the forward-swept wing aircraft 
to s p e e d s  of about Mach 0.6 (almost 400 mph) at altitudes of about 30,000 ft. 
That phase would  include as  many  as  30 flights and would conclude during 
the summer. 
The first three flights would  concentrate on handling qualities and stability 
and control  aspects  of  the aircraft  in  i t s  backup flight  control  mode,  one of 
three different modes of the X-29’s  computercontrolled flight. These flights 
would  also  provide  p i lo t   familiarization  and  allow  smooth  program  team 
transition from  the  contractor  to  the  government.  NASA  test  p i lo t  Stephen 
Ishmael would  p i lo t  the first flight. 

6 

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

Following the  three  flights,  NASA  would  reconfigure  the  DFRC  control 
room  from  i t s   functional  flight  monitoring  mode  to  a  research  mode  that 
would allow the team to expand the aircraft’s flight  envelope for  the second 
flight  research phase scheduled for early fall  1985. 
Prior to s tar t  of the  second phase or  full envelope concept evaluation, the 
contractor would modify the aircraft‘s  flight control system to incorporate full 
envelope flight control  system capabilities. 
The second phase,  lasting through October 1986, called for as  many as  100 
research flights by  NASA and Air  Force pilots and should extend the X-29’s 
flight envelope to Mach 1.5, about  1,000  mph, and to 50,000  ft.  i n  altitude. 
(NASA Release 85-40) 

During  May:  Dr.  George  Keyworth,  II,  the  President’s  science  advisor,  re- 
leased a report of  the Aeronautical  Policy Review  Committee that  proposed 
national goals for  research and development in  aeronautics, NASA  reported. 
The  report  stressed  that,  i n  the  face  of  strong and growing  challenges  from 
foreign  interests,  the  U.S.  would  maintain  lasting  aeronautical  leadership 
only by vigorous application of the country’s traditional strength-innovative 
technology. The report also pointed out that there were aeronautical opportu- 
nities that could make virtually all of that day’s  operational military and c iv i l  
aircraft obsolete before the end of the century. 
The  report  reaffirmed  the  government’s  role  in   supporting  research  and 
technology  i n  aeronautics.  “From  our  viewpoint,  aeronautical research  and 
technology remain an important investment. Our national interests, i n  partic- 
ular our  national security  interests, dictate continued federal support.” 
The  first  goal  outlined  in  the  report  addressed  advancement of  technolo- 
gies  applicable  to  a variety  of  subsonic  aircraft  including short-,  medium-, 
and long-range transports;  rotorcraft;  high-speed turboprop engines; all-com- 
posite  primary  structures;  high-lift  aerodynamics  systems,  as  well  as  new 
flight control  and guidance improvements. 
The second goal concerned higher-speed regimes of supersonic transports. 
The  report noted that the  Reagan Administration had made no  commitment 
to supersonic transports,  but was  laying the groundwork,  both in  NASA and 
the  Department  of  Defense,  i n  the  fundamental  technologies  essential  for 
any future efforts  in  supersonic flight. 
The  third  goal  called  for  capturing  the  potential  payoffs  available  from 
super  high-speed  flight-hypersonic  speeds  and  transatmospheric  vehicles. 
These  vehicles would  operate from  conventional  runways,  maneuver a t   the 
fringe of  the atmosphere,  and ascend  into space orbit when  required. 
The  report concluded  that  the  government could only  provide part of the 
technological base and support to achieve those goals and that private indus- 
try must share in  the development of new technology and in  i t s  application to 
new projects. (NASA Activities,  May 85, 9)

l u n e  74: With the aim of eventually conducting a piloted  simulation study to 
assess  airplane  susceptibility to  tumbling  (an  autorotative  pitching  motion 
where  an  airplane  could  theoretically go  out of  control  end  over  end) and 
developing mathematical control  laws  for  providing  resistance to  tumbling 
motions,  Langley  Research  Center  was  testing  in   i t s   spin  tunnel  a modern 
configuration,  the X-29A  forward-swept wing demonstrator,  that had shown 
a tendency for the unaugmented airframe (without black box) to tumble,  the 
Langley Researcher reported. 
Certain modern aircraft design trends had established the need to study the 
phenomenon of tumbling.  One such  trend was  relaxed static stability, where 
a displacement in  pitch was  not automatically corrected by the natural aero- 
dynamics of  the  airplane;  however,  an  electronic  black  box  made  such  an 
airplane controllable. Other design trends contributing  to tumbling were the 
elimination of  aft-mounted  horizontal  tails  and  an  unprecedented demand 
for pitch agility. 
Langley's  free-tumbling  tests  and  "singledegreeof-freedom  free-to-pitch 
tests"  demonstrated  tumbling  motions that  could  not  be  controlled  by  the 
canard  (forward horizontal  wing)  surfaces.  The  strake  flaps were  somewhat 
effective d u r i  ng turn b l  i ng . Researchers a I so o btai ned ae rod y nam i c w i nd-t u n- 
ne1 data  for  the  X-29A  configuration  over  a  360°  angleof-attack  range  (to 
include flying backwards). (Langely Researchel;  June 14/85,  4) 

j u l y   8:  NASA  announced  that  i t s   Ames-Dryden  Flight  Research  Center 
(DFRC) would  begin  a  series  of  simulated airline  flights to  test  two experi- 
mental  laminar  air  flow  control  devices.  Previous  research had shown that 
laminar air  flow  could  reduce aerodynamic drag from  25  to 40%  and  thus 
provide  significant  fuel  savings  under  laboratory  conditions.  However,  in  
actual flight  insects,  ice, and other obstructions adhering to  the leading edges 
of an  aircraft's wings  could disrupt  laminar flow. 
Ames-DFRC  had  installed on  i t s  business-sized JetStar aircraft the  two  ex- 
perimental  laminar control flow  devices and would  simulate airline service 
flights  in  widely  separated  areas  of  the  U.S.  to experience a wide variety  of 
contaminant conditions.  NASA  would  conduct the  simulated airline service 
flights just  as  an  airline would under normal air traffic rules and regulations. 
During the test,  researchers  planned up to four  flights each day over  a two- 
week  period  to  gather  as  much  information as  possible on  the  test  articles' 
performance. 
The test article installed on the left w ing  used suction through 27 0.003-in. 
spanwise slots on the  upper and  lower surface  to  maintain  laminar  flow.  A 
propylene  glycol  methyl  ether  (PGME)/water  mixture  discharged  through 
several  slots at  the w ing   leading edge and  flowing back  over  the wing pro- 
vided  ice and  insect impact protection. Lockheed-Georgia manufactured the 
article for  NASA. 

8 

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

The  test  article on  the  right w ing   used  suction  through  approximately  1 
m i l l ion  0.0025-in.  diameter  holes  in the  titanium  skin  to  maintain  laminar 
flow on the upper surface of the article.  For  insect protection, a shield, which 
retracted at 6,000  feet altitude, extended much like a wing leading edge flap 
on commercial  transports.  Spray  nozzles behind  the  shield could  spray  the 
PGMVwater mixture on the  test  article for  additional  insect protection.  For 
additional  ice prevention, glycol was  forced through the wing's  porous metal 
section  of  the  shield  leading edge.  McDonnell-Douglas  manufactured  the 
article for  NASA. 
The JetStar would carry a Knollenberg probe, mounted atop the aircraft,  to 
measure the number and size of ice and water particles encountered in  flight. 
A charge patch,  located on the pylon that held the probe, would measure the 
static electric charge caused  by  particles  in the air  rubbing across  the  patch 
surface,  thus giving a qualitative measure of  ice and water  particles. Correla- 
tion of the probe and patch data could calibrate the charge measurement in  a 
simple cockpit  display. (NASA Release 85-101) 

ju ly   26:  In work  done under a  three-year grant  in  cooperation with Wichita 
State  University  (WSU) and  aircraft  and  component  manufacturers,  Lewis 
Research  Center  (LeRC)  developed  the  Electro-Impulse  Deicing  System 
(EIDI), which creates an electromechanical impluse at the leading edge of an 
aircraft's  w ing  to  produce a  minute flexing of  the  metal  skin  that  serves  to 
shatter, debond,  and remove ice buildup,  the  Lewis News reported. 
At  a  LeRC  symposium,  more  than  100 representatives from  various  com- 
panies and other government agencies met to review the results of the c o o p  
erative program to  develop a technology  base  for  EIDI.  Cessna Aircraft Co. 
planned  to  apply  for  Federal  Aviation  Administration  certification  for  their 
model 206 aircraft with the ElDl system. 
Although  several methods of  deicing  or anti-icing were  available,  all  had 
u ndesi ra ble  energy  req u i re men ts.  The  elect ro-magnet i c  i m pu I se  met hod, 
first suggested  in  1937 by Rudolf Goldschmidt,  a German national residing in  
London after World War  I I ,   offered a  promising alternative. 
During the  1950s and  1960s,  industry used  electro-impulse  methods for 
metals forming in  various  industrial processes.  In the  1970s,  the  USSR  pur- 
sued further research  including some aircraft applications.  However,  for vari- 
ous  reasons  the  development  stopped  short  of  full  implementation;  the 
system  still  lacked a well developed  underlying  technology  and  known de- 
sign  parameters.  Early ElDl  system  research  offered  promise of  ice  removal 
w i th   low   energy  requirements,  minimal  maintenance  (no  moving  parts), 
greater  reliability, and a weight and cost competitive with existing methods. 
In mid-1982,  LeRC  funded  a  six-month  grant  to  WSU  to  work  w i th   two 
small  plane makers and  an  aircraft electrical system  manufacturer  to  do   a 
feasibility  study  that  resulted in  a successful  icing tunnel  demonstration  in  

9 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

October/November  1982. LeRC  then  organized a consortium of  companies 
for  full development of the method for the whole range of civil aircraft,  each 
company agreeing to contribute some services or equipment to the project in 
return for eligibility to submit its own products for deicing design and tests by 
the  ElDl method. 
Engine aircraft candidates for  the  ElDl system  included commercial  trans- 
port  turbofans,  business jet  turbofans,  commuter  transport  turboprops,  and 
commercial transport propfans. (LeRC News,  July 26/85,  2) 

August 9: A flight today of an F-14  marked the completion of the latest phase 
in   the  plane’s  aileron-rudder  interconnect  (ARI) ‘program,  which  was  in- 
tended to coordinate turns,  prevent wing rock,  and resist spins at  high angle- 
of-attach flight conditions,  the  DFRC  X-Press  reported.  Dryden Space  Flight 
Center  (DFRC) modified the  F-14  X’s  basic analog flight  control  system  for 
ARI. 
Although  earlier configurations were successful in flight tests,  pilots noted 
a deficiency  in  loss  of  roll power in  high angle-of-attack flight  regions. NASA 
then  developed  a  “cross  control”  feature  in   the  ARI  system  to  correct  the 
problem. 
The  cross  control  feature allowed  the  pilot to  roll the  aircraft opposite  to 
lateral stick  input but in  the direction of the rudder pedal input. This gave the 
F-14  pilot roll power needed for  tactical maneuvering while the aircraft was 
in  a high angle-of-attack mode. 
Flight  tests  of  the  cross  control  feature  began  in June 1985.  Two  NASA 
Ames-DRFC  F-15  project pilots,  three  Navy pilots,  and one Grurnman pilot 
flew  these  initial  evaluation  flights.  As  part of  the  evaluation  program,  four 
other Ames-DRFC  pilots not  involved in the F-14  program flew  the aircraft. 
NASA  Ames-DFRC  pilot  Ed  Schneider  said  after  his  flight  that  ”The  new 
modification  permits improved rolling performance at  angles of attack above 
3 0 ° ,  yet  the  system  retains spin  resistance and wing rock suppression,  both 
ARI  features.” 
Navy personnel taking part in  the evaluation would  make presentations on 
program results to NAVAIR. Navy pilot Lt. Commander Chuck Baucom would 
also  present  results  at  the  Society  of  Experimental  Test  Pilots‘  September 
symposium.  (DFRC X-Press,  Aug  16/85,  2) 

August  74:  The  deputy  for  tactical  systems  at  the  Air  Force  Aeronautical 
Systems Division (ASD) issued a  request for  proposals for demonstration and 
validation of the Air Force’s  planned Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF), Defense 
Daily  reported. ASD  planned  to  award  up  to  four  fixed-price  contracts  run- 
ning approximately 3 3  months. 
Seven  ATF  concept  formulation  contractors  would  compete  for  the  con- 
tracts.  The  companies  were  Boeing Military  Airplane,  General  Dynamics, 

10 

Aerospace  Research and Development 

Grumman Aerospace,  Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas,  Northrop,  and Rock- 
well  Internatl. 
ASD  said the demonstration/validation contractors would develop detailed 
concepts and designs of the ATF  to meet operational needs,  conduct testing 
to  validate  and  assess  proposed  concepts,  and  identify  and  reduce overall 
program  risks prior to start of full-scale development. 
General  Electric and  Pratt  &  Whitney  were  competitively  developing the 
joint advanced fighter  engine for  the ATF. 
ASD  was  planning a FY  89 decision on full-scale development of the ATF, 
w i th   initial operational capability  set  for  1995.  The Air  Force estimated the 
cost of developing and building 12  research and development ATF  aircraft at 
$15.3  b i l l ion  and believed i t  could build the ATF  at a total unit cost only 20% 
higher than that of the F-15. 
A top Air  Force official  had noted  in 1984 that the ATF  would  have a basic 
Mach  1.5  speed  and that  i t  could  ernploy  technologies being demonstrated 
by the Grumman X-29  forward swept wing aircraft. (D/D, Aug.  14/85,  1 )  

August 23:  The testing of  the AFTVF-111  mission adaptive wing program at 
NASA’s  Ames-Dryden Flight Research Center (DRFC) was  an  important mile- 
stone,  the  DRFC X-Press  reported. It was  the aircraft’s first taxi  under its own 
power  in  four-and-a-half years. 
In  the test,  the control  room was  fully staffed,  the air crew was  aboard the 
aircraft just as  they would  be for the first flight,  and the airplane operated as  i f  
i t  were  ready  to  fly.  Engineers  checked  and verified all  aircraft and  control 
room displays,  including the mission adaptive wing color  panel  that  dupli- 
cated cockpit displays and featured a caution panel that  identified discretes, a 
trou ble-shooti ng tool. 
“Things  went  really well,!’  said  Ames  DRFC  AFTVF-111  project  manager 
Louis Steers.  “There  were some small problems on the aircraft,  but no show 
stoppers.”  (DFRC X-Press,  Aug 30/85,  2) 

September 9: NASA  announced that  pilots flew  the  NASNArmy XV-15  tilt- 
rotor  research aircraft w i th   its  stability control  augmentation system  (SCAS) 
both operative and  inoperative. The SCAS  reduced pilot workload,  allowing 
the  p i lo t  to devote attention to other  tasks;  however,  i f  the  SCAS  failed,  the 
p i lo t   had  to  provide  stability  and  control  commands.  A  primary  question 
answered  by  the  NASA  research  was  whether  a  p i lo t   could  fly  a  tilt-rotor 
aircraft w i th  a sidestick  controller when  the SCAS  failed. 
The  objective of  the  XV-15  tilt-rotor  research  aircraft  program was  to de- 
velop and evaluate tilt-rotor technology  for civil and military applications.  A 
tilt-rotor aircraft could lift off vertically like a helicopter and then,  by  rotating 
its  rotor thrust from  vertical  to  horizontal,  fly  like a conventional airplane at 
speeds  up  to  345 miles per hour.

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

The sidestick control system evaluation provided data tor the V-22  Osprey, 
a  tilt-rotor  aircraft  NASA  was  developing  for  the  Department  of  Defense 
(DOD). DOD would consider the flight test when deciding whether to use a 
sidestick controller  in  the V-22. 
Results of the flight evaluation indicated the sidestick controller  provided a 
reasonable means of controlling the aircraft with or without the SCAS.  How- 
ever,  when  the  third  axis  (yaw) was  added  to  the  sidestick  controller,  pilots 
noted  a  significant  increase  in workload,  indicating  that  additional  studies 
were  necessary  in this area. 
The  sidestick controller  system  used  onboard digital  computers and elec- 
tronics,  which  replaced mechanical  linkages that  normally  transmitted  pilot 
signals to the aircraft's  control surfaces. Ames  Research Center developed the 
system and would  refine and  reevaluate i t  during future control  system  stud- 
ies.  (NASA Release 85-124) 

September  70:  The C-5's  new  B model made its first  flight today  from  D o b  
bins  Air  Force  Base,  Georgia,  climbing to  15,000  feet  and  cruising  at  300 
knots-an  appropriate altitude and speed to determine airworthiness,  the Air 
Force Systems Command (AFSC) Newsreview reported. Airborne  for  slightly 
more than  three  hours,  the Galaxy began  5 5  hrs of  production  flight  testing 
designed to evaluate i t s   improved features.  Evaluation would  be shorter than 
usual  for  a newly  designed  aircraft because  the  C-5B  only  carried state-of- 
the-art  features added to the already proven C-5A. 
Col. Thomas Stover,  acting C-5B  director in  Aeronautical System's  Division 
(ASD) Deputy  for  Airlift  and  Trainer  Systems,  called  the  first  flight  a  "key 
event  .  .  . ushering in  a  significant  improvement to our  strategic airlift ca- 
pa b i  I  ity. " 
The  nine-member  crew  alternately  shut  down  and  restarted  each  of  the 
airlifter's  four  General  Electric TF39-1 C engines,  which  restarted without a 
hitch. 
Production flight evaluation would include airborne testing of an  improved 
onboard computer called MASAR  II, the malfunction detection analysis and 
recording computer. Pilots would also evaluate the improved automatic flight 
control  and  landing gear  actuation  systems. 
In October  1982 ASD  awarded  Lockheed Georgia a $50-million  prelimi- 
nary contract to  begin C-5B  production, and the first aircraft  rolled out July 
12,  1985. The Air  Force had contract options to buy 50 C - ~BS ,  at total cost of 
$7.8 17 billion. 
Military Airlift  Command expected to  receive its first  B model by  Decem- 
ber,  with  delivery  of  the  50th  expected  near mid-1989.  (AFSC  Newsreview,

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

September  73: Researchers  in the Workload and  Ergonomics Branch of  the 
Armstrong  Aerospace  Medical  Research  Laboratory were  working  to  adapt 
machines to pilots rather than the traditional other way  around,  the Air Force 
Systems Command Newsreview reported.  “The  success or  failure of  a  mod- 
ern  Air  Force  aircraft  and  mission  depends  on  whether  the  p i lo t   has  the 
ability  to  handle the  unpredictable situations typical  in  a  wartime  environ- 
ment,’’  said  Maris Vikmanis,  supervisory  industrial engineer  for  the  lab.  He 
explained that  laboratory  researchers studied how pilots performed in  differ- 
ent  environments,  including combat,  to  provide  information  to  aircraft  de- 
signers so  that  future aircraft would  be better adapted to pilots. 
But he pointed out there was more to it than simply assessing new aircrafts‘ 
cockpit designs.  “Not  only do we  have to observe how the pilot performs in  
the  aircraft  cockpit,  we  also  have  to  tap  into  the  p i lo t   himself:’  Vikmanis 
explained.  “We  must  know  how  much  effort  the  pilot  i s   expending,  his 
mental capability,  and his workload  limitation.” 
In  analyzing  cockpit  design,  researchers  checked  into  how  well  a  pilot 
could see  and  reach cockpit  controls and displays. 
On ly   in  existence  as  an  aerospace  research  field  since  1979,  workload 
research measured both the pilot’s  performance and his internal state of well- 
being.  By  combining  experiments  in  the  laboratory  and  in  flight,  lab  re- 
searchers  measured  human  performance/workload  using  three  different 
methods. 
First,  researchers  used  a  computer-based  performance test  to  measure a 
pilot‘s  physical  and  mental  action.  By  having  the  p i lo t   perform  up  to  11 
different tasks,  researchers  could  characterize various aspects of  human be- 
havior. 
Second,  pilots answered, after  flying a  simulator or an  actual aircraft,  s u b  
jective questions about their experience. 
A third method measured human performance/workload from a physiolog- 
ical viewpoint by collecting and analyzing vaGable  responses of the  human 
brain,  heart,  muscles,  and visual system. 
Lab scientists and engineers used the test data to prepare a workload scale, 
which  focused  on  problems  the  pilot,  aircrew,  and  the  aircraft  itself  might 
encounter in  the future. 
NASA was applying similar methodology to the Space Shuttle and i t s  crew, 
particularly  to  examine the  effects on astronauts  of  microgravity  as  an  ele- 
ment of stress.  (AFSC Newsreview, Sept  13/85,  7) 

September  17:  NASA  announced  the  first  flight  at  Ames  Dryden  Flight Re- 
search  Facility, scheduled for  late September, of the advanced fighter technol- 
ogy  integration (AFTI) F-111  with a mission adaptive wing (MAW). The AFT1 
F-111  research aircraft was  modified with a wing that could change its cam- 
ber (fore and aft wing curvature) and its wing sweep to adjust to varied flight 
conditions. 

1 3  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  expected that  MAW'S variable camber capability would  allow opti- 
mum efficiency at  supersonic,  transonic,  and  subsonic  speeds  by  adopting 
the  best  wing  shape  for  each  speed.  The  MAW  program  was  intended  to 
demonstrate that smooth variable camber technology  showed  improvements 
over  current  aircraft  w ing   lifting-altering devices  in   such  areas  as  aircraft 
payload and  range  capability,  maneuverability,  fuel  efficiency,  and  aircraft 
handling qualities. 
The first flights would test the airworthiness and flight envelope expansion 
phase  of  the  program,  followed  by  the  research  phase.  The  plans  for  the 
initial  phase  called  for  about  15  flights  that  gradually  increased  the  MAW 
aircraft to speeds  of approximately Mach  1.05  and altitudes of about 35,000 
feet.  NASA  expected  that  phase  to  be complete  by  January 1986;  and  the 
research  phase,  about 30  flights,  by June 1986. 
The MAW system had smooth-surfaced, variablecamber wing leading- and 
trailingedge flaps,  an actuation mechanism, hydraulics, and redundant com- 
puters to control  flap positions. S ix   independent trailingedge flaps (three per 
wing)  and  two  leadingedge  flaps  provided  a  smooth continuously variable 
w ing  camber using flexible fiberglass skins on the  upper surface and sliding 
panels on the  lower surface. 
Fully developed,  the  MAW  system  would  result  in  an  aircraft  equipped 
w i th   an  automatic  flight  control  system  with  several  control  modes.  Cruise 
camber control mode would optimize the trailingedge flap position for max- 
imum  cruise  speed.  Maneuver  camber  control  mode would  continuously 
position leading and trailing edge for optimum  lift-todrag ratio depending on 
the  l i f t   coefficient  and  speed  of  the  aircraft.  Maneuver  enhancemendgust 
alleviation mode would enhance the aircraft reponse to pilot control  inputs, 
wh i le  reducing the aircraft's  sensitivity  to wind gusts. 
Designed for  research rather than  as  a  production  prototype,  the AFT1  F- 
111  was  a jo in t  program of Ames-Dryden Flight Research Center and the U . S .  
Air  Force's  Flight  Dynamics  Laboratory. The  Boeing  Military  Airplane  Co. 
manufactured the MAW.  (NASA Release 85-129) 

October  4:  As  part  of  the  continuing  Lewis  Advanced  Turboprop  Project 
(ATP), supported by some 50 contracts and 15  grants,  two advanced propeller 
propulsion  systems  recently  underwent  testing,  the  Lewis  News  reported. 
Lewis Research Center's  (LeRC) Advanced Turboprop Project Office was  di- 
recting development  of  the  new  highly  loaded,  multi-bladed  propellers for 
use at speeds  up to Mach 0.85  and at  altitudes compatible with commercial 
air  support  system  requirements. Advanced  turboprop  engines  offered  the 
potential of  15  to  30%  savings  in  aircraft  fuel  burned  relative  to  advanced 
turbofan engines (50 to 60°/0  savings over  the current turbofan fleet).  Investi- 
gators were developing both single- and counter-rotation propeller systems. 
Researchers  at  Wright  Patterson  Air  Force  Base  were  testing  in   a  static 
propeller test  rig the first  Largescale Advanced Propfan (LAP),  designed and 

14 

Aerospace  Research and   Development 

bu i l t  by Hamilton Standard  Div. of United Technologies Corp. under a NASA/ 
LeRC  contract.  Testing  of  the  nine-foot  diameter  propfan,  powered  by  an 
electric drive motor  in the  rig test,  began in  late August. 
At  approximately  the  same  time,  the  General  Electric  Co.  began  static 
proof-of-concept tests of  its Unducted Fan  (UDF) demonstrator engine at  the 
GE  Peebles,  Ohio,  test  site.  LeRC  partially  funded  development of  this  ad- 
vanced counter-rotating pusher propellers propulsion system. 
After completing  a  series of ground tests,  both advanced propeller propul- 
sion  systems  would  undergo  flight  tests  starting  in  mid-to-late  1986.  The 
propfan  would  be tested  in  a  wing-mount  installation on  a  modified  Gulf- 
stream  II testbed aircraft under a  NASA-contracted program with  Lockheed; 
the  UDF would be tested as  an  aft-mounted pusher on a Boeing 7 2 7  as  part 
of a GUBoeing cooperative program. 
The  propfan  of  the  LAP  program  was  an  example  of  the  application  of 
single-rotation tractor propulsion technology, whereas the UDF was  a unique 
example  of  counter-rotation  pusher  propulsion  technology.  The  UDF  was 
unique  in  that  its  propellers  were  directly  driven  by  the  multi-stage power 
turbine without  the need for gearbox speed  reduction. Normal procedure in 
propeller  installations was to drive the propeller through a reduction gearbox 
so  that  both the  propeller  and  its driving  turbine  operated  at  close  to  their 
optimum speeds  for  peak efficiency. 
The  APT  effort  was  also  addressing  more  conventional  counter-rotation 
propfan configurations,  as  well  as  associated gearbox designs.  (LeRc  News, 
Oc t  4/85,  1)  

October 9: NASA announced it signed w i th  the  Federal Aviation Administra- 
tion  (FAA) and the  Department of  Defense (DOD) a memorandum of agree- 
ment to conduct a two-year study of the possible benefits to the nation of the 
continued  development  of  tilt-rotor  aircraft.  In  particular,  the  study  would 
assess  the broader implications of V - 2 2   aircraft development,  including the 
potential for  other  versions and  sizes,  both  civil and military; c iv i l  certifica- 
tion  issues;  c iv i l   production  impact on  the defense  industrial base;  and any 
indirect technology spin-offs. 
Tilt-rotor aircraft  combined  the  vertical  take-off-and-landing ability  of  the 
helicopter w i th  the relatively higher cruising speed and longer range of fixed- 
w ing  aircraft. 
A small proof-of-concept aircraft,  the XV-15,  was  tested successfully,  lead- 
ing to a larger tilt-rotor aircraft,  the V - 2 2   Osprey,  which DOD  was  develop 
ing.  DOD expected  the  V - 2 2   to  bring the  tilt-rotor  configuration  closer  to 
maturity,  enabling  lower  risk  development  of  other  versions  and  sizes,  for 
both military and civilian use. 
The  FAA  would  certify  any  c iv i l   versions  of  a  U.S.  tilt-rotor  aircraft  and 
would assess  i t s   impact on the national airspace system,  airport and heliport 
development,  and other air service needs. 

1 5  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  acquired  a  high  level  of  expertise  in   tilt-rotor  technology  during 
development  and  flight  testing  of  the  XV-15,  and  the  agency  also  had  a 
charter  to  study  use  of  NASAdeveloped  technology  and  to  assess  future 
research  needs.  (NASA Release 85-144) 

October  18:  NASA  announced  the  first  flight  of  the  NASA/Air  Force/F-111 
mission adaptive w ing  (MAW) [see Aerospace R & D/Aeronautics, Sept.  171 at 
the Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility. The flight accomplished functional 
verification of the variable camber MAW at flight conditions up to MACH 0.6 
and altitude of  15,000  feet. 
The  Boeing Military Airplane  Co.  manufactured  the  MAW.  (NASA  Da i ly  
Activities Report, Oct 21/85) 

December  13:  NASA  announced  that  during  1985  it began a  series  of  re- 
search  flights under simulated airline conditions to evaluate the effects of an 
operational environment on new technology for  smooth,  or  laminar,  airflow 
over  aircraft wings  [see Aerospace  R  &  D/Aeronautics,  July 81.  Previous  re- 
search  had shown this technology could  reduce aerodynamic drag from  25 
to  40%  under  laboratory  conditions  and  could provide significant fuel  sav- 
ings. However,  insects,  ice, and other obstructions could disturb laminar flow 
in  actual  flight service. 
To  test  the  system  in  an  operational  environment,  NASA's  AmedDryden 
Flight Research  Facility's  business-sized jet  Star,  equipped with  two  experi- 
mental  laminar flow  control  devices, was  based  in  Atlanta and flown  in  and 
out of commercial airports in  the southeast and midwest,  including those in  
St.  Louis,  Cleveland, and New Orleans, to test the devices in humid summer 
climates. 
Wh i le   based  in  Pittsburgh to  test  the devices  in early  autumn  east  coast 
conditions,  the plane flew  in  and out of airports  in  Boston;  Chicago; Chatta- 
nooga;  Cleveland;  Charleston,  W.Va.;  Washington,  D.C.;  Detroit;  Bangor, 
Maine; New York;  Kalamazoo, Michigan; Oklahoma City; Albuquerque;  and 
Denver among others. 
The flight tests  would continue  in  1986 with the plane based  in  Cleveland 
during January. (NASA Release 85-170) 

Balloons 

February  1 7 :   Ben Abruzzo,  who took  part in  the  1st balloon  crossings of  the 
Atlantic and Pacific oceans,  died February 11  along with five others when his 
twinengine  Cessna  421  plane crashed after  takeoff  from  Coronado Airport 
north of Albuquerque,  the  Washington Post reported.

Aerospace  Research and Development 

In 1978 Abruzzo,  along with Maxie Anderson and  Larry Newman crossed 
the  Atlantic  in  the  Double Eagle  II,  landing near  Paris  after  the  3,000-mile 
flight.  Late  in  1981 Abruzzo,  Newman,  and two other men flew  the  Double 
Eagle V  across  the  Pacific.  Lifting off  November 9 from  Nagashima, Japan, 
Abruzzo  crash-landed  four  days  later  in   northern California  in  one  of  the 
worst storms  there  in  20  years.  Abruzzo and another crew member won  the 
Gordon Bennett race  in 1979. ( W  Post,  Feb  13/85,  C6) 

Large Space Systems 

january 24: Marshall Space Flight Center  (MSFC) announced that a  Decem- 
ber 1985 experiment, EASE or the experimental assembly of structures in EVA 
(extravehicular  activity),  aboard  Space  Shuttle  flight  61-C  would  provide 
information  about  humans working  in  space.  In the  experiment,  two  crew 
members  would  move  six  aluminum  beams,  each  12  feet  long  and  four 
inches in  diameter,  into space from the Space Shuttle payload bay and assem- 
ble them  into a tetrahedron shape and then disassemble them.  This experi- 
ment would demonstrate human ability to build strong, practical structures in  
space.  During the experiment videotape and still  photographs would  record 
crew  member movements to   link beams  by  special connectors at  the  beam 
tips. 
This  building  approach  was  a  technique  in   the  Large  Space  Structures 
program called an  “erectible”  method, as  opposed to a “deployable”  method 
that would not be demonstrated until 1986 or  1987 when NASA would orbit 
a structural-assembly demonstration experiment. MSFC had conducted tests 
similar  to EASE  in  its neutral buoyancy simulator, a million-gallon water tank 
that gave  a sense  of  weightlessness to  submerged  people working  in space 
suits. Researchers would  compare assembly and disassembly times recorded 
i n  the  space  test with  results found  in the  neutral buoyancy tank.  However, 
MSFC’s  Ed  Valentine,  experiment  manager,  noted,  “We‘d  like to  be able  to 
measure a human’s  productivity  in space  scientifically,  and we’re  not  really 
sure  i f  time  measurements are all that  are  needed to guage  that,  so we’ll  be 
examining other  possible criteria to use  in  the future.” 
A  Langley Research Center structural  assembly experiment would  accom- 
pany the MSFC experiment.  (MSFC Release 85-3) 

During April:  NASA announced i t  awarded to Howard University’s School of 
Engineering Large Space  Structure Institute (LSSI),  Washington,  D.C.,  an  on- 
going grant expected to total $1.9  m i l l ion  to develop theoretical knowledge 
supporting  the  design  and  construction of  very  large space  systems.  NASA 
expected the  knowledge to make a  significant contribution  to the establish- 
ment of  large space stations and space  settlements. 

1 7  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985  

The LSSl  research project would help demonstrate the practical benefits of 
US .  space capabilities,  including construction of a  solar  power satellite that 
would convert the sun’s  energy  into electricity for  transmission back to earth 
and construction of  large platforms that would allow scientists to observe the 
earth for  improved understanding of the weather and the ground water table. 
The  LSS l   team would consist of  Dr. Taft  Broome, chief  project investigator 
and  chairman  of  the  Department  of  Civil  Engineering,  and  other  Howard 
University  faculty  members;  and one faculty  member each  from  the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge University, and  Rensselaer Poly- 
technic  Institute.  Graduate  students  from  the  latter  institutions would  also 
participate. 
NASA was  primarily interested in LSSl doing the concept development and 
the  research and demonstration  analysis.  Once  Broome and  his  team  pro- 
vided  the agency w i th  the needed data,  NASA could turn  the project over  to 
private industry for  implementation. (NASA Activities,  Apr  85,  8) 

Launch Vehicles 

January  9:  NASA  announced  that  Lewis  Research  Center  awarded  a 
$32,346,000  follow-on  contract  to  General  Dynamics’s  Convair  Division 
(GD/C) to erect,  test,  and  launch (with accompanying launch facility modifi- 
cations) Atlas-Centaur  launch vehicles  and  to  perform  support  testing and 
launching  of  Centaur  upper  stages  from  the  Space  Shuttle  in  1986;  GD/C 
would work  at  Kennedy Space Center. The  cost-plus-award-fee contract,  be- 
ginning January l, 1985 and running through December 1986, was  a continu- 
ation  of  work  GD/C  had  performed  under  earlier  contracts.  The  Centaur 
should increase the Space Shuttle’s capability to carry  heavier payloads from 
low-earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit or  interplanetary trajectories. (NASA 
Release 85-5) 

During March:  In  a  report  of  1984  accomplishments,  Arnold  Engineering 
Development Center (AEDC) commander, USAF Col. Philip Conran, said that 
AEDC  conducted more than 200  separate test and evaluation programs dur- 
ing FY 84 and demonstrated the  importance of the center’s  full-spectrum test 
support to development and operational aerospace  programs. 
In that  year,  propulsion  systems  testing dominated test  and evaluation ef- 
forts,  turbine  engine testing  being  the  busiest  in  the  history  of  the  center. 
Much of  that  had  resulted from  the  new  start  for  the  F109  next-generation 
trainer engine and the fly-off competition between the F110 and F100 engines 
for  the USAF’s  F-16  Fighting Falcon and the subsequent product verification 
of  the  F110. 

18 

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

In rocket motor  testing,  AEDC  conducted three  altitude test  firings of  the 
inertial upper stage  (IUS) in an effort that  helped Space Division and Boeing 
Aerospace Co.  successfully understand and f i x  the April  1983 upper stage  in- 
flight  anomaly.  After  failure  of  the  Palapa  B-2  and  Westar  6  commercial 
satellites to  reach desired orbits,  AEDC  supported the conversion of defense 
and  commercial  satellite  perigee and  apogee  booster  motors  from  carbon- 
carbon to carbon phenolic  rocket nozzles. 
AEDC  considered  completion  of  construction  of  the  aeropropulsion sys- 
tems  test  facility  (ASTF) its  outstanding achievement  for  1984 and was  pro- 
ceeding  with  activation  and  acceptance  testing  to  prepare  the  ASTF  for 
operations  in September  1985. 
In the flight dynamics area,  AEDC  completed in  a specially modified  vac- 
uum chamber the  initial  ground testing phase of  the antisatellite pathfinder 
sensor  that  required the  use of a  spin mount rig,  which had been three years 
in  development, and an optical alignment system that provided accuracies on 
an  order  of  magnitude  better  than  any  other  available  system.  AEDC  also 
developed and successfully demonstrated a new test technique of spinning a 
nose cone to evaluate reentry erosion. 
One of  the most productive programs at  AEDC  in  1984 was  for  the C-17 
advanced cargo  aircraft.  AEDC  provided more data  in   less  time  than  usual 
and saved  the sponsors  about $1 m i l l ion  in  wind-tunnel  test time. 
The in-house technology program, which supported testing and evaluation 
missions,  delivered  needed  test  techniques for  testing of  advanced  reentry- 
vehicle  materials,  engine  icing,  and  rocket motors.  For  example,  AEDC  a p  
plied a flash  X-ray  technique  and worked  with  the  University of  Tennessee 
Space  Institute to enhance the  image of three test firings of the  inertial upper 
stage,  resulting  in  successful  completion  of  the  anomaly  investigation.

l u l y   72:  Arnold  Engineering Development Center completed the  fourth and 
final  qualification  test  firing  of  the  Payload  Assist  Module-D  (PAM-D)  II 
rocket  motor,  the  Air  Force  Systems  Command  Newsreview  reported.  The 
PAM-D  II featured  increased propellant capacity (7200 Ib.) over  its predeces- 
sor,  the  PAM-D  (4400  lb.),  and  could boost  both  military  and  commercial 
communications  satellites  into  geosynchronous  orbit  about  22,300  miles 
above earth. 
A  Space  Shuttle would deliver the motor and  its payload into space  at  an 
altitude of  160 to  180 miles,  where the PAM-D  II satellite package,  spinning 
at  30 to 85   rpm,  would  spring-eject from the orbiter’s  open bay doors. 
At a safe distance from the orbiter, the PAM-D  II, which served as  a perigee 
kick  motor,  would  ignite  and  propel  i t s   payload more  than  22,000  miles 
higher.  PAM-D  II would  then  separate  from  the  payload,  which  was  posi- 
tioned  by  its own  apogee motors activited by signals from earth.

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

AEDC  test-fired  the  motor  in  one  of  its  high-altitude  rocket development 
test cells at a simulated pressure altitude of approximately  100,000  feet while 
spinning i t  about  i t s  thrust axis at  70  rpm. Test  objectives were to determine 
ballistic performance and  to  take  plume  (exhaust) radiation measurements, 
which were  important in  determining  i f  the exhaust radiation would damage 
the motor case or satellite. 
With the  fourth  test  completed,  the Air  Force considered the  motor  ready 
for production and flight. Morton Thiokol’s Wasatch Division was  the rocket’s 
manufacturer.  NASA  had  tentatively  scheduled  PAM-D  11’s  first  flight  for 
November  1985 aboard the Space  Shuttle Challenger to place the  RCA  SAT- 
COM  satellite  into orbit.  (AFSC Newsreview, July 12/85,  7) 

July 26: NASA announced the Lewis Research Center awarded a  $10,169,016 
contract to General  Dynamics Corp. for  management and engineering serv- 
ices  in  support  of  the  Atladcentaur  launch  vehicle  program.  The  contract 
also called  for  the  company  to  provide technical management,  engineering 
design,  analysis  and  development,  engine  testing  and  development,  and 
reliability and quality  assurance.  The cost-plus-award fee  follow-on  contract 
would begin July 1985 and continue through December 31,  1986. 
Centaur was  a high-energy,  upper-stage used with expendable boosters to 
deliver  large payloads to geosynchronous orbit.  NASA  was  modifying it for 
use as an  upper stage on the Space Shuttle. (NASA Release 85-110) 

Augus t   1:  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC)  announced  i t   awarded  a 
$12,386,535  sole source fixed-price-incentive-fee contract to Teledyne Indus- 
tries,  Inc. for  the fabrication,  assembly,  and testing of digital  computers and 
remote multiplexer  units  in  support  of  the  Space  Shuttle/Centaur  program. 
Work began  in  July 1985 and would  run through October  1987. 
Digital computers  would  serve  as  the  focal  point  for  the  Centaur  flight- 
control  system,  processing  data  from  the  other  flight  boxes  including  the 
multiplexer  units. They would also  provide the  hardware capability  to  inter- 
face with the orbiter and ground system; 
NASA  scheduled the  first  Centaur  launch-the  Ulysses  mission-for  May 
15,  1986,  from the Space Shuttle payload bay  followed on May 21,  1986,  by 
the Galileo  mission.  (LeRC Release 85-58) 

September  6:  NASA  announced  that  its  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC) 
awarded a $79,194,665  contract to General Dynamics Corp.’s  Convair D iv i-  
sion  to  support  the  Space  ShuttleKentaur  program  from  August  30,  1985 
through  June  1987.  Under  the  cost-plus-award-fee  contract,  General  Dy- 
namics would  supply  labor,  materials, and  resources necessary  for  manage- 
ment and engineering services and  launch operations services to  implement 
the program.

Included  in  the  multi-contract concept were  services  such  as  overall  pro- 
gram  management;  administration and engineering support;  technical man- 
agement;  operations,  planning,  and  integration;  and  launch  complex 
modifications. 
NASA  planned  that  the  Space  ShuttleKentaur  combination  in May  1986 
would  launch  Ulysses,  the  first  and  only  planned  mission  to  observe  the 
polar  regions of  the sun,  and a  week  later Galileo  to explore Jupiter’s atmo- 
sphere.  In spring 1988 the combination would  launch the Venus  radar m a p  
per mission to   investigate the surface and  interior of Venus.  (NASA  Release 
85-125) 

September  9: General  Dynamics would  delay  for  more than  two weeks  the 
delivery  of  the  first  Space  Shuttle/Centaur  upper  stage  to  the  company’s 
facility  at  Cape Canaveral  Air  Force Base,  adding an  increased schedule  risk 
to  already  tight  timing for  launch  in  May  1986 of  the  Galileo  and  Ulysses 
missions  on  trajectories  toward  Jupiter,  Aviation  Week  reported.  Martin 
Winkler,  General  Dynamics  Space  ShuttleKentaur  program  manager,  said 
the stage  remained in  San  Diego to complete acceptance testing and also to 
conduct some tests  that were to have been done in  Florida. Winkler  said that 
keeping the stage  in San  Diego to complete assembly and testing would  not 
affect the testing and processing schedule in  Florida, since i t  would be deliv- 
ered  in  time  for  the  scheduled mating with  the  Centaur  integrated support 
structure (CISS). 
Winkler  said  the  schedule called for  completion  of acceptance testing by 
September 11  and that there were no unresolved flight safety issues,  although 
i t  was possible some might come up during future safety  reviews and subsys- 
tem qualification testing. 
Problems fixed  prior  to  shipment  included  a mislocated  forward  bearing 
bracket that  held each of the  12  springs on  the stage,  installation difficulties 
resulting from a minor tooling problem,  and strut reengineering required for 
installation of a component in  the tank. 
The  CISS,  which  was  then  in  Florida  for  the  first  Space  Shuttle/Centaur 
stage,  was  flight hardware and was  a complete system with only some  small 
parts yet to be delivered by mid-September. NASA had scheduled a major test 
for  September  16,  when  the  assembly would  rotate with  a l l   of  the  installa- 
tions  in  place to  assure  clearances.  A  November  milestone would  be  four 
tanking tests. 
The second Space  ShuttleKentaur was  on schedule;  contract date for de- 
livery of  the  second stage and second ClSS was  the end of  December. Gen- 
eral  Dynamics estimated  i t  would  deliver the  second Space  ShuttleKentaur 
on  November 22 and the second ClSS on October 29.  (AvWk, Sept 9/85,24) 

October 7: NASA announced that  i t  signed a 21-month agreement with Scott 
Science and Technology,  Inc. (SST)  to  provide technical expertise to  SST  in  

2 1  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

the development of  a commercial  liquid-fuel upper stage for  boosting Space 
Shuttledeployed satellites to geosynchrous orbit. 
SST,  whose president was former astronaut David Scott, had worked for two 
years  on  developing  the  upper  stage,  called  the  Satellite Transfer  Vehicle, 
which would  be able to boost satellites ranging from 2,000  to  19,000  Ib. O n  
some  missions,  the stage would  be recoverable. 
Engineers at NASA's  Johnson Space Center would monitor the stage's  devel- 
opment and consult with  SST  s ta f f   on  technical  problems. SST would  reim- 
burse NASA for  the use of any  test facilities and the salaries and travel of JSC 
personnel working on the project.  (NASA Release 85-143) 

November 27: NASA's  Marshall  Space  Flight Center  (MSFC) requested pro- 
posals  for  a  12-month study  of  an  advanced  high-thrust,  high-performance 
liquid oxygen/liquid  hydrogen rocket engine that  could be used  for  the ad- 
vanced launch vehicles being examined in  NASNAir  Force Space Transporta- 
tion  Architecture Studies (STAS), which  included  heavy  l i f t   launch vehicles, 
Defense Da i ly  reported. NASA considered the advanced LOWhydrogen cryo- 
genic  engine  and  a  new  LOXhydrocarbon engine  to  be  key  elements  to 
advanced transportation  systems.  MSFC said  i t  planned to award  up to three 
parallel firm-fixed-price  contracts  for  the  study  of  the  Space  Transportation 
Main Engine (STME). 
During the  study,  the  contractors would  prepare parametric trade-off data 
for engine requirements and configurations that might be employed in  future 
launch vehicles.  NASA  would  compare  these  engine  configurations to  the 
Space  Shuttle  main  engine  (SSME )   for  application  to  new  launch vehicles. 
The  contractors would  identify  candidate  engine  configurations,  compare 
their  features,  and  then  recommend engine configurations that  would  best 
satisfy the  requirements of future  launch vehicles. 
The three principal contenders for the STME study were Rockwell's Rocket- 
dyne  Div.,  prime  contractor  for  the  SSME;  and  Aerojet  Technologies and 
United Technologies's  Pratt & Whitney  Aircraft,  who  conducted component 
improvement studies for  the  SSME .   (D/D, Nov 21/85,  105) 

Military Applications 

Ap r i l  26: Although the Defense Department's fourth edition of Soviet Military 
Powerdescribed an unfavorable imbalance between U.S. and Soviet strategic 
forces  and  research programs [see  USSWMissiles,  Apr.  11,  the annual  report 
of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense for  Research and  Engineering stated that 
the  U.S.  would  lead  the  Soviet  Union  in   virtually  every  basic  technology 
"critical to  defense''  over the next 10 to 20 years,  Science reported,  including 

2 2  

Aerospace  Research and Development 

many that would be crucial to the success of a  sophisticated ballistic missile 
defense. 
U.S.  technology  was  superior  in  computers and  software,  electro-optical 
sensors,  guidance  and  navigation,  materials,  microelectronics,  optics,  pro- 
pulsion,  radar,  robotics,  signal  processing,  telecommunications,  and  signa- 
ture  reduction  (or  stealth),  the  report  said,  and  also  in   life  sciences, 
productiodmanufacturing,  and  submarine  detection.  The  Soviets,  in   con- 
trast,  led  in  no areas  and  matched the  U.S.  only  in  aerodynamics,  conven- 
tional and nuclear warheads,  and power sources. 
In the area of weapons systems,  the  report said the U.S.  was  superior  in 25 
of  30  categories; the only exceptions were  in categories where the  U.S.  had 
not chosen  to  deploy  any  weapons  or  where  the  U.S.  was  ready  to  deploy 
what experts believed were vastly superior weapon systems. These categories 
included deployed antiaircraft missiles,  a deployed ballistic missile defense, 
deployed chemical weapons,  and deployed antisatellite weapons. 
The  report  concluded  that  the  ”strengthening  of  the  U.S.  military  R&D 
commitment  w i l l  make it more difficult for  the  USSR  to close existing tech- 
nology gaps.”  (Science, Apr  26/85,  478) 

May  70: Deputy Secretary  of  Defense William  Howard Taft  gave approval to 
the  U.S.  Air  Force  to  begin development of  higher  thrust  derivatives of  the 
Pratt & Whitney  F100 and General Electric F110 engines that powered the F- 
15  and  F-16  fighters,  Defense  Daily  reported. The  development  program, 
expected to cost between $400 and $500 million, would boost the thrust of 
the 24,000-lb.  thrust F l O O  and 27,000-lb.  thrust F l l O  to 29,000  Ib.,  about the 
maximum possible. 
Air Force Assistant Secretary Thomas Cooper said durability,  not thrust,  was 
the key problem for fighter engines and that the new engines would have the 
same  durability  as  current  engines.  He said  the  Air  Force  planned  to  start 
production  of the engines in 1989 and to complete annual buys on a shared 
basis. The Air  Force would  seek  warranties on the derivatives as  on current 
engines, access  to proprietary data,  and pre-priced production options. 
Cooper  said  the  new  engines,  costing slightly more than  current  engines 
that were  between $2  and  $3  m i l l ion  apiece,  would  have  the  same  dimen- 
sions as  present engines,  could be used  in all models of  the  F-15  and F-16, 
and  could  be  retrofitted.  He  pointed  out  the  Navy  could  also  use  either 
derivative engine for  its fighter  program. 
Under questioning, Cooper declined to say  whether the Air  Force planned 
to  buy  the  Northrop  F-20  fighter  in FY  87,  but said the Air  Force was  inter- 
ested  in the aircraft and needed more detailed cost data to make a decision. 
Northrup had offered to supply 396 F-20s  over  four years  at a fixed price of 
$15  m i l l ion   per  plane;  however,  Cooper  said  the  Air  Force  required  more 
detailed  data on the  “bits  and  pieces”  of  the  program  in order  to  make the 
cost comparison that people were asking for.  (D /D ,  May  10/85,  57)

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

/une 26: U.S.  Rep.  George Brown, Jr. (DCalif.1,  author of an  amendment  to 
prohibit  tests  of  the  antisatellite  miniature  homing  vehicle  (MHV-ASAT) 
against  objects  in   space,  suggested  that  in   light  of  the  successful ground- 
based  laser  test  w i th   the  orbiting  Space  Shuttle  [see  Space  Transportation 
System,  Military  Applications,  June 211,  the  U.S.  should drop  the  MHV   in  
favor  of  a  laser antisatellite system,  Defense  Daily  reported. 
Brown said  that ”.  . . This very successful demonstration raises the ques- 
tion of whether  the United States should spend sewral b i l l ion  dollars on the 
technologically  less-advanced  MHV  ASAT  system,  s t i l l   in  the  testing  stage, 
when  we  could  have  a  more  technologically  advanced,  far  more  versatile 
system  available for  deployment in  the same  timeframe  . . . and  probably 
at a  lesser cost.” 
Brown emphasized the significance of the  laser  test,  which  he  noted had 
h i t  a target  on the Space  Shuttle “less  than a foot  in  diameter,  much smaller 
than an ICBM, traveling faster than a missile, and there i s  no question but that 
a missile would be just as  easy  to hit.” 
Although  lethality was  not demonstrated in  the test,  the U.S.  had “demon- 
strated  lethality  more  than  10  years  ago  when  we  knocked  down  a drone 
airplane w i th  a  laser,  and we  haw now in the  inventory  lasers w i th  about a 
m i l l ion  times the energy of the one that was  used”  in  the Space  Shuttle test, 
Brown added.  “There  i s  no question that  lethality i s  achievable w i th  existing 
technology.”  (D /D ,  June 26/85,  318) 

/u ly   12:The  U S .  Air Force rolled out the C-5B  today,  the first B model of the 
free world’s  largest  military cargo  aircraft,  the Air  Force Systems  Command 
Newsreview reported.  Although  it looked  like a C-5A,  the  new  C-5B  had 
many  improved features  including state-of-the-art materials and  avionics.  It 
also had the new wings,  which would boost the service life of the aircraft to 
30,000  flight hours,  that the Air  Force was  retrofitting to the A model. 
The Air  Force planned to  buy  50 C-5Bs,  nearly doubling its capability to 
airlift  non-stop anywhere  in  the world  large  equipment  such  as  the Army’s 
74-ton mobile scissors bridge, Abrams M-1  tanks,  and helicopters. When the 
purchase  of  the  C-5Bs  was  completed,  the  Air  Force  would  be  about  18 
million-ton-miles per day  short of  its goal of  66-million-tons per day  of  out- 
sized  airlift  capability,  the  minimum  capability  recommended  i n   a  1981 
Congressionally mandated mobility study. The Air  Force planned to make up 
the difference by acquiring the C-17. 
Four  improved General Electric TF-39  engines,  rated at 41,000  Ib. of thrust 
each,  powered  the  C-5B.  The  aircraft  seated  75,  and  i t s   seats  were  30% 
lighter  than  the  A  model’s,  decreasing total  aircraft  weight  by  725  Ib and 
cutting fuel consumption by an  estimated $13 m i l l ion  y r
 the  l i fe  of the C- 
5B  fleet. 
The  C-5B’s  24  main  landing gear  wheels  had  carbon  brake  assemblies 
w i th   multiple discs.  More than  400  Ib.  lighter  per  aircraft,  the  new  brakes 

24 

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

doubled the life of the A model’s beryllium system and should bring about an 
estimated 20-year savings of  $20 million. 
In  October  1982  the  Air  Force’s  Aeronautical  Systems  Division  had 
awarded  a  $50-million  preliminary  C-5B  production  contract  to  Lockheed- 
Georgia. Plans called for early September flight testing of the first production 
aircraft at  Dobbins AFB,  Georgia. The Air  Force had contract options to buy 
50 C-5Bs  for  $7.817  billion.  (AFSC Newsreview, July 29/85,  1) 

August23:  In the first test of the precision location/strike system  (PLSS),  three 
TR-1  aircraft picked up a  radar signal like one an enemy might use to guide a 
missile  attack  and  passed  the  signal  direction  and  time  data  to  a  ground 
station  computer.  The  computer  analyzed  the  data,  compared  inputs  from 
the  three  aircraft,  and  pinpointed  where  the  radar  signal was  coming from, 
the  Air  Force  Systems  Command  Newsreview  reported.  If  the  source  had 
been  an  enemy  site  for  radardirected  missiles,  artillery,  or  an  anti-aircraft 
system,  the US. Air  Force could quickly direct an F-16  to i t  for an attack. The 
PLSS  passed  the  test  by  zeroing  in  on  a  prepositioned  radar  emitter  the 
moment  i t s  signal started. 
Lt. Col. Day1 Donahey, PLSS program director for the Aeronautical Systems 
Division,  called  i t  “a  giant  leap forward”  for  future  wartime capabilities of 
U.S.  tactical forces.  “The  system performed better than expected at  this point 
in  its development testing,”  he said. 
Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. was developing the PLSS,  which featured 
an  integrated,  lethal mix of ground-based and airborne electronics. 
In  an  operational  scenario,  the  three  highly  instrumented,  high-altitude 
TR-1  s  would fly  racetrack patterns behind the forward edge of a battle area. 
Around the clock,  in  all kinds of weather,  the TR-1  listening platforms would 
detect enemy electronic transmissions. Despite dense electromagnetic  inter- 
ference,  the  TR-1s  could  pick  up  individual  pulses of  enemy  radar.  (AFSC 
Newsreview, Aug 23/85,  1) 

December  6: Lockheed Georgia, manufacturer of the C-5B  Galaxy,  resumed 
flight testing of the aircraft after  it replaced about  12,000  fastener nuts on the 
plane,  the Air  Force Systems Command (AFSC) Newsreview reported. Lock- 
heed-Georgia grounded the  plane  after  its  September maiden  flight  when 
quality  control  inspectors found that construction crews  had  installed alumi- 
num,  instead  of  steel,  nuts  on  the  first  eight  planes.  The  mistake  slowed 
production  and temporarily  halted certain aircraft flight  testing. 
Col.  Thomas  Stover,  acting C-5B  program  director  for  Aeronautical  Sys- 
tems  Division,  said,  ”It  is  important to  note that  flight  safety  was  never  an 
issue. The concern was  for  development of  maintenance problems  10  to  15 
years  down  the  road.”  Stover  explained  that  steel  nuts  were  stronger  and 
lasted  longer than  aluminum  nuts and  that,  although there were  about  3.7 
m i l l ion  nuts for each C-5B,  only 35,000  had to be steel. 

2 5  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Lockheed-Georgia  spokesman  Dick  Martin  said  workers  installed  the 
wrong  nuts  because  some  engineering  drawings,  used  by  supervisors  and 
assembly line workers,  were not specific about nut type.  He said about  3 E i O i 0  
of the nuts had to be replaced on the first  aircraft. 
The Air  Force had scheduled the  first  C-58  for  delivery by January 1,  and 
Lockheed-Georgia still  expected  to  deliver  the  aircraft on  time  because  the 
company had been four weeks ahead of schedule before the delay caused by 
the  replacement.  (AFSC Newsreview, Dec 6/85,  4) 

Simulation Technology 

March 20: NASA announced that a five-year project a t  Lewis Research Center 
(LeRC) resulted  in  development of  the  real-time multiprocessor simulator,  a 
low-cost  easily  programmable  computing  system  that  simulated  or  moni- 
tored  complex  physical  processes  in  real  time.  The  simulator  could  offer 
considerable savings,  for example,  in  the development and testing processes 
for  producers of airplane engines. 
Real-time simulations were  particularly important  in  studying the  internal 
aerodynamics of a jet engine,  including such variables as  the performance of 
turbine  and  convergentdivergent nozzles,  bypass  valves,  injectors,  and  fan 
and compressor geometry  and the  coordination of  these variables with  fuel 
flows and flight controls.  In a  real-time simulation of a helicopter engine,  the 
NASA system  solved all 63  engine equations within  1/100th of  a  sec. 
The  system  had  hundreds  of  real-time  applications  where  there  was  a 
critical  need  to  simulate  or  monitor  many  processes  at  once  or  when  the 
reaction of one process could be vital to the performance of another,  such as 
monitoring the  structural  dynamics of  a  space  station  at  several  locations, 
with  a processor dedicated to each  location. 
The essence of the NASA system was  a network of computers tied together 
and operated simultaneously but with different programs, each one a portion 
of  the  overall  task.  The  system  could  detect  a  change  in  one  aspect  of  a 
dynamic  process and  report  the  effect of  that  change  on  other  parts of  the 
process. U s  i ng state-of-the-art, h i g h-pe do  r m ance m icrocom pu ters,  NASA sci- 
entists  had  designed  hardware  configurations  that  enabled  a  person  at  a 
single terminal to control up to 10 microcomputers operating simultaneously, 
each  handling a  portion of  a  total program. NASA  scientists  had also devel- 
oped  a  companion  form  of  computer  language,  taken  from  the  PASCAL 
format,  that  enabled  an  engineer  who  was  not  a  computer  specialist  to 
program his or her own  multiprocessor for experimentation and monitoring. 
(NASA Release 85-39) 

December  6 :  NASA  announced that  a  flight  simulation  laboratory, the Man- 
Vehicle  Systems  Research  Facility  (MVSRF),  was  in   operation  at  its  Ames 

26  

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

Research  Center  to  give  scientists  a  new  tool  to  study  human  factors  in 
operating commercial aircraft. 
The MVSRF contributed to flight safety by allowing researchers to simulate 
the  complex  set  of  relationships among pilots,  their  crews,  converging air- 
craft,  the weather,  and air traffic controllers. Using the facility,  scientists could 
study  the  effects of  new  and  increasingly automated technologies  on  flight 
crew  performance.  NASA's  human  factors  researchers  worked  directly  with 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  airplane manufacturers,  and commer- 
cial  airlines to  improve  flight  safety.  For  example,  with  the  727  simulator, 
NASA  scientists  researched  airplane  landings  to  learn  methods  that  mini- 
mized  fuel  consumption  while  allowing  pilots  to  maintain  safe  distances 
between their planes and other air traffic. 
The MVSRF  included an exact  replica of a Boeing 727 cockpit,  a mock air 
traffic control  station,  and  a  cockpit  known as  the advanced  concept  flight 
simulator  (ACFS). In both  the  727  replica and  the ACFS,  a computer visual 
system provided out-the-cockpit window displays of approaching aircraft and 
landscapes of many U . S .  airports.  The computer system also depicted clouds 
and other weather conditions, the glow of the horizon a t  dusk and dawn,  and 
the varied texture of  the area  illuminated  by  the  simulated aircraft's  landing 
lights. 
Researchers a t   the MVSRF  put  the  pilots and  controllers through  created 
situations,  during which  the  researchers monitored communications among 
flight crew members and between the crew and traffic controllers. They also 
read the aircraft's  instruments and observed flight control settings while mak- 
ing audio  and  video  recordings  that  included  tracking  a  pilot's  eye  move- 
ments. (NASA Release 85-162) 

December  20:  Scientists  at  the  Air  Force  Geophysics  Laboratory's  (AFGL) 
Space Physics Div. developed a computer program that predicted the electri- 
cal  effects  of  the  highly  charged  polar  space  environment  on  spacecraft. 
These  effects could  range from  the  production of  noise in  circuits to system 
failure  in  extreme cases,  the Air  Force Systems Command's  (AFSC) Newsre- 
view  reported.  Called  Potential  of  a  Large  Object  in  the  Auroral  Region 
(POLAR), the code simulated in three dimensions the electrical interaction of 
the  Space  Shuttle or  any  other  space  vehicle  with  the  polar  space  environ- 
ment in the region from 100 to 600 miles above earth. Space Shuttle launches 
from  Vandenberg Air  Force Base  would  orbit  through  the  polar  region,  and 
the polar charging code could provide important data  for  the design of  large 
space structures such as  space stations. 
Lockheed Corp. used POLAR to predict the effect of charging on the Space 
Shuttle  in  low-altitude  polar  orbits  with  payloads funded  by  the  Air  Force 
Space  Test  Program  Directorate  and  other  Air  Force  and  NASA  programs. 
RCA  performed  calculations  with  POLAR  for  the  Defense  Meteorological 
Satellite Program vehicles. 

2 7  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA’s Spacelab 2 mission scientists used POLAR to predict the electrified 
gaseous  environment,  or  plasma,  of  the  Space  Shuttle  when  the  Plasma 
Diagnostics Package,  a  free-flying satellite,  deployed.  And  NASA’s  LAGEOS 
Satellite Project Office would use  POLAR  to study charged particle drag on 
this  laser reflecting satellite. 
POLAR was  a successor  to  NASCAP (NASA Charging Analyzer  Program),, 
the  computer  code AFGL  developed with  NASA  to  model  charging of  Air 
Force  satellites  at  geosynchronous  altitude.  The  European  Space  Agency 
(ESA) had used that code to design weather and TV  relay spacecraft, and the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory used  it to design the Galileo  satellite. 
POLAR would  incorporate data derived from  future spacecraft flights and 
would  become  a  computer-aided  design  tool  for  the  construction  of  the

Transatmospheric Vehicle 

A p r i l  2:  Robert Cooper,  director of  the Defense Advanced  Research Projects 
Agency  (DARPA),  said  in testimony delivered  in   late March before the  U.S. 
House Armed Services Committee research and development subcommittee 
that a space plane capable of flying to anywhere on the earth within  half an 
hour  to  intercept enemy  bombers or  perform  space  s p y   missions might  be 
possible within  the next  10 years,  the  Washington  Times  reported. 
The  US.  Space  Shuttle,  which  had  limited ability  to  maneuver  in space, 
was  put  in  orbit only  after  a  lengthy and complicated  rocket  launch.  So  the 
U.S.  Air  Force  wanted  a  ”transatmospheric  vehicle”  that  would  be  able  to 
quickly  reach and  return  from  space  like an ordinary aircraft.  Cooper said a 
recent breakthrough in  so-called  ramjet technology  might make possible an 
aircraft capable of taking off from a runway and reaching speeds of Mach 2 5  
(times the speed of sound), the velocity necessary to escape earth’s  gravity. 
Cooper noted the plane would weigh about 100,000  Ib.,  take off from and 
land on a  10,000-foot  runway,  and probably use hydrogen as  a  fuel.  Only  a 
small amount of  rocket power would be  required to  “deorbit”  the  plane,  he 
said. 
DARPA  proposed to  bu i ld  two full-scale model  ramjet engines for  testing 
on  the ground.  ”There  are a number of  very  interesting technical  problems 
here  .  . . none  of  them  insurmountable.  They’re  all  within  our  grasp,” 
Cooper said. 
Cooper  explained  that  the  ramjet  combustion  providing  the  extra  boost 
took  place only when thg air flowing through the jet engine chamber was  at 
supersonic  speeds.  Ordinarily,  to  get  air  flowing  at  this  speed  through  the 

28  

Aerospace  Research and  Development 

entire length of  the chamber,  the aircraft  itself had to  be moving at Mach 6. 
However,  “a  way  has  been found,”  he said,  “to  use  a subsidiary  scheme for 
driving the air through the engine up to supersonic speeds,  even  though the 
vehicle on which the engine i s  attached  is sitting on the  runway.” 
By  slightly varying the geometry of  the engine,  i t  might  be possible to fly 
the aircraft from takeoff to Mach 6,  and “with  slight variations” fly from Mach 
6 to  14 and then to Mach 25,  Cooper said. 
The  Air  Force  and  Navy  were  interested  in  the  engine,  development  of 
which marked a resurgence in  hypersonic speed research that had been “put 
on a back burner”  in the  late  1960s, Cooper commented. ( W  Times, Apr  2/ 
85,  3A) 

November 21: U.S.  Air  Force Maj. Gen.  Donald Kutyna said  today  that  the 
Defense Department had decided to proceed with a $500 m i l l ion  program to 
design a hypersonic plane capable of flying around the globe in less than two 
hours and of flying in  the highest reaches of the atmosphere and to provide a 
low-cost  method  for  launching  satellites  and  other  equipment  critical  to 
President  Reagan’s  Strategic  Defense  Initiative,  the  N Y   Times  reported. 
Speaking at a Colorado Springs symposium on space technology,  Kutyna said 
construction of  the  plane itself could cost $2  to $3   billion. 
“It  i s  something we are very  serious about, and we  think the technology  i s  
now  w i th in   reach,”  said  Kutyna,  who  coordinated  the  Air  Force’s  research 
and development of space systems.  “We  have been examining the principles 
for some time,  and now we are  ready to head into the next phase.” 
However,  in Washington  an  aide  to  George  Keyworth  I I ,   the  President‘s 
science advisor,  said,  “Funding  for  the  project’s  next  phase  i s  not assured.” 
He  noted Congress would  have  to approve  the  program.  “This  i s  all  a  little 
premature,” the aide noted. “We  have not yet presented the plan to President 
Reagan.” 
But on  November 20 Keyworth and top officials on the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and NASA presented details of the plan to 
members of Congress interested  in  aerospace issues. 
Unlike  the  Space  Shuttle,  which  was  launched  vertically  w i th   rocket 
boosters,  the  aerospace plane would  take  off  like an  ordinary  airplane,  but 
would  not have jet  engines with  heavy  compressors,  making the  aerospace 
plane a light-weight vehicle.  “Once you  reach about Mach 3,”  or three times 
the  speed  of  sound,  Kutyna  said,  “the  air  streaming  through  the  engines 
begins to compress  itself. Some studies indicated that the plane could attain 
speeds  of  Mach  20,  although  there  were  experts  who  said  half that  speed 
would be more reasonable. 
If successful, the project could solve a key  problem for the military: drasti- 
cally  reducing the cost of  placing satellites and defensive space weapons  in  
orbit.  (NYT; Nov 22/85)

February  6 :   President  Reagan  and  USSR  Chairman  Konstantin  Chernenko 
had  approved  the  idea of  establishing ties  between  the  U.S.’s  Young  Astro- 
nauts and the Soviet’s  Young Cosmonauts, the  Washington Post reported, as a 
step  toward better U.S.-Soviet  relations and peaceful cooperation in  space. 
The  program would  begin with  a  Young  Cosmonauts’  delegation  visiting 
the  U.S.  to view  a  space  launch and  tour  space  facilities. Young Astronauts 
would  then  write  to  Young  Cosmonauts,  explaining  their  interest  in  space 
and  what  the  groups  might  accomplish  together.  Those  writing  the  best 
letters would visit, a l l  expenses paid,  their  letters’  recipients. In addition,  the 
International Aeronautical  Federation had adopted the Young Astronaut pro- 
gram and planned to offer  i t  to other nations to establish ties between Young 
Astronauts and Cosmonauts around the world. 
In his Washington Postcolumn, jack Anderson wrote that the Young Astro-

with  NASA. 
North  had  joined  the  National  Advisory  Committee  for  Aeronautics 
(NASA’s  predecessor agency) in  1947 as  a test-pilot engineer at  LeRC.  In 1959 
North had transferred to NASA Headquarters, where he participated in early 
planning for  Project Mercury,  including selection and  training of  the  seven 
original Mercury  astronauts;  in   1962  N o r t h   assumed  leadership of  the  JSC

Sullivan,  an  astronaut  since  1978 with  197.5  hours  in  space,  served  as  a 
mission specialist on the October 1984 Space Shuttle mission 4 1 4  and was 
the first American woman to perform an extravehicular activity or space walk, 
during which she and astronaut David Leestma conducted a 2.5-hour  dem- 
onstration of the potential of  refueling satellites  in  space. 
Gardner,  an  astronaut since  1978 with  337 hours  in  space,  had flown  on 
the  August  1983  Space  Shuttle  mission  STS-8, 
the  first  night  launch  and 
landing  using the  orbiter Challenger,  and  in  November  1984 on  the  51-A 
mission, during which the crew retrieved two communications satellites that 
had failed to  achieve proper orbits after  launch from an earlier Space Shuttle 
flight.  NASA  refurbished the satellites for  reflight. 
During the A i r  Show,  the astronauts would make numerous public appear- 
ances,  participate in  media interviews, and assist  NASA's  marketing efforts at

applications for  p i lo t  and mission specialist  positions to one where  i t  would 
accept applications from civilians on a continuing basis beginning August  1, 
1985, and nominees from the military on an annual basis. NASA would make 
selections in  the spring of each  year  with  successful candidates reporting in  
the summer. Mission requirements and attrition  rate of  the current  astronaut

lune   79: NASA announced that Dr. Joseph Allen,  who  in  November 1982 was 
a mission specialist on the four-member crew of mission STS-5,  the first fully 
operational flight of the Space Shuttle, would  resign July 1,  1986 from NASA 
to  become  executive  vice  president  of  Space  Industries,  Inc.,  a  Houston- 
based  firm  pursuing commercial ventures  in space.  Allen  also  flew  on  mis- 
sion  51-A, 
the  second flight  of  Discovery, during  which  he  participated in  
the  deployment  of  two  communications  satellites  and,  in   the  first  space 
salvage  mission,  helped  retrieve the  Palapa  8-2  and Westar  VI satellites  for 
return to earth. 
In addition to  his astronaut work,  Allen  was  a mission scientist  for Apollo 
15,  staff consultant on science and technology  to the President’s Council  on 
International  Economic Policy,  and  NASA  assistant administrator  for  legisla-

September  73: During a  recent ceremony,  the  U.S.  Naval Academy  named a 
new  Space  Systems  Research  Chair  in   memory  of  two  naval  astronauts- 
Roger  B.  Chaffee,  who was  a  Lt.  Commmander  in  the  Navy,  and Clifton C. 
Williams,  who was  a Major  in the  U.S.  Marine Corps. The faculty  chair was 
designed to enhance space education programs for the Navy. The astronauts’ 
widows,  Jane Williams  and  Martha Chaffee,  joined  Rear  Admiral  Charles 
Larson,  Academy  superintendent,  and  Commodore  Richard  Truly,  com- 
mander of the  Naval Space Command,  for  the  plaque unveiling ceremony.

Both Williams and Chaffee were among the third group of astronauts NASA 
named  in October  1983. Williams  served as  backup pilot for  the Gemini  10 
mission.  He was  killed  in  a  T-38  crash  October  5,  1967.  Chaffee was  as- 
signed as  one of the pilots for the first three-man Apollo flight. He was  killed 
in  the  Apollo  1  spacecraft  fire January 27,  1967,  a t   Kennedy Space  Center 
along with astronauts Virgil Grissom and Edward White. 
The  Naval Space Command and the  Naval Academy  signed earlier  in the 
year an agreement to establish the Space Research Chair. The principal objec- 
tive of  the  new  Academy  professorship,  as  stated  in  the  agreement, was  to 
provide a  means for  future officer candidates at  the Academy  to further  their 
understanding of space systems and their naval applications.  “It  w i l l  provide 
the  mechanism  by  which  midshipmen  and  faculty  members w i l l   become 
exposed,  involved,  and  committed  to  scientific activities at  the  forefront of 
the technologies  related to space  systems,”  the agreement said. 
Rear  Admiral William  Ramsey,  director of  the  Naval  Space  Systems  Divi- 
sion,  also participated in the Space Chair dedication ceremony. He presented 
the  Defense Superior  Service Medal to three  Navy astronauts present at  the 
dedication-Commodore  Truly,  Captain  Robert  Crippen,  and  Commander 
Robert  Gibson-commending 
them  for  “exceptionally  superior  achieve- 
ment” as  astronauts. Truly served as p i lo t  on STS-2  and commander of STS-8; 
Gibson served as  p i lo t  for STS  41-8;  Crippen had flown on STS-1,  STS-7,  STS 
41-C,  and 4 1 4 .  USC  Roundup,  Sept  13/85, 2) 

October 2 8  Astronaut John Fabian  resigned from the  NASA astronaut corps 
in   the  summer  of  1985.  It  was  the  eighth  astronaut  resignation  over  the 
previous 16 months, the  Washington Post  reported, suggesting the way  of  life 
that  was  the  hallmark  of  astronaut  service might  have  begun  to  wear  thin. 
Besides  Fabian,  NASA  lost over  those months Joseph Allen,  Terry  Hart,  Wil- 
liam Lenoir, jack  Lousma,  Thomas Mattingly,  Donald  Peterson,  and  Richard 
Truly,  all veterans  in the prime of  their careers whose combined experience 
covered 12  of  the  21 Space  Shuttle missions flown. 
“Are these  resignations something we  worry  about?” said  NASA  Adminis- 
trator  James Beggs.  “Yes,  especially  the  younger  ones  like  Allen  [45]  and 
Fabian  [44],  who  s t i l l   have  a  lot of  tread  left on  them.  We‘ve  now  begun to 
lose the guys we‘ve  educated and trained to the most difficult  things we  do, 
like spacewalks,  and  i f  this  trend starts  to  increase,  it‘s  going to disturb me,” 
he concluded. 
Stripped of  i t s  glamor,  astronaut service was  demanding work  that  kept its 
members  away  from  home,  the  Post  said.  One  female  astronaut,  who  jus t  
began training for a flight  late in 1986 said she had seen her husband twice in 
the previous two months,  “The  last time  i t  was  for  12  hrs,”  she  said,  “and  for 
s ix  of  those we  were  both asleep.” 
Astronaut  training  ranged  from  studying  the  physics and  biology  of  spa- 
ceflight to making parachute jumps  and threeday  survival visits  in Panama’s

Astronauts 

jungle.  Classroom hours were equivalent to time spent by Ph.D. candidates. 
Physical fitness was a must,  but astronauts had to exercise on their own  time. 
Once assigned a mission,  the astronaut’s training pace quickened. At John- 
son and Kennedy Space Centers there were around-the-clock computer simu- 
lations of  astronaut  tasks  and  potential problems  in  space.  Astronauts  also 
visited other NASA centers and contractors’ facilities to become familiar with 
the equipment they would use on their missions. 
NASA  officials said  there was  nothing  they  could do  to  slow  the  training 
pace,  because they  believed  i t  was  the  reason  the  U.S.  had  not  had a fatal 
accident  in  space.  NASA Administrator  Beggs  indicated that the way  to keep 
astronauts  happy and  in the corps was  to keep them busy and assigned to a 
mission. 
That didn’t  keep Fabian from  resigning, however,  the Post pointed out. “ 1 ’ 1 1  
miss flying and I’ll miss the people,  but I don’t  want to be known to posterity 
as  the oldest astronaut to fly  in  space,“  Fabian said.  (WPosf, Oct 28/85,  A I )

ASTRONOMY 

january 7: NASA was accelerating design of an unmanned U.S.  space mission 
that would rendezvous w i th  a comet and possibly drop a penetrator to return 
data  directly  from  the  comet’s  surface,  Av  Wk  reported.  NASA  officials be- 
lieved  that  this first  U.S.  comet-rendezvous mission  using the  new  Mariner 
Mk .  2  spacecraft would  be a high-priority item in  the  FY  87 budget. 
NASA planners would probably select the Comet Kopff or Comet Wild-2 as 
mission target;  FY   87 new-start funding  could make a  1991 launch possible. 
Unlike Halley’s Comet flybys,  the  U.S.  spacecraft in  a rendezvous mission 
would  spend many months  flying  in  formation with  a  comet. Mission  con- 
cept  proposed  rendezvous well  before  closest  approach  to  the  sun,  so  the 
spacecraft  could  observe  the  comet while  it was  in   its  asteroidal  stage  and 
before  solar  w ind   would  blow  large  amounts  of  dust  off  its  surface.  The 
spacecraft  would  remain  in  formation  during the  comet’s  active  phase  and 
possibly the post-solar-encounter phase. 
GSFC  and  ARC  were  examining  comet-penetrator  concept  systems  that 
would  return compositional  data  using a  gamma-ray  spectrometer.  (AvWk ,  
Jan 7/85,  18) 

j a n u a r y 8   NASA announced it signed with the University of Arizona, Tucson, 
a  memorandum of  understanding to  study,  plan,  and,  i f  approved by  Con- 
gress,  develop  an  orbiting  astrometric  telescope  facility,  which  would  be 
mounted  in  the mid-1990s on the planned space station,  to detect and study 
planetary systems  around other  stars.  Astrometric telescopes measured with 
extraordinary  precision positions of stars  and other celestial objects. 
Eugene  Levy,  director  of  the  University‘s  Lunar  and  Planetary  Laboratory, 
and  David  Black,  head  of  Ames  Research  Center‘s  (ARC)  Space  Sciences 
Division,  would be project principal scientists.  Black described the effort as 
“the  beginning  of  a  new  scientific  discipline.  The  results  of  the  search, 
whether positive or negative, w i l l  profoundly alter our view of the universe.” 
The gravitational  pu l l  of  planets orbiting a  star causes  it to wobble as  seen 
against  the  sky.  By  measuring this  wobble,  an  astrometric  telescope  could 
determine  the  presence of  planets and  perhaps determine the  properties of 
such a planetary system.  Although ground-based telescopes use the wobble- 
measuring technique  to measure properties of  double  stars  in orbit around 
one  another,  an  astrometric  telescope  could  measure the  disturbance  in  a 
star’s  motion  caused  by  objects  as  small  as  planets.  Un t i l   researchers  find 
other  planetary  systems,  they  cannot  fully  test  theoretical models  used  to 
explain  the  origin  of  our  solar  system  or  the  formation  of  stars.  The  joint 
project would be coordinated with development of photometric and spectro- 
scopic techniques and theoretical modeling of planetary system  formation.

ARC  would  clarify  final  telescope design and manner of mounting on the 
space  station  as  well  as  Oversee telescope and  instrument construction and 
mounting. The University would establish operating facilities on the ground 
and coordinate continuing scientific investigations that would  extend more 
than a decade. 
The  project would  include  a core program of  planet detection and study, 
and  guest  investigators  could  use  the  telescope  for  astrornetric  studies  of 
other  important  celestial  objects.  Initial  study  and  definition  work  would 
begin  shortly;  ultimate  implementation  would  require  Congressional  a p  
proval  and  funding.  (NASA  Release  85-3;  ARC  Release 85-01;  ARC  Asfro-

january  15:  Naval Observatory astronomer Richard Walker proposed a simple 
explanation  for  the  inclination  of  a  descending  passageway  in  the  Great 
Pyramid of Cheops in  Egypt,  the  Washington Post  reported. Walker had first 
examined the suggestion of John Herschel, an early  19thcentury astronomer, 
that  the  337-foot  passageway  was  at  an  angle  of  26.5230°  to  point at  the 
North Star,  allowing the pyramid to serve an  as  astronomical observatory as 
well as  tomb for the pharaoh. Walker noted,  however,  that due to the wobble 
of earth’s  axis  in  its orbit around the sun,  no prominent star could have been 
seen  from the base of the passageway i n  2800 B.C. 
Walker  suggested  the angle  resulted from  the  construction  technique.  By 
placing three stones  of equal  length  horizontally  and another of  equal  size 
on  top  of  the  3rd  horizontal  stone,  the angle from  the  top  stone to  bottom 
(WPost, Jan 15/85,  A10) 
stone at the other end was  26.5’. 

January  17:  The  Washington  Times  reported on  the  “Planet  X “   theory  of 
Daniel Whitmire and John Matese,  physics and astronomy professors  at  the 
University of  Southwestern Louisiana,  in  which  they  had  suggested  that  an 
undiscovered planet triggered a rain of comets upon earth,  resulting in  extinc- 
tions  of  dinosaurs  and  other  species  at  roughly  26-million-year  intervals. 
i f  it‘s  out there:’  Whitmire said,  ”lies  in  an  orbit outside Neptune 
“Planet  X, 
and,  every 30 m i l l ion  years or so, passes through a ring or disc of comets that 
also  l ie  out there. When  i t  does,  gravity diverts  some  of  the  comets toward 
earth,  kicking  up  huge  clouds  of  dust  on  impact  that  disrupt  the  weather 
enough to k i l l  off many species of plants and animals.” 
Whitmire  noted  the  theory  would  explain  several  phenomena that  had 
puzzled scientists: fossil evidence of extinctions at approximately 26-million- 
year  intervals and  the  slight  variations  in  Neptune and  Uranus’s  orbits  by 
Planet X’s  gravitational  pull.  ( W  Times, Jan 17/85,  3A) 

January  7 8  Observations by  the  lnternational  Ultraviolet Explorer ( /UD  re- 
vealed what  appeared to  be a variable  gas  cloud surrounding the  star  Beta

Pictoris. This was  the first evidence of gas  around the star as  well as  the  large 
dust  particles  previously  observed  from  the  Infrared  Astronomy  Satellite 
( I R A 3  and  ground-based  telescopes,  the  JSC Roundup  reported.  Many  as- 
tronomers considered Beta  Pictoris,  in  the constellation Pictor  in  the  south- 
ern hemisphere, a leading candidate for  another  planetary system. 
Dr. Yoji  Kondo,  Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC) IUE project scientist, 
and Dr.  F.C.  Bruhweiler of Catholic University jointly  made the observations 
in   December and  said  the  coexisting dust  and  gas  clouds  were  consistent 
with  scientific theories of  planetary system  formation.  “Many  stars  like Beta 
Pictoris  show  evidence of  being surrounded by  clouds of  gas  at  ultraviolet 
wavelengths,”  said  Kondo.  “If  such  data  imply  that  these  stars  also  are  sur- 
rounded by a protoplanetary gaseous cloud with a disk of dust particles, then 
many nearby stars  may  have evolving planetary systems.  That’s  exciting,”  he 
concluded,  “because  these stars would  offer a unique opportunity  to see  the 
way  a solar system  might appear  in formation.”  Theories of planet formation 
had generally predicted that planets evolved from  large stellar clouds of dust 
and  gas  that  gradually  condensed  into  orbiting planetary  bodies,  a  theory 
strengthened by the  IUE observations.  USC  Roundup, Jan 18/85,  3) 

March  3 :  The N Y  Times reported the death in  Moscow of  losif S.  Shklovsky, 
internationally  known Soviet astrophysicist and early champion of the search 
for  intelligent extraterrestrial life. Shklovsky was  68. 
Dr.  Herbert Friedman of the  National Academy  of Sciences  in  Washington 
said  Shklovsky’s  contributions  were  diverse and,  in  some  cases,  basic.  For 
example,  in  1953 Shklovsky had  proposed that  the  strange  light  from  such 
features as  the Crab Nebula,  puzzling because it occurred a t  a l l  wavelengths 
instead  of  being  concentrated  into  spectral  lines  like  ordinary  light,  was 
synchrotron  radiation  generated  by  electrons  whirling  in  extremely  strong 
magnetic fields.  Researchers later discovered that the Crab Nebula and other 
remnants of great stellar explosions, or supernovas,  emitted synchrotron radi- 
ation across  the full width of  the spectrum. 
Shklovsky also proposed the widely held concept that periodic X-ray  emis- 
sions  from  space  came  from  superdense stars  circling one  another at  close 
range. 
In  1962  Shklovsky  published  a  book  arguing  that  intelligent  creatures 
might exist  i n  other worlds;  it had gone through four Soviet editions and was 
translated  by  Carl  Sagan.  Later,  Shklovsky  began  to  doubt  the  existence of 
nearby civilizations,  but had urged the creation of hugh space colonies. 
He  received the Lenin Prize in  1960 and was  made a corresponding mem- 
ber of the Soviet Academy  of Sciences  in  1966. (NYT ,  Mar 6/85,  B10) 

March  6  NASA  announced  selection  of  the  scientific  investigators whose 
projects  would  be  included  on  the  proposed  Advanced  X-ray  Astrophysics 

39 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Facility  (AXAF),  an  observatory  that would  operate  in   lowearth  orbit for  at 
least  15  years.  A  spacecraft  carrying an  array  of  instruments and  providing 
power,  precise pointing,  and data transmission would  house the observatory 
containing a  1.2m  diameter,  10m focal  length telescope. AXAF  construction 
could begin around 1987-88  with  launch approximately five years  later. 
In  orbit,  AXAF  would  jo in   the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  scheduled  for 
launch  in   1986,  and  the  Gamma-Ray  Observatory,  planned  for  a  1988 
launch.  The  three  observatories,  together  w i th   the  planned Space  Infrared 
Telescope  Facility,  would  provide  simultaneous  observations  of  cosmic 
sources over  infrared,  visable,  ultraviolet, X-ray,  and gamma-ray wavelengths. 
Those  selected  included instrument principal  investigators to design  and 
fabricate  scientific  instrumentation  for  placement  i n   the  telescope  focal 
plane,  interdisciplinary scientists to  provide expertise on X-ray  astrophysics 
and  other  fields of  astronomy,  and  a  telescope scientist  to  guide  telescope 
fabrication. 
Instrument  principal  investigators  selected  were  Dr.  Gordon  Garmire, 
Pennsylvania  State  University  (charged  coupled  device  imaging  spectros- 
copy);  Dr.  Steven Murray,  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (high-reso- 
lution camera); Dr. Stephen Holt, Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) (X-ray 
spectroscopy  investigation  for  the AXAF); Dr.  Claude Canizares,  Massachu- 
setts  Institute of Technology (high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy using AXAF); 
and  Dr. Albert  Brinkman,  University of  Utrecht,  Netherlands (high through- 
put transmission grating for cosmic X-ray  spectroscopy). 
Interdisciplinary scientists selected were Dr. Riccardo Giacconi, Space Tel- 
escope  Science  Institute (advanced X-ray  astrophysics  facility  mission);  Dr. 
Jeffrey Linsky,  National  Bureau  of  Standards  (the  coronal  structures  of  se- 
lected cool stars and close binary systems);  Dr.  Richard Mushotzky, GSFC  (a 
program to measure the mass of galaxies and clusters of galaxies with AXAF); 
Dr.  Andrew  Wilson,  University  of  Maryland  (studies of  radio  jets  and  the 
narrow  line  regions of  active  galaxies with AXAF);  and  Dr.  Andrew  Fabian, 
Cambridge  University,  United Kingdom (cooling flows  in  clusters  and  gal- 
axies). 
Dr.  Leon  Vay  Speybroeck,  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,  would 
serve  as  telescope scientist. 
The  investigators, as  members of the AXAF  science working group,  would 
provide scientific and technical guidance throughout  the project and would 
receive a  specified  amount  of  time  to  use  the  telescope  during  its  first  30 
operational months. Astronomers from the U.S.  and around the world would 
use the majority of observing time.

March 12 Soviet and French scientists would  soon  launch into orbit a space 
observatory,  the Gamma 1 Project,  that would  carry a large gamma-ray  tele- 
scope  to   help determine sources  of  cosmic  rays,  streams  of  highly  charged 
particles that  bombarded the earth  from  space,  the  NY  Times  reported the 
newspaper lzvestia as  saying. Researchers hoped to obtain a detailed picture 
of  the  sky  in  gamma  rays  in order  to  understand  the  mysterious  nature  of 
gamma  stars  and  their  possible  relationship with  known  astrophysical o b  
jects.  lzvestia had gone on to say  that  testing was  underway on the observa- 
tory  but did not report a launch date. 
The  lzvestia article said  the  two countries  had cooperated  in  designing a 
special spacecraft, to be placed in  an orbit 216 miles above earth,  capable of 
carrying  nearly  two  tons  of  scientific equipment  for  the  Gamma  1 experi- 
ment,  including main,  small gamma-ray and X-ray  telescopes. 
Franco-Soviet  space  cooperation dated  back  to  an  agreement  signed  in  
1966;  France  was  a  major  partner  in   the  Vega  missions  the  Soviets  had 
launched i n  December to examine Venus  and Halley’s Comet and,  i n  June 
1982, the  French cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chretien had been the  first  and was 
the only man from a country outside the Soviet block to go  into space aboard 
a Soviet spacecraft, the Soyuz T-6.  (NYT ,  Mar  12/85,  C3) 

April  70:  NASA announced that observations by the  International Ultraviolet 
Explorer  ( l u g  satellite  revealed what  appeared  to  be  a variable  gas  cloud 
surrounding the star  Beta Pictoris in  the constellation Pictor  in  the southern 
hemisphere, a star that many astronomers considered a leading candidate for 
a planetary system resembling earth’s.  Scientists using the  lnfrared Astronomy 
Satellite  (//7ASI and  ground-based telescopes  previously  had  reported  large 
particles of  dust around the star. 
The  W E  findings  of  coexisting dust  and  gas  clouds  were  consistent with 
scientific theories of  planetary system  formation,  noted  Dr.  Yoji  Kondo,  IUE 
project  scientist  at  Goddard Space  Flight Center.  In  general,  theories  pre- 
dicted  that  planets  evolved  from  large  stellar  clouds  of  dust  and  gas  that 
gradually  condensed  into orbiting planetary  bodies.  Observations with  the 
MAS strengthened this theory by suggesting that planetary disks surrounded a 
number of nearby stars.  Also,  astrometric measurements of the movement of 
several  stars  indicated the  possible presence about  each  star  of  a planetary 
body several times more massive than Jupiter. 
Kondo and his associate Dr.  F.  C.  Bruhweiler of Catholic University, Wash- 
ington,  D.C.,  used the  IUE telescope to obtain the ultraviolet spectra of Beta 
Pictoris to determine the manner  in which  ultraviolet light was  absorbed by 
the gas  cloud and the extinction of the  light by the dust cloud. The ultraviolet 
spectra  showed  an  absence  of  selective  extinction  of  the  light  at  shorter 
wavelengths,  evidence  that  the  star’s  light was  being  blocked  evenly  at  all 
wavelengths by dust particles greater than one micron (millionth of a meter), 
as  infrared data had reported. 

4 1  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

“The  IUEobservation:’  Kondo said,  “indicates the gas  i s  either clumpy or i s  
varying under the pressure of the stellar wind and radiation. If so, this would 
tend to complement  lRAS and ground-telescope observations that a substan- 
tial dust cloud of  protoplanetary material exists around Beta Pictoris.” 
Kondo cautioned that the  lack of  observed extinction could also be due to 
viewing the star  just a  little off-plane,  so that the telescope’s  Iine-of-sight was 
not aligned directly through the disk of orbiting dusty matter. However,  Bruh- 
weiler  added,  “that  would be unlikely. All evidence seems  to point to a  belt 
too  thick  around  Beta  Pictoris for  the  line-of-sight  to   be  missing the  dust 
belt.”  (NASA Release 85-52) 

April  76:  NASA announced  it selected the  first  participants  in  a  program  to 
assimilate discoveries from space astronomy experiments into a  comprehen- 
sive  modern  astrophysical  theory  in   order  to  use  more  effectively  future 
experiments such as  the  Hubble Space Telescope,  the Gamma-ray Observa- 
tory,  the Solar Optical Telescope,  and similar planned projects. After evaluat- 
ing  49  proposals  from  300  individuals  at  80  institutions,  NASA  selected 
seven  groups to participate in  the astrophysical theory program. 
Dr.  Richard McCray and a  scientific team  from the  University of Colorado 
would study detailed ways  in  which spectra form  in  a variety of astrophysical 
sources  such as  stars,  supernovae,  and active galactic nuclei. 
Dr.  Jeremiah Ostriker  and  colleagues  from  Princeton  University  would 
analyze the most distant observable parts of the universe to determine possi- 
ble effects of the theoretical “big  bang”. 
Dr.  Pierre  DeMarque  and  a  team  from  Yale  University  would  develop 
computer models of  the  sun  to examine the  internal motions and magnetic 
fields that caused  sunspots,  solar  flares,  and  solar wind. 
Dr.  Roger  Chevalier  and  his  team  from  the  University  of  Virginia  would 
study the hot gases that appeared to surround clusters of  galaxies,  individual 
galaxies, and supernova remnants to determine the origin and motion of the 
gases as  well as  their effect on the development of galaxies. 
Dr.  Ronald  Taam  and  colleagues  from  Northwestern  University  would 
study  the  origin  of  rapid bursts of  high-energy  radiation from  neutron stars 
and globular clusters  in order  to model the  ignition,  nuclear evolution,  and 
propagation of burning fronts on surfaces of  neutron stars and to understand 
the nature of  hot plasma confinement in magnetic fields near  such subjects. 
Dr.  David  Black,  heading  a  team  from  Ames  Research  Center  and  the 
University of  California, Santa  Cruz  and  Berkeley campuses,  would  investi- 
gate various physical and chemical processes taking place in the formation of 
stars,  concentrating  particularly  on  the  stars’  origins  in   giant  molecular 
clouds  in  interstellar  space  and  the  protostellar/protoplanetary  disk-shaped 
nebulae surrounding fledgling  stars.

And  Dr.  Simon  White  and  a  team  of  scientists  from  the  University  of 
Arizona would  study  questions  regarding star  and planet formation,  includ- 
ing properties of star-forming regions, galaxy formation,  and evolution. 
NASA would  bring the  researchers together  in  1986 to exchange informa- 
tion  and  to  encourage a  better  understanding of  the  advances  that  science 
has made w i th  data acquired from space  research. (NASA  Release 85-59) 

May  37: When  a gap  occurred  in ancient  records dealing with  the  appear- 
ance of  Halley's  Comet-its  appearance  in  164 B.C.-pertinent 
information 
was found on ancient clay tablets originating in Babylonia and  residing in  the 
British Museum,  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's UPL)  Universe reported. 
The museum had about  1,200  astronomical texts from  Babylonia, but they 
were  in  disarry and few scholars had looked at them. Museum representative 
C.B.F.  Walker said that  information from the tablets relating to Halley consti- 
tuted  "the  first  significant addition  to  our  knowledge of  past  history  of  the 
comet"  in more than a century. The  information was  impressed into the clay 
in  the  cuneiform  alphabet,  an  ancient system  that  employed wedge-shaped 
sym bok. 
JPL's  Dr.  Don Yeomans  said  that  since  recorded history mentioned a l l   an- 
cient  sightings  of  the  comet  except  the  164  B.C.  appearance, archeologists 
and astronomers had joined forces to discover such a  reference,  resulting in  
the find at the British Museum. 
"It  filled in a blank:'  Yeomans said.  "The  information showed that we were 
extremely close to where we  thought  i t  [Halley's  164 B.C.  visit] would  be." 
For the International Halley Watch,  of which JPL  was the lead organization, 
Yeomans was discipline specialist in  the area called "astrometry; 
the science 
of  predicting where,  when,  and how the comet would  appear and what the 
world could expect from  it. 
Yeomans  served  in  a  similar capacity for  the planned mission to the comet 
Giacobini-Zinner w i th   the  international cometary explorer  (ICE) spacecraft. 
UPL  Universe, May 31185,  1) 
lune  5: NASA announced that flight controllers for  i t s  International Cometary 
Explorer (ICE) performed the first and  largest of four midcourse corrections to 
direct  the  spacecraft toward  a September  11  intercept  of  Comet Giacobini- 
Zinner. Conducted from  ICE mission control at Goddard Space Flight Center, 
these corrections used two thousand pulses of the spacecraft's  two-lb.  hydra- 
zine thrusters to change  its  heading so  i t  would  fly  through  the  comet's  tail 
16,200  miles from  the comet's  nucleus. The thruster  burns  lasted four-and-a- 
half hours. 
In 1982,  NASA  redirected the  International Sun-Earth Explorer, which was 
launched  in  1978,  toward  the  comet  for  what  would  be  the  first  satellite1 
comet  encounter  in   history.  This  encounter  would  provide  scientists with 
their first  look at  the makeup and dynamics of a comet's  tail.

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

The  ICE  trajectory adjustment would  place the  satellite/comet  encounter 
within  the coverage window  of  the world’s  largest single dish  radio  astron- 
omy  telescope  located at  the Arecibo  Observatory,  Puerto Rico. The  300-m 
dish,  managed by  the  National Science Foundation, would  supplement cov- 
erage  by  three  NASA deep  space  network stations at Goldstone,  California; 
Madrid,  Spain;  Canberra,  Australia;  and  the  recently  completed  64-m  an- 
tenna of the Japanese Space Agency at  Usuda,  Japan. 
NASA based  ICE’S course adjustment on telescopic observations of Giaco- 
b in id inne r   as  the  comet  emerged  in  April  from  behind  the  sun,  the  first 
observation since July 1984. The comet was  approximately 149 m i l l ion  miles 
from the sun on the  inbound leg of  its orbit between the sun  and the neigh- 
borhood of Jupiter. 
NASA would  direct three  smaller  orbit maneuvers as  ICE approached the 
comet,  the  last scheduled for  three  days  prior to encounter. Course correc- 
tions  were  necessary  because  material  spontaneously  outgassed  from  the 
comet’s  core,  acting as  jet  thrusters on the comet’s  body,  slightly altered the 
its orbital  path. 
Astronomers  in   1900  discovered  Giacobini-Zinner,  which  returned  to 
earth’s  neighborhood every six-and-one-half years.  It would  not be visible to  
the naked eye,  but amateur astronomers with small telescopes would be able 
to  see  it.  (NASA Release 85-86) 

lune  7: Two  groups of  scientists,  who were  making observations at  infrared 
and radio wavelengths,  reported the strongest evidence so  far of a supermas- 
sive black hole in  the center of the M i lky  Way  galaxy,  the N Y  Times reported, 
strengthening the theory that very massive black holes existed in  the cores of 
all galaxies. Astrophysicists had already deduced that black holes might be at 
the cores of some distant galaxies. 
Eight physicists and astronomers from  the  University of California,  Berke- 
ley,  reported in  the British journal  Nature their infrared observations showing 
gas  whipping  around  a  core  at  100,000  to  400,000  miles  per  hour.  They 
concluded the gas was  in the grip of a black hole four million times the mass 
of the sun. 
The group measured the velocities  near the center of the core with  suffic- 
ient precision to show that they decreased further out in  a way  to be expected 
i f  controlled  by gravity from  a single central object. They  believed this ruled 
out a  dense  cluster  of  stars,  proposed  by  some  astronomers,  because that 
gravity field would be more uniform. 
Radio astronomers using coordinated observations with antennas in West- 
ford,  Massachusetts;  Green Bank, West Virginia;  Fort Davis,  Texas;  and Gold- 
stone,  Hat Creek,  and Owens Valley,  California;  and the  2 7  antennas of the 
very  large  array  in   New  Mexico  aimed  the  antennas  at  a  radio  source,  a 
suspected black  hole,  almost directly  i n  the center of  the M i lky  Way  called 

44 

Astronomy 

Sagittarius A  ( in  the constellation Sagittarius). The  results indicated that  the 
source,  despite i t s  enormous mass and output of energy,  was smaller than the 
orbit of  Saturn.  Donald  Lyndon-Bell of  Britain's  Royal Greenswich Observa- 
tory and Martin Fees of Cambridge University had proposed 14 years before 
that there might be such an  object there. 
Astronomers using improved radio and infrared techniques had mapped in  
more and more detail the M i lky  Way core, which was  30,000  light years from 
earth. They could not see  the core with visible light because of dense clouds 
of dust and gases.  (NYTJune 7/85,  A15) 

lune  2 2  NASA  announced  that  the  International Ultraviolet Explorer ( IUD  
observed for the first  time  the comet Giacobini-Zinner while the comet was 
approximately  87  m i l l ion   miles  from  earth  on  the  inbound  leg of  its  orbit 
between the sun and the neighborhood of Jupiter. IUE would continue obser- 
vations  of  the comet as  it moved closer and ultimately  became the target of 
the world's  first  intercept,  on September  11,  1985,  of  a comet  by  a satellite, 
the  International Cometary Explorer ( IC0  spacecraft. 
The  June 22   W E  observations  of  Giacobini-Zinner  produced  ultraviolet 
spectrograms-graphic  depictions  of  the  intensity of  light  over  a  range  of 
ultraviolet  wavelengths-revealing  emissions  of  two  molecules,  carbon 
monosulfide and another known as  the hydroxyl radical. Preliminary evalua- 
tion indicated that the ultraviolet emissions from both molecules were some- 
what brighter than expected at this stage of the comet's  development. 
The  IUE had taken  the  ultraviolet "pulse"  of  not only  nearby solar  system 
objects  such  as  comets  and  planets,  but also  extragalactic  objects  such  as 
quasars,  providing research data to more than  1,000  astronomers around the 
world. 
Scientists, engineers, and technicians at  NASA's  Goddard Space Flight Cen- 
ter designed and integrated the spacecraft, which was  launched in  1978 as  a 
cooperative  venture  of  the  British  Science Research Council,  the  European 
Space Agency,  and  NASA.  (NASA Release 85-103) 

lu ly   I :  The European Space Agency (ESA) announced that the European X-ray 
Observatory  Satellite,  EXOSAT,  had  been  in   orbit  over  two  years,  during 
which time i t  had performed nearly 2,000  observations, returning data to an 
observatory based at  the European Space Operations Centre,  ESOC,  in  West 
Germany. 
The  EXOSAT  telescopes had provided among other  findings  detailed  im- 
ages  of the  remnants of dead stars,  called  supernova,  which had consumed 
their nuclear fuel (hydrogen and helium) and ended their lives in  a spectacu- 
lar  explosion.  The  images  enabled  astronomers to   deduce  the  amount  of 
energy  in  the original explosion and the physical conditions  in  space  in  the 
neighborhood of the explosion. 

45 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Some astronomers speculated that a supernova might end as  neutron stars 
or  black  holes,  and  EXOSAT  was  helping  astronomers  study  a  number  01 
these "exotic"  objects  in the M i lky  Way. 
Early  in   1984 astronomers proposed using EXOSAT to  search  for  very  fast 
rotating neutron stars  in  X-ray  binaries. In mid-July 1985, ESA  announced that 
these  observations  had  led  to  the  discovery  of  a  completely  unexpected 
phenomenon, that of quasi-periodic oscillations that might indicate the pres- 
ence  of  fast  rotating  neutron  stars  in  very  o ld   X-ray  binary  systems.  The 
discovery of the oscillations opened up an  entirely new area of  investigation 
in  the  study of  neutron stars  that,  because of  the  stars'  extreme gravitational 
conditions,  could make  i t  possible to test  to their  limits some of  the  funda- 
mental  laws of  physics. (ESA  release July 1/85;  ESA  release Ju ly  19/85) 

j u l y 2 :  The European Space Agency (ESA) announced that i t  launched at  11.23 
hours GMT July 2 Giotto,  ESA's  interplanetary space probe that would after a 
700  m i l l ion   km  voyage  encounter  Halley's  Comet  in   March  1986.  ESA 
launched Giotto by  an Ariane  1 launcher from  the  Kourou Space Center  i n  
French Guiana,  the ninth straight success  for  the agency's  unmanned Ariane 
1 rocket. 
The rocket placed Giotto into a geostationary transfer orbit with parameters 
of  35,966  km,  apogee;  199.2  km,  perigee;  and  7 O  inclination.  Following 
separation from the  launcher's  third stage 22  minutes after  liftoff, ESA's  Space 
Operations Centre (ESOC) at  Darmstadt, West  Germany,  took  control  of  the 
spacecraft.  During  the  following  32  hours,  ESOC  spacecraft  controllers 
worked  around  the  clock  to  reconfigure the  spacecraft  in   its  geostationary 
transfer  orbit  and  carry  out  spin-up  and  attitude maneuvers.  After  Giotto 
made three  revolutions in  its transfer orbit,  ESOC at  19.24 hours GMT July 3 
injected the spacecraft  into an earth-escape trajectory. 
Giotto,  named for the  lrlthcentury artist Giotto de Bondone, who  in  1301 
witnessed what probably was  Halley's Comet,  should come within 310 miles 
of  the comet's  f i v em i l d i am e t e r   nucleus. When  the  spacecraft  reached  its 
rendezvous,  ESA  scientists  expected  it  to  be destroyed  by  billions  of  high- 
speed dust particles pouring off the comet's  nucleus.  Before  its destruction, 
Giotto would  perform approximately  10  experiments examining the  image, 
chemistry,  magnetism, and other aspects of the comet and its tail. 
Other spacecraft participating in  the Halley's Comet investigation were the 
USSR's  Vega  1  and  2,  launched  December  15  and  December  21,  1984, 
respectively,  to  encounter  the  comet  at  a distance  of  62,000  miles;  Japan's 
Sakigake  launched January 8,  1985,  and  Planet A,  scheduled for  launch  i n  
August  1985 to   photograph the  comet's  tail  at  a distance of  160,000  miles; 
and  NASA's  International Comet  Explorer,  ICE  (formerly  ISEE-31, 
launched 
December 22,  1983, and diverted from its previous earth orbiting position for 
the Halley's Comet encounter.  (ESA  release July 2/85;  ESA  release July 4/85;

August 2:  Crew aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission 51-F  made 
major progress  in fixing the  instrument  pointing system  (IPS)  for  a $60 mil- 
lion  solar  telescope,  the  Washington  Post  reported;  and  flight  planners 
moved  closer  to  extending  the  mission  one  day  to  make  up  for  lost  sun- 
watching time.  The extension would  have Challenger  landing  in  California 
after eight days  in orbit. 
The  IPS’S  improved operation enabled the astronauts to  increase the  pace 
of their observations of the sun,  the only star close enough for detailed study. 
Although  the balky telescope mount late in  the evening again failed to work 
properly,  the  Space  Shuttle scientists manually  locked the  telescope on tar- 
get.  New computer commands  radioed earlier  from earth  had helped solve 
some  initial  problems with  the  IPS,  and  i t  aimed  its  three  solar  telescopes 
precisely at  specific  spots  on the  sun,  holding them there  for  a few  minutes 
each time.  However, the steadiness  d id  not last. 
During one  long sun-sighting period,  astronaut-physicist Loren Acton  said 
the  solar  chronosphere,  a  layer  of  gas  that  resembled a  flaming  forest,  a p  
peared more active  than  he had suspected. The  phenomenon was  dubbed 
the  “Acton effect.” 
A decision  to extend Challengers’s  mission depended  largely on  the orbi- 
ter’s  supply of hydrogen for generating electricity.  ( W  Post,  Aug 3/85,  A101 

August 2:  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs met with  planetary science ex- 
perts to discuss a plan to develop a spacecraft capable of flying in  formation 
with a comet known as  Wild-2  and dropping a probe down onto  its surface 
i n  hopes of bringing back samples,  the  Washington Times reported. 
Space scientists said NASA wanted to  launch the $400 m i l l ion  mission  in  
the  early  1990s.  NASA  hoped  to  get  about  $30  m i l l ion   in   start-up  money 
earmarked for  the project i n  the agency’s  FY 87 budget. 
The mission would  be an  important space  first,  because  none of  the  pre- 
vious  spacecraft  launched  toward  Halley’s  Comet would  fly  alongside that

August 5: Astronauts aboard the Challenger on Space Shuttle mission 51-F 
spent  an  extra day  in space  gazing at  the  sun  after  the  instrument  pointing 
system was back in order, the Washington Postreported. The sudden recovery 
on August  4,  as  a  result of  a  lucky  radio command  transmitted on a whim 
after  a jolting  rocket firing,  of  a  fourth  solar  telescope called a solar  optical 
universal  polarimeter added to  the  science data.  Most of  the August  5  sun 
observations used  that telescope after  NASA had considered i t  a failure. 
The  telescope  initially  recorded  images  of  sunspots,  dark  splotches  that 
erupted  through  the  visible  surface of  the  sun  when  underlying  magnetic 
fields  became convoluted,  the  Washington  Times  reported. The  astronauts

turned  the  telescope on  the  sunspot again on August  5,  and  the TV  image 
was so  clear scientists on the ground reported that they could see  changes  in  
i t s  penumbra, a surrounding halo-like feature made up of jets  of gas  stream- 
ing  out from  the dark  central area.  (W  Post,  Aug 6 / 8 5 ,  AS;  W Times, Aug 6 /

August  15: Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.  personnel fitted the Jet Propul- 
sion  Laboratory’s (JPL) wide-field/planetary  camera (WFPC) into the  Hubble 
Space Telescope,  the JPL Universe reported. They then removed and returned 
it to JPL for modifications and testing.  ”Everything went fine,”  Dave Rodgers, 
JPL‘s  WFPC  project manager,  said.  “There  were no problems with any of our 
equipment.” 
The WFPC consisted of two complete camera systems with different focal 
lengths. There were four cameras  in  each system,  all sharing the same hous- 
ing and electronics. The wide-field  camera would obtain a wide perspective 
of a region  in  the  sky,  while the planetary camera would make high-resolu- 
tion studies of individual objects.  “It‘s  called a planetary camera,  but you can 
use  it for any object  that you want  to study  in  detail,”  Rodgers explained. 
Besides planets in  earth’s  solar  system,  the  planetary camera would  study 
galaxies and star-like objects such as  quasars. Astronomers could also use the 
camera system  to  search  for  clues  suggesting the  presence of  other  planets 
orbiting nearby stars.  Because the space telescope would  be above the earth’s 
obscuring atmosphere,  i t  would  be able to detect objects  100 times dimmer 
than those visible from earth with about  10 times greater resolution. 
The  orbiting  observatory  was  a  major  part  of  NASA‘s  astronomy  effort 
through the end of the century. Space Shuttle crew would service and replace 
i n  orbit the space telescope  instruments, keeping the telescope operating for 
at  least  15 years.  (JPL Un iw s e ,  Aug 2 3 / 8 5 ,  1) 

August  19: Officials at Japan’s  Institute of  Space  and Astronomical  Research 
announced that  today Japan launched from  the  Kagoshima Space Center  in  
Kyushu i t s  second spacecraft to observe Halley’s Comet the following March, 
the  N Y  Times  reported.  The  spacecraft,  Planet  A,  was  on  a  trajectory  that 
would  take  it w i th in   about 60,000  miles of  the  comet.  The  USSR  had two 
craft bound for Halley and the European Space Agency  had one. 
Planet A  had a solar-wind  analyzer to  measure the distribution and direc- 
tion of high-energy particles from the sun as  they encountered the vicinity of 
Halley’s Comet and an  ultraviolet telescopic camera to examine the cloud of 
atomic hydrogen, glowing in  the ultraviolet,  that extended tens of thousands 
of miles out from the comet.  (NYT  Aug 20185 ,  C3) 

September  3:  NASA  announced  that,  when  its  International Cometary  Ex- 
plorer  (ICE)  intercepted  the  dust-filled  tail  of  Comet  Giacobini-Zinner  on

Astronomy 

September 11,  i t  would be the world’s  first spacecraft encounter with a comet. 
When i t  moved into the comet‘s  bow shock approximately 45 minutes before 
the predicted rendezvous with the tail at  7 a.m.  EDT,  ICE would have traveled 
for  more  than  seven  years  and  covered  more  than  1  billion,  500  m i l l ion  
miles,  participating  in   three  distinct  scientific missions  instead of  the  one 
planned. 
When  launched August  12,  1978 from Cape Canaveral,  ICE was  known as 
the  International  Sun-Earth  Explorer  (ISEE-3).  The  1054-lb.  16-sided space 
craft became the first spacecraft to orbit at the sun-earth libration point (that 
point  i n  space where a satellite  i s  suspended  in  a gravitational equilibrium 
between  the  sun  and  the  earth-moon  system)  and  the  first  to  traverse  the 
earth’s  distant geomagnetic tail.  ISEE-3  also was  the  first  spacecraft to make 
multiple swings by the moon and the first to use a lunar gravity-assist maneu- 
ver  for  targetingescape  trajectory.  It  made  more  gravity-assist  maneuvers 
(five) than any other spacecraft. 
After  the  spacecraft  completed most of  the objectives of  its  original  mis- 
sion,  i t  remained in good operational condition and had approximately 75% 
(150 Ib.) of  its total propellant reserves (200 Ib.). Engineers at Goddard Space 
Flight Center (GSFC), under the leadership of Dr.  Robert Farquhar,  developed 
a plan that would divert ISEE-3  from  its  libration point orbit,  take  it past the 
moon five times,  and propel it out toward Comet Giacobini-Zinner. Although 
the spacecraft was not designed for cometary investigation (it had no cameras 
or  dust  detectors),  GSFC  scientists  believed  i t  was  well-suited  for  measure- 
ments of a comet‘s plasma properties, a chief objective of cometary explora- 
tion.  In addition,  the  trajectory  developed  by  Farquhar and  his  colleagues 
brought  the  spacecraft within  range of  a March  1986 upstream  intercept of 
Comet Halley. 
That  1986 upstream pass,  following an October 31,  1985 distant pass,  was 
important because ICE would  provide data on the solar-wind  state upstream 
from Halley and earth-based telescopes would then observe the effect of the 
solar w ind  on Halley’s  tail. 
The spacecraft would  return  in  July 2012  to the vicinity  of earth,  where a 
lunar  gravity-assist maneuver could place the  spacecraft  into an  earth  orbit 
from which  i t  might be retrievable. (NASA Release 85-121) 

September  11 :   At  44  m i l l ion   miles  from  earth,  the  International Cometary 
Explorer  (ICE) spent  20  minutes traveling through  the  tail  of  Comet Giaco- 
bini-Zinner, the  Spaceport  News reported.  During the  precedent-setting en- 
counter,  ICE  was  traveling  at  46,000  miles  per  hr.  when  i t   entered  the 
14,000-mile  wide  tail  at  a  point 4,900  miles  behind  the  comet’s  nucleus; 
when  i t  emerged,  ICE had no apparent damage. 
Dr.  John Brandt,  head  of  Goddard  Space  Flight Center’s  Laboratory  for 
Astronomy and Solar  Physics,  summarized scientists’ tentative conclusions at 

49 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

a press conference, saying that mission discoveries added significantly to and 
confirmed many predicted features of the scientific portrait of a comet. 
Scientists expected to  see  a sharply  defined bow  shock,  but  instead they 
observed that a  broad  U-shaped turbulent  interaction region  preceded the 
comet as  it moved through the solar wind of  interplanetary space. 
Some data,  however,  confirmed what cometary scientists postulated about 
the  comet's  plasma  tail:  it was  threaded  by  hairpin-shaped magnetic  field 
lines captured from the solar w ind  and included electrified gases both denser 
and colder than those of the surrounding solar wind. 
The flight also showed that the hazard of flying through the dust  in Comet 
G iacobi n i-Zi nner's  tai I  was  less than expected. 
There was  one new-found phenomenon that puzzled the  ICE scientists. At 
least 300 ,000  miles before the ICE reached the comet,  i t  detected high-speed 
heavy  ion beams never before found  i n  space.  ICE  scientists theorized  that 
these  beams  were  actually  low-speed  molecules  that  escaped  from  the 
comet, were  ionized by solar ultraviolet light,  and then turned around by the 
supersonic  solar  w ind   and  accelerated  back  toward  the  comet  as  particle 
beams. 
ICE was  then continuing on to take solar wind measurements upstream of 
Halley's Comet on two occasions-the  second,  March 28,  1986, to be within 
19.5 m i l l ion  miles of the comet.  (Spaceport News,  Sept  27/85,  1 )  

September  72:  Planetary scientists at  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory outlined 
plans for two future $400 m i l l ion  missions,  one of which NASA would select 
for  funding,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
One mission entailed a spacecraft that  in September 1991 would  fly by the 
asteroid  Hedwig and  rendezvous  in  1995  with  Comet W i ld   2.  The  other 
called for a spacecraft in 1995 to pass by the asteroid Freia and rendezvous in  
1996 with Comet Tempel 2. 
JPL scientists preferred the  Hedwig and W i ld   2  mission,  in  part  because 
W i ld  2 was a newer and brighter comet than Tempel  2.  Plans for that mission 
called  for  a March  1991  spacecraft  launch from  the  Space  Shuttle with  an 
ultimate encounter January 8,  1995, with Wild 2, when the comet was at the 
far end of  i t s  orbit 465  m i l l ion  miles from earth. 
Scientists would  program  the  spacecraft to  match  the  comet's  speed  as  it 
turned  in toward  the  sun,  which would  then draw  the comet and  spacecraft 
toward  it  at  the  same  speed  for  the  next  850   days  while  the  spacecraft's 
instruments measured the comet. ( W  Post,  Sept  31/85,  A231

plorer  (ICE) spacecraft  w i th   comet  Giacobini-Zinner, which  took  place  44 
m i l l ion  miles from earth and was  the first comet  intercept  in  history. 
In the precedent-setting encounter,  ICE,  traveling at  46,000  miles an  hour, 
entered at approximately 6:50 a.m.  EDT,  September  11,  the  14,000-milewide 
tail  of  the  comet  4,900  miles  behind  the  cometary  nucleus  and  emerged 
from  the tail about 20 minutes later.  Midpoint of  the  tail encounter came at 
7:02  a.m.,  when  the  spacecraft  passed  through  a  narrow  region called  the 
neutral sheet. 
ICE was then on its way  to its fourth space exploration assignment to record 
on October  31  and March 28,  1986 solar  wind  measurements upstream of 
Halley’s  Comet.  (NASA Release 85-138) 

October 8:  The  National Academy  of  Sciences’  Astronomy  Survey  Commit- 
tee,  the NASA Solar System Exploration Committee,  and the NASA Commit- 
tee  on  Solar  and  Space  Physics  made  recommendations for  future  NASA 
space  exploration  and  science programs,  which  Rep.  Wyche  Fowler,  Jr. (D- 
Ga.)  was  asking the  U.S.  House to  endorse  in concurrent  resolutions,  De- 
fense Da i ly  reported. Advisory committee recommendations were often the 
basis for programs NASA sought to  implement. 
The Astronomy Survey Committee recommended the following major new 
programs  “in  order  of  priority”  for  total  funding  of  up to  $950  m i l l ion   (in 
constant  1980 dollars) over  the  next ten  years:  (1) the  advanced  x-ray  astro- 
physics facility  (AXAF) to  be  authorized  in   FY  87,  (2) a  very-long baseline 
(VLB) array of  radio telescopes,  (3)  a new technology telescope (NTT) of the 
15-m  class  operating from  the  ground  at  optical  and  infrared wavelengths, 
and   (4) a  large dep loyab le   reflector ( L D R )  in  space. 
The Solar System Exploration Committee recommended a program funded 
at a sustained annual  level of $300 m i l l ion  per year  (in FY 84 dollars). Its four 
initial core program recommendations were the Venus  radar mapper (au the  
rized in  19841, the Mars observer (authorized in FY 851,  a comet rendezvous/ 
asteroid flyby  to be authorized in  FY 87 for a 1990-92  launch,  and the Titan 
probe/Saturn orbiter to be authorized for a 1988-92  launch as  a joint  NASA/ 
European Space Agency mission, 
Other  committee  recommendations included the  Mars aeronomy orbiter, 
the Venus  atmospheric probe, the  lunar geoscience orbiter, the Mars surface 
probe,  the  comet  atomized  sample  return,  the  multiple  mainbelt  asteroid 
orbitedflyby,  the  earth-approaching asteroid  rendezvous,  the  Saturn  flyby/ 
probe,  the Uranus flyby/probe,  the Neptune flyby/probe,  and the Pluto flyby. 
The  Committee  on  Solar  and  Space  Physics  recommended  an  average 
annual funding of $400 m i l l ion  (in FY 84 dollars) “which would  be sufficient 
to achieve the highest objectives in  solar and space physics between the year 
1988  and  the  year  2000.”  Major  missions  recommended were  the  upper 
atmosphere  research satellite  (authorized in  FY  851,  solar  optical  telescope 
for  launch  in   1990,  the  international solar  terrestrial  physics  program  for 

5 1  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

launch between 1989 and 1993, a solar probe for  launch in  1995, and a solar 
polar orbiter to be launched  in 2000. The committee also endorsed a series 
of moderate Explorer-class missions of about one launch per year.  (D/D, Oct 
8/85,  197) 

October  77:  NASA  Administrator  James  Beggs  confirmed  this  week  that 
NASA cancelled a mission to send an  unmanned spacecraft to comet W i ld  2, 
citing  budgetary constraints,  the  Washington Post  reported.  ”However,  the 
comet  rendezvous proposal i s  a very  promising candidate for a new start”  in 
FY  88,  Beggs said.  NASA  had expected the  mission from  FY  87 to  1992  to 
cost $400 million,  which was within  the budgetary limits NASA established 
in  1981 for  new planetary missions. The NASA budget the Reagan Adminis- 
tration was  drafting eliminated  the mission. 
Delaying a decision on a  comet  rendezvous by  even  one year  meant the 
spacecraft could  not fly  to W i ld  2,  the  favorite candidate of  space  scientists 
because it was  a bright,  fresh comet.  Discovered in  1978,  the comet would 
make i t s  third and fourth appearances in  1990 and 1996.  In order to  rendez- 
vous  with  the  comet when  it passed  near  the  earth,  NASA  in   1986 would 
have to begin work  on the mission to  have the  spacecraft ready by  1991 for 
launch from the Space Shuttle. The announcement followed  NASA decisions 
i n  1980 and  1981 not to attempt a mission to fly by Halley’s  Comet. 
“Once  again,  the United States  i s  passing up an opportunity  to initiate the 
exploration of the comets, which contain the most unblemished record of the 
origins of our solar system,”  the Postquoted Dr. Laurel Wilkening, dean of the 
graduate school at the  University of Arizona and vice chairman of  President 
Reagan’s Commission on Space.  ”The decision i s  a major setback for the U.S. 
planetary exploration  program,”  he concluded. 
Space scientists were also  upset  because  NASA’s  science advisory groups 
recommended that a comet rendezvous be the next new misson in  planetary 
exploration [see Astronomy, Oct. 81.  Scientists pushed for a mission to W i ld  2 
because the spacecraft could travel with the comet for 850 days,  observing it 
before i t s   long dust  tail  formed  and  obscured the  comet’s  nucleus or  dam- 
aged  the  spacecraft.  It would  have  been  NASA‘s  most ambitious mission to 
explore the sofar system. 
The  next  comet  that  NASA  could  approach  would  be Tempel  2,  which 
would  pass  by  earth  in   1998.  Such  a  mission,  also  costing  $400  million, 
required a NASA decision by the middle of  1986. ( W  Post,  Oct  17/85,  A21 )  

October  24:  The  European Space  Agency  announced  today  that  the  Euro- 
pean Space Operations Centre (ESOC) on October  14  and  16  simulated the 
spacecraft Giotto’s encounter w i th  Halley’s Comet (scheduled for about mid- 
night March 13,  1986) by testing the spacecraft’s  systems,  the different scien- 
tific  instruments, 3nd the associated ground systems  in  the first of a series of

rehearsals that would take place up until a few days before the encounter. The 
first rehearsals showed satisfactory operation of the spacecraft and i t s  payload 
and helped experimenters and engineers obtain better insight into the type of 
situations they might face during actual encounter. 
Before  the  formal  rehearsals,  engineers  had  switched  on  and  tested  all 
scientific instruments. The two plasma analyzers and the  ion mass spectrom- 
eter  produced  measurements  of  the  solar  w ind   and  i t s   composition;  the 
magnetometer,  of the  interplanetary magnetic field. 
The onboard camera made observations of the star Vega,  the planet Jupiter 
and,  on October  18 and 23,  of earth. Taken  at a distance of about 20 m i l l ion  
km,  images  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  region  showed  a  pattern  of  darker  and 
brighter  structures,  the  latter  being associated  with  cloud  formations.  The 
quality and resolution of the images showed that the camera was  functioning 
according to  i t s  design specifications. (ESA  release Oct 24/85) 

October28: NASA announced that the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), 
launched January 25,  1983,  worked  almost  perfectly for  300  days  until  it 
depleted  i t s   liquid  helium coolant and  that  it had achieved mission objec- 
tives,  which were to  produce an  unbiased all-sky  survey  using a number of 
broad infrared photometry channels,  to study selected galactic and extraga- 
lactic sources,  and to map extended sources. 
For  infrared astronomy,  IRAS  represented  as  great  an  improvement  over 
ground-based telescopes as  the Palomar 200-in.  telescope had over Galileo's 
telescope.  Because fewer  than  1,000  infrared sources were cataloged before 
the  IRAS  launch,  the  sensitivity  of  IRAS produced a survey  of  a  large unex- 
plored area  in  the electromagnetic spectrum. The  IRAS All-Sky  Survey  cata- 
log contained about 250,000  sources,  including some  20,000  new galaxies 
and 16,000  small extended sources.  IRAS surveyed more than 96% of the sky, 
16%  more than  was  required for  mission  success.  Information  in  the  IRAS 
databased  revolutionized  the  infrared study  of  the  sky  and  provided a  rich 
data source to observers in  other wavebands. 
The  IRAS program resulted from a cooperative effort among the US.,  The 
Netherlands, and the  United Kingdom  i n  the areas of operations,  spacecraft 
design,  infrared technology,  and scientific collaboration. During the next four 
years,  scientists would continue to examine and analyze the more than 200 
b i l l ion  data bits in  the IRAS database and,  by developing specialized process- 
ing  techniques,  possibly  increase the  sensitivity of  the  survey.  (NASA MOR

During  October:  NASA  announced  that  its  Marshall  Space  Flight Center 
(MSRC)  awarded  a  14-month  $140,000  contract  to  Perkin-Elmer  Corp.  to 
study concepts and technologies needed for a next generation telescope w i th  
ten  times the capability  of  the  Hubble Space Telescope.  This study,  the first 

5 3  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

step toward preparing to launch a space telescope array in the first decade of 
the next century, would define a technology development plan for  the array 
and provide NASA w i th  cost and schedule data. 
Perkin-Elmer  would  initially  examine  the  probable  science  such  a  tele- 
scope would perform as  well as  the concept of an array of telescopes working, 
together as  one.  Perkin-Elmer said  i t  would  develop two  telescope concepts 
based on the best use of the proposed space station and technology advance- 
ments needed to  implement them. The first would  emphasize assembly  and 
optical alignment  in  orbit  using the  space  station as  an  assembly  base.  The 
second  concept  would  focus  on  modularization,  ground  assembly  and 
checkout,  and minimal on-orbit assembly. 
The study would a lso  explore the possibilities of adapting,  for visible light 
purposes,  interferometer  techniques  used  by  radio  astronomers  to  obtain 
high-resolution maps of deep space objects.  In addition,  Perkin-Elmer would 
define and  recommend technologies needed for maximum use of the space 
station for  assembling,  testing,  and servicing the  next generation facility  for 
optical astronomy.

November  7:  Jet Propulsion Laboratory UPL)  planetary scientist Steve  Ostro 
recently completed  a five-year  study  of  asteroids  located  in  a belt  between 
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the JPL Uniwrse reported, and then turned his 
attention  to observing nearearth asteroids  using the world’s  most powerful 
radar telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in  Puerto Rico. 
“Some  asteroids are  among the  most primitive  planetesimals-the  matter 
which accreted to form the solar system,”  Ostro said.  ’Asteroids are every  b i t  
as  exciting as  comets and potentially the most important objects in  our solar 
system,”  he pointed out. 
Asteroids constituted an enormous and diverse population,  ranging in  size 
from  a few  hundred meters to  1,000  km,  and varying  in  composition,  spin 
rate,  and shape.  Most asteroids were  in  the belt Ostro had studied and were 
thought  to   be  the  remnants of  a  planet that  failed  to  form  due  to Jupiter‘s 
gravitational  influence.  However,  many  other  asteroids  tumbled  through 
space close to and sometimes across earth‘s  orbit. 
Some  scientists  believed  nearearth  asteroids  could  be  the  nuclei  of 
burned-out comets.  “We  really don‘t  know what the  nucleus of a comet  is,” 
Ostro  said.  “Comets  might  eventually  lose  a l l   of  their  volatile compounds 
and then travel as  asteroids.”  And  scientists believed asteroids were some of 
the most primitive objects  in  the solar system.  “We  really have a spectrum of 
asteroids-some  of  the  primitive material  left from  the  solar  nebula all  the 
way  up  to those that are highly evolved,”  Ostro commented. “So asteroids are 
a  laboratory  for  studying  the  evolution  of  planets  and  other  planetary ob- 
jects.“

N o  spacecraft had ever explored an asteroid,  nor had scientists obtained an 
image of  an  asteroid’s  surface.  That  was  why  many  planetary scientists be- 
lieved JPCs proposed Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby mission was  critical 
to  understanding not only  comets and asteroids,  but also  the  history  of  the 
solar system. 
Another JPL planetary scientist,  Eleanor Helin,  recently discovered a near- 
earth  asteroid  with  a  36-inch  telescope  located  in  Caussols,  France.  The 
asteroid,  designated  1985-PA  and  the  22nd  asteroid  discovered  by  JPL  re- 
searchers,  had a small elongated orbit highly  inclined to the ecliptic plane; 
scientists  had  discovered  only  two  other  near-earth  asteroids  with  orbital 
inclinations  higher than  1985-PA.  Helin said  the  asteroid’s  inclination sug- 
gested  it could have had a close encounter with Mars and been knocked into 
the steeply  inclined orbit. 
At discovery the asteroid was moderately bright-measuring  at  16.5 magni- 
tude-and 
reddish,  indicating the asteroid was  probably a stony,  silicaceous 
body. UPL  Universe,  Nov  1/85,  1 and 2) 

November  75:  Nobel  Laureate  Charles  Townes,  speaking  recently  at  a 
Smithsonian  institution  Associates  lecture,  discussed  how  he  and  his  col- 
leagues at  the University of California-Berkeley proved,  after years of hypoth- 
esizing and researching, that there was a black hole,  twice the size of the sun 
and four  m i l l ion  times as  heavy,  in  the  center of our  galaxy,  the M i lky  Way, 
the  Washington Times reported. 
A  black hole  i s  a body of such enormous gravity that nothing escapes  it- 
it  cannot,  by 
no  light  waves,  no  radio  waves,  no waves  of  any  kind-and 
definition,  be seen or heard. Townes said he and his colleagues identified the 
black hole by deductive reasoning and picking up clues here and there. 
The  first  clue  came  in   the  1940s  when  a  scientist  at  Bell  Laboratories 
picked up a steady stream of radio noise from roughly the center of the M i lky  
Way.  Electrons  bumping  into  protons  and  heating  them  produced  radio 
waves,  but great  permanent clouds of  silicate dust  obscured the  radio wave 
source.  Several  decades  later  scientists at  Berkeley  detected  infrared waves 
coming from the same place. The waves were just  long enough to get through 
the dust clouds,  seeming to  indicate they came from  a  cluster of stars. 
About  ten  years  before,  the  scientists picked up gamma  rays-a  sure  sign 
that,  somewhere near the galactic center,  antimatter (protons) was  destroyed 
at  a  rate  of  about  10  m i l l ion   tons  a  second.  Black  holes  sucked  in   stars, 
causing them to  spiral in  a whirling cluster, moving faster and faster until they 
reached the  speed  of  light and were  ripped apart and swallowed,  a process 
that  created  great  waves  of  energy.  “That  suggested  that  something  very 
strong and violent was  going on,“  Townes said. 
“There  were  three  possibilities,”  Townes  said.  ‘A  large  cluster  of  stars, 
alone, which pulled everything into it,  a black hole,  or some combination of 
the two.” If i t  was  a cluster of stars,  they would all travel at the same speed.  If 

5 5  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

it was  a spiral  of  stars  in  the  process of  falling  into a black  hole,  the  ones 
nearest the hole would move a lot faster than  those on the outer edge. 
Since  each  element  had  its  own   spectrum,  an  astronomer  using a  radio 
telescope could search and find the  identifiable wave emitted by a particular 
element. The astronomers at  Berkeley picked out molecules of  neon along 
the  line  of  stars  around  the  galactic  center;  those  furthest  from  the  center 
were going at  the  slowest  rate,  those  nearest  at  the  fastest.  That  proved the 
presence of a black hole. 
Yet  to  be  definitively  answered,  Townes  said,  were  such  questions  as 
whether  black  holes  came  in  different sizes;  whether  every  galaxy  had  a 
black  hole  at  its center;  and  how  i t  all would  end,  since  black  holes were 
destroying stars.  “It’s  possible,” Townes said,  “that  eventually the  black  hole 
w i l l  pull in  all the stars  i n  our galaxy,  i f  something else doesn‘t  happen first. It 
would  take  an  enormous  time,  so  far  in  the  future,  that  all  kinds of  other 
things would  be more likely to  happen. Such  as  our  sun  cooling off. We‘re 
more likely to fall  into the sun than  into the black hole.  I don’t  think we  have 
to worry about that  immediately.”  ( W  Times, Nov  15/85,  C1) 

November  7 9 :   NASA  announced  i t  had  added  an  educational  experiment 
package sponsored by  the Charleston County,  South Carolina school district 
to   the  Astro-1  payload  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  Columbia  scheduled  for 
launch March 6,  1986. The Astro-1 complement of three ultraviolet astronom- 
ical  instruments and a special visible-light,  wide-field  camera system would 
study  Halley’s  Comet and other celestial objects during its nineday flight  in  
space.  The primary objective of the student project, called “Can  Do:’  was  to 
photograph  Halley’s  Comet;  middle  school  students  (grades  6  through  8) 
would then study and interpret astronomical photos obtained from the flight. 
The  photographic  equipment-four  35mm  still  cameras  equipped  with 
lenses  addressing a  particular aspect  of  cometary  science-would  be  in  a 
canister normally  used for Get Away  Special experiments. The camera pack- 
age,  developed w i th   the  participation of  the  National  Geographic  Society, 
would  use a newly developed color  film with  unprecedented f i lm  speeds  to 
photograph the d im  tail of Halley’s Comet. The color photos would  comple- 
ment the  black-and-white images  obtained  by  Astro-1 ’s  own   image-intensi- 
fied,  scientific wide-field  camera. 
In addition,  the  canister would  contain a  separate  package of  passive stu- 
dent  experiments  including biological  samples,  magnets,  and  two  kinds of 
accelerometers to study effects of microgravity. 
The Charleston County Schools,  in cooperation with  NASA‘s  Educational 
Affairs  Division,  developed  a  broad  program  of  astronomical  science  and 
related educational activities that they would offer to other students through- 
out  the  nation.  These  included  concurrent  ground-based  photography  by 
student groups to compare with results from the Space Shuttle-based photos, 
teaching packets for classroom use, and comparative studies of Comet Halley

(NASA  Release 85-154) 

November  24: Astronomers tracking Halley’s Comet with  the  recently  built 
radio telescope called the Very  Large Array  found that water streamed off  the 
comet at  two to  three  times  the  rate expected  from  calculations  made after 
the  1910  passing,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Comets  were  mainly  ice 
balls embedded with dust and  rock;  they  remained frozen  until they  neared 
the  sun,  when  their  surfaces  began  to  sizzle.  O n   October  19,  when  the 
comet was  about  190 m i l l ion  miles from  the sun,  Halley was  giving off  two 
tons of water  per second. 
Looking at  the  watery  stream  through  a  radio  telescope  showed  only  a 
“hole”  extending 30,000  miles around the comet. This appearance occurred 
because earth-based  telescopes  could  not pick  up  the  wavelengths of  light 
given off by water-they  were obscured by the earth‘s  soggy atmosphere.  Past 
the 30,000-mile  hole, astronomers detected the water broken up into oxygen 
and hydrogen at a distance extending out to 60,000  miles around the comet. 
Astronomers  were  surprised  to  find  the  oxygen-hydrogen  emission  in  
“clumps”  about the size of earth rather than  in  a continuous cloud.  ”No  one 
had even  hypothesized such clumps,”  said  lmke de Pater of the University of 
California. Researchers had no explanation for  the clumps. 
To  observe the comet, de Pater and colleagues Patrick Palmer,  University of 
Chicago, and Lewis Snyder,  University of Illinois, were the first to use the two 
dozen  “dishes“  arranged  in  a  grid at  the  Very  Large Array,  which  provided 
resolutions 20 times better than  that of  a  single telescope.  ( W  Post,  Nov 24/ 
85,  A18) 

Decembe r2   NASA  issued a revision of  its October 28  report on the  Infrared 
Astronomical  Satellite  (IRAS)  [see Astronomy,  Oct.  281,  in which  it noted  a 
major  IRAS  survey  discovery  that  many galaxies emitted  far  more energy  in 
the  infrared than  in the optical band where normal stars emitted the bulk of 
their  luminosity. 
Astronomers  considered  these  galaxies to  be of  three  distinct  kinds.  The 
first  was  “starburst  galaxies,”  those that were  presumably  undergoing an  ac- 
tive  period  of  star  formation  leading to  a  large  infrared  luminosity  and  in 
which as  much as  10 to 20 solar masses of gas and dust were being converted 
into new massive stars  each year. 
Another  class was  sometimes  called  Seyfert  galaxies,  which  astronomers 
believed were powered by matter falling into an accretion disk surrounding a 
black hole. The active regions of these galaxies had a great deal of interstellar 
dust,  which absorbed the optical and ultraviolet radiation from the accretion 
disks,  accounting for  the  large infrared luminosity. 
The third and most mysterious class  of extragalactic objects discovered by 
IRAS  was  the  extremely  luminous  infrared  galaxies  corresponding to  very 

5 7  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

faint  optical  galaxies.  Such  galaxies  produced  100  to  300   times  as  much 
energy  in the  infrared  as  in  the  optical, and  the  total  luminosities of  these 
galaxies were approximately 100 times  those of  ours.  Astronomers believed 
the  infrared radiation in these galaxies was  probably from thermal dust emis- 
sion,  where  the  dust  was  reradiating  energy  absorbed  from  shorter  wave- 
lengths. 
Astronomers  found  a  large  fraction  of  the  active  infrared  galaxies  were 
interacting galaxies,  that  is,  galaxies that were undergoing a collision or near 
collision with a neighboring galaxy. The  IRAS survey  demonstrated the  pro- 
found  effect  such  collisions had on  galaxies,  and  i t  could well  be that  such1 
events dominated the evolution of most galaxies.’(NASA  MOR E-885-83-01

December  5:  NASA announced  i t  selected three  scientific investigations for 
the Hubble Space Telescope that would  lead to the design and development 
over  the  next several years of one or  two advanced scientific instruments for 
flight  readiness during the period  1992 to  1994 for  that orbital observatory. 
The three  investigations selected for  the definition phase were an  imaging 
Michelson  spectrometer,  by  Donald  Ha l l ,   University  of  Hawaii,  Honolulu; 
near-infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer, by Dr. Roger Thompson, 
University of Arizona,  Tucson;  and space telescope imaging spectrograph, by 
Dr.  Bruce Woodgate,  NASA Goddard Space  Flight Center. A l l   the  proposed 
instruments would  be capable of taking photos of celestial objects and break- 
ing  down the  light from these objects into spectral colors. 
NASA would then select one or two of the investigations for flight hardware 
development  about  one  year  after  telescope  launch,  scheduled for  the  last 
half of 1986. Space Shuttle astronauts would  install the selected instrument(s1 
on the telescope wh i le   i t  was  in earth orbit.  (NASA Release 85-164) 

December  6 :   NASA  announced  that,  during  mission  51-L  scheduled  for 
launch  no earlier  than  January 22,  1986,  i t  would  release  from  the  Space 
Shuttle a free-flying payload called Spartan-Halley to observe Halley‘s Comet. 
Scientists believed that comet exploration was  a search for  the beginnings of 
earth,  because comets  were  the  most  unaltered  samples  of  the  early  solar 
system. 
Spartan-Halley was  the only  NASA  satellite dedicated  solely  to observing 
Comet Halley. During these observations, January 24  through  31,  the comet 
would be in  its most active period as i t  headed towards its closest approach to 
the  sun  on  February 9.  The  objective of  the  Spartan-Halley mission was  to 
measure from earth orbit the ultraviolet spectrum of Comet Halley using twin 
spectrographs designed and built by  the  University of  Colorado‘s  Laboratory 
for Atmospheric  and Space  Physics. 
Spartan-Halley’s cameras and  instruments would analyze the active comet, 
looking  for  hydrogen  and  oxygen  atoms  and  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  sulfur 

5 8  

Astronomy 

molecules.  I f  the  spacecraft detected these elements,  i t  might  indicate more 
complex compounds could be present  in  the  ice and dust that made up the 
comet’s  nucleus. 
Goddard Space  Flight Center developed Spartan-Halley, a modified  Spar- 
tan-2  spacecraft,  to  be  a  research  carrier.  The  spacecraft  consisted  of  the 
spectrographic  instrumentation,  attitude  control  cameras  (which  also  pro- 
vided  science photography), a microprocessor, associated electronics, a sun- 
light baffling system,  and a service module. The January mission would  be 
the first for  the Spartan-2 type carrier,  a completely reusable spacecraft to be 
reflown later on several  other missions. Following completion  of the January 
mission,  the  Space  Shuttle‘s  robot  arm  would  retrieve  Spartan-Halley  and 
store  it in the cargo bay.  (NASA Release 85-161) 

December  7 0 :   NASA  announced  that  scientists  from  the  U.S.,  France,  the 
United Kingdom, and West Germany released their findings from the rendez- 
vous on September 11  of  the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) spacecraft 
w i th  Comet Giacobini-Zinner. Although  some  ICE data confirmed the tradi- 
tional portrait of a  comet,  other  information was  unexpected. 
Perhaps  most surprising was  detection  of  electrical wave  (plasma) distur- 
bances and high-speed molecular species coming from the comet more than 
a day  before  rendezvous. The  spacecraft’s  Plasma Wave  Experiment,  devel- 
oped  by TRW‘s  Dr.  Frederick Scarf,  detected the  electrical waves  while  ICE 
was  1,429,200  miles from the comet. Scientists had theorized that first detec- 
tion  might occur just a few  hours before the  spacecraft crossed the  comet’s 
tail. 
A few hours after  initial detection,  but still one day before intercept,  two of 
ICE’S  instruments  discovered  electrically-charged  particles  (ions)  as  far  as 
1,130,000  miles from the comet. The  Energetic Proton Experiment, directed 
by Dr. Robert Hynds,  Imperial College,  London, and the Low-Energy Cosmic 
Ray  Experiment, directed by  Dr.  Dieter Hovestadt of the Max Planck Institute 
for  Extraterrestrial  Physics,  Garching,  West  Germany,  detected  these  ions. 
According to Hynds,  it was  believed solar  ultraviolet light ionized  gas  mole- 
cules escaping from the comet’s  nucleus, then the solar wind picked up and 
accelerated the  ions back toward the comet. 
In another  finding,  Dr.  Samuel  Bame of  the  Los  Alamos  National  Labora- 
tory  reported  that,  in   contrast  to  the  hot  electrons  on  the  outskirts  of  the 
comet,  its  tail  consisted of  a  dense  narrow  structure  of  cool  plasma.  The 
Radio Wave  Experiment of  France’s  Meudon  Observatory  made  this  same 
finding. 
The  ICE’S Ion Composition  Experiment,  directed  by  Dr.  Keith Ogilvie of 
Goddard Space  Flight Center,  made the  first  direct measurements of  mole- 
cules i n  a comet. The experiment found mainly water vapor ions, confirming 
the “dirty  snowball”  model of comets. 

59  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

A major prediction  confirmed by the  ICE data was  that the magnetic struc- 
ture of the comet’s  plasma tail consisted of two parallel lobes, each threaded 
by  a  magnetic  field of  opposite polarity.  ICE’S Magnetometer Experiment of 
Dr.  Edward  Smith  of  the  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory  mapped  this  structure, 
which was  predicted in  1957 by  Nobel physicist Dr.  Hannel Alfven. 
Putting conflicting scientific conjectures to  rest,  the  ICE mission  revealed 
that no clear-cut bow shock-a  surface moving ahead  of the comet  like that 
through which a jet aircraft passes as  i t  breaks  the sound barrier-accompa- 
nied  the  comet.  instead,  researchers  found  around  the  head  of  the  comet 
what  they  called  “a  transition region”  in which  the  solar  wind was  heated,. 
compressed, and slowed. 
Neither the  ICE spacecraft nor  i t s   instrument payload suffered any  detect- 
able damage as  a result of  the  impact with the comet‘s  dust.  (NASA Release 
85-166) 

December  17:  NASA  announced  that  i t s   Comet  Halley  Active  Monitoring 
Program (CHAMP), a middeck payload to obtain wide field visible and ultra- 
violet  data  on  Comet  Halley  using  handheld  equipment,  would  have  i t s  
primary flight January 1986 on the  Space Shuttle (STS) mission 51-L.  It was 
during that time that the comet would  be most active but viewing from earth 
would be most difficult due to the narrow viewing angle between the comet 
and the sun. 
The  first  flight  of  CHAMP would  be on  STS  mission  61-C  in  December 
1985; the third, on STS  mission 61-E  March 1986. The December and March 
flights would  provide  important  pre- and  post-perihelion baseline data  that 
would assist w i th  the  interpretation of the January flight data. 
NASA considered CHAMP data supplemental to the extensive and detailed 
space-based data to  be obtained from the flight of the ASTRO payload on STS 
the  UVX 
the  Spartan-Halley  payload  on  STS  mission  51-L, 
mission 61-E, 
payload on STS  mission 61 -C,  and the  International Cometary Explorer (ICE) 
spacecraft.  However,  the  CHAMP  data  would  be  unique  in   i t s   nature and 
ability to provide a single context for all of these  activities,  because i t  would 
make observations on three  Space Shuttle missions. 
Before each observation,  the assigned mission specialist would set  up the 
experiment by mounting the CHAMP equipment in  the appropriate window. 
O n  the January flight,  the mission specialist would use the orbiter Challeng- 
er‘s  U V  transmissive side hatch quartz window. On  the other two flights, data 
probably  would  be  acquired  through  the  aft  flight  deck  windows.  During 
observations, the orbiter would be oriented so the appropriate window was 
pointed to w i th in   5 O  of the celestial coordinates of  the comet,  with attitude 
drift rates of  less than  1.002O  maintained. 
Each observation required exposing a series of one to four calibration shots 
plus s ix  to eight frames of f i lm  for images or spectra during the approximately 

60  

Astronomy 

fiveminute  period occurring  in each orbit when the comet was  in  view and 
the sun was  at  least 8O  below the earth’s  horizon. 
NASA  hoped there would be an  observation for each flight day during the 
sevenday December and March missions,  and up to 20  observations during 
the  January flight.  However,  conflicts with  other  operational  requirements 
might reduce the actual number of observations,  although unusual cometary 
behavior  could  require additional  time allocated to  the experiment.  (NASA 
[prelaunch],  Dec  17/85) 
MOR  E-420-61  -C-20 

December 31: NASA  announced  that  on  December 26  its  Venus  orbiting 
Pioneer spacecraft began s ix  weeks of observations of  Halley’s Comet during 
the comet’s  most active period closest to the sun  (perihelion). Near the time 
of  perihelion,  the comet,  Venus,  and  Pioneer were  located on  the opposite 
side  of  the  sun  from  earth,  making observations  difficult  from  earth  (160 
m i l l ion  miles away). 
Pioneer was the only spacecraft close to Halley’s Comet during perihelion, 
and  NASA  expected  that  Pioneer’s  ultraviolet observations  would  provide 
valuable insights into the state of the comet in  advance of flybys of Halley’s by 
European, Soviet,  and Japanese spacecraft beginning March 6 ,   1986. 
Pioneer’s first phase of observations would end January 4 when both Venus 
and Pioneer passed  behind  the sun  for  almost a month,  cutting off effective 
communications  between  the  spacecraft  and  ground  controllers at  Ames 
Research  Center.  Observations would  resume  about  February  3,  s ix   days 
before perihelion,  and would continue  until March 6. 
NASA scheduled Pioneer to  produce two images of the comet in ultraviolet 
light. One would show the hydrogen cloud surrounding the comet, an  image 
expected to be 20 times larger than a photo of the comet in  visible light. The 
image would come from 20,000  scans of the comet as  i t  drifted for three days 
through  Pioneer’s  ultraviolet spectrometer’s  field  of  view.  A  second  image 
would show both Venus and Halley’s Comet in a single view.  (NASA Release

Planetary Exploration 

january  7 8  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  approved  the  addition  of  an 
asteroid 28  Amphitrite-flyby  option to the Galileo mission,  permitting a De- 
cember  1986 final  flyby decision and changing the Jupiter arrival  date  from 
August to December 1988, the JSC Roundup reported. 
Approval  had  followed  a  two-year  study  by  scientific groups,  mission de- 
signers,  and  program officials,  in  which  the  National Academy of  Sciences 
and NASA‘s  Solar System Exploration Committee identified asteroids  investi- 
gations as  an essential element of a balanced planetary exploration program. 

61  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics.  1985 

The  asteroid  flyby  could not compromise or  risk  mission objectives.  NASA. 
would  make  the  final  decision  for  a  flyby  after  launch based  on  analysis of 
spacecraft  health,  particularly  the  attitude-control  and  mission-operations 
systems. 
Amphitrite,  about 200  km in diameter and one of  the  larger of the  minor 
asteroids, was  in  a  near-circular solar orbit  in the middle of the asteroid belt 
at 2.5  Astronomical  Uriits (AU) from the sun (the earth’s  distance was  1 AU  01’ 
about  150,000,000  km). 
A specially convened hazards workshop had concluded  that,  at  a  10,000- 
to  20,000-km  flyby  distance,  hazard to  the  spacecraft was  no  greater  than 
flying through  the  asteroid  belt as  2  Pioneer and  2  Voyager  spacecraft had 
done,  and measurements analysis and  Doppler-tracking data could  achieve 
significant scientific objectives. As  Amphitrite  had a rotation period of about 
5.39  hours,  Galileo’s mapping spectrometer could photograph and scan most 
of  i t s   surface.  Data analysis  would  reveal  size,  shape,  mass,  density,  exact 
rotation  rate,  pole  orientation,  detailed  surface  morphology,  and  mineral 
composition,  thus  indicating whether Amphitrite  was  a  primitive  accumula- 
tion of solar nebulae condensates or an evolved body that was  a  fragment or 
perhaps a core of  a  broken-up minor  planet. With this data,  scientists could 
possibly confirm or refute a hypothesis that asteroids were sources of many of 
the meteorites that  had fallen on earth. 
NASA  had  developed  a  new  trajectory  containing  both  Amphitrite  and 
Jupiter, constrained  by  launch-vehicle energy  and  the  existing launch  win- 
dow,  that would result in a Jupiter arrival date delay from August 29,  1988 to 
December  10,  1988.  Since  the  flyby  would  require early  added-propellant 
expenditure,  NASA would decrease the number of Jupiter-tour orbits from  11 
to  10 and  lengthen the tour from 20 to 22  months,  permitting achievement of 
all major  l l -o rb i t  tour objectives. The delayed arrival and  increased tour time 
would  add  five months and about  $20-25  m i l l ion   in  costs  to  the  mission. 
(ISC  Roundup,  Jan 18/85,  1) 

January 2 5  NASA  and  the  European Space  Agency  (ESA) would  launch  in  
1986 Ulysses,  previously known as  the  International Solar  Polar  Mission,  to 
explore behind and around the sun beginning i n  July 1987,  the JPL Universe 
reported. JPL managed the  U.S.  mission phases and was  responsible for  part 
of the magnetometer experiment. The Space Shuttle would  take Ulysses  into 
orbit;  a modified Centaur  upper  stage  rocket would  send  i t  on  a  trajectory 
toward Jupiter, where i t  would gain energy from Jupiter’s gravity field to pull it 
out of the ecliptic plane (the plane of the earth’s  orbit) and back over  the sun. 

Researchers would incorporate into the spacecraft bus instruments shipped 
to  the  European Space  Research  Technology Center  near Amsterdam,  Hol- 
land;  after extensive testing scheduled for  completion  i n  August,  an  interna- 
tional  board  would  review  the  spacecraft’s  readiness.  After  a  mission 

62 

Astronomy 

operations review, ESA  would ship Ulysses to KSC for flight tests and prepara- 
tions.  At  a  June meeting in  Switzerland,  a  team  of  scientists would  decide 
whether  Ulysses  would  approach  the  sun  over  its  north  or  south  pole. UPL 
Universe, Jan 25/85,  1) 

January28 NASA announced i t  had received signals from the USSR's Venera- 
Halley space  probes at  its  Deep Space  Network's  (DSN) 210-foot antenna at 
Goldstone,  California. The USSR  had agreed  that  Vega-1 and 2, launched  in 
December 1984,  would  carry experiments for  joint U.S./French  research. 
For  the June 1985 experiment, each spacecraft would  drop  into the Venu- 
sian atmosphere an  instrument-laden balloon, which would  float free  in  the 
middle,  most active  layer,  of  Venus's  three-tiered cloud system.  Transmitters 
on the  balloons would continually  send  signals to earth during the  twoday 
lifetime of each balloon. Three globally-placed, hypersensitive dish antennas 
of NASA's  DSN, part of an  international network of  radio astronomy antennas 
organized  by  the  Centre  National  d'Etudes  Spatiales  for  the  study,  would 
receive the signals. Using data received from the combined array of at  least 10 
antennas worldwide,  in addition  to that  from  the  USSR's  network,  scientists 
could calculate in detail the  balloons'  locations and motions. 
Scientists would  use  a  radio  astronomy  technique  known  as  Very  Long 
Baseline  Interferometry  (VLBI)  to  measure  balloon  velocity  and  hence 
Venus's w ind  velocity with a precision of approximately two miles per hr. at a 
distance  of  67   m i l l ion   miles  from  earth.  Scientists  hoped  data  obtained 
would  help further understanding of the complex Venusian weather  system. 
The DSN antennas would also receive data from the other scientific instru- 
ments on  the  balloon gondola,  including  instruments  to measure lightning 
flash  frequency,  wind  gusts'  vertical  velocity,  atmospheric  temperature  and 
pressure,  and cloud location and density. 
Understanding turbulence and wave-type motions in clouds was  important 
because scientists believed Venus's  cloud layers to be the driving gear  of the 
planet's  multilayered weather  machine.  For  example,  scientists  hoped  data 
would explain why the atmosphere at Venus's  cloud tops circled the planet at 
250 miles per hr.  as  compared to near-calm on the surface. 
By  studying the atmospheric dynamics on Venus  and other  planets,  scien- 
tists hoped to understand atmospheric processes in general  in order to char- 
acterize a l l  planets,  including earth,  in  terms of a general set of physical laws. 
(NASA  Release 85-13) 

March 8 NASA announced that astronomers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL) and the Universities of Hawaii, Arizona,  and Texas  were observing Pluto 
and its only known satellite, Charon, as  the two alternately moved in front of 
one another  in a  series of eclipses that occurred every  124 years  or  twice  in 
each orbit of  the  sun.  Each time Charon passed between Pluto and earth,  a 

6 3  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

portion of  Pluto‘s  surface was  blocked from  view,  resulting in  a dimming a4 
the  combined  light from  both bodies.  When  Charon  m& 
behind  Pluto, 
their  roles  reversed.  Measurements of  the  times,  durations,  and changes  in  
brightness of  the  events  would  allow  astronomers  to  calculate  the  masses, 
diameters,  and  densities  of  Pluto  and  Charon,  permitting  development of 
models of the two bodies’ composition. 
Current estimates of  Pluto’s  density  had an  uncertainty of  5 0 ° / o ,   not accu- 
rate enough to derive  information on  its composition.  However,  researchers 
thought Pluto’s density was  about that of water,  making i t  the  lowestdensity 
planet known that  had a solid surface. 
The  new  measurements  indicated  that  the  combined  brightness of  Pluto 
and  Charon  diminished  by  4%  during  the  eclipses,  a dimming that  lasted 
about  two  hours and was  superimposed on  a  30% brightness change  that 
occurred over  a 6.4day  period. The  longer change  in  brightness happened 
because one hemisphere of Pluto was  30% brighter than the other. 
Very  little was  known about  Pluto and even  less  about Charon,  including 
when or even i f  the five-year-long series of eclipses would begin.  In order not 
to miss any of the earliest events,  the astronomers had established an obsew

at  12  noon   EDT  June  1  was  2,095,063,224  miles  from  earth  and 
2,170,849,615  miles  from  the  sun,  Omn i   reported. Voyager  2,  after Jupiter

187,782,284  miles from  Uranus. 
At  12  noon  EDT June 14,  Pioneer  10,  which  encountered Jupiter in   1973 
and  was  the  first  spacecraft  to  leave  the  solar  system,  was  3,410,823,980 
miles from earth and 3,319,306,400  miles from the sun.  (Omn i ,  June 85,  28) 

lune   7 5 :   An  international team of planetary scientists gathered at  the  USSR’s 
Space  Research  Institute to  catch  the  first  return  of  data  from  the  Vega-2 
spacecraft plunging into the atmosphere of Venus,  the N Y  Times reported. At 
6:06  a.m.  Vega-2  began  its  descent.  Among  the  roughly  100  participants 
were  representatives from eight  European nations and  the  French Ambassa- 
dor. 
Two days before, exploding bolts had freed an eight-foot sphere that carried 
one-and-a-half  tons of  payload bound for Venus’s  night  side.  The main craft 
would miss Venus entirely and use energy provided by the planet‘s  gravity to 
propel  i t  toward an encounter with Halley’s Comet.  Inside the  rapidly decel- 
erating sphere a timing device programmed months before switched on the 
scientific  packages  around  it,  then  set  loose  a  15-lb.  stack  of  miniaturized 
weather  instruments bu i l t  by  French,  Soviet,  and  U.S.  scientists.  An  ll-foot- 
diameter teflon balloon filled with  helium  kept the  instruments from  reach- 
ing Venus‘s  surface. 
An  hour  after  the  balloon  inflated,  the  Vega-2  lander  had  reached  the 
surface safely.  The  lander,  in  an  atmospheric pressure 80 times  the earth’s  at 
sea  level and in  a nighttime  temperzture of 855O  F,  was  relaying information 
on  surface conditions  and excavating a small sample of the surrounding soil 
for crude analysis of  its composition. 
Vega-1’s  balloon had  reached the  planet June 11  and  had covered nearly 
6,000  miles through the Venusian clouds in  46  hours,  passing into the plan- 
et’s  sunlit hemisphere before exhausting i t s  battery. 
The  new  ’Jega  results suggested  the  planet  had  five discrete  cloud  layers 
whereas  earlier missions  detected  only  three.  ( N Y  Times, June 18/85,  C8,

September  6: Jet Propulsion Laboratory  UPL)  engineers and  technicians  re- 
cently  practiced the exact technique that would  be  used  to  fuel  the Galileo 
spacecraft,  simulating the  Kennedy Space Center  (KSC) environment where 
the spacecraft would actually be fueled,  the JPL Universe reported. This was 
necessary because Galileo’s  propulsion system,  designed and  bu i l t  by West 
Germany and unlike previous JPL  spacecraft in  which the propulsion system 

65  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

was  a  separate  module,  would  be  sandwiched  in between the  bus  and  the 
despun  section  of  the  spacecraft. This  would  require fueling  when  Galileo 
was  fully assembled, and any  resulting problems could jeopardize the sensi- 
tive cargo. 
“This  fourday exercise  i s  basically an  ’undress  rehearsal’,”  Hank Delgado, 
propulsion and pyro devices group  leader, said.  “We want to acquaint every- 
one with the procedures and equipment we  plan to  use to fuel Galileo.” 
Instead of using the actual  propellants-mono-methylhydrazine  and  nitro- 
gen  tetroxide-that  Galileo  would  use,  the  team  practiced with  less  hazard- 
ous  fluids-isopropyl  alcohol  and  freon-allowing 
them  to  work  without 
special suits. When Galileo was fueled at KSC,  technicians would wear  55-113. 
SCAPE  (self-contained  atmospheric  protective  ensemble)  suits  to  protect 
them from the highly toxic propellants. Although the suits had an  a i r  supply 
and  thermal  control  system,  the  limited air  supply  allowed  only  about  an 
hour of work,  requiring  technicians to work  in shifts. 
JPL  would  send Galileo to KSC early  in 1986 for final  launch preparations. 
Technicians would  then  fuel  the  spacecraft,  taking a day  for  each of  its  four 
tanks.  For  the  following  four  months,  the  technicians  would  monitor  the 
propellant closely for  leaks or changes  in temperature. UPL  Universe, Sept 6/

October  8  NASA announced that  a  panel of  scientists at  its Ames  Research 
Center  (ARC) said  today  that,  although  Mars  presently  was  a  frigid  desert 
planet,  it once  had  enough water  to  cover  its entire surface with  an  ocean 
more than 300 feet deep. Dr. Michael Carr of the U.S.  Geological Survey said 
at  the meeting,  which grew out of  research discussed the  previous winter  at 
ARC‘s  Water on Mars Workshop,  that  “The  pictures taken by  the two Viking 
spacecraft  in   orbit  around  Mars  tell  us  that  Mars  had  as  much  water  in 
geologic  history as  earth did.” 
Carr said the  20,000 close-up pictures taken since  1976 by  the two Viking 
spacecraft  revealed  canyons  that  were  deeper,  wider,  and  longer  than  the 
Grand Canyon and  could  be  made only  by  rushing rivers.  The  photos a lso  
showed thousands of  gullies formed  only  by  water  or  snow  and  ice slicing 
into the surface or forcing their way  up to the surface. 
“If  a l l   the  water  that  existed  on  Mars  to  form  these  channels  covered  its 
surface today,”  commented ARC’s  Dr. James Pollack, “it  would  be enough to 
form a global Martian ocean tens of  hundreds of meters deep.“ 
Carr  pointed  out  that  the  Viking  photos  also  suggested  that  water  was 
below  the  surface at  latitudes  near  the  Martian equator where  the  planet‘s 
interior heat could keep it from freezing just as do underground rivers in  most 
temperate  latitudes on earth.  “There  is  a  softening of the terrain,  a  rounding 
off  of  the  edges  .  .  .  that  i s  evidence of  underground water  flow  and  the 
creep of  ice near the surface,”  he said.

“This  terrain  i s  also  located where  most of  the Martian  gullies are  today, 
where  snow,  ice,  and  water  burst  out  of  the  ground  to  cause  the  colossal 
floods that  formed the channels we  see  today:’  Carr  said. 
And  Pollack  added  that  Mars  long  ago  lost  most  of  i t s   carbon  dioxide, 
which  helped trap  the  sun’s  heat,  causing in effect a  permanent Martian  ice 
age.  (NASA  Release 85-140) 

November 2 9  New observations supported the prediction that Saturn’s  satel- 
lite Hyperion was tumbling wildly  rather than rotating with a  regular predict- 
able period,  Science reported. 
In  1983 Jack Wisdom,  who was  currently at  the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and his colleagues predicted that the combination of Hyperion’s 
odd potato shape and the stretching of  i t s  orbit by the gravitational tugs of the 
larger satellite Titan would prevent Hyperion  from  rotating regularly.  Instead 
of keeping one face toward Saturn, as the moon faced earth,  Hyperion would 
rotate chaotically, tumbling one way  then another,  slowing down and speed- 
ing  up,  in  a  fashion  impossible to  predict  in any  detail  from  its  preceding 
behavior. 
Since then,  Peter Thomas of Cornell University and his colleagues reported 
analyses  of  the  brightness  of  Hyperion  in  Voyager  images that  indicated  a 
regular  13day period of rotation during the 61 days of Voyager-2’s encounter 
w i th  Saturn. 
Jack Wisdom and Stanton  Peale of  the  University of California,  Santa  Bar- 
bara,  countered  that  determining  a  period  from  14  brightness observations 
scattered over  several  supposed  rotations could not determine whether  the 
rotation was chaotic or not. They found many periods by similarly sampling a 
numerically  generated chaotic  light curve. 
The  University of  Texas‘s  Richard  Binzel,  Jacklyn Green,  and  Chet  Opal 
reported at  a recent meeting of astronomers that the  light curve of  Hyperion 
they  observed  in   April  was  “highly  inconsistent  with  a  13.1-day  rotation 
period.”  O n  April 16 and 17,  Hyperion’s magnitude was at a maximum for the 
14day observing period;  i t  faded  by  1 magnitude by  April  21  and  was  no 
brighter  13  days  after the first observations.  It should have become 1 magni- 
tude or 2.5  times brighter i f  i t  had a 13day period. Although the observations 
did not prove chaotic rotation,  the group said,  ”they  provide strong evidence 
in  favor  of the hypothesis.” 
To  say  much more about  Hyperion’s  rotation,  astronomers would  have  to 
observe  Hyperion  nightly  for  many weeks,  something  that  those  assigning 
telescope time  had been reluctant to permit.  (Science,  Nov 29/85,  1027) 

December 3:  Dr. Michael Kaiser of the Goddard Space Flight Center said at a 
news conference today  that,  “We  see  no  radio  emissions from  Uranus that 
would  tell  us  i t  has  a  magnetic  field,  and we’re  less  than  46  m i l l ion   miles 
from the planet” w i th  the Voyager 2 spacecraft, the Washington Post reported. 

67 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

“We  still pick up Jupiter’s radio noise,  Saturn’s  radio noise and even the sun’s 
radio  noise but we’re  not  hearing any  radio events  at  Uranus:’  he added.  If 
Uranus  had  no  magnetic  field,  it would  make  i t   only  the  second  known 
planet in the solar system without one,  Venus  being the other. 
Kaiser said  the sign of a planet‘s  magnetic field was  i t s   radio noise,  gener- 
ated when  protons and  electrons poured off the  sun  and  collided  with  the 
planet’s  magnetosphere. This  collision  triggered  the  one  billion-watt  radio 
signal  from  earth called  the  Northern  Lights,  a  100 billion-watt  signal  from 
Saturn,  and  a signal  so  loud  from  Jupiter that  i t  dwarfed  every  other  radio 
signal  in  the solar system. 
“You  don’t  need much to fotm a magnetosphere that would generate noise 
out a t  Uranus’s  distance,”  Kaiser said,  “so we  figure we’re  either dealing with 
a planet that has  no magnetic field at all or  i s  so  bizarre we don’t even know 
what to  look for.” 
Kaiser pointed out that a missing magnetic field suggested that Uranus had 
no  internal heat  source-no 
radioactive core  such  as  that  which  made the 
rotating earth  behave  like a  dynamo,  and  no  internal  heat  source  such  as 
those that gave the rapidly  rotating Jupiter and Saturn a strong magnetic field. 
“You  need an  internal heat source to drive a magnetic field:’  Kaiser  said.  ‘A 
planet’s  rotation i s  not enough by  itself to create one.” 
Voyager  2,  which had been in  space for eight years and had passed Jupiter 
and Saturn,  on January 24 would fly within 51,000  miles of the cloud tops of 
Uranus. Voyages  2  would  in  August  1989 encounter  Neptune,  but  i t s  fiight 
would  not take i t  near Pluto,  the  last known planet from the sun.  The space- 
craft would  then pass out of the solar system.  ( W  Post,  Dec 4/85,  A20) 

December 4  NASA  announced  that  Voyager  2  began  today  i t s   encounter 
w i th   Uranus, which would continue through  February 2 5 ,   1986. During the 
period,  the spacecraft‘s  11  instruments would perform close-range studies of 
the  planet,  its  five  known  satellites,  and  nine  rings.  Voyager  2  would  also 
search  for  a planetary magnetic field,  new satellites,  and new  rings. 
The  spacecraft would make  its closest approach to  Uranus,  flying 81,500 
km above  the cloud tops of the seventh  planet,  at  1 :00 p.m.  EST  January 24, 
1986.  Because  Voyager  2  was  the  first  spacecraft  to  reach  the  planet,  the 
encounter would provide scientists w i th  more information about Uranus and 
its satellites and  rings than  had been learned since William Herschel discov- 
ered the  planet March 31,  1781. 
In  addition  to  two  cameras,  a  photopolarimeter,  and  a  spacecraft  radio, 
Voyager 2 carried an  infrared interferometer/spectrometer and radiometer, an 
ultraviolet spectrometer,  a cosmic-ray detector,  a plasma  instrument,  a low- 
energy  charged-particle detector,  magnetometers,  a  planetary  radio  astron- 
omy  receiver,  and  a  plasma-wave  instrument.  Three  radioisotope 
thermoelectric  generators  supplied  the  spacecraft’s  electric power,  a system

such  a great distance from the  sun.

lanua ry   14:  NASA  announced  that  Goddard  Space  Flight Center’s  (GSFC) 
Wallops  Island,  VA,  facility  in  cooperation with  the  Air  Force  Geophysics 
Laboratory  (AFGL) at  Hanscom AFB,  Massachusetts,  and  the  Danish Mete- 
orological  Institute (DMI), Copenhagen, Denmark, would  carry out that win- 
ter  the  1985  Cooperative  Observations  of  Polar  Electrodynamics  (COPE) 
project of sounding rocket research  in  Greenland to gather knowledge about 
the  solarearth  relationship.  The  project would  include  studies  of  polar-cap 
turbulence  and  electrodynamics,  auroral-zone  electrodynamics,  auroral- 
electrojet  turbulence,  neutral-atmosphere coupling,  and  polar-ionospheric 
irregularities. 
Researchers selected Greenland for the  investigations because of  its access 
to   the  auroral  oval,  polar  cap,  and  polar  cusp;  an  existing  rocket  range; 
support  from  the  Sondre  Stromfjord  incoherent-scatter  radar,  the  H i   Lat 
Spacecraft,  and the extensive array  of scientific ground-observing stations in  
Greenland,  Scandanavia,  and North America;  and a broad choice of  launch 
azimuths.  GSFC/Wallops Flight  Facility  personnel  had  spent  several weeks 
during  the  previous  summer  at  the  Greenland  Sondre  Stromfjord  facility 
installing additional  launchers and related ground-support equipment,  radar, 
telemetry,  and  communications  systems  and  erecting vehicle  and  payload 
assembly structures. 
Project experimenters scheduled nine suborbital  rocket  launches of which 
two  would  release chemicals creating artificial  vapor  clouds  250  km  high. 
NASA scheduled seven  flights:  two Black Brant Xs,  two Terrier-Malemutes, a 
Taurus-Orion,  a  Nike-Tomahawk, and a Taurus-Tomahawk;  AFGL  scheduled 
two missions: a Black Brant V l l l   and a Black Brant  IX .   (GSFC Release 8 5 - 5 )  

February 2 2  Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) announced that on Febru- 
ary  4  techn ica lk ien t i f ic   teams  from Australia,  India,  Finland,  and  the  U.S. 
had  begun  a  six-week  meeting  a t   Wallops  Flight  Facility,  Va.,  to  compare 
radiosonde  instruments  used  worldwide.  Measuring  only  a  few  inches 
square  and weighing  less  than  2  Ib.,  the  radiosonde was  a  low-cost,  mass- 
produced instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure,  temperature,  rela- 
tive humidity, and wind while ascending on a  small balloon up to about 25 
km (15 miles), or more frequently  30 km (18 miles), above earth. Worldwide 
weather  services  used  radiosonde data  for  forecasts  to  aid aviation  and  for 
research. 
There were  currently  17  radiosonde manufacturers in  a  number  of  coun- 
tries,  resulting in  occasional differences in instrument measurements and the 
need  to  make  periodic  comparisons.  A  working  group  on  the  quality  of

The United Kingdom’s Meteorological Office had hosted the  1 st  phase  in  
1984, when researchers released 106 ballons. Phase2 participants at Wallops 
launched  four  halloons a day,  five  days  a week,  weather  permi!ting,  for  an 
anticipated  total  of  about  1GO   flights,  each  balloon carrying  four  or  more 
instruments.  Researchers  would  then  correlate  Phase-2  data  with  Phase1 
results.  (GSFC Release 85-81 

A p r i l   16:  NASA  announced  the  postlaunch status  of  the  NOAA-A,  -B,  and 
-C  missions carried out for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adrninis- 
tration.  In addition,  NASA   announced  i t  scheduled N O A A - D   for  launch  in 
1987. NASA submitted on January 24 ,   1984 a postlaunch report for  NQAA-E 
(launched  March  18,  1983)  and  would  submit  a  postlaunch  report  for 
NOAA-F  (launched December  12,  1984) after  a  full  year  of data  collection 
and evaluation. 
NASA successfully  launched N 0 . M - A   (NOM-6) June 27,  1979, from the 
Western Space and Missile Center into a sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite 
ceased  providing usable atmospheric soundings on October 22,  1983, when 
the  filter  wheel  assembly  became  inoperable.  NASA  s t i l l   used  the  primary 
imaging system.  NOAA-C  would  replace NOAA-6  in November  1985. 
During NOAA-B  launch on May  24,  1980,  one  of  the  two Atlas  booster 
engines had a thrust  reduction. This premature booster engine cutoff caused 
a deficit  i n  velocity  and  altitude of  the  Atlas,  making the  sustainer  engine 
burn  55   seconds  longer  than  planned.  As  the  sustainer  engine  was  still 
thrusting when the spacecraft attempted to separate from the  launch vehicle, 
the  spacecraft  consumed  most  of  its  attitude control  gas  as  i t   fought  the 
booster for  i t s   attitude control. The  apogee  kick motor  burn  put  NOAA-B 
into a highly elliptical,  269   x  1466 km,  92 .5’   inclination orbit. As a result of 
the combination  of  incorrect orbit and  loss of attitude control,  NASA  termi- 
nated the mission. The aborted NOAA-B  mission brought about changes  in  
subsequent NOAA  launches,  and the next three  launches were successful. 
O n  June 23 ,   1981, NASA successfully launched NOAA-C  (NOAA-7)  from 
the Eastern Space and Missile Center into a sun-synchronous orbit.  Failure of 
the filter  wheel  assembly on  February 7,  1985,  terminated  the  collection  of 
usable  atmospheric  soundings.  On   February  25,  198.5,  NASA  placed  the 
primary imaging system on standby when  NOAA-9  became the operational 
spacecraft for afternoon observations. 
NASA achieved the mission objectives of NOAA-A  and -C,  and the space- 
craft provided useful sounding and  imaging data  far  in  excess  of  their  two- 
year  design  life.  NASA  certified  these  missions  successful.  Due  to  launch 
vehicle  malfunction,  NASA  terminated  the  NOAA-B  mission  and  reported 
that mission unsuccessful. (NASA MOR  E-6  15-79-01

Na ta l ,   Brazil. The team acquired data from 9 to 40 miles above the earth at an 
equatorial  site  using the  improved  'A"  version  ROCket  OZonesonde  (RO- 
COZ-A). 
The team  took  seven  profiles during ozone-measuring satellite overpasses 
to  compare  the  ROCOZ-A  data  with  other  satellite data  for  the  same  time 
and  place. Although  the  primary mission was  to support the SAGE  I I   ozone 
measurements acquired  by  the  .ERBS/SAGE  I /  satellite,  the  team  would  also 
compare the data with that from the solar backscatter ultraviolet spectrometer 
on the Solar Mesopheric Explorer (SMD  satellite. 
Each  ROCOZ-A  launch  included  the  supporting  launch  of  a  super-loki 
datasonde  dart  (a  small  meteorological  rocket)  to  collect  temperature  data 
from  9 to 43  miles in the atmosphere and an  electrochemical  concentration

low   18  miles) ozone,  temperature,  and  pressure data.  The  team  would  use

above  earth.  Specific  mission  objectives were  to  investigate differential a b  
sorption of  radio waves;  determine the  electron density  profile;  and  investi- 
gate  the  irregular  structure of the electron density  profile in  terms of  neutral 
turbulence,  plasma  instabilities in  the mid-latitude  region,  and gravity wave 
effects. The  120-lb. payloads reached peak altitudes of  110 statute miles, and 
preliminary  results indicated all instrumentation performed satisfactorily and 
obtained good data. 
The  Nike-Orion  was  a  two-stage,  solid-propellant  unguided  sounding

lence  i s   the  major  unsolved  problem  of  the  atmosphere and  ionosphere.”

September  9  Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC) announced that  its Wal- 
lops  Flight  Facility  conducted  today  a  coordinated  series  of  rocketborne 
experiments  to  study  effects  of  lightning  in   the  earth’s  troposphere.  Three 
rocket payloads at different altitudes simultaneously collected  lightning mea- 
surement data,  and a series of  ground-based  instruments designed to detect 
the  location and characteristics of  lightning also made coordinated measure- 
ments. 
Wallops  researchers  launched at  8:Ol  EDT  a  single-stage Orion sounding 
rocket,  70 seconds later a two-stage Taurus-Orion, and then 57 seconds  later 
a Nike-Orion;  all  three were  solid-propellant sounding rockets. 
The Taurus-Orion lofted its 297-lb. payload to a peak altitude of  120 statute 
miles,  and  the  Nike-Orion  carried  its  303-lb.  payload to  a  peak  altitude of 
71.5  statute miles. The Taurus-Orion experiment package contained a water 
recovery  system  using an  eight-foot  parachute with  flotation  bag,  flashing 
strobe  light,  and  recovery beacon. 
Wallops personnel,  following the three rocket series,  launched a meteoro- 
logical data sonde on a small  rocket to determine the meteorological charac- 
teristics  in the upper atmosphere near  the time of the other measurements. 
The Wallops P-3  search aircraft located the Taurus-Orion payload package 
at  9:45  p.m.  that  same  day  about  40  miles  offshore,  and  the  next  day  the 
Coast Guard cutter  “Point  Brown”  recovered and  returned  it to the Wallops 
Flight Facility for  refurbishment and  future  spaceflights.  (GSFC Release 85-

October  16: NASA’s  Goddard Space  Flight Center announced the  launch at 
6:Ol  a.m.  DST today of a single-stage Orion sounding rocket from its Wallops

Atmospheric  Research 

Flight  Facility  to  evaluate  electrical  fields  and  charged  particles  in  earth’s 
middle atmosphere. 
The Orion, about 16 feet  long and 14  inches in diameter,  carried the 90-lb. 
payload to a peak altitude of  52   statute miles,  after which a Wallops Skyvan 
aircraft  recovered the payload in  mid-air. 
NASA  launched the experiment from the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR) 
in  Alaska on April  12,  1985;  however,  snow cover  hindered payload recovery. 
O n  August  26  a sheep  hunting  party  found  the  payload and  its  parachute 
floating on Beaver Creek  in  the White Mountains,  Alaska and  returned  i t  to 
the  PFRR.  Range officials on  September 23  sent  the  payload  to Wallops for 
refurbishment for today’s  launch. 
NASA tentatively scheduled for July 1986 another launch of the experiment 
in Sweden. (GSFC Release 85-29) 

November  7:  Scientists  analyzing data  recently  sent  from  two  monitoring 
devices  aboard  the  Nimbus-7  satellite  said  the  observations  confirmed  a 
progressive deterioration  in  the earth’s  ozone  layer above Antarctica,  the  NY 
Times reported. Since 1974,  the satellite data showed that a “hole”  appeared 
each October  in  the ozone layer there, meaning the layer in  that area became 
less  able  to  shield  the  earth  from  damaging solar  ultraviolet rays.  This  had 
caused scientists to predict that  increased atmospheric pollution was causing 
the gradual  depletion  of  stratospheric ozone;  the new data seemed  to show 
researchers that  the ozone  loss was  proceeding much faster  than expected. 
However, Goddard Space Flight Center’s  Dr. Donald Heath, who had mon- 
itored the  satellite  recordings for  several  years,  said  he was  uncertain of  the 
reason  for  the  ozone  decline.  In  addition  to  the  theory  that  fluorocarbons 
caused ozone depletion,  some  scientists blamed the depletion on the sulfur 
compounds  and  other  particles  ejected  into  the  stratosphere  in   the  1982 
eruption of  E l  Chichon  in Mexico. And Heath said there were other possible 
explanations,  such  as  the  sunspot  cycle,  which was  then  near  a  minimum. 
According  to  a  study  by  NASA  scientists,  the  chemical  reactions  that  pro- 
duced stratospheric ozone were stimulated by a  form  of  ultraviolet radiation 
that became weak  when  sunspots were fewest. 
Even  under  normal conditions  the  ozone  layer was  subject to wide  varia- 
tions,  so  it was  difficult to  establish  that  the  recent depletion  was  part  of  a 
long-term  trend.  Heath  also  pointed  out  that  it was  not  clear  whether  the 
Antarctic  readings manifested a  local change in atmospheric circulation or a 
global depletion,  since the condition  of the winter atmosphere over Antarctic 
was  unique. 
Government officials in  1977 imposed a ban on fluorocarbons as spray-can 
propellants,  but  i t  became  evident  that  the  ozone  varied  in   response to  a 
variety  of  interacting natural  and  human  influences.  By  1984  a  National 
Academy  of  Science report estimated fluorocarbon-caused ozone  reduction 
at  only  2 to 4%.  (NYT ,  Nov  7/85,  B 2 1 )

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

November  19  The  TOMS,  or  Total  Ozone  Mapping Spectrometer,  aboard 
Nimbus-7 made  measurements  the  previous  week  indicating  that  the  gas 
cloud ejected from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in  Columbia released twice 
as  much sulfurous gas  into the sky as  the  1980 eruption of Mount St.  Helens 
and five times as much as  the 1982 eruption of Galung-gung in  Indonesia, the 
NY  Times  reported.  Dr.  Arlin  Krueger  of  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center 
said that w i th in  14 hours of the November 13  eruption, the cloud spread over 
an area of 600,000  sq.  km (230,000  sq .   miles). 
NASA  researchers designed TOMS to monitor changes in  earth’s  protective 
ozone  layer,  and  i t  scanned  the  stratosphere  at  a  succession on  ultraviolet 
wavelengths  whose  relative  intensities  provided  an  index  of  ozone  abun- 
dance.  But the TOMS  readings could also identify sulfur dioxide. 
The  sulfur  cloud,  14  hours  after  the  main eruption,  spread  chiefly  to  the 
east,  covering most of Colombia and part of Venezuela. One arm of the cloud 
reached  as  far  south  as  the  equator  in  Colombia  and  as  far  north  as  Lake 
Maracaibo in  Venezuela. 
Because TOMS was  not used for day-today weather forecasting,  i t  was  not 
ordinarily  subjected to  a  rapid-analysis process. As  soon  as  the  Colombian 
eruption  occurred,  however,  Dr.  Krueger and  his colleagues  began to  study 
its  readings. The sulfur dioxide,  he said,  “shows  up very well.” 
Although estimates of the cloud’s volume were preliminary,  Krueger said  i t  
appeared  much  smaller  than  that  formed  by  the  eruption  in   1982  of  El 
Chichon  in  southern Mexico. Visible and  infrared data  from  National  Oce- 
anic and Atmospheric Administration satellites had traced E l  Chichon’s dust, 
which  formed  a  narrow  plume,  through  one  complete  circuit  of  the  globe 
from April 5  to April  15,  1982. 
Although  Nevado del Ruiz’s  sulfur  cloud was  extensive,  i t  d id  not appear 
sufficient,  w i th   its  associated  ash  cloud,  to  have  an  effect  on  climate. 
Whereas E l  Chichon’s  sulfur cloud was  traced around the world,  researchers 
expected del Ruiz to dissipate within days without any severe environmental 
effects.  ( N M ,  Nov  19/85,  A141 

November 20: NASA’s  Wallops Flight Facility announced  it launched at  5:19 
a.m.  today  a  three-stage,  Taurus-Nike-Tomahawk sounding  rocket  that  left 
several  colored clouds  high over  the  mideastern  U.S.  coastline. The objec- 
tive of the experiment was to provide baseline data on expected yielas,  vapor 
expansion velocities,  and other parameters for the chemical release canisters 
for the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES),  scheduled 
for  launch  in  July 1987 from the Space Shuttle. 
The 157-lb. payload ejected balls of greenish-white titanium-boron-barium 
and barium-cupric-oxide at an altitude of 230 statute miles, one as  the rock.et 
ascended  and  one  as  the  payload  descended.  The  barium  clouds  rapidly 
expanded,  while  ejecting  barium  ions  along  the  earth‘s  magnetic  field  to 
form  a visible streak more than  62 miles  long. Another  red titanium-boron-

lithium cloud released at  325 miles expanded to  a diameter of  several hun- 
dred kilometers in  less than a minute. 
Goddard Space  Flight Center‘s  (GSFO Wallops  Range Control  Center  re- 
ceived reports of cloud sightings from as  far  north as Waterville, Maine, as  far 
south as  Wilmington,  North Carolina, and as  far west as  South Bend,  Indiana.

January  11:  Observers  had  anticipated  seeing  the  world’s  first  man-made 
comet 72,000  miles above earth (over the Pacific Ocean west  of  Lima,  Peru) 
the  morning of  December  27,  1984,  the  JPL   Uniwrse reported.  Although 
clouds  obscured  viewing  from  official  ground-observation sites,  scientists 
called the artificial comet a success,  marking another milestone in  the active 
magnetospheric particle tracer explorers (AMPTE) program sponsored by the 
U.S.,  West  Germany,  and  the  United Kingdom.  Mission goal was  to  inject, 
from  a  satellite tracer,  ions  of  lithium and  barium  inside,  outside,  and  just 
w i th in   the  earth’s  magnetosphere (creating the  comet  appearance)  and  to 
detect and monitor these ions with two other satellites as  the  ions convected 
and diffused through the inner magnetosphere. Scientists hoped that this new 
data would improve understanding of the influence and mechanisms of inter- 
action of  the solar w ind  w i th  earth’s  magnetosphere,  including formation of 
the van  Allen Belts. 
A  NASA Convair 990 reported a six-minute viewing;  an Argentine  Boeing 
707 an  eight-minute view.  Overall  intensity of  the  “comet”  was  lower  than 
expected;  the  12,000-  to   20,000-km  tail  was  somewhat  shorter  than  ex- 
pected.  Experimenters withheld other canisters of chemicals aboard the Ger- 
man ion-release module (IRM) for AMPTE experiments later  in  the year. 
GSFC managed the U.S.  portion of the project;  a JPL  mission control team 
operated  the  charge  composition  explorer  (CCE)  spacecraft  to  observe  the 
cloud.  UPL  Universe, Jan 11/85,  1;  GSFC News, Jan 85,  3) 

March 6: NASA announced it awarded a $145.8 m i l l ion  contract to General 
Electric Co.’s  Valley Forge Space Center,  Philadelphia for development of the 
upper atmosphere research satellite (UARS) observatory. Scheduled for Octo- 
ber  1989 deployment  from  the  Space  Shuttle,  the  satellite would  carry  10 
scientific  instruments  into  a  373-mile  circular  orbit.  Valley  Forge  Center 
would  design  the  observatory  system,  design  and  fabricate  an  instrument 
module compatible  w i th   the  NASA  standard  multimission  modular  space- 
craft (MMS), integrate the instrument module with the MMS and flight  instru- 
ments,  test  the observatory  system,  integrate the observatory  into the  Space 
Shuttle,  and support postlaunch flight operations.

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

The UARS, w i th  i t s  remote sensing instruments providing essentially global 
coverage, would for the first time generate data for understanding the compo- 
sition  and  dynamics  of  the  upper  atmosphere,  important  to  solving  many 
questions  about  the  earth‘s  weather  and climate.  For  example,  the observa- 
tory would  provide previously unavailable data on the nature of  natural and 
human effects on earth’s  ozone layer. 
GSFC would provide UARS project management for NASAs office of space 
science and applications. (NASA  Release 85-32) 

March 2 2   NASA  announced  that  the  third  phase  of  the  active  magneto-. 
spheric  particle tracer  explorers  (AMPTE)  magnetotail  probe,  a  U.S.,  West 
German,  and  United Kingdom scientific  experiment  to determine  how  the 
solar w ind   interacted with the earth’s  magnetosphere, was  underway. 
Gilber Ousley,  AMPTE  project  manager  of  Goddard Space  Flight Center 
(GSFC),  said  that  the  first  AMPTE  magnetotail  release  of  barium  occurred 
March  21   at  4:20  a.m.,  EST  and  that  the  release  conditions  had  been well 
w i th in  established criteria. The German ion release module spacecraft imme- 
diately  detected  a  magnetic  field  change  as  expected.  The  satellite  would 
make one additional  release  of  barium and  two of  lithium (the tracers) into 
the earth’s magnetotail. The U.S.  satellite would analyze the charged-particle 
space  environment  around  the  magnetotail to determine the  effects on  the 
environment of the  injected elements. 
Ousley  also  said  that  all  ground  stations except the  one  in  Argentina  re- 
ported clear weather and that the observatory a t  K i n  Peak,  Arizona,  reported 
visual sighting w i th  the naked eye for about 20  minutes. The airborne NASA 
Convair 990  and Argentine Boeing 707 observation aircraft had recorded the 
event. 
The  first  phase  of  the  AMPTE  project  had  consisted  of  lithium  releases 
September  11  and  20 ,   1984,  into  solar  wind  outside  the  earth’s  magneto- 
sphere  about  70,000  miles above  the  Pacific Ocean off  the  coast  of  Lima, 
Peru.  Results  of  the  experiment  indicated  that  the  artificial  comet  was 
“eroded”  by the solar w ind  much faster than  previously anticipated. 
The  only  scheduled AMPTE  experiment  remaining after  the  March-April 
releases was  formation July 13 or  14,  1985, of another artificial comet on  the 
opposite flank  of the magnetosphere from  the  December experiment. 
A l l  releases had to satisfy several  criteria,  including clear voice communi- 
cations  between  the  U.S.  AMPTE  science  data  center  located  at  Johns 
Hopkins University’s Applied  Physics Lab and the German Space Operations 
Center in West Germany,  where German scientists gathered to view the data. 
The  latter  sent  the  command  for  release  through  their  center  and  NASA‘s 
Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network.

/ u l y   77:  Dr.  Mario Acuna,  project  scientist  at  Goddard  Space  Flight Center 
(GSFC), announced that the Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer  Explorers 
(AMPTE) project, an international scientific experiment to determine how the 
solar w ind  interacted w i th  the earth’s magnetosphere, would  produce on July 
18  or  20  a t  midnight EDT  the world’s  second  artificial  comet.  In the  fourth 
and  final  phase  of  the  project,  a  West  German  satellite  would  release  at 
70,000  miles  above  earth  two  barium  canisters  into  the  solar  wind  on  the 
flank  of  the  earth‘s  magnetosphere. The  release would  create  an  artificial 
comet  expected  to  be visible  in  the  southwestern  United  States  to  the  un- 
aided eye  for  approximately four minutes. 
In the first phase of the AMPTE project,  the West German satellite released 
September  1984  lithium  into  the  solar  wind  outside  the  earth’s  magneto- 
sphere.  Preliminary results of that experiment  indicated that  less  than  1%  of 
the  solar w ind  gained access to the  magnetosphere under the conditions  in  
which the  releases took  place. 
In the second phase,  the German satellite created on December 27,  1984, a 
barium  cloud on the flank  of  the earth’s  magnetosphere about  70,000  miles 
above the Pacific Ocean off the coast  of  Peru.  Data from the artificial comet 
indicated that the solar w ind  eroded it much faster than scientists had antici- 
pated. 
Releases on March 21  and May  13,  1985,  of  barium and  lithium  into the 
earth’s  rnagnetotail region ended the third phase of the AMPTE experiments. 
Acuna said of those releases,  ”Although,  disappointingly,  no tracer  ions were 
detected  by  the  U.S.  satellite  (Charge Composition  Explorer)  located  inside 
the magnetosphere, this fact  i s  in itself a very significant result.  It implies that 
fundamental  revisions to our  current models of  the  magnetosphere need  to 
be made to account for these negative observations.”  (NASA Release 85-105) 

November 4: A team of Jet Propulsion Laboratory UPL)  researchers  launched 
on  November  4,  as  part  of  the  Balloon-borne  Laser  In-situ  Sensor  (BLISS) 
experiment,  a  10.2-million-cubic-foot  balloon  carrying  a  microprocessor- 
controlled  payload that  produced vertical  profile measurements of  nitrogen 
dioxide,  water  vapor,  and  nitric  oxide  concentrations  at  115,000  and  then 
90,000  feet  in altitude, the JPL Universe reported. When  researchers  left JPL 
for  Palestine, Texas,  to conduct the research,  they expected to return home in  
three weeks.  But two hurricanes, a cancelled insurance policy, and a balloon 
failure-which  caused  JPCs  instrument-laden gondola to  be dumped  in the 
mud  in  a prison camp-extended 
the trip to  11  weeks. 
The researchers used two balloons,  each  large enough to enclose an entire 
football  field,  to  l i f t  scientific payloads  into the  atmosphere. At  launch,  the 

79 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

balloons stood about 600 feet  high and were about 70 feet across;  at cruising 
altitude they expanded to about 420 feet. 
A  balloon’s  3000-lb.  payload  included two types  of  lasers,  a  TV  carntm, 
and  a  retroreflector suspended  by  a  steel  cable  one-third  mile  below  the 
gondola  after  the  balloon  reached  cruising  altitude.  The  optically  tracked 
retroreflector-swinging 
like  a  pendulum-bounced 
infrared  laser  beams 
through the atmosphere and back to the payload’s  receiving optics.  “We  use 
l iqu id  helium  to  cool  the  lasers  and  our  supply  only  lasts  a  day,”  said  Dr. 
Christopher Webster,  principal investigator for  the experiment.  “So over  the 
11  weeks we  had to f i l l  the cryostats 220 times.” 
Balloon failures  in scientific  research  occurred  frequently,  mainly due  to 
defects  in   the  thin  plastic  balloon  material  or  because  seams  ripped  out, 
Webster  noted. “This  i s  a serious problem and scientific research i s  definitely 
suffering because of  it,”  he said.  “However,  the payload recovery i s  excellent, 
so  JPL does  not lose i t s  instruments.” 
“The  greatest advantage of a balloon-borne laser  instrument,”  he added,  “is 
that  we  can  obtain  continuous  spectroscopic  analysis  of  the  upper  atmo- 
sphere  in  situ w i th  high sensitivity.”  UPL  Uniwrse, Nov 29/85,  3)

AVIATION 

August  7 :   Fourteen-year-old Todd  Holmes of  Fort Smith,  Arkansas,  unoffi- 
cially became the youngest person to solo  in  a glider,  the  Washington Times 
reported. 
According to Federal Aviation Administration regulations,  a p i lo t  had to be 
14 before he or she could solo in  any  kind of aircraft and 16 to be licensed in  
a passenger-carrying glider or  to fly  a powered aircraft.  The agency d id  not 
keep statistics on who might have been the youngest person ever  to solo. 
Todd,  who  got his glider license on his 14th birthday, said,  “I could’ve done 
i t  two weeks ago,  but I  had to wait until I was  14.”  (W  Times,  Aug 1/85,  4B) 

August  6: Arthur  Smith,  74,  retired chairman of  United Technologies Corp. 
and the originator  of  the  concept  for  water  injection  in  piston engines that 
made major contributions to  the performance of World War  II combat planes, 
died August 6 after a long illness,  the  Washington Times reported. 
Smith retired as  chairman of  United Technologies-then  known as  United 
Aircraft-in  1973. He  had assumed the post 15 months earlier after serving as 
executive vice president,  president,  and chairman of the executive commit- 
tee. 
In  1935,  after  two years  in  the  automotive  industry,  Smith  joined  Pratt & 
Whitney as an experimental test engineer. As  a project engineer, he and a co- 
worker  invented and patented a system for water injection to control detona- 
tion and  increase horsepower  in  aircraft piston engines. The  1938 invention 
increased the  speed of  U.S.  fighter  planes u s e d  during World War  I I   by 40 
mph. 
In 1949 he became chief engineer at  Pratt & Whitney  and helped develop 
the  J57,  which  powered  the  F-100  fighter,  the  first  production  aircraft  to 
exceed  the  speed  of  sound  in   level  flight.  Smith  became  president of  the 
company  i n  1967.  (W  Times, Aug 8/85,  78) 

December20  The US. Air Force’s Aeronautical Systems Div.  (ASD) issued in  
December  a  request  for  proposals to  supply  a  wide-body  jet  aircraft  to  re- 
place two aircraft known as  Air  Force One, which was  used by the president 
and his staff,  the Air Force Systems Command’s (AFSC) Newsreview reported. 
Current  candidates  included  the  Douglas  DC-10  and  Boeing‘s  747SP  and 
747-300.  The Air  Force  planned  to  award  a  contract  for  the  plane  by  May 
1986. Military Airlift  Command’s  89th  Military Airlift Wing a t  Andrews Air 
Force Base would receive the first jumbo jet in late 1988;  the second in  1989. 
Existing Air  Force One aircraft were deficient in  three basic ways,  Air  Force 
officials  said.  They  were  getting  more  difficult  to  maintain;  they  were  so 
crammed w i th  equipment  that  there was  no  room for  new communications 
equipment, an emergency medical treatment facility,  or improved work areas 

81 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985  

for the president and staff and they d id  not meet Federal Aviation Administra- 
tion  (FAA) standards and had limited performance, especially  range. 
The Air  Force said the new aircraft must be certified by the FAA,  have three 
or more engines,  and be a model that had at  least two years of airline service 
time.  “The  two-year  in-service requirement guarantees a performance record 
w i l l  be available to evaluate the  maturity of aircraft design  relative to  safety, 
reliability, and maintainability,”  said Col.  Robert Black,  program manager of 
ASD’s  Deputy for  Airlift and Trainer Systems.  Other Air  Force One perform- 
ance requirements under evaluation would call for the aircraft to take off from 
a 9,300-foot  runway and  fly  6,000  nautical  miles  nonstop. The  new  plane 
had  to  have  a  minimum  cruising  speed  of  about  5 2 8   mph  while  flying 
between 36,000  and 45,000  feet and a high-speed cruise capability of about 
575 mph. 
O n  the  new Air  Force One the president and staff would  have state-of-the- 
art communications complete with secure voice terminals and cryptographic 
equipment for writing and deciphering classified messages. The cabin areas 
would  provide seating for  8 0  passengers and  23   crew  members;  and  presi- 
dential accommodations would  consist of an office,  stateroom,  and adjacent 
dressing room and  lavatory. 
Other  features would be a  conference room;  guest,  staff,  press,  and Secret 
Service compartments; and a  complete medical  treatment  facility.  Onboard 
galleys would allow stewards to prepare and serve about 50  meals from each 
galley.  (AFSC Newsreview,  Dec 2 0 / 8 5 ,  4)

lanuary  24:  NASA  announced  that  its  anonymous  and  voluntary  Aviation 
Safety  Reporting  System  (ASRS),  managed  by  Ames  Research  Center,  had 
evaluated  some  42,000  incident  reports  in  eight  years  and  had  issued 805  
alert bulletins and 2 8   research reports to improve airway safety.  Designed and 
implemented by  NASA  in  1976 at the  request of the Federal Aviation Admin- 
istration (FAA), ASRS  gave  pilots and  flight  controllers a  means of  reporting 
incidents that would otherwise have passed unnoticed,  resulting in  revisions 
to both air  traffic control  procedures and  FAA  regulations. NASA  served  as  a 
neutral  third  party  in operating  the  system,  protecting the  confidentiality of 
those who  reported.  In addition,  FAA  could grant participants limited immu- 
nity from disciplinary  action except in cases of accident or criminal conduct. 
The system  had  identified, for example,  the need for  more flight-controller 
help  to general aviation  pilots operating at  night over  unfamiliar  terrain and 
restriction of  cockpit  conversation  and  activity  in  transport  aircraft  flying 
below  10,000  ft.  The  system  had  also  produced  a  number  of  changes  in 
airline, military,  and general aviation pilot flight  training based  on  real flight

ASRS  received about 500 incident reports a month; experienced pilots and 
controllers  screened  these  to  identify existing  safety  problems and  forecast 
future  problems and trends,  and NASA  used the data  for  safety  research for 
FAA,  the  National Transportation Safety  Board,  Department of  Defense, and 
other  government agencies. ASRS  issued a monthly safety bulletin and also 
alert bulletins for  hazards needing rapid response.  (NASA Release 85-12) 

During January: NASA announced that  its new findings on the nature of high-

flightdata recorders, could eventually lead to CAT prediction, enabling pilots 
to fly around the  invisible wind swirls. 
The findings  provided the  f irs t   detailed description of  hazardous,  clear-air 
turbulence,  a series of swirls or vortices of air embedded in  upper-level w ind  
streams  at  altitudes  between  35,000  and  40,000  feet.  The  findings  also 
showed that  a  jet  traveling at  500 mph flew  through  a singlevortex  core  in  
about  one  second.  During  that  second,  the  wind  would  push  the  plane 
upward and then down,  exerting the weight of an extra G (a measurement of 
gravity) on passengers. Planes might encounter two to four vortices in succes- 
sion about four seconds apart,  possibly causing injury to flight attendants and 
passengers without  fastened seat  belts. 
Ames  Research  Center  investigators had  found  that  the  strongest vortices 
occurred a t   about  2 5   miles downwind of  large thunderstorms or  mountain 
ranges,  which caused a swell  in the  upper-level w ind  stream,  and that wind 
shears  formed  vortices at  the  tropopause,  the  boundary  between the  tropos- 
phere  and  the  stratosphere.  At  the  tropopause,  higher-velocity jet  streams 
traveled  just  above  lower-speed windstreams,  the  difference  in  the  speeds 
forming a w ind   shear.  The  investigators had  verified that  wind-shear  layers, 
pushed up over  a thunderstorm or a mountain range,  acted like ocean waves 
when  forced  to  rise over  an  obstacle.  The air would  form a series of  swells 
that turned to waves that curled like those on the sea. They would continue to 
curl until they formed complete circles or vortices that whirled at high speeds 
before disintegrating. 
As  a  result of  i t s   research,  NASA  hoped one day  to  be able to give  pilots 
better  indications  of  when  and  where  they  might  encounter  the  vortices.

February 27:  In  its just-released annual  ’Aviation Forecasts,”  which  covered 
FY  85-86, 
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  forecasted  healthy 
growth for the nation’s major air carriers in  the next dozen years and slow but 
steady growth  for  general aviation (private and business flying). 
The agency noted that U.S.-certificated air carriers had recorded passenger 
gains  in  each of the  previous three years and  in FY 84 achieved their  largest 

8 3  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

operating profit i n  history-$2  billion. The FAA  said airlines, over the  12-year 
forecast period, would  increase passenger enplanements at better than 4.5%) 
annually,  from  336  m i l l ion   in   FY  84  to  573  m i l l ion   in   FY  96.  Commutelr 
airlines had  increased passenger boardings 14%  in  FY 84,  a figure expected 
to more than double during the forecast period to 54.2  m i l l ion  in  FY 96. 
The FAA  expected the general-aviation fleet to  increase from  213,300  air- 
craft  in  1984 to 270,500  in  1996,  an  annual growth  rate of 2% .  
FAA   projections  for  takeoffs  and  landings  at  airports  with  FAA  control 
towers indicated an  increase from  57  to 92 million,  as  the number of aircraft 
handled  by  the  agency’s  en  route control  facilities would  rise from  31.6  to1 
45.7  million. (FAA  Release 8-85) 

During March: A panel organized b y  the National Academy  of  Engineering i n  
conjunction w i th  the National  Research Council  (NRC) published i t s  assess- 
ment of aviation technology in,  “The Competitive Status of the Civil Aviation 
Manufacturing Industry,”  the  NRC  Newsreview reported. 
U.S.  aircraft manufacturers in  the  past had been particularly successful  i n  
translating  advanced  technology  into  products  suited  to  the  marketplace; 
however,  as  competition  intensified,  the timing of the introduction  and the fit 
of the product to  customers’ needs had become increasingly important. Euro- 
pean countries had tried  repeatedly to create a viable air transport manufac- 
turing  industry;  in  1970 their efforts were  realized  in  the  creation  of Airbus 
Industrie, which drew on the  resources  of  many  companies i n  a number of 
countries. Those foreign companies created a  dilemma for  U.S.  manufactur- 
ers,  whose product lines were not extensive. Furthermore, U.S.  markets were 
relatively open  t o  competitors,  while  many  foreign  markets were  closed  to 
Ame r ican-made products. 
The  panel  foresaw  a  need  for  U.S.  manufacturers to  form  international 
partnerships, especially as  the U.S.  aircraft industry was often  in  virtual com- 
petition w i th   governments as  well  as  with  private  commercial  companies. 
And  the  panel  determined  that  U.S.  manufacturers had  to  be  even  more 
sensitive i n  interpreting the needs of foreign customers. 
The panel d id  conclude that i t  was possible to further  improve reliability of 
aircraft and air travel,  as  well as  increase efficiency i n  fuel consumption and 
operations. Studies cited by the panel  indicated that a variety  of technologi- 
cal changes  together could  improve fuel efficiency by as  much as  30-50%. 
Introduction  of  advanced turboprops or  propfans could provide up to  20% 
additional  improvement,  and  the  experimental  unducted  propfan  engine 
could  raise that figure. 
In the  technology  area  of advanced structures,  the  panel viewed  the  U.S. 
and Europe as  on a par  in  developing this technology. Although  the U.S.  led 
in  application experience,  Europe threatened the U.S.  position. In propulsion 
technology,  the panel saw  the U.S.  lead as  not unassailable; Rolls Royce was 
the principal  foreign competitor,  and the U.K.  was committed to maintaining 

84 

Aviation 

a comparative position with  the  U.S.  The  panel rated U.S.  R&D facilities as 
the best  in  the world,  European facilities as adequate,  and Japanese facilities 
as  handicapping  their  efforts  to  benefit  from  technological  developments.

lune  17:  The  Air  Transport Association  reported  that  a  record  343  m i l l ion  
passengers and five rnillion  tons of cargo traveled  without a single passenger 
fatality  on  5.4  m i l l ion   scheduled  jet  airline  flights  in   1984.  The  industry 
achieved a  1984 net profit of more than  $800 million,  after  losses  for  three 
consecutive years.  The  year‘s  operating  profit was  a  record  $2.2  b i l l ion  on 
revenues  of $44 billion. 
Other facts  noted  in  the  association‘s  annual  report  included  lengthened 
airline passenger trips (average passenger trip  length was  887 miles,  up from 
785  miles  10 years  previously), average  passenger‘s  cost was  12.1  cents  per 
m i le  (compared with  11.6  cents  in  1983 and  12.3  cents  in   19811,  airlines  in  
1984 accounted  for  more than  88% of  the  intercity public passenger  traffic 
miles  in  the  U.S.  (up from  80%  in   19741,  and  Chicago’s  OHa re  was  the 
busiest  passenger  airport  in  the  country,  handling more  than  45.7  m i l l ion  
people (New York‘s  J F K  airport handled the most air cargo,  1.3  m i l l ion  tons).

lune   1 9  Responding to a suggestion made by  President Reagan  at a June 19 
press conference that the U.S.  expand i t s  sky marshal force for use on interna- 
tional flights, Thomas  Pyle,  speaking for the  International Air Transport Asso- 
ciation,  said  security  experts  found  little  merit  in   the  suggestion,  the  NY 
Times reported. “We’re  not happy about anybody having guns up in  the air,“ 
he  said.  “There’s  a  distinct  danger  to  passengeh and  a  bigger  danger  of 
damage  to  the  aircraft.”  Pyle did acknowledge  that  there  might  be  special 
occasions,  including cases  of known threats  to  particular flights,  when  mar- 
shals would be needed. 
Richard  Lally,  security  chief  for  the  association  representing U.S.  airlines 
and for  the  Federal Aviation Administration from  1974 to  1982,  agreed  w i th  
Pyle’s  assessment.  “It  i s   not  an  answer  to  the  problem and  introduces  an 
impression that  it is.  I t  provides for a very dangerous situation.” 
The views expressed by  Pyle and  Lally  reflected the consensus of security 
experts  that  the  best  place  to  head  off  hijackings was  on  the  ground.  (N Y

luly 26: NASA  would once again be one of  the chief exhibitors at  the  33rd 
annual Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) International Fly-in July 26 to 
August  2  a t   Oshkosh,  Wisconsin,  the  Langley  Researcher  reported.  NASA 
would  broaden  i t s   exhibit,  “The  Shape  of  Things  To  Come,”  which  was 
traditionally  only aeronautical,  to  include a greater  representation of  i t s   ac-

A 60  x  90-foot tent would  house displays of NASA’s  research and technol- 
ogy development work  in aeronautics, the  space  station,  Space Shuttle,  and 
space  exploration.  Langley  Research  Center  and  Ames  Research  Center 
would  provide aeronautical exhibits,  Lewis  Research Center would  provide 
aeropropulsion and space exhibits, Goddard Space Flight Center would  have 
its search  and  rescue satellite van  on  hand,  and Johnson Space Center and 
Marshall Space  Flight Center would  exhibit  material on space  research. As- 
tronauts  Robert Gibson  and  Robert  Overmeyer would  be  EAA  guests  and 
would  participate in   a  program  the  evening  of  July 29.  Two  dozen  NAS,A 
forum  speakers would  give  presentations covering every  aeronautical disci- 
pline. 
Each  year  for  the  last  several  years  about  100,000  people  and  10,000 
privately owned light airplanes were at Oshkosh for the exhibition. Organiz- 
ers  also  scheduled  the  British Airways  Concorde  to  make  special  fly-bys 
during the afternoon air shows.  (LaRC Researcher, July 26/85,  3) 

lu ly  26:  Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole announced the 
award of  a $196.9  m i l l ion  contract  to  IBM to  provide new-generation com- 
puters that would give controllers extra capacity to handle growing air traffic 
safely and efficiently  i n  the coming decade.  Under the contract,  IBM would 
replace  the  computer  systems  in   the  nation’s  20  air  route  traffic  control 
centers. Contract options for  future hardware maintenance and software and 
technical support,  i f  exercised,  could total an  additional  $235.1  million. 
In  making  the  announcement,  Dole  said  that  “existing  computers  are 
based  on  outmoded  technology  . .  .  The  new computer w i l l   have the  ca- 
pacity to assume added functions-such  as  improved conflict detection and 
resolution-permitting 
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  to  make 
more efficient use of controllers.”  And  it would provide a vehicle for a stable 
transition to an  advanced automation program in  the future. 
The  new  computers  would  have  greater  storage  capacity  than  the  IBM 
9020s used since  the early  1970s in  FAA  centers,  which control  a l l   aircraft 
operating under instrument flight  rules between the nation’s  airport terminal 
areas. 
The FAA awarded the contract to I BM  following a 21-month design compe- 
tition with the Sperry Corp. The FAA  based the selection on a number of cost 
and performance factors  including the  results of  a “compute  o f f  at  the FAA 
Technical Center  near Atlantic  City,  New jersey.  A  key  factor  in  the  sideby- 
side evaluation was the capability of each computer system to run the current 
9020 software package w i th  minimum modifications. 
K e y   element  in   the  IBM hardware was  the  IBM  3080-BX1  model.  Each 
installation would consist of two  units with one serving as  the primary proc- 
essor  and the other as  a backup. 
The  contract  called  for  IBM to  deliver  the  new  computer  systems  over  a 
oneyear period beginning  in the summer of  1986 to air  route traffic control

centers including the FAA Technical Center and the FAA  Aeronautical Center 
where  the  computer  system  would  be  used  for  training purposes.  (FAA  Re-

l u l y   2 9   U.S.,  Indian,  and  Canadian  officials were  estimating  the  cost  of 
raising portions of the wreckage of the Air-India Boeing 747 that crashed June 
2 3   into the Atlantic  off  Ireland,  Aviation  Week  reported.  Lack  of  significant 
data on either the cockpit voice recorder or the flight data recorder, recovered 
July 10 and July 11,  respectively,  by a  remotely controlled  submersible vehi- 
cle,  stalled  the  investigation  into the  cause of  the crash until more  informa- 
tion became available. Raising portions of the wreckage seemed the only way 
to accomplish this. 
After  a British ship  initially surveyed  the  sea  bed where the wreckage  lay, 
the  Canadian  ship  John Cabot  completed  a  second  sonar  survey  of  that 
portion of the ocean floor.  Officials later said wreckage of  the aircraft could 
be identified only as  “lumps.” 
Officials said they had not determined the cost of raising the wreckage or a 
significant part of  it,  but knew  it to  be high. Although  responsibility for  the 
accident  investigation  legally belonged to  India, the  U.S.  and Canada-both 
parties to  the  investigation-might  contribute funds to the salvage operation.

Augus t2   In  a letter to the editor  i n  the N Y  Times,  Saunders Kramer,  a Fellow 
of  the American Astronautical  Society,  commented on the  N Y  Time’s  report 
of speculation in  a London newspaper that debris from a satellite  reentering 
the atmosphere may have struck the Air-India jetliner that crashed in  July [see 
Aviation/Civil  Aviation,  July 291.  “You  dismiss  that  possibility as  ’bizarre,”’ 
Kramer wrote,  “Not  quite.” 
Kramer then  related a tale of an  incident that occurred in  the early  1960s, 
when  passengers on a airline flight  from  Honolulu to Tokyo  saw  at  30,000 
feet a white flash and heard a thud. 
‘After  they  landed at  Tokyo,  inspection  revealed a  smooth dished-in area 
(about 18  inches across) on the plane’s  right wing  leading edge between the 
two starboard engines:’  Kramer continued. There was  no evidence of  a  bird 
cot1 i s  ion. 
When  the  navigator  returned  home,  he  related  the  tale  to  Kramer,  who 
checked North American Air  Defense Command‘a  (NORAD) space-tracking 
data bulletins, which showed reentry of satellite debris at the time and loca- 
tion of  the Pan  Am  flight.  “We  concluded that the debris  had  indeed struck 
the plane:’  Kramer wrote. 
“The  propulsion section of the  las t  stage of a satellite booster i s  frequently 
massive enough to survive reentry. Had  i t  struck  the  tail  section  severely  or 
struck  the  cockpit  from  above,  it  i s  certainly conceivable,  however  remote, 

87

that destruction of the aircraft could have  been  instantaneous,"  Kramer con- 
cluded.  ( N M ,  Aug 2/85,  A241 

August  2  Federal  investigation  of  the  Delta  Air  Line  Lockheed  L-1011-1 
crash August  2  at  DalladFt. Worth  International Airport  showed  strong evi- 
dence of  w ind   shear  and  microburst  in the  aircraft's  landing path,  Aviation 
Week  reported,  which  raised  issues  concerning the  adequacy  of  detection 
and training of pilots to respond to  violent weather.  The Delta TriStar crashed 
at 6:05 p.m.  CDT on final approach to  runway 17L after entering a suddenly 
developed violent thunderstorm  cell that eluded detection by  ground-based 
sensors and was  not reported by  pilots. 
The  problems  p o s e d   by  w ind   shear  would  force  the  government  in  the 
following weeks  to deal with  procurement of  Doppler  radar systems  (which 
the  Federal Aviation Administration successfully tested  as  a wind-shear and 
microburst  detector),  regulations  requiring  simulator  training  and  cockpit 
resource management instructions  to  prepare pilots for w ind  shear,  and en- 
hancement  of  the  lowlevel,  wind-shear  alert  system  (LLWAS)  to  broaden 
coverage  of the detection system. 
Rep. Mickey Edwards (R.-Okla.)  had called for  investigations to go beyond 
the  direct  cause  of  the  Delta  accident  to  "basic  airline  and  government 
operating  procedures  and  priorities"  in  responding  to  weather  hazards.

August  2 6  The  investigation  into the August  12  crash in  a remote mountain 
area  of a Japan Air  Lines Boeing 747-100SR  after  it  lost most of  its vertical 
stabilizer and rudders focused on damage i n  the aft pressure bulkhead of the 
aircraft, Aviation  Week reported. Japan's Aircraft Accident  Investigation Com- 
mittee said it was attempting to determine whether the bulkhead damage was 
caused by a crack or cracks that existed in the bulkhead, by explosive decom- 
pression in  the cabin, or by the crash impact. The Boeing Co. said inspections 
as  of August  19 of the aft pressure shell of 43  Boeing 747 aircraft showed no 
evidence of cracks. 
In  addition  to  cracks  in   the  bulkhead,  lower  ends  of  5  of  18  triangular 
panels, or gores,  were buckled toward the rear.  Boeing Co.  had replaced 9 of 
the  18 panels after the aircraft was  involved i n  a hard  landing June 2,  1978. 
Further optional  or mandated inspections of the wide-body  transport fleet 
stalled the  previous week  due  to  lack of  information  on damage to  the JAL 
aircraft.  Information  from  Japan was  sparse,  partly  because  of  restrictions 
placed on access  to the wreckage and  because of damage done to some of 
the  vital  evidence  by  members of  the  rescue  team.  Rescuers  had  cut  the 
bulkhead into pieces and removed them to clear the way  for  rescue.  Boeing's 
accident  investigation team  had not been able to make a close inspection of 
the bulkhead by  the previous week.

One of the few pieces of evidence-damage  to the vertical fin-led  Boeing 
to   suggest  that  Boeing  747 operators  inspect the  f in   and  rudder  structure. 
And  reports that a depressurization occurred prompted the company to sug- 
gest  inspection of the external and aft portion of the pressure shell structure. 
The  Federal  Aviation  Administration declined  to  take  action  pending  r e  
ceipt of more information.  (AvWk, Aug 26/85,  28) 

August  26: At  least  54  persons were  killed and  83  injured  when  a  Boeing 
737-200  operated by  British Airtours aborted its takeoff,  ran off the  runway, 
and  caught  fire  at  Manchester  International Airport  in  northern  England, 
Aviation Week  reported. Manchester Airport officials said the pilot radioed as 
he  approached  rotation speed  that  he was  having trouble  with  one  of  his 
engines. Then the aircraft  rolled off the side of the runway causing the fuse- 
lage to break.  Fire quickly gutted the aircraft. 
British Airtours Flight KT 328,  en route to the Greek island of  Corfu, carried 
a fu l l   load of fuel  plus  131 passengers and a crew of s ix .   Most of those who 
died were  in  the rear section of the aircraft.  Two crew members were among 
the dead,  but both the p i lo t  and copilot survived. 
Loss of  life was  reduced because the Boeing 737 skidded to a halt near the 
airport's fire station,  and all seven of the airport's  firefighting vehicles were on 
the  scene within  minutes.  Firemen were able to  rescue many of the passen- 
gers,  although a secondary explosion during the  rescue attempt injured  two 
of the firemen.  (AvWk, Aug 26/85,  28) 

September 2: Loss  of  13  commercial aircraft  hulls since January, including 
four wide-body  transports,  totaled $318 m i l l ion  and exceeded hu l l  losses  in  
any previous year,  Aviation  W k  reported. The wide-body  losses  included a 
UTA Boeing 747-300,  which burned March 1985 on the ground  in  Paris,  an 
$85 m i l l ion  loss;  an Air-India Boeing 747-200B;  a Delta Air Lines Lockheed 
L-1011-1;  and a Japan Airlines  Boeing 737-100SR.  Observers expected this 
to  result in  increased airline insurance premiums, the third round of increases 
since  heavy  hu l l   losses  i n   1982  and  1983  and  the  onset  of  large  liability 
awards  in  U.S.  courts. 
Insurance officials also predicted the year's  losses would narrow capacity in  
the  insurance market,  meaning airlines could negotiate for  insurance,  but i t  
would be harder to  get and at  higher rates.  Payouts from  hu l l  losses already 
incurred had exceeded total premiums paid plus any  interest income gained 
from  investment,  although  interest  rates  were  low  and  produced  compara- 
tively  little income. 
Premium  rates  on  a  world  scale  averaged  a  45%  increase  in   1984  and 
would probably  rise another 15%  in 1985. Also,  the  levels at which deducti- 
ble insurance became effective would  likely double. Most policies signed  in 
1984 increased the deductible  from  $250,000  to $500,000  for  narrow-body 

89 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

aircraft and from $600,000  to $1 m i l l ion  for wide-body aircraft. This was part 
of  a  long-term  trend  toward  airlines  self-insuring  for  the  first  few  m i l l ion  
dollars of  liability. 
Of  greatest  concern  to  insurance  officials was  the  rise  of  average  settle- 
ments for  passenger fatalities in  the U .S . ,  which averaged $450,000  in  1979, 
$650,000  i n  1982,  and would  likely  rise to  between $800,000  and  $1   mil- 
lion, the officials believed. The average settlement in  the rest of the world was 
approximately $50,000  but varied considerably.  (AvWk, Sept 2/85,  34) 

September  6  Air  safety  experts,  flight  attendants,  and  some  members  of 
Congress were  complaining  that  the emergency evacuation tests  run  by  air- 
lines had little resemblance to a real accident,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  regulations  required  that  all  jetliners 
pass an evacuation test that showed a  planeful of passengers could be evacu- 
ated  in  90  seconds.  Such tests  determined how many seats a plan must have 
in   relations  to  the  number  of  exits.  However,  flight  attendants typically  re- 
hearsed several days  for  the  tests  in  which  there was  no smoke,  no fire,  no 
elderly  participants, or children. 
Federal  regulations  didn't  prohibit  manufacturers  from  using  their  own  
employees  for  the  tests,  although  no  "passenger"  could  rehearse  for  the 
evacuation.  Although  regulations  required  a  certain  percentage of  elderly 
persons  or  children  for  the  tests,  FAA  officials  said  they  often  waived  the 
requirement because of concerns that they might be  injured. 
Rep. James Oberstar (D-Minn.), whose U .S .   House public works and trans- 
portation subcommittee on investigations and oversight monitored the  FAA, 
said that changes i n  the FAA's handling of evacuation requirements were long 
overdue.  "We've  got  . . . no uniformity,  just  sort of a haphazard approach 
to rule making and safety,  and lives of people are at stake,"  he said. Rep.  Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.)  of  the  same  subcommittee called the approach to  evacua- 
tion  taken  by  the  FAA  and  industry  "just  totally  out  of  touch  w i th   the  real 
world. " 
The  controversy over  the  adequacy of  evacuation  requirements had  sim- 
mered for months since the FAA  permitted the Boeing Co. to eliminate two of 
ten  exit doors on  i t s   747 jumbo  jet.  Boeing officials convinced  the  FAA  to 
allow elimination of  the  two over-wing emergency doors on the  plane,  be- 
cause  federal  regulations required two doors for every  110  seats and none of 
the  747s w i th  sealed doors would carry more than 440 seats. 
The  FAA's  Seattle office, which  handled certification of  large commercial 
aircraft,  approved the change without  a  test to see  whether  passengers actu- 
ally  could  evacuate  the  plane  within  90  seconds  and  instead  relied on  a 
mathematical calculation using o ld  evacuation tests.  Critics complained that 
those tests  were themselves flawed.  ( W  Post,  Sept 6/85,  A211

September 9  A mountain climbing team reached the wreckage of an Eastern 
Airlines  Boeing  747   that  crashed January 1,  1985,  at  19,600  feet  into  Mt. 
lllimani in  the Bolivian Andes and photographed the site for use in  an  investi- 
gation,  Aviation  Week  reported.  Judith Kelly,  wife  of  William  Kelly,  a  U.S. 
Peace Corps official who  died in  the crash,  financed and led the three-person 
expedition  because she  was  concerned  that  the  accident  investigation was 
lagging. 
Photographs of the site showed parts of the tail structure and the fuselage. 
Kelly also collected cable and honeycomb structures identified by part num- 
bers and turned  them over  w i th  the  photos to the  U .S .   National Transporta- 
tion  Safety  Board  (NTSB).  Remains  of  the  29  persons  on  board  were  not 
located. 
The  Kelly team’s  ascent was  the  fourth visit to the site since the crash  and 
prompted  questions over  the  status  of  the  accident  investigation. Although 
Bolivia had  primary  responsibility to  report  the  accident,  government  offi- 
cials said  it was  unlikely Bolivia would  finance an expedition to the site due 
to  lack of funds,  but added  i t  would  not stand  in  the way  of an  investigation 
by the  U .S . ,   which was  the country of aircraft  registry and manufacture. 
Early  i n   January  Bolivian  Bernard0  Guarachi,  who  was  Kelly’s  guide, 
reached the crash site and spent several  hours there,  bringing back pieces of 
wreckage and  luggage tags  identifying the flight. 
A  second  Bolivian  team  in  March  reached the  site and  took  motion pic- 
tures. The f i lm  showed the aircraft wreckage,  including a tail section that was 
torn off the plane,  and scattered cargo and baggage.  The team also found an 
engine  cowling,  a  piece of  the  fuselage  with  the  Eastern  name on  it,  and 
other parts of the tail structure. A team sponsored by the Bolivian  Red  Cross 
spent three days  in  August at  the site,  but was  hindered by  new-fallen snow 
and  lack of guidance on where to  look for technical evidence. 
John Young,  the  NTSB  investigator in  charge,  said  he was  discussing with 
officials  in   the  safety  board’s  accident  investigation  division  whether  the 
safety board should attempt to carry on the  investigation and what approach 
to  take.  Recovery of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder could 
aid i n  determining  navigation procedures the crew were taking. 
Because of  the questions surrounding the crash of the aircraft,  which was 
several miles off course when  i t  struck the mountain 26 miles southeast of La 
Paz  International Airport,  the U.S.  Air  Line Pilots Association was  discussing 
financing an  expedition  to  recover  the  recorders. (AvWk, Sept 9/85,  40) 

September  9  Continental Airlines filed a  reorganization  plan with  the  U .S .  
Bankruptcy  Court  in   Houston  in  which  i t  said  creditors  would  be  repaid 
100%  in   a  combination  of  immediate  cash  and  deferred  payments w i th  
interest,  Aviation  Week  reported.  Cash  payments  would  total  about  $121 
m i l l ion  at the time of court confirmation of the plan,  expected by mid-1986.

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Continental  had  originally  filed  September  24,  1983,  for  protection under 
Chapter  11  or  the bankruptcy  laws. 
"We  have submitted a  plan that w i l l  make whole our obligations to those 
individuals and  companies  that  stood w i th   us  through  the  worst  of  times," 
said Continental Chairman  Frank  Lorenzo. "It's  taken  nearly two years  to do 
it,  but the pieces of the puzzle are almost all  in  place." 
One  missing  piece  in  the  plan  was  provision  for  union  and  employee 
claims.  Continental  asked  the  bankruptcy court to  estimate these  claims,  a 
process that  had been used in  a number of other companies'  bankruptcies. 
Continental  said  i t s   plan  to  repay  i t s   debt  in   five  to  ten  years  had  the 
support of  important creditor groups  including Continental's  banks and  the 
committee  representing Continental's  unsecured creditors.  Included  in  the 
plan was  an  agreement in  principle for  two  groups  of  banks  to  provide the 
airline w i th   $50 m i l l ion   in  revolving credit and equipment  financing facili- 
ties,  which the airline said was  "clear  evidence of the financial community's 
support and confidence"  in  the company. 
Once the  reorganization  plan was  approved  by  the  court,  most  creditors 
were entitled to vote on  it. Even  i f  a creditor class d id  not approve the plan, 
the  bankruptcy  court  could  s t i l l   confirm  i t   i f   the  court  found  it  "fair  and 
equitable"  and that  it did not discriminate against the creditor class.  (AvWk, 
Sept  9/85,  34) 

October 21: The  Canadian  recovery  ship M V  Kreuztrum,  chartered by  the 
U.S.  government,  retrieved from  the Atlantic Ocean the first  piece of wreck- 
age,  a section of fuselage skin  approximately  15  by  30  feet,  of  the Air-India 
Boeing 747 that crashed in  June off Ireland, Aviation Week  reported. Another 
Canadian recovery ship,  the John Cabot equipped with a Scarab 2  underwa- 
ter  search  and  recovery vehicle,  was  also  at  the  site.  The  two  ships  later 
recovered three other sections of the aircraft's  fuselage and were  in  the proc- 
ess of lifting a fifth section. Recovery team members said they had confronted 
no serious problems but that the work was  timeconsuming. 
The Scarab 2  itself lifted a smaller second piece of wreckage;  highcapacity 
winches  on  the  Kreuztrum  lifted  two  other  sections.  Officials  said  i t   w a s  
taking 18  to 24  hrs to  lift each piece of wreckage. 
The ships'  crews  recovered the  larger pieces by  using four clamps that the 
Scarab  2  attached  to  each  corner of  a  piece.  Scarab  2  could take  only  two 
clamps down during a dive,  and a third dive was  necessary to carry down a 
lifting bridle to attach to the four clamps and a lift line to attach to the bridle. 
This method made  i t  possible to  raise  large sections w i th  as  l i t t le  additional 
damage as  possible. 
"Since  i t  takes two hours for the Scarab to dive to the 6,700-foot  depth,  two 
hours to do its work,  and another three hours to swim back to the surface,"  a 
recovery official said,  "it's  going to take some time."

Recovery officials believed wreckage  retrieved as of the previous week  was 
from  the  fuselage both  fore  and  a f t  of  the  wing,  and  they  were  working to 
locate i t s  position on the aircraft structure. They believed the fifth piece being 
recovered was  a primary fuselage structure,  including ribs and skin. 
Recovery  officials  said  they  established  a  two-tier  priority  system  for  the 
order  in  which they recovered wreckage. They gave top priority to pieces that 
were  likely to  confirm or  refute primary theories on  the  cause  of  the  crash. 
Secondary priority was  given to pieces considered likely to contain evidence 
of  what  occurred  to  cause  the  aircraft  to  break  up  in   flight.  Early  efforts 
focused on fuselage structure. 
The officials had located the a f t  pressure bulkhead of the Air-India 747  and 
scanned it w i th  TV cameras,  but said  ”there  i s  nothing visible to indicate any 
common  problem”  w i th   the  August  crash  of  a  Japan Air  Lines  474 .   Plans 
called for  raising this bulkhead section toward the end of the recovery opera- 
tion.  (AvWk, Oct 21/85,  32) 

October 22: Northwest Airlines  Inc. completed  an  agreement today  to  pur- 
chase  10 Boeing 747-400s  as  part of a $21  b i l l ion  airplane order,  the  Wash- 
ington  Post  reported,  making  Northwest  the  first  airline  to  have  the 
long-range,  450-seat  747 -400 .   Northwest president Steven  Rothmeier,  in  a 
telephone  conversation w i th   the  Post,  said,  “the  747 -400   i s   really the  next 
logical step  in  the  progression of  aircraft  for  the  Pacific  . . .  It‘s  our  belief 
that this plane w i l l  set  the economic structure of the Pacific to the end of the 
century.”  Northwest  also  purchased  ten  more  Boeing  757-2OOs,  a  high- 
technology,  twin-engine standard-body aircraft. 
The  747 -400  would be 22%  more fuel efficient than current 747s,  which 
i t  closely  resembled;  however,  it had wings  s ix   feet  longer that  were  tipped 
w i th   “winglets”  that  bent  upward and forward  to  improve aerodynamic effi- 
ciency. 
Digital  instrument displays and  computers would  permit the  747 -400   to 
have a two-pilot cockpit  instead of  the  three-person  flight crew  required for 
current 747s; and the new plane would have a range of  8,000  statute miles- 
the  longest  of  any  commercial  jet-permitting 
i t  to  fly  nonstop  from  New 
York  to Tokyo,  Seoul,  or Shanghai. 
Boeing would  deliver  the  747s  between  December  1988  and  1990;  the 
757s from  1987 through  1989. (WPost, Oct 23/85,  F1) 

Nowmber 7: United Airlines today  placed orders w i th  a  value of  over  $3.1 
b i l l ion   for  up  to  110  737-300s  and  up  to  six  747s,  the  largest  order  ever 
placed  by  an  airline,  Aviation  Daily  reported.  The  previous  record  was  a 
November  12,  1980, order by  Delta for  60 757s valued at $3  billion. 
United President James Hartigan said that the first two 737s and two 747- 
200Bs had a June 1988 delivery date and that ”we  have obtained flexibility  in  

93 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

the  contracts  to  change the  downline  delivery  dates  of  the  later  aircraft  to 
meet our needs.”  He added that the orders were made possible because “we 
reached cost-competitive contracts with all of our work groups. We  are now 
positioned properly for dramatic growth  in  the competitive marketplace.” 
A l l  aircraft should be delivered by the end of  1990, giving United a fleet of 
478 transports. ( N D ,  Nov 8/85,  41) 

December  13:  NASA  announced  that  researchers  at  its  Langley  Research 
Center  (LaRC) were developing use of  pyrotechnic-activated emergency exit 
systems  that  might  save  lives  in  an  emergency situation aboard commercial 
transport ai rc raft. 
Although  pyrotechnic components aboard commercial aircraft might seem 
dangerous,  Laurence Bement,  an aerospace technologist specializing in  p y r e  
technic-activated  aircraft  escape  systems,  pointed  out  that  military  aircraft 
had  used  such escape  systems  for  more than  20  years  and  NASA  had used 
them  i n  their manned spaceflight programs as  far  back as  Project Mercury  in  
the  1960s. The emergency egress  system  he  proposed would  be more  reli- 
able and more effective in aiding the  rapid evacuation of airplanes and more 
cost-effective  than  existing  mechanical  and  electrical  systems.  “What  we 
have done i s  take the best materials and applications from years of pyrotech- 
nic  usage  and  tried  to  assemble  the  best  escape  system,  using  our  past 
experiences,”  Bement said. 
One  U .S .   Air  Force  system,  the  emergency  lifesaving  instant  exit,  used 
pyrotechnic chargers to  sever  a  panel  inside the  aircraft  door.  Another,  the 
NASA  general  aviation  egress  opening  system,  created  by  an  explosion an 
opening  in  the fuselage without modifying the airframe structure. The p y r e  
technic-activated  escape  systems  on  U.S.  armed  forces  planes  had  already 
saved approximately $10  m i l l ion  by avoiding component replacement costs. 
However,  they  added weight  and  complexity  to  the  aircraft and  do   not  in- 
crease the structural efficiency of the airframe. 
To  improve existing systems,  Bement  studied  the  possibility of  replacing 
fuselage skin sections with an explosively severed,  composite material panel. 
Researchers had tested graphite/epoxy and fiberglass composite panels, dem- 
onstrating that  the graphite/epoxy  was  the better material.  Not only was  the 
graphite/epoxy  easier  to  sever  than  the  original  fuselage  material,  but  the 
composite  panel was  much  lighter and  more crashworthy.  Once activated, 
the explosive material severed the panel from the fuselage and jettisoned the 
panel outward.  No debris was  projected inward and no sound or  over-pres- 
sure hazard existed inside the aircraft. 
The  composite  system  was  more  reliable  than  existing mechanical  and 
electrical systems and would  require less maintenance, since the system was 
expected to last at least 15 years.  Bolts would hold the composite panel to the 
primary structure and i t  would be a loadcarrying component, unlike existing 
emergency exits.

Av ia t ion  

Bement estimated that using composite panels w i th  the pyrotechnic system 
could  reduce the  weight  of  existing  emergency  exits  by  30  to  50%.  If the 
airframes were designed to  include the composite panels,  the weight  reduc- 
tions would  be far  greater,  because the  light-weight composite panels were 
capable of carrying  loads,  meaning the  fuselage would  not  require as  much 
support structure around the emergency door frames. 
The explosive  in  the system was  hexanitrostilbene (HVS),  an organic com- 
pound  insensitive to  handling,  impact,  gunfire,  and  lightning and was  unaf- 
fected by 50  hours of exposure to temperatures of 350'  F.  HNS would burn i f  
exposed to  a flame but would not explode. 
Another  advantage of  the compound was  its explosive power;  in  a test  of 
the  Langley  general  aviation  opening  system,  less  than  0.4  ounce  of  the 
compound  was  sufficient to  sever  a  panel  about  30  square  inches.  (NASA

December  16: In a recent report to the U.S.  House Public Works and Trans- 
portation  Committee  and  its  subcommittee  on  aviation,  the  U.S.  General 
Accounting  Office  (GAO)  said  that  deregulation  of  the  U.S. air  transport 
system  had forced carriers to become more efficient and competitive,  lower 
fares,  and  improve services for most travelers, Aviation  Week reported.  How- 
ever,  airlines had dropped  nonstop service  between some  cities,  and  some 
small  communities  had  lost  all  scheduled  air  service.  Most  communities 
receiving  subsidies were  not  progressing toward  self-sustaining  air  service 
and  had  lost  passengers  since  deregulation  began,  the  report  said;  and  i t  
indicated that without legislative action,  many of the small communities with 
subsidized essential air  service would  lose all  scheduled service when  the 
current subsidy ended in  1988. GAO repeated its recommendation that Con- 
gress  consider  giving the  Department of Transportation greater flexibility  to 
increase or decrease subsidies to selected communities. 
The report found the airline industry was  still  in  the process of adapting to 
deregulation w i th   these  trends dominant:  more airlines offering competing 
services;  declines  in   average  fares;  improvements  for  most  passengers  in  
service,  availability,  and  convenience;  and  industry  profitability  improved 
through  increased efficiency and declining unit labor and fuel  costs. 
Travelers between high-traffic,  long-distance city-pairs gained the most from 
deregulation,  as  fares  came closer  to cost;  and competition  fostered greater 
choice  in  fares  and  service.  However,  the  smaller  number  of  passengers 
flying  between  many  light-traffic,  shortdistance  city-pairs  d id   not  benefit 
from  lower fares,  the  report said. 
GAO  predicted that  the  industry would  probably  remain competitive,  al- 
though the number of airlines might decrease  due to bankruptcies and mer- 
gers.  And  the  report  said  the  number  of  large  airports  with  capacity 
limitations on service could  increase from the current 8 to 61  by  the end of 

95 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

the century and that the allocation of  limited airport capacity among compet- 
ing  airlines could offset the benefits of  regulations. (AvWk, Dec 16/85, 33) 

December  31:  In  terms  of  fatalities,  1985 was  the  worst  year  in   aviation 
history,  the  Washington  Post  reported,  as  nearly  2,000 people died  in   36 
accidents. The previous worst year was  1974, when  1,299 people died  in  29 
accidents. 
Among the  1985 aircraft  losses were:  an Air  India jet that disintegrated off 
the Irish coast,  k i l l ing  all 329 on board; a Delta Air  Lines jumbo  jetliner that 
crashed  in   a  violent  thunderstorm  while  approaching  the  Dallas  airport, 
k i l l ing   133; a Japan Air  Lines jet  on a flight  from  Tokyo  to Osaka  that  h i t  a 
mountain,  k i l l ing  520; a British Airways  charter  plane that  burst  into flames 
on  the  runway  i n  Manchester,  England,  k i l l ing  54; a charter  plane carrying 
US. military service members that crashed at Gander,  Newfoundland,  killing 
all  258 on  board;  and a  twinengine  plane  that  crashed  into  the  roof  of  a 
suburban California  shopping mall,  k i l l ing  four  persons and  injuring 88. In 
addition,  hijackers took  over  a TWA  plane on a flight  to  Beirut and  killed a 
passenger. 
The year's  aircraft  losses  resulted  from  pilot error  and  equipment  failure, 
sugar  i n  the  fuel  line  of  one  plane,  and  possibly  a  bomb  in   the  luggage 
compartment of another.  Some blamed the crashes,  i f  only  indirectly,  on the 
1981 firing of the air traffic controllers,  on deregulation, and on the enforce 
ment  role  of  federal  safety  inspectors.  However,  federal  officials  said  that 
there w a s   no common  thread  among the year's  major aviation disasters.  ( W

Human  Powered Aircraft 

February 5:  Langley  Research Center  announced  that John Langford of  the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology would speak  February  11  on  the MIT 
Monarch, a human-powered aircraft that had won first prize May  11, 1984, in  
the Kremer World  Speed Competition. 
An  all-volunteer  team  had designed and  bu i l t  the  craft  in  88 days  during 
the summer of  1983 and had flown i t  29 times before disassembling it. With 
an improved version,  the team had made 35 flights in  spring 1984, culminat- 
ing  in  the  record flight. 
Langford would  discuss  design  consideration  and  construction details  of 
the Monarch,  including propulsion and avionics.  (LaRC Release 85-5) 

Supersonic Transport 

February 25: Lewis Research Center (LeRC) researchers believed their engine 
research,  focusing on development of supersonic combustion ramjet (scram- 

96 

Av ia t ion  

jet)  technology,  would  lead to air-breathing engines capable of operating at 
speeds  through  Mach  12,  Aviation  Week  reported.  Testing  had already  pro- 
duced  net  thrust-todrag  ratios  of  better  than  one  at  high  Mach  numbers. 
Research  included solution  of  engine  aerodynamics,  diagnostics and  mea- 
surement  problems,  and effects of change to  full-scale,  flight-weight engine 
prototypes. 
Although the Reagan Administration budget request for NASA FY 86 hyper- 
sonic  research continued  the existing  level of effort,  NASA  believed propul- 
s i o n   t e c h n o l o g y   deve lopmen t   w o u l d   be   the   p a c i n g   fac to r   f o r  
hypersonic-flight capability  and  looked to congressional  interest,  evidenced 
by a request for a NASA report on hypersonic research,  for  increased funding. 
Initial scramjet technology applications might  lie in  missile development. 
As  the  potential  for  higher  speeds  and  longer  ranges  became  attainable, 
NASA concentrated on basic  research for  later generations of military cruise 
missiles rather than applications to aircraft. (AvWk, Feb  25/85,  52) 

During March:  After  a  detailed  review of  the  history  of  Concorde develop 
ment,  J.C.D.  Baine  in  his article,  “The  Concorde Supersonic Airliner-The 
Struggle for Survival,”  concluded that the survival of Concordes or their being 
superseded by  second generation supersonic airlines appeared doubtful  un- 
der  the  persisting  circumstances  of  international economic,  political,  and 
social  relationships. 
He  noted that the confrontation between aviation technology and the envi- 
ronment had brought  into focus  problems,  whether  real  or  emotional,  that 
on ly  advanced aeronautical science and technology would  solve. That was 
especially true w i th  respect to airport noise,  sonic booms,  and stratospheric 
pollution caused by emissions from multiengines that consumed large quan- 
tities of  petroleum-based fuels.  Un t i l  those acceptable solutions were found, 
he concluded,  opposition  to civilian supersonic aircraft would continue and 
might further  restrict or  ban the  aircraft‘s  use  on  national and  international 
routes. 
However,  he noted that  the efforts of Great Britain and  France  to develop 
the  Concorde should  not  be dismissed  as  a waste  of  human effort and  re- 
sources. They  had contributed to advancements in  aeronautical science and 
technology  that,  though  not  financially  rewarding,  represented  a  store  of 
scientific knowledge that would  be available for  future development.  (Aero- 
space Historian, Marl85,  10) 

November  73  NASA  announced an  award  of a $400,000  contract  to  North 
American  Aircraft  Operations  of  Rockwell  Internatl.  Corp.  for  preliminary 
design  of  a  pivoting wing  for  a  supersonic  aircraft.  The  contract  covered 
Phase B of a jo in t  NASNNavy program to design,  develop,  and flight  test an 
aeroelastically  tailored,  pivoting-oblique  wing for  transonic  and  supersonic 
flight evaluation.  It was  part of a four-phase  procurement program to modify 

97 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

the  NASA  Ames-Dryden  F-8  fly-by-wire  research  aircraft  to  a  supersonic 
oblique-wing  configuration. 
For  takeoff  and  landing,  the  pivoting  w ing  was  set  in   the  conventional 
aircraft flight  position.  For  faster  flight  speeds ,   the w ing  pivoted so  that one 
side was swept forward and the other side swept aft,  forming an oblique angle 
with  the aircraft's  fuselage.  In the oblique  wing configuration,  an  aircraft in  
high-speed flight encountered less air  resistance. 
The  contract  covered  preliminary  design  of  the  oblique  wing,  its  pivot 
assembly,  and flight  control  program for  the F-8's  computers. The  company 
would  also  define  the  aircraft's  flight  envelope  and  assess  the  operational 
capabilities of oblique wings for  potential naval applications. 
A  follow-on  contract  phase  would  provide  detailed  design,  fabrication, 
ground  testing,  and  flight  support  for  a  12-month flight  test  program of  a p  
proximately 40 flights.  (NASA Release 85-152)

AWARDS 

january  30:  NASA announced i t s  graphics and visual communications system 
had won  the  Presidential Design Award,  presented January 30 by  President 
Reagan. The National Endowment for the Arts sponsored the award to recog- 
nize excellence  in  federal design and had selected the  NASA  project,  along 
w i th   12  others,  from among 91 Federal Design Achievement Award winners. 
The  Presidential Design Awards  jury  chairman,  architect  1.M.  Pei,  said  in  
his jury  report,  ”.  .  .  Especially  noteworthy  i s   the  visual-communications 
system developed by NASA whose posters, publications,  and logotype gener- 
ally maintain a high  standard of design,  which  truly  captures  the  spirit and 
vitality of the space program.”  (NASA Release 85-16) 

During january:  NASA announced it had conferred i t s  Space Act Awards  on 
four Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory personnel for the invention of 
a medical device based on space and aeronautics technology. The invention, 
a programmable implantable medication system (PIMS), was a computerized 
pump  intended  for  implanting  in   the  human  body  to  dispense  medicine 
automatically  to  treat  disease  such  as  diabetes,  cancer,  and  cardiovascular 
problems. 
A  nonhypodermic device introduced medication to a  reservoir  located  in 
the P lMS  device s o  that  i t s  tiny  battery-powered pump could send  the  rnedi- 
cine  into the body via a tube  in  minute doses  precisely timed by one of two 
clocks w i th in  the PIMS. A small computer in the PlMS analyzed i t s  perform- 
ance and operated an alarm i f  the device was malfunctioning or about to run 
out of fluid. 
NASA technologies employed in the P lMS  development were space micro- 
circuitry,  titanium welding,  and  the  pump and  fluid-handling  systems  used 
on  the Viking spacecraft and space-program techniques of quality  control. 
Awatd  recipients were  Robert Fischell, Wade  Radford,  Albert  Sadilek,  and 
Arthur  Hogrefe. (NASA anno Jan 85,  14) 

February  1:  The  National  Society of  Professional Engineers had  recognized 
Marshall Space  Flight Center‘s  (MSFC) role  in  the  first  Spacelab  mission as 
one of  the  nation‘s  10  outstanding engineering achievements  for  1984,  the 
center announced. Because the  1Oday mission occurred so late in  1983,  the 
society  had placed  it in  the  1984 competition.  The society also cited MSFC 
for  i t s   management  of  NASA’s  role  in   Spacelab  development,  which  had 
included the transfer tunnel connecting the Space Shuttle orbiter cabin to the 
module and other components necessary for successful laboratory operation, 
for i t s  technical and programmatic monitoring of Spacelab’s  European design 
and development activities,  and for  lending technical  expertise and support 
to  the  European Space Agency  (ESA)  in  the project.

February 7:  The US. Navy awarded Dr. Robert Stevenson,  an oceanographer 
w i th   the  Office  of  Naval  Research  (ONR),  i t s   Meritorious  Civilian  Service 
Award  for  his  role  in  the application  of  space  technology to the  solution of 
oceanographic problems, the US. Navy announced. The award cited Steven- 
son as  the  ”father”  of space oceanography in the western world,  recognizing 
h im   as  one  of  the  first  American  scientists  to  suggest  that  remote sensing 
instruments in  space could accurately  record oceanographic measurements. 
As  an advisor on  space-related programs,  Stevenson had worked with the 
National  Council  for  Marine  Resources  and  Engineering Development,  the 
National  Academy  of  Science,  North  American  Air  Defense  Command 
(NORAD), and  NASA.  Stevenson was  a Fellow of  the Geological Society of 
America and author of  numerous scientific  articles on ocean surface-layers’

March  5: The  Soviet  Geophysical  Committee  of  the  USSR’s  Academy  of 
Sciences presented Dr.  Alexander  Dessler,  director  of  Marshall Space Flight 
Center’s  (MSFC) Space Science Laboratory,  a bronze medal for  his contribu- 
tion to fulfillment of  international geophysical programs, MSFC announced. 
The committee awarded 1,000  medals,  100 to American scientists, commem- 
orating the  100th anniversary of  the  first  international geophysical program, 
the  First International  Polar  Year,  1892-1983.  Scientists  receiving the award 
made  important  contributions  to  international geophysics  in  such  areas  as 
solid earth, oceans,  atmospheres, solar-terrestrial relations, and the geophysi- 
cal programs in  Antarctica and space. 
Since  beginning  his  scientific career  in  1956,  Dessler specialized  in   re- 
search  in  low-temperature physics, atmospheric electricity,  and space physics 
and authored more than  100 technical papers on these subjects.  Dessler was 
a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Association 
for the Advancement of  Science and served as  an  officer of the  International 
Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy.  (MSFC Release 85-11  ) 

March 28:  NASA announced it had presented at a ceremony at NASA Head- 
quarters i t s  1984 inventor of the year award to Dale Kornfeld, Marshall Space 
Flight Center  (MSFC), and John Vanderhoff,  Mohammed El-Asser,  and  For- 
tunato  Micale,  all  of  Lehigh  University,  Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania,  for  their 
“process  for preparation of  largeparticle size monodisperse latexes.” 
The monodisperse latex reactor processor, an experiment flown aboard the 
Space  Shuttle,  had  produced microspheres  in  zero  gravity  in  sizes  ranging

from  5  to  30 micrometers. The maximum size particles produced on  earth, 
w i th   the  required  standards  of  quality  and  uniformity,  were  about  2  to  3 
micrometers. 
Researchers  used  microspheres  in   calibrating  sensitive  scientific  instru- 
ments such  as  microscopes,  filters,  and  particle counters.  Medical  uses  in- 
cluded  identification of cancer and glaucoma and the study of  the transport 
of  materials  inside  living  organisms.  Industrial applications  included  the 
production  of  finely  ground products  such  as  paint  pigments,  inks,  toners, 
explosives, and other powder materials. 
NASA  took  an  important  step  toward  making the  microspheres commer- 
cially available when  i t  presented 15 grams of  10-micrometer particles to the 
Commerce  Department’s  National  Bureau of  Standards  for  certification  as 
“standard  reference material.”  (NASA Release 85-44)  

April  5: NASA announced  i t  would award James Harford, executive director 
of the American  Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics  (AIAA),  i t s   Public 
Service Medal at  a luncheon ceremony April  10 during AIAA’s  annual meet- 
ing in  Washington. 
The award cited Harford “for  more than  30 years  of staff  leadership of the 
nation’s  principal  professional society for the advancement of aerospace.” 
In  1953 Harford became executive secretary of the American Rocket Soci- 
ety (ARS),  than a fledgling organization of about 2,100  missile engineers and 
scientists. When  ARS  and  the  Institute of Aeronautical  Sciences  merged  i n  
1963 to form  the AIAA,  Harford became its deputy executive director and a 
year  later  i t s   executive  director.  AIAA,  under  Harford’s  leadership,  grew  to 
35,000  members w i th  66 professional sections and 132 student branches. 
Harford was a Fellow of AIAA,  the British Interplanetary Society,  the Ameri- 
can Association for  the .Advancement of Science and an Associate Fellow of 
the Royal Aeronautical Society. (NASA Release 85-49) 

May23 :  In a ceremony today  in  the East Room of the White House, President 
Reagan presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to  12 people including 
former  test  p i lo t  Chuck Yeager.  “More  than  you‘ll  ever  know,”  Reagan said, 
“this  world would have been much poorer and a dimmer place without each 
of you.” 
In   presenting  Yeager’s  award,  Reagan  said  he  was  “a  hero  in   war  and 
peace,”  who   on  October  14,  1947,  in   a  rocket  plane  named  “Glamorous 
Glennis” after his wife,  “became the first human being to travel faster than the 
speed of  sound,  and  i n  doing so, showed to the world  the  real  meaning of 
‘The  Right Stuff.”  After the ceremony,  Yeager gave Glennis Yeager his medal. 
In  an  interview  w i th  a Washington Post  reporter upon  his arrival  in  Wash- 
ington  for  the ceremony, Yeagar  said,  “I was  just a lucky  kid who caught the 
right  ride. But then  I was  as  naive as  could be,  living a cloistered  life out at 
Muroc,  where the flying was  fun and the  living was  easy.

August 7:  The Smithsonian Institution announced selection of Robert Gilruth 
and  astronauts  Kathleen  Sullivan  and  Bruce  McCandless  II  to  receive  the 
newly created National Air and Space Museum Trophy for their achievements 
i n  the fields of aerospace science and technology. The Smithsonian on Octo- 
ber 4 would  present the trophy,  created by Washington,  D.C.,  sculptor john 
Safer,  at  the Air and Space Museum. 
Sullivan,  selected  by  NASA  as  an  astronaut  in   1978,  was  the  first  US. 
woman  to  walk  in   space  in  October  1984 on  Space  Shuttle  flight  4 1 4 .  
During  that  flight,  Sullivan  and  fellow  astronaut  David  Leestma  tested  an 
orbital  refueling system for  use on satellites and the proposed space station. 
McCandless,  a  1966 astronaut  selection,  flew  for  the  first  time  February 
1984 aboard Space  Shuttle flight  41-8  and became the first  person to fly  in 
space the manned maneuvering unit that he helped develop. 
In  1936 G i lru th  joined  Langley Memorial  Aeronautical  Laboratory where 
he  specialized  i n  structures,  dynamic  loads,  and  pilotless aircraft.  In  1958 
NASA named h im  director of  its space task group,  the organization responsi- 
b le  for designing,  developing, and testing the Mercury spacecraft. From 1961 
to   1971,  Gilruth was  director  of  the  manned  spacecraft  center  in  Houston 
where  he was  responsible for  the  Mercury, Gemini,  and many Apollo mis- 
sions.  (Smithsonian Institution release, Aug 7/85) 

November  77:  The Circumnavigators Club  in New York  City  would  present

dedicated to  advancing peace and understanding i n  a l l  parts of the world and 
who  had circumnavigated  the  globe.  Ride was  only  the  17th person to  re- 
ceive the award. 
Other  recipients were Gen.  Douglas MacArthur,  former  President Hoover, 
Ne i l  Armstrong,  Sen.  Barry Goldwater,  Lowell Thomas,  and Thor  Heyerdahl.

November  75: NASA’s  Inventions and Contributions  Board awarded the  Jet 
Propulsion  Laboratory’s  (IPL)  Dr.  Robert Nathan a  plaque  and  a  check  for 
$20,000  for  his work  in   planetary  image  processing,  the  JPL  Uniwrse  re- 
ported. Nathan received the award for his “combined  technical contributions 
to  planetary  and  biomedical  image  processing and  scientific data  analysis 
techniques.”  Nathan  invented  digital  image  processing,  a  technique  in  

102 

Awards 

which  computers  remove  noise,  correct  distortions,  and  enhance different 
images such as  planetary objects or biomedical  images. 
Nathan joined JPL in   1959 to  manage scientific data  analysis  for  the  u p  
coming Ranger moon missions. The Ranger spacecraft used the best available 
cameras,  but they  were  subject  to  distortion and  noise contamination.  Na- 
than  devised techniques  to  eliminate  extraneous  patterns from  the  images. 
His processes and the creation of the image processing laboratory (IPL) estab- 
lished JPL as  an  important center for  planetary image processing. 
In 1969 Nathan  launched JPL into biomedical  imaging w i th   a  $2  m i l l ion  
grant from  the  National  Institutes of  Health, which  later  led to  formation of 
the JPL biomedical  image analysis facility. 
In 1976 Nathan developed a  system  at the  IPL to handle large amounts of 
data by  means of  a  large array filter  using very-large  scale  integration (VLSI) 
system silicon chip technology.  The  microchip  reduced computer time  by a 
factor of  100. 
He  was currently working on another microchip design that would perform 
highquality  geometric  image manipulations and filter  chips that would  per- 
form  pattern recognition functions.  UPL  Un iwse ,   Nov  15/85,  1 )  

During November:  NASA  announced that  its  Lewis Research Center  (LeRC) 
received  four  of  Research  &  Dewlopment magazine’s  IR-100  awards  to 
honor the  100 most significant new products developed during the past year. 
A  panel  of  technical  judges  selected  the  winners  from  more  than  1,000 
entries.  The  award-winning  products were  servomechanism  for  propeller- 
pitch change,  transmit module, communications traffic processor,  and rotary 
power-transfer device,  all of which LeRC and private firms under contracts to  
the center developed jointly. 
LeRC  researchers  Stuart Loewenthal and Bruce Steinetz w i th  General Elec- 
tric  engineers  developed  the  servomechanism  for  propeller-pitch  change, 
which  could accurately  control  the  propeller  blade angle  of  large  (10,000 
kw)  turboprop aircraft propellers over the complete spectrum of flight operat- 
ing  conditions. With certain modifications,  the product should be adaptable 
for applications as  aircraft wing pivot mechanisms, tank  turret aiming actua- 
tors,  and  other  heavy  mechanisms,  requiring  very  accurate  pointing  and 
tracking control. 
The  transmit  module,  developed  by  LeRC  researchers  Thomas  Kascak, 
Godfrey  Anzic,  and  Denis Connolly  along  w i th   Rockwell  Internatl.  engi- 
neers,  provided rf signal amplification and phase shifting at a frequency of 20 
gigahertz.  The device was  of  monolithic design  in which  all  module  func- 
tions were contained on a single  6.4  by  4.8  millimeter semiconductor chip 
w i th  the smallest circuit feature about 40-millionth of an  inch. This develop 
ment made possible the production of weight- and cost-effective phased array 
antenna systems  for  future communications satellite systems.

LeRC  engineer  Russel jirberg along with  electronics  engineers  from  Mo- 
torola Corp. developed a communications traffic processor for  the  next gen- 
eration of  communications satellites.  The system  provided the capacity and 
routing flexibility  needed to  handle the  nation's  growing demands  for  tele- 
phone  and  computer  message  traffic. When  used  aboard  satellites  having 
multiple narrow beam antennas,  the device enabled more than 60,000  indi- 
vidual  voice  messages,  video  pictures,  and  computer data  to  be  routed di- 
rectly to users throughout the U.S.  equipped w i th  low-cost ground terminals. 
LeRC engineer David Renz  in  cooperation with Sperry Flight Systems engi- 
neers  developed  a  rotary  power-transfer  device  that  transferred  electrical 
power through a rotating joint.  It had a  low loss space-type  design capable of 
transferring  high  power  (hundreds of  kilowatts),  AC  or  DC,  to  frequencies 
such as  20  kilohertz. One of  i t s  outstanding features was  loss of only 22  watts 
per circuit wh i le  transferring 100 kilowatts. Renz and his colleagues said the 
roll-ring assembly device  had the  potential to  be one of  the major compo- 
nents  of  the  proposed  space  station  and  other  spacecraft  where  large 
amounts of  power are  required.  (NASA Activities,  Nov 85,  10)

Halley Watch (IHW),  for which JPL was  the western hemisphere lead center 
and  University of  Erlangen-Nurnberg, W.  Germany,  the eastern hemisphere 
lead  center,  the  JPL  Universe reported.  Lead  center  representatives  at  the 
meeting had joined  IHW  discipline  specialists  in  such  fields  as  astronomy, 
photometry  and  polarimetry,  radio  science,  and  spectroscopy;  representa- 
tives  of  European, Japanese, and  Soviet  spacecraft missions  to  Halley;  and 
IHW  steering group members. The IHW  organized a group of ground-based 
professional  and  amateur  Halley  watchers  worldwide  to  coordinate  their 
observations with those of  airborne, earth-orbital, and spacecraft-flyby obser- 
vations. N ine  hundred professional astronomers from 50 countries and some 
300 amateur astronomers had signed on as  members of the  IHW. 
JPL expected the  IHW  meeting would  be the  last before perihelion,  Ha l -  
ley’s  closest approach to the sun on February 9 at 53.1  m i l l ion  miles. Since its 
1948 inbound leg of  its 74-year orbit around the sun,  Halley would  make its 
closest approaches to earth  on  November 27  at  57.6  m i l l ion  miles and  the 
following April  11  at 39 m i l l ion  miles. 
Astronomers  had already  observed that  Halley‘s  coma  (the bright  halo of 
dust and gas  surrounding the nucleus) had begun developing and questioned 
why  the comet exhibited  this  feature at such a great distance  from  the  sun. 
Early  observations  had  also  unexpected I y  revealed  the  comet’s  brightness 
was  fluctuating. 
Amateur  observers with small  telescopes would be able  to  see  Halley by

October  15: Navy  Secretary  John Lehman  said  that  intercepting  U.S.  Navy 
aircraft  ordered  the  Egyptian  Boeing  737  Airliner,  which  Palestinians  hi- 
jacked and ordered to be flown from  Egypt,  to  land at  Sigonella Air  Base  in  
Sicily “or  else,”  Defense  Daily  reported. Lehman  said one of  two Grumman 
E-2C  Hawkey  airborne  control  aircraft,  which  joined  six  Grumman  F-14 
Tomcats  and four  tankers in  the  intercept mission,  issued the command. 
Lehman said  four of the F-14s  flew a close intercept formation on the 737 
to the  landing  in  Sicily;  the  E-2Cs  from  the  USS  Saratoga  had  loitered over- 
head until the airliner took off from  Egypt with the hijackers. 
There “was  no  deal,”  Lehman said, and no  help from any other country. He

Ant isate l l ite   System 

lanuary  16: The  U .S .   Air  Force couldn’t  decide whether  the  next test  of  the 
miniature  homing  vehicle  antisatellite (ASAT)  system  should  be  against  a 
target  in  space,  Aerospace  Daily reported. The Air  Force was evaluating data 
from  its  November  13  ASAT  test,  in  which  the  miniature  homing vehicle 
M H V  infrared sensor  tracked a star,  but had said that  i t s  next ASAT  test would 
be  flown  against  an  instrumented  target  vehicle.  Congressional  limitations 
barred such a test until March  1 and until President Reagan  had certified to 
Congress that  the  test  was  needed and  wouldn’t  undercut  the  potential for 
negotiations w i th  the  USSR. 
The  previous  day  the  magazine  had  discussed  a  House  Republican  re- 
search  report recommending raising the  l im i t  of  three U.S.  ASAT  tests against 
objects  in  space during that fiscal  year.  ( N D ,  Jan 16/85,  84;  Jan 15/85,  73) 
May 24: The U.S.  Senate voted today,  74 to 9,  to approve a proposal by Sen. 
John Warner  (R-Va.)  to  allow  three  final-stage antisatellite tests  next year  as 
long as  President Reagan  told Congress  the  test would  not disrupt  negotia- 
tions aimed at  banning antisatellite weapons,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
The Senate previously rejected, 51 to 35,  a testing ban proposed by Sen. John 
Kerry (D-Mass.). 
The  U.S.  antisatellite (ASAT)  weapon  was  a small  warhead  atop  a  rocket 
carried by an F-15  jet to the edge of space,  where i t  was  released to pursue i t s  
target. Although  the  U.S.  had tested the weapon  in stages,  the  U.S.  had not 
fired the weapon against a target  in  space.  The Pentagon had scheduled that 
final  round of testing to begin within several months.

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

During the Geneva negotiations on weapons  reductions, the USSR  sought 
a halt to ASAT  tests,  while the Reagan Administration said i t  was  open to such 
a  proposal but had refused to halt ASAT  testing as a condition to talks. 
In 1984 Congress banned tests of the U.S.  system  in  hopes the pause might 
help negotiations, which had not then  started. 
The  Washington Post earlier had reported that electronic problems would 
raise the cost of the antisatellite system and stretched out i t s  testing program. 
The Air Force planned a test,  originally scheduled for fa l l  1984,  for  late July in  
which  the  target  would  be  two metallic  balloons  attached  to   an  orbiting 
satellite. 
However,  the Air  Force was  cautious about  the first  test  against a  target  in  
space,  fearing  that  a well-publicized  failure  would  hurt  the  space  defense 
program. Sources told the Postthat i t  might be impossible for the Air Force to 
carry  out  a  second  test  of  the  weapon  against  the  balloon  target  in   space 
during the current fiscal year.  Originally the Air  Force had planned for  three 
tests  in  1985. (W  Post,  May 25/85,  A4;  May  16/85,  A27) 

ju ly  3: The  first test of a  U .S .   antisatellite weapon against a physical target in 
space  was  delayed  indefinitely  because  technical  difficulties  forced  post- 
ponement  of  the  target  launching,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  The  U.S. 
Air Force cancelled the launching from Wallops  Island,  Virginia,  and sent the 
targets back to the manufacturer, Avco  Systems,  for  repair. Un t i l  the cause  of 
the problem was  found, Air  Force officials said they could not estimate when 
the test might be rescheduled. 
The  NY  Times  reported john  Pike,  associate  director  of  the  Federation of 
American  Scientists,  as  saying he was  told by  “usually  reliable sources”  that 
the technical problems centered on the radio that would signal the  results of 
the target practice back to earth. 
The Air  Force had conducted two of the test flights planned for  the antisa- 
tellite weapon,  but aimed a t  a point in space  rather than a physical target. The 
Air  Force  had  already  for  apparently  technical  reasons  rescheduled  several 
times  in  1985 the  latest test,  in which  the weapon would be fired  at one of 
two six-footdiameter target balloons in  orbit. 
The antisatellite weapon  was  a two-stage rocket w i th  a  13-inch, heat-sens- 
ing homing vehicle  in   i t s   nose.  Launched from  beneath an  F15 fighter,  the 
rocket would intercept and destroy  i t s  target on  impact. 
The  U.S.  House the previous week approved an amendment to the military 
programs bill banning tests of antisatellite weapons against targets  in  space as 
long as  the USSR  refrained from similar tests.  The Senate voted to permit the 
testing as  long as President Reagan certified that he was  trying to negotiate a 
treaty prohibiting antisatellite weapons. A House-Senate conference commit- 
tee  was  scheduled to  begin  reconciling differences on  the  military  bill the 
following week.  (WPost,  July 4/85,  A4;  N V  July 4/85,  A9)

August 20: President Reagan informed Congress that the U.S.  planned shortly 
to  conduct  the  first  test  of  an  antisatellite weapon  (ASAT) against a  target  in  
space,  which a spokesman said would provide an  “incentive,’  to the USSR to 
negotiate  limits  on  such  weapons,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Reagan 
promised  the  US.  was  bargaining  in   good  faith  with  the  Soviets  to  l im i t  
ASATs,  although the White House repeated the administration’s opposition to 
a Soviet proposal for a moratorium on ASAT  development and testing. 
Officials  said  they  expected the  test  of  an  ASAT  fired  from  an  F-15  at  an 
obsolete U.S.  satellite to take place in  September or early October. Technical 
problems  w i th   both  the  antisatellite weapon,  called  the  miniature  homing 
vehicle,  and  the  intended target,  an  instrumented balloon  to  be  inflated in  
space,  delayed  the  first  test.  Since the  original  target  was  still  experiencing 
problems,  the test would use an  obsolete satellite. 
That  same  day  Presidential spokesman  Larry  Speakes  read  to  reporters a 
lengthy  statement  criticizing  Soviet  advances  in antisatellite  weapons  and 
technology and said this provided justification for  the first US. test against a 
target  in  space.  Speakes  added  that  a  moratorium on  antisatellite weapons 
tests  would  “perpetuate”  a  Soviet  “monopoly”  on  antisatellite systems.  ( W

September  77:  Kenneth Adelman,  director of the Arms Control and  Disarma-

antisatellite weapon,  to assist  in  negotiating an  arms  control agreement,  the 
Washington Post reported. Adelman argued  that testing  “would  not  impair‘, 
negotiations and  “can  constitute an  incentive to  the  Soviet  Union to  reach 
agreements on a wide range of  issues.” 
Although the Air Force had set  September  13 as i t s  first test of the antisatel- 
lite weapon against a target in space,  congressional sources  said  the Reagan 
Administration might step  up  i t s  test  plan because of the negotiations or  the 
November summit meeting. As of mid-July, the Air Force had no plans to test 
the weapon  in  September,  because  i t  had  returned both the weapon and  its 
instrumented target to their manufacturer for repairs expected to take through 
October.  Thus  when  House-Senate conferees met  in  July to  iron out differ- 
ences on the  1987 defense spending bill, the Pentagon agreed to a provision 
that  limited the Air  Force to  three tests  against a target  in  space  through  the 
end of FY 86. “They  said they would not have a test before the new fiscal year 
began  in  October,”  one conferee recalled. 
Pentagon sources said Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and President 
Reagan agreed  in  early August to test the weapon against an old U.S.  satellite 
“to  show  resolve.” 
Critics of the weapon,  including four  members of Congress,  had filed suit 
in  U.S.  District Court  in  Washington  seeking to  block  the test,  arguing that 
Reagan  had  not  met  a  congressional  requirement  that  he  certify  he  was 

113

negotiating ”in  good f a i t h  to get an agreement with the Soviets  limiting such 
weapons. Oral arguments in  the case were set  for  September 12. 
Rep. George Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told the 
subcommittee the  presidential certification was  “less  than  candid“  and  “cir- 
cumvented the  intent and w i l l  of the Congress.” 
Brown also criticized the weapon,  which was  two years  behind schedule, 
saying that  the Pentagon talked about “how  vital to the national security the 
system  is,  right up  to the day  they cancel  it.“  (W  Post,  Sept  12/85,  A261 

September  73: An air-launched antisatellite missile (ASAT) h i t  its target in the 
A i r   Force’s  first  ASAT  test  against  a  target  in  space,  the  Air  Force  Systems 
Command  Newsreview  reported.  An  F-15 
from  Edwards  Air  Force  Base 
launched the two-stage ASAT  missile 35,000  to 40,000  feet above  the West- 
ern Test  Range at  Vandenberg Air  Force Base,  then  two  boosters carried  the 
ASAT  into space.  When  the ASAT’s  infrared sensors  locked on to the  target, 
which was  about 350 miles over  the  Pacific, small  rocket motors guided the 
weapon to  its kill. 
The  Air  Force  in  1979  launched  the  ASAT’s  target,  an  Air  Force  satellite 
known as  P78-1,  which  gathered scientific data on the  space  environment 
but which had outlived  its usefulness. 
In 1984 F-15s  launched two Iive-fire tests but not at targets. The first was an 
ASAT  launch to a point in space;  the second tested the ASAT  sensor’s  ability to 
home in on a star‘s  infrared emissions. 
Air  Force  plans called  for  nine  more  target  tests  against  specially  instru- 
mented balloons and satellites that had completed their missions. 
The  Washington Post  later  reported that,  according to  Robert MacQueen, 
director  of  the  high-altitude  observatory  at  the  National  Center  for  Atmo- 
spheric Research  in  Colorado,  the Solwind satellite destroyed in  the test was 
providing  “very  useful  data”  on  solar  activity  until  the  moment  i t  was  hit. 
MacQueen  said  he was  surprised and  upset  at  seeing a  fruitful  experiment 
being used as  a military target and said i t  was  “deplorable”  that the Pentagon 
“had  taken a scientifically useful thing and sacrificed i t  in  this way.” 
The  satellite carried seven  experiments for  the  Naval Research  Laboratory 
(NRL) and other government agencies. One NRL experiment used a corona- 
graph  that  sent  to  earth  during each  of  the  satellite’s  orbits,  or  roughly  15 
times a day,  images of activity on the sun’s  surface. 
Several months previously, NRL scientists had to draft what one source said 
“they  thought  was  a  routine  paper  to  justify  continued  operation  of  their 
coronagraph.”  Although  the  scientists  acknowledged  problems  with  the 
spacecraft system,  the source said,  they wrote that  i t  should continue. 
NRL  Scientists  were  told  in  July that  ”the  satellite  would  be  turned  off 
sometime  after  August  1,  but  they  weren’t  told  how,”  the  source  said.  The 
Washington Post  reported on September 6 that Solwind was  the  likely target 

114 

Department  of  Defense 

for  the ASAT  test  because the  original  target,  an  instrumented balloon,  was 
plagued w i th  technical problems. 
A  Pentagon spokesman said the satellite was  intended to operate for  three 
years at  most and that  recent data from the satellite had “marginal  value.” 
The  Washington Post  reported  that  another  Defense Department official 
said the Solwind  research satellite was  originally scheduled as  a target  in  the 
weapon’s  seventh test,  which probably would  have come  in  1987. The satel- 
lite’s  solar  research program was  expected  to  be  ending  by  then,  scientists 
associated w i th  the program said. 
Although  Secretary  of  Defense Caspar  Weinberger  described the  satellite 
as  “burned  out,”  an  Air  Force  spokesman said  the  fact  that  the  satellite was 
still sending signals back to earth played a key  role in its selection as  a target. 
“We  had  to  have  an  active  telemetry  system  to  verify  i t  had  been  hit,”  the 
spokesman  said.  ‘A  dead  satellite  would  not  have  given  us  that.”  (AFSC 
Newsreview, Sept 27/85,  1;  W Post,  Sept 20185, A l ,   Sept 27/85,  A9) 

December 27: Reps.  Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) and Norman Dicks (D-Wash.) sent 
a  letter  to  Defense  Secretary  Caspar  Weinberger  warning  that  “Congress 
would  not excuse any attempt by the Department of  Defense to circumvent” 
a  congressional  ban  on  antisatellite  weapon  testing,  the  Washington  Post 
reported.  The  warning  came  after  the  Post  reported  that  a  DOD  official 
discussed  plans  to  continue  development  of  a  $4  b i l l ion   U.S.  antisatellite 
weapon despite a week-old  law that  banned tests  against an  object  in  space 
as  long as  the Soviets d id  not test such a system. 
The DOD official  said a  possibility under study was  to fire a test weapon 
against “a  point in  space“  rather than at two  targets put  into orbit December 
12  [see  U.S.  Air  Force/NASA  and  DOD,  Dec.  121.  The  Air  Force  ”won’t  do 
anything  in  direct  violation”  of  the  congressional  language  attached  to  an 
omnibus spending bill signed into law by President Reagan, but “we  w i l l  find 
a way  to go ahead,“  the  DOD  official  had said. 
Although  the congressional action stopped testing,  it d id  not halt the over- 
all  antisatellite  program,  for  which  Congress  increased  by  $15  m i l l ion   a 
Pentagon  request  for  $150  m i l l ion   in   FY  86  to  develop  the  system.  The 
increase,  a congressional aide said,  was  to show  the Soviet Union that  the 
US. program would be available for testing i f  Moscow broke i t s  moratorium. 
The spending b i l l  also had a special  $5   m i l l ion  item for  the Air  Force “to 
carry out a research program to develop new and improved verification tech- 
niques to  monitor compliance w i th  any antisatellite weapon agreement that 
may be entered  into by  the U.S  and the Soviet Union.” 
Rep.  Les Aspin  (D-Wis.),  chairman of  the House Armed Services  Commit- 
tee,  said he hoped to bring arms-control supporters in  the House together to  
discuss antisatellite weapons.  The  long-term  goal  of  arms  control,  he  said, 
was  “to  promote  stability.”  In the  antisatellite area,  he  added,  that  meant 

115

finding a way  to  make  secure  the  superpowers’  high-altitude satellites  that 
monitored nuclear  forces and  provided early warning of an  attack.  ( W  Post,

Budget 

March 29: A  defense  budget  frozen  to  the  inflation  level  could k i l l  the Air 
ForcdMcDonnelI Douglas C-17  transport program, for which Defense Secre- 
tary  Caspar Weinberger had approved full-scale development  in FY  86,  D e  
fense Da i l y  reported.  In a markup by  the Senate Armed  Services  sea  power 
and force projection  subcommittee,  funds would  be included for the C-17  i n  
the 3%  and 4%  real growth version of the budget. 
The  subcommittee  also  cut  the  budget  request  for  the  Lockheed C-5BI 
which would have to f i l l  the gap  i f  the C-17  was terminated. Weinberger had 
said earlier that  the C-5B  would  be one of over  170 aircraft to be deleted  i f  
there were a budget freeze,  but he had not mentioned the C-17  in  his list of 
threatened  programs. 
Weinberger  had previously approved a  request of  $453.68  m i l l ion  for the 
C-17  in  FY  86 and $624.8  b i l l ion  for  FY  87.  (D /D ,  Mar 29/85,  161) 

/ u / y  7:  Rep.  Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee’s  procurement subcommittee,  said  a  new  bomber  force  study, 
done by the Defense Department in  response to a U.S.  House request, could 
lead  to  changes  i n  the  planned mix  of  100  B-1B  bombers  and  something 
over  100 Advanced  Technology  Bombers  (ATBs-Stealth),  Defense  Daily  re- 
ported. The  new  study  was  intended to  reevaluate and  update the  conclu- 
sions of a 1981 study. 
Stratton pointed  out  that  major  changes  in  the  strategic environment de- 
manded that  the  U.S.  House take  a new  look at  the air-breathing  leg of  the 
strategic triad  to  determine  i f  those  requirements had changed.  He empha- 
sized  that  the  subcommittee  did  not  have  a  prejudged  position  on  the 
bomber mix question and that  the group d id  not want  a rehash of  positions 
taken years  before when  circumstances were significantly different. 
When asked  by  Rep.  Beverly Byron (R-Md.) i f  the study could change the 
mix of the bomber force,  Stratton responded, “I think that i s  entirely possible. 
If the study group finds that a different ’mix‘  i s  required, they should clearly 
state  the differences and  provide justification for  those changes.  This  study 
could call for more or fewer of either bomber or for a high aggregate number 
of  both  .  . . but there  must be full debate on the proposed bomber force, 
because obviously  a good deal of  money would  have to  be spent  i f  we  are 
going to continue  both those  lines  into the future.”  (D/D, July 2/85,  9 )

November  7: The Senate Appropriations Committee cut the Air  Force FY 86 
request for  development of  the advanced  tactical fighter  (ATF)  by  $103  mil- 
l ion  to  $140  m i l l ion  and  recommended  that a unit cost  cap  be  put on  the 
program,  Defense  Daily  reported.  The  House  Appropriations  Committee 
earlier approved $170 m i l l ion  for ATF. 
Acting  on  the  recommendation  of  i t s   defense  subcommittee,  the  Senate 
committee allocated $100 m i l l ion  for  the  joint  advanced  fighter engine de- 
velopment program,  $13 m i l l ion  for  avionics development,  and  $27 m i l l ion  
for  continuation of the competitive air vehicle demonstration and validation 
"for  not  less than  three contractors."  Although  the committee endorsed the 
ATF  development  program  "as  a  long-term counter  to  Soviet tactical  air  im- 
i t  said  it " is   concerned that  the current  program does  not pro- 
provements:' 
vide sufficient time to absorb a l l  of the technology"  to be incorporated in  the 
aircraft and that the program "entails unacceptable risks."  And the committee 
pointed out that  "these  advanced technologies would  be very  expensive  to 
obtain." 
The  Air  Force estimated  R &  D costs  for  the ATF  at  $11.8  b i l l ion   in  FY  85 
dollars and,  after considering a  figure  up to  $40 million,  assumed  the  pur- 
chase price would be $35  m i l l ion  in  FY 85 dollars. However,  the committee 
pointed out that the Air Force "has  not identified how i t  w i l l  reduce ATF  costs 
without  deleting technical  features  previously  identified  as  aircraft  require- 
ments."  Therefore, the committee directed the Air  Force to submit an annual 
report on  the  future  likely cost of  ATF,  beginning w i th   the  FY  87 budget.  I t  
recommended that  "a  20% limit be placed on  the ATF  program unit flyaway 
costs"  above  F-15  costs  and that  this  l im i t  be made the  baseline of  the ATF 
development  program. 
The  ATF  would  include sustained supersonic dash,  internal weapons  car- 
riage,  blended aerodynamic design  including low observable (stealth) tech- 
nology,  and  higher  thrust  (32,000 Ib.)  engines.  It would  also  have  short 
takeoff  and  landing (STOL) capabilities,  high  transonic and  supersonic ma- 
neuverability, an expanded flight envelope, and  improved survivability. (D /D ,

Missiles 

january 23:  The  U .S .   Air  Force's  Aeronautical Systems  Division successfully 
flight-tested a  low-cost,  state-of-the-art autopilot  on  an  unmanned  research 
vehicle,  the  Air  Force  Systems  Command's  Newsreview  reported. The  divi- 
sion  adapted  commercially  available microprocessor chips  in  the  $50,000, 
in-house autopilot program to develop flight control-systems technology that 
would  lead  to  cost  reductions  in   tactical  missiles.  Researchers  made  five 
flight tests of the autopilot since October  1983 on an  XBQM-106  unmanned 

117 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

vehicle during which  the autopilot  provided control  augmentation,  translat- 
ing  user  inputs into vehicle actions. 
Current  guidance  and  stabilization packages  in  missiles  and  other  aero- 
space systems were costly  because they  used expensive data processing mi- 
crochips that  had excessive amounts of computational processing capability 
but no built-in control  functions,  thus  requiring additional  electronic  inter- 
face components to  perform the “control”  function tasks.  The microprocessor 
chip,  in  contrast,  had sufficient built-in computational and control  functions 
to   permit  60%  fewer  interfacing components and  should be appropriate to 
numerous tactical weapons systems,  both surface and air-launched. 
The next step in  the program would require replacing the wire-wrapped or 
brassboard model of the autopilot with a refined system on a printed circuit 
board, which would undergo at  least 2  additional flights before the end of FY 
85.  (AFSC Newsreview, Jan 23185,  8) 

March  12: A US. House Appropriations subcommittee approved a resolution 
to release $1.5  b i l l ion  frozen  in  Congress the previous year  for an  additional 
21  MX  missiles,  the  Washington Post  reported.  The  vote,  expected  in   the 
defense subcommittee  that  had supported the MX  i n  the  past,  was  only the 
first  in  a series of votes  required before funds could be released. But missile 
opponents  acknowledged  that  the  vote  was  indicative of  the  uphill  battle 
they  faced  in  trying to defeat the MX  in  the  midst of  renewed arms  control 
talks with the Soviets. 
The Reagan Administration had lobbied hard for the previous two weeks to 
w in   release of  the funds,  contending that continued  funding  of  the MX  was 
crucial to the arms control  talks that  had opened in  Geneva. 
MX missile supporters on the subcommittee argued that the administration 
should not be denied a weapon that could be a “bargaining chip”  in  the arms 
talks.  On  the other  hand,  opponents characterized the missile as  “the  glass 
jaw  i n  our strategic forces”  and  “totally  irrelevant” to the arms talks. 
The  resolution  would  next  come  before  the  full  committee,  which  had 
backed  it in  the past. Observers agreed the  real fight over  the missile would 
occur  on  the  Senate  and  House floors.  Under a complicated  arrangement 
worked  out  the  previous  year,  representatives of  the  Republicancontrolled 
Senate and the Democraticcontrolled House had agreed that the MX  legisla- 
tion would  be sent  to  the floor  of  both  chambers  regardless  of  what action 
was  taken at  the committee  level.  (W  Post,  Mar  13/85,  A4) 

May  13: General Electric pleaded guilty to 108 counts of making false claims 
to  the  government  for  work  on  the  Minuteman  Mark-12  reentry  vehicle 
systems  for  January  1,  1980  to  April  1983,  during  which  time  they  had 
claimed  more  than  $800,00  on  nonreimbursable  overrun  labor  costs  by 
altering employees’  time cards,  Defense Daily reported.

GE  faced  a maximum  penalty of  $1.04  million.  Because  there was  not a 
plea  agreement  to   halt  indictment  of  officials within  GE,  the  investigation 
would continue  in  order to find which GE managers were criminally respon- 
sible. 
A company spokesman said,  “We  changed our plea because of  new  infor- 
mation  given  to  us  and  to  the  U.S.  Attorney’s  office and  the  attorney  for  a 
former employee.  Four years of  investigation by GE  and various government 
agencies revealed errors in  time card charging in  1980.  From the beginning, 
we offered to  reimburse the government for  any  incorrect charges.  However, 
until  now,  GE  was  unable to  conclude  that  any  individual  has  engaged  in  
criminal activity.”  ( D D ,  May  14/85,  73) 

June 28: In May an armament division  F-16  from the US. Air  Force’s  3246th 
Test  Wing  fired  an  advanced,  medium  range air-to-air  missile  (AMRAAM) 
over  White  Sands  Missile  Range  in  the  first  guided  launch of  its  full-scale 
development program, the Air  Force System Command’s (AFSC) Newsreview 
reported.  Armament  division  officials  said  the  successful  flight  verified 
AMRAAM‘s  interface w i th  the F-16‘s  avionics system and the performance of 
i t s  active  radar guidance capabilities. 
AMRAAM  i s  an all-weather, all-aspect radar missile designed to replace the 
AIM-7  radar missile. AMRAAM i s  smaller,  lighter, and faster than AIM-7  and 
had an active radar seeker  that would permit air crews to “launch  and leave’’ 
or to  execute simultaneous multipletarget attacks during a single intercept. 
Pilots could  launch AMRAAM  from  beyond  visual  range,  because  i t  r e  
ceived  target  information  from  the  launch  aircraft‘s  avionics  systems.  After 
launch, the aircraft could pass target information to the missile,  or the  m iss i le  
could use  its own   inertial  reference unit and  microcomputer to  guide  iner- 
tially toward the target.  During the terminal phase,  the missile’s active seeker 
would take over and guide the missile to the target. 
The Air  Force and  Navy  had a contract with  Hughes Aircraft Co.  for  full- 
scale development of AMRAAM, w i th  Raytheon Co. designated as  “follower” 
contractor to  introduce competition  during the production  phase. 
The previous December an  AMRAAM separationkontrol  test vehicle flew 
a preprogrammed course to evaluate the missile‘s  autopilot,  control  system, 
aerodynamic characteristics, and safe  separation from the aircraft. 
The Air Force planned over the next three years more launches from several 
aircraft including the F-14,  F-15,  F-16,  and F-18.  Plans also called for com- 
bat aircraft of the United Kingdom and Federal Republic of Germany to carry 
AMRAAM.  (AFSC Newsreview, June 28/85,  4) 

August 23:  Under a  1985  memorandum of  agreement,  the  Eglin Air  Force 
Base’s  armament division was  leading a jo in t  U.S.,  British,  and M s t  German 
project to  determine how a non-nuclear,  long-range standoff missile should 

119 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

be developed,  the Air  Force Systems Command  Newsreview reported. Gen- 
eral Dynamics and Boeing Aerospace Co.,  which had 15-month contracts to 
study  the  possibilities, was  working with  subcontractors from  the other  two 
countries. 
The  countries  could use  the  conventional,  low-altitude subsonic  missile, 
launched from air or ground,  primarily against  airfields. The  immediate goal 
of the project was  to design the system,  develop a procurement program and 
schedule,  and  identify technological transfers among the three countries. 
The point of the agreement was  to save money and eliminate duplication of 
effort in  development of a needed weapon system.  One country would build 
the  system,  but  the  others  would  support  the  effort.  While  the  U.S.  com- 
pleted the procurement package,  England provided most of  the threat  infor- 
mation needed to design the missile. West Germany was  taking an active part 
in  a l l  project phases.  (AFSC Newsreview,  Aug 23/85,  3) 

NASA and Department of  Defense 

September  7 7 :   The  U.S.  Air  Force announced  today  that  i t  had selected Air 
Force Undersecretary Edward “Pete”  Aldridge to fly on the first  Space Shuttle 
mission  launched  from  Vandenberg Air  Force  Base,  the  Arizona  Daily  Star 
reported. The Air Force said Aldridge and Air Force Maj. John Brett Watterson 
would serve  as  payload specialists with  five astronauts named  by  NASA  for 
the Defense Department’s mission set  for  launch March 20,  1986. 
Aldridge,  47,  who  had been Air  Force undersecretary since 1981,  said  in  a 
statement,  “I‘m  thrilled at the opportunity and thrilled at  the prospects that  I 
w i l l  be able to apply what  I have learned to expanding U.S.  efforts in  space.” 
NASA and the  U.S.  Air  Force were  building the Vandenberg Space  Shuttle 
launch  facility  primarily  for  military  missions.  Because  the  Space  Shuttle 
could be launched  from  there directly south,  it could  go  into a north-south 
orbit  that  covered  the  entire  globe,  passing over  both  poles  and  allowing 
Space  Shuttle crews to observe Soviet military forces  anywhere  in  the world. 
Space Shuttles launched from Kennedy Space Center could not go directly 
north or south because they would fly over  inhabited areas during the  initial 
minutes  of  flight,  possibly  endangering the  population  i f   something went 
wrong.  Those  Space  Shuttles launched  into east-west  orbits d id   not fly  any 
closer than about 2000 miles to the poles. (Ariz.  Daily Stac  Sept  12/85,  A3)

plained  a  company  policy  that  instituted  “expanded,  no-questions-asked” 

120 

Department  of  Defense 

refund policies on the sale of spare parts and support equipment to the U.S., 
foreign countries,  and commercial customers worldwide,  Defense  Daily  re- 
ported. 
McDonnell said  the  government could  return  “any  covered  spare  part or 
piece of  support  equipment  i f  there  i s  any  dissatisfaction  with  i t s  cost-no 
questions asked.” 
McDonnell described the  refund policy as  the most comprehensive in  the 
aerospace  industry and said  that  i f  the military  felt  it must  retain an  item  in  
stock  for  operational  readiness,  “their  complaint  w i l l   be addressed  without 
concern for a time limit.” 
Under  the  new  policy,  the  military  could,  i f   dissatisfied  w i th   the  price, 
return w i th in   s ix   months  of  delivery  new  and  unused  parts  or  equipment 
bu i l t   by  McDonnell  Douglas  and  purchased  under  prime  contracts.  The 
company said the policy applied to prices to the government up to $100,000; 
at that level the company furnished cost data in advance of establishing price. 
Earlier Weinberger directed establishment of  a standard  industry-wide re- 
fund  policy based on voluntary  refund policies of  Boeing Co.  and the Gen- 
eral  Electric Co. The  BoeingKeneral  Electric refund programs accepted for 
credit the  return of  any  spare  parts or  support equipment that  the  Pentagon 
considered to be unreasonably priced.  (D/D, Aug 2/85,  1) 

Satellites 

February  18: Sources  inside and outside the  Reagan Administration said  the 
Department of  Defense (DOD) was  developing for  constant surveillance  of 
all objects  in  deep space  a new generation of  navigation,  communications, 
and s p y   satellites,  which would  orbit  22,000 miles high and  be aided  by  a 
nearly completed network of ground stations,  the  Washington Post reported. 
DOD would harden the new satellites against radiation and laser attacks and 
give  them  some small  jet  engines for  maneuvering away  from  attack.  DOD 
was  also determining  i f  the satellites could be armed to defend themselves. 
DOD was completing Spacetrack,  a worldwide U.S.  network of five space- 
watching  facilities,  that  would  provide  adequate  time  to  take  defensive 
actions  i f  the  USSR   launched weapons at  U.S.  deepspace satellites.  DOD’s 
FY  86  budget  reportedly  would  contain  $20   m i l l ion   to  complete  a  fully 
operational Spacetrack  sensor  system by  1988. 
The Soviets  had had for  10 years  a rudimentary weapon  that could knock 
down   low-level U.S.  satellites. The Pentagon was  beginning tests on  i t s  own  
antisatellite weapon,  which would  knock down low-level Soviet satellites as 
they passed over  the  U.S.  ( W  Post,  Feb  18/85,  A l )  

April 26: The Department of Defense (DOD) placed a satellite on the Space 
Shuttle Discovery [see  STS/Military  Applications,  Jan. 241,  which  put  it  in  a 

121  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

radically  different  orbit  from  many  s p y   satellites,  the  NY  Times  reported. 
According to figures made public by the Air  Force,  DOD put the satellite in  a 
highly elliptical orbit at  a  low angle above  the equator;  the majority  of  U.S. 
s p y  satellites were  in roughly circular orbits that  passed across  polar  regions 
so that  satellites would spend as  much time  as  possible over  the  USSR.  The 
satellite’s,  whose United Nations designation was  1985-108,  highest altitude 
was  34,670  km (21,543  miles);  its  low   point was  341  km  (212 miles). This 
to  the  equator,  and  the  satellite  took  10 
elliptical  path was  inclined 28.4’ 
hours  to  complete  one  revolution.  In  addition  to  its  elliptical  orbits,  the 
satellite could  maneuver  from  its  initial  orbit  into  another,  perhaps  more 
usual,  orbit. 
By  international treaty,  DOD was  required to release to the United Nations 
a technical description of all  its satellites’  initial orbits. This  recording proc- 
ess,  which  passed  through  the  State  Department  and  included  filing  the 
information w i th  the  Library of Congress,  often took  several  months after an 
object was  launched. The  DOD released the data  in early April to the State 
Department;  the  N Y  Times  then  requested  and  received  the  information.

lune   11 :  The Rome Air  Development Center planned to award three contracts 
for work  in  support of the U.S.  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s 
(DARPA) proposal to  develop a multiple satellite  system  (MSS) consisting of 
several  hundred  low-cost,  low-o rbi t i ng com m u n i cat i ons  satel I i tes  i n several 
orbits,  Defense Daily reported. 
The satellites,  expected to cost about  $1  m i l l ion  each,  would comprise a 
highly  survivable,  high-bandwidth  global  communications  system  through 
the  combination  of  high  bandwidth  packet switches  and  burst  radios with 
low-cost proliferated,  low-orbiting satellites. Each satellite would carry a low- 
cost burst radio capable of instantaneous data rates on the order of 100 Mbps, 
along  w i th   digital  controllers  to  do   the  packet  switching  and  a  suitable 
antenna system  capable of  both omnidirectional and directive beams. 
The  contracts  would  be  for  study  of  burst  radio  development,  low-cost 
antenna design,  and  low-cost satellite  integration.  (D/D, June 11/85,  229) 

lune  28: A  8-52  equipped with the Navstar global positioning system  (GPS) 
flew  a mission over  the North Pole to prove the space-based  radio navigation 
system’s  ability to navigate a polar mission, the Air  Force System Command’s 
(AFSC) Newsreview  reported. The mission marked first time a preproduction 
Navstar CPS  was  used on a polar mission. The flight also tested the system’s 
high-latitude  navigation and compatibility  with  the  aircraft’s  inertial naviga- 
tion system  (INS). 
Navstar GPS,  when  completed  in the  late  1980s,  would  use  18  GPS  satel- 
lites  in  s i x  orbital  planes to give worldwide,  three-dimensional position and 

122  

Department  of  Defense 

velocity  information to U . S .  and allied land, sea,  and air forces. To  determine 
the position of an aircraft such as  the 8-52,  an onboard  receiver would pick 
up  signals  from  at  least  four  satellites  and  measure  the  time  i t  took  each 
signal  to travel  from  the satellite. 
The Navstar GPS on the B-52  aligned the inertial navigation system,  giving 
the  crew  constant  navigation during the  13-hour mission  despite  the  CPS 
being available only three hours. The GPS  and INS kept track of the aircraft‘s 
position  at  all  times,  even  when  crossing  lines  of  longitude  faster  than  the 
onboard screen could update them. 

Although  testing of the Navstar GPS  using the  8-52  was  almost complete, 
production  integration was  just beginning. The production  phase of  Navstar 
GPS  required bringing the three segments-space,  user,  and control-to 
full 
operational capability. The Air  Force expected two-dimensional capability  in  
1987,  three-dimensional  capability  in  1988.  (AFSC Newsreview, June 28/85,

August 28:  A  Titan  34-D  booster  carrying a classified  payload,  possibly  a 
reconnaissance satellite, exploded August 28 minutes after  launch from Van- 
denberg Air  Force Base,  the  N Y  Times  reported.  Because  of  the  classified 
payload,  the Air  Force  revealed  little  information  about the  launch.  Booster 
rockets typically carried an  internal destruct package that ground controllers 
could activate in  the event of a malfunction. 
The explosion and subsequent crash of the booster started a 20-acre brush 
fire  near  the  launch  pad.  An   A i r   Force  spokesman said  it took  firefighters 
more than five hours to extinguish the blaze. 
The Air  Force was  conducting  an  investigation  to determine  the  cause  of 
the booster failure.  (NYT; Aug 31/85,  A14) 

September  73: New car buyers in 1988 might find a Navstar Global  Position- 
ing  System  (GPS) receiver among their  list of options,  the Air  Force Systems 
Command Newsreview reported. 
”It  would essentially  be a small TV  screen  that  shows your  position  on a 
map,”  said  1st  Lt.  John Schoenewolf,  GPS  cargo  manager  for  the  Eastern 
Space  and  Missile  Center.  A  small  cursor,  or  mobile electronic  dot,  would 
pinpoint a car’s  location  to within  300 miles,  he added,  and map cassettes 
could be purchased separately. 
Before the  satellite electronic  car  map became a  reality,  along w i th  other 
GPS applications both military and civilian,  the Air  Force between 1986 and 
1988  would  have  to  launch  28  satellites,  the  most  ambitious  launch  rate 
attempted  in  space-launch history. 
“We  plan to  launch the satellites for  the GPS  system  at  a  rate of one every 
seven weeks  aboard the shuttle.” Schoenewolf said.  “We  w i l l  need a total of 

123  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

18 to start operating the system,  and the target year  i s   1988 to begin operat- 
ing.” 
The  East  Coast  Navstar  GPS  launch  facility  opened  in  August  at  Cape 
Canaveral Air  Force  Station  to  help make  possible  the  accelerated  launch 
rate. At the facility’s  ribbon cutting ceremony,  Maj. Gen. Donald Henderson 
said the facility  and GPS  itself “w i l l   revolutionize the way  we  perform preci- 
sion  navigation.” 
He  noted the satellite system would be the  largest constellation ever  estab- 
lished and would have an  influence on  everything that floats,  drives,  flies,  or 
submerges. (AFSC Newsreview, Sept  13/85,  5 )  

October  11:  The  Department of  Defense (DOD) decided  to drop  the  fee  i t  
planned to  charge civilian users of the Navstar Global Positioning System,  the 
Air  Force  System  Command  Newsreview  reported. William  Taft  IV,  deputy 
secretary of  defense,  said  deleting  the  user  fee  was  necessary  to  enhance 
worldwide aviation safety  and to avoid charge difficulties. He said the stand- 
ard  positioning  service  signal,  which  would  be  the  lower  of  two  accuracy 
levels,  would  be  broadcast  in   the  clear  and  available  to  any  properly 
equipped  user.  However, Congress could  reinstate user fees. 
The  precise  positioning  service  signal,  the  higher-accuracy signal,  would 
be encrypted and made available initially to the U.S.  and some a l l i e d  military 
users.  DOD would  permit  limited  civil  use  i f   i t  was  shown  to  be  i n   the 
national  interest,  adequate security  protection was  provided,  and compara- 
ble accuracy could not be obtained from another source,  DOD officials said. 
DOD  scheduled  the  Navstar  system,  a  continuous  worldwide  satellite- 
based  radio  navigation  system,  for  operation  in   the  late  1980s.  (AFSC 
Newsreview, Oct  11/85,  6 )  

October  7 7 :  American  University professor Jeffrey Richelson, testifying at the 
espionage  trial  of  former  Navy  intelligence analyst  Samuel  Morison,  said 
publication in   1984 of  three secret  KH-11  s p y   satellite  photos  in  lane’s De- 
fense  Weekly told  the  Soviets  nothing important  that  they  d id   not already 
know,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Morison,  who  worked  at  the  Naval 
Intelligence  Support center  in  Suitland,  Maryland,  had official  approval for 
his part-time job  as  U.S.  editor of lane’s Fighting  Ships and  in  1984 sent  the 
weekly  the  three  photos  in  hopes of  securing a full-time  job   there.  He was 
also  indicted  on  charges  of  keeping  in  his  apartment  two  classified  docu- 
ments about a May  1984 fire at a Soviet naval ammunition  depot. 
In his testimony,  Richelson said the Soviets already had the KH-11  manual, 
which they  had bought from a CIA officer,  as  well as  earlier published satel- 
lite photos to  show them how the system worked. 
Government witnesses earlier  testified that  the  photos sent  to Jane’s were 
potentially  valuable  to   the  Soviets  in  confirming the  KH-11’s  sophisticated 

124  

Department of  Defense 

workings and  in  disclosing U.S.  targeting  interests. Similarly,  a Navy   intelli- 
gence expert testified that the details about the ammunition  depot fires,  also 
gleaned from satellite photos, were so  precise that  it would have been “very 
damaging”  to the U.S.  i f  the documents had been  leaked. 
Richelson,  however,  said  public sources  had  provided much detail about 
the  KH-11  and other  satellite programs,  such  as  their  flight  paths over  the 
Soviet  Union,  their  altitude  (75  to  155  miles),  and  the  fact  that  a  Titan  3D 
rocket launched them and another so-called Keyhole satellite,  the KH-9.  He 
said i t  was well known that the KH-11  sent  i t s  pictures back to Washington in  
a matter of seconds via another satellite and that  i t  passed over  targets quite 
frequently. 
Another defense witness,  John Pike,  associate director  for  space  policy at 
the  Federation of American  Scientists,  testified on  what was  publicly availa- 
b le  about the KH-11,  saying DOD  would soon replace it w i th  a longer-lasting 
KH-12.  According to   Pike,  the  KH-11  orbited  the  Soviet  Union  11  times  a 
day,  had  the  capacity  to  take  pictures  continuously,  and  had  a  peripheral 
vision that could switch from extreme left to extreme right in  an  instant. 
The Washington Post s i x  days  later reported that Morison was  found guilty 
of espionage and theft and could be sentenced to up to 10 years  in  prison and 
fined 310,000  on each of four counts. (WPost, Oct 12/85,  A9,  Oct 18/85,  A l )  

Strategic Defense Initiative 

january  77:  The Wall Streetjournal printed Robert Jastrow‘s comments on the 
Union of Concerned Scientists’s (UCS) Space  Defense Initiative (SDI, or Star 
Wars)  report,  i n  which Jastrow noted that  although the  UCS  had originally 
stated the program would  require 2,400  satellites,  they  had corrected this to 
300,  making  the  program  not  a  seemingly  impractical  proposal  but  one 
readily affordable within  fiscal  limits on strategic forces. 
The  UCS  had  also  stated  in  its  report  that  the  neutral  particle beam  (to 
destroy  Soviet  missiles) would  require orbiting a 40,000-ton  accelerator,  an 
impossible task. However, Jastrow noted the correct weight of the accelerator 
was  25  tons,  quite  reasonable for earth orbit, and the  UCS had admitted the 
error. 
Also  on   the  SDI  program,  Space  World published  the  Council  on  Eco- 
nomic Priorities’s  (CEP) recommendations,  in which CEP  suggested  the  D e  
partment of Defense reduce emphasis on developing prototype systems until 
clarification of the technological uncertainties of deploying an effective over- 
all  space  defense and Congress  should significantly slow  SD l ’s   growth  rate 
until demonstration of  the  plan‘s  technical  feasibility.  ( WSj, Jan 17/85,  2-E;

k b r u a r y  20: Michael  Burch,  assistant secretary  of defense for  public affairs, 
said  beginning  in   1987,  two  years  earlier  than  planned,  two  Space  Shuttle 
flights a year  would  carry  experiments for  President Reagan‘s  Strategic  De- 
fense  Initiative (SDI) research  program,  with  initial  experiments testing  the 
ability to  detect, track,  and aim against targets i n  space,  the  Washington Post 
reported. 
The tracking and targeting tests,  developed in a Pentagon research program 
that antedated the Reagan Administration,  would  include a mounting device 
for  attaching the  telescopelike  sight  to  the  Space  Shuttle  and  sensors  that 
could  pick  up at  a distance equal  to  the width of  the  U.S.  the  “signature  of 
objects”  such as  the booster plume of a  missile. 
The  Department of  Defense had canceled a Space  Shuttle test  of  the  sys- 
tem’s  main telescope,  though sources said  it would continue  land-based tests 
to develop a more capable telescope.  Defense Secretary  Caspar Weinberger 
had said  the  previous year‘s  congressional SDI  program  budget  cuts would 
delay  by  one year  an  integrated-system demonstration.  ( W  Post,  Feb  20/85,

February  22:  In  testimony  February  21   before  the  Senate  Armed  Services 
Committee,  Lt.  Gen. James Abramhamson said  the  High  Frontier organiza- 
tion’s  proposal  for  a system  of  non-nuclear space  interceptors based  on  ki- 
netic-kill vehicles was an attractive weapons concept that could be deployed 
earlier than others,  but questioned whether  it was  the best system,  the  Wash- 
ington Post  reported. 
Retired Gen.  Daniel Graham,  High Frontier’s director  and former  director 
of the  Defense Intelligence Agency,  had proposed the satellitelaunched  sys- 
tem  of  kinetic-kill  vehicles  three  years  previously  as  a  possibly  near-term, 
space-based  missile defense.  Abramharnson  said  the  High  Frontier  system 
was simpler than other systems being considered and might be useful against 
the  current  generation of  missiles,  but said  he feared  such  a system  would 
only  drive  the  Soviets  to  deployment of  more missiles and  development of 
countermeasures. He  pointed  out  a  truly  effective space-based,  missile-de- 
fense  system  had  to  be  tied  in w i th   warhead  tracking and  command  and 
control  systems,  which he said would be ready  in  a decade or  less. 
Abrarnharnson  went  on  to   say  it would  be  the  early  1990s  before  the 
Strategic  Defense Initiative (SDI)-research effort would  be far  enough  along 
for a decision on which technologies  to develop for  a deployed  system;  an 
effective system would require a whole family of technologies. The  Washing- 
ton  Post  article quoted  Abramhamson concluding  that  he  “wouldn’t  give  a 
figged  nickel”  for  calculations  by  groups  such  as  the  Union of  Concerned 
Scientists that  space defense i s  impossible. ( W  Post,  Feb  22/85,  8A) 

March  78:  Lt.  Gen.  James Abramhamson,  in   testimony  before  the  Senate 
armed  service strategic and  theater  nuclear  forces  subcommittee,  said  that 

126

bringing down the cost of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program was  a 
critical factor  in proving that SDI was  affordable,  Defense Da i ly  reported. The 
aim was to have a program that was  “practicable and could be implemented,” 
he said. 
Abramhamson  told  the  subcommittee  that  he  believed  the  SDI  program 
would develop a sufficient base of  understanding by the early  1990s so that 
“we  could be  reasonably confident  that decisions  could  be made  [for mov- 
ing] into the  initial portions of a  layered defense.” 
He pointed out that,  although a  limited defense system  using conventional 
weapons might  be possible by  1995,  the emphasis on weapons was  not the 
problem,  but rather i t  was  putting together the command and control  by that 
time.  However,  he  added  that  i f   a  national  decision  were  made  to  have  a 
limited defense system by  1995, this would be possible. (D/D, Mar 18/85,  89) 

March 29:  Robert Cooper,  director of  the  Defense Advanced  Research  Pro- 
jects  Agency  (DARPA),  in  testimony before the  U.S.  House Armed  Services 
Committee’s  research  and  development  subcommittee,  said  the  U.S.  had 
developed  a  secret  graphite  coating that  could  shield  spacecraft,  satellites, 
and  missiles  from  Soviet  laser  beams,  the  Washington  Times  reported. The 
new material could be highly effective a t   a  modest weight  penalty,  perhaps 
1Ooh of a spacecraft or missile’s  payload, and could withstand as  much as  100 
times more laser energy deposited on  it than  the typical aerospace  material. 
The CIA estimated that the Soviets could  have a space-based  laser capable of 
shooting at U.S.  satellites by  1988 and one capable of shooting at targets on 
the ground possibly  by  1990. 
The development added a new dimension to the controversy over  President 
Reagan’s  Strategic  Defense  Initiative. Critics  had  argued  that  it  would  be 
difficult  i f  not  impossible  for  a  space-based  laser  to  destroy  an  ascending 
missile in  its early  and vulnerable boost phase  before  its multiple warheads 
had been  launched.  Development of  the  new class  of  lightweight shielding 
materials  appeared  to  bolster  this  argument,  increasing  the  possibility  of 
missiles as  well  as  spacecraft and  satellites  being made  impervious to  laser 
destruction. 
When questioned about the Soviets using such a material to thwart a U.S. 
space-based defense system,  Cooper replied,  “ 1   don’t  know what  implemen- 
tation  it has  for  a Soviet space or  missile system.  I’m  not sure  they  have  the 
technology,  or even could achieve it in the near term.”  ( W  Times,  Mar 29/85, 
1 A) 

Ap r i l23 :  Anthony Battista,  the U.S.  House Armed Services R&D subcommit- 
tee senior staff adviser,  said on April  3  that a “reasonable”  funding effort for 
the Reagan Administration’s  Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program would 
be between $2.2  and  $3   billion for  FY  86,  Defense Da i ly  reported. Battista 

127  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

noted that the reductions in  SDI should be taken from surveillance,  acquisi- 
tion,  and targeting,  which  represented about $1.5 b i l l ion  of the $3.7 billion 
requested by  the  administration  and  that  “the  one  troublesome  part  about 
SDI,  from a command and control point of view  right now,  i s  that there i s  not 
enough emphasis on the hardening of detectors to live in  the thermo-nuclear 
environment. I’m  worried  about the ability of missiles to live in  that environ- 
ment.“ 
However,  in  testimony  before the  Senate defense appropriations  subcom- 
mittee,  Under Secretary of Defense Fred  lkle said on April 23 that a reduction 
i n  the  FY 86 SDI budget would  be extremely harmful to the  program and a 
poor policy decision. SDI  “ is   not some optional experiment, to be continued 
or  curtailed  depending  on  short-term budgetary  or  arms  control  consider- 
ations:’  he  said.  “It  i s   a  vital  long-term  effort  to  strengthen  our  ability  to 
prevent nuclear war. 
”.  .  .  If we slow down the SDI  in  this early phase,  we would not have the 
answers  in  the next decade that we  need to chart our  long-term strategy and 
arms control policy.” The Administration planned to spend $4.9 b i l l ion  in FY 
87 and $16 b i l l ion  in  FY 88-89 on the program. (D /D ,  Apr 3/85, 185, 24/85,

M a y 4  France turned down President Reagan’s  invitation to participate in the 
U.S.  Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) project because of the subordinate role 
France would have to play and because i t  was at that time promoting i t s  own 
French-led  European  advanced  technology/space  research  project  that  in- 
cluded  some  key  technologies  related  to  strategic defense,  Defense  Daily 
reported. 
French President Francois Mitterrand told a news conference May 4 at  the 
close  of  the  Bonn  economic  summit  that  President Reagan  used  the  term 
“subcontractors”  in  reference to Europe’s  role in  the SDI  project, which con- 
firmed  his  view  that  the  US.  would  not  treat  France  and  other  European 
countries as  equal  partners in  SDI  and that  they would  not get access  to all 
research  results. 
“The  technology  interests me,”  Mitterrand said,  “but  the strategic project i s  
interesting only  for  the  future when  man  becomes a  master  of  space.”  He 
urged  other  European  nations  to  jo in   France  in  an  independent  advanced 
technology R&D program called “Eureka,”  which would explore civilian uses 
of  space  and other advanced technologies  including high-power lasers,  o p  
tics,  microelectronics,  and high-speed computers. Although  these  technolo- 
gies  would  apply  to  a  number  of  areas  including  strategic  defense,  the 
primary  aim  of  Eureka  would  be  to  “explore  space  through  advanced  re- 
search  in  order  to master new technologies,”  Mitterrand said.  He  noted that 
Eureka was  important for  Europe because of the need to ”preserve their fund 
of  intelligence, technology,  and brains. A l l  this has to be mobilized in  a great 
project that  is  European.” 

128

According to reports, Mitterrand told Reagan that he was  concerned about 
actual  deployment  of  SDI  because  i t  could alter  the  strategy of  mutual  as- 
sured destruction that had successfully prevented nuclear war.  (France had its 
own  small  nuclear deterrent,  but  i t  was  more vulnerable to  ballistic missile 
defense than the  large strategic forces of the  U.S.  and USSR.) 
France  had  agreed  to  support  the  European Space  Agency's  proposal  to 
define a pressurized module called Columbus for the U.S.  space station,  i f  all 
parties could work  out adequate arrangements. (D/D, May  7/85,  35)  

May  70:  The  Australian  minister  of  defense,  Mr.  Beazley,  confirmed  that 
Australia would  help test a new U.S.  satellite system called  "Teal  Ruby" that 
was associated w i th  the space defense system known as  the Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI), FBIS,  Melbourne  Overseas  Service  in  English reported.  Mr. 
Beazley  stressed,  however,  that  Australia's  involvement was  not  directly  re- 
lated to SDI and would end the following year. 
He said  the  U.S.  would  use Australian defense vessels  and aircraft to  test 
the satellite system using infrared rays and that the project had some benefits 
for  Australia over the  long term  because of  that country's  surveillance prob- 
lems.  He  pointed  out  that  infrared  sensing  was  a  good  way  to  maintain 
surveillance af countries with electronic warfare systems. 
However,  the  Australian  Democrats's  Spokesman,  Senator  Mason,  con- 
demned  the  decision,  saying  the  research was  an  essential  part of  the  SDI 
system and that the Australian government was  guilty of hyprocrisy in  agree- 
ing  to  participate in  the  testing.  (FBIS,  Melbourne  Overseas  Service  in  En- 
glish,  May  10/85) 

May  23: The  Pentagon's  Strategic  Defense  Initiative (SDI) office said  today 
that  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery would  participate in  June in  the  first  SDI 
experiment in  orbit, carrying a mirror  intended to intercept and reflect a laser 
beam  fired  from  earth,  the  Washington Post  reported.  In some  missile  de- 
fense  systems,  a large orbiting mirror would  receive a powerful beam from a 
ground-based laser and reflect i t  to destroy an enemy missile, but in  the space 
shuttle  experiment,  the  laser  beam would  be too  weak  to  harm  the  space- 
craft. A small mirror would reflect the beam back to the ground so engineers 
could verify their ability to keep the  laser pointed at  the orbiting mirror. 
The  laser  would  travel  from  an  Air  Force  Base  on  Maui,  Hawaii,  and 
bounce  back  by  a  special  8-in.diameter  "retroreflector"  that  astronauts 
would  place in one of  the Space  Shuttle's  middeck side windows  while the 
spacecraft was  over  the Pacific. 
An  SDI  spokesman  said  the  laser  had  successfully  tracked during earlier 
tests  an  airplane carrying the mirror at an altitude of 30,000  feet.  The Space 
Shuttle flew  in  orbit at  100 miles and more. 
The  test,  called  the  high  precision  tracking experiment,  was  the  f i rs t   in a 
series that the SDI office had booked aboard the Space Shuttle. Beginning in  

129  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

1987,  the Pentagon would fly two major SDI experiments each year.  ( W  Post, 
May 24/85,  A8) 

DuringMay: Brigadier General Robert Rankine, Jr.,  U.S.  Air  Force,  writing in 
Aerospace about the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), said that,  ”In  the  long 
term, we have confidence that SDI w i l l  be a crucial means by which both the 
U.S.  and  the  Soviet  Union  can  safely  agree  to  very  deep  reductions  and 
eventually even the elimination of ballistic missiles and the nuclear weapons 
they carry. This does not represent a shift from the basic deterrent strategy of 
the  US.,  but  represents a new means for enhancing deterrence. 
”.  .  . A ballistic missile defense capability has the potential of  increasing 
deterrence and adding to stability,  by  increasing substantially the  uncertain- 
ties in the success of nuclear attack by an enemy,  thoroughly confounding his 
targeting  strategy,  thus  significantly  reducing  or  eliminating  the  utility  of 
preemptive attack. The system  need not be perfect to accomplish this objec- 
tive,  but most meet three  important criteria: 
-effective  against the systems and countermeasures that exist or could  be 
deployed, 
-sufficiently  survivable that  i t  would  not encourage an attack  on  the  sys- 
tem  itself  .  .  . 
-effective  at  lower cost than any  proliferation or countermeasure attempts 
to overcome it. 
“.  .  .  Some of the opponents of the Strategic Defense Initiative,”  Rankine 
said,  “have  argued that the research and technology program currently under 
way  i s   inconsistent with  the  ABM  treaty  and  conflicts with  arms  control  in 
general. Quite  to the contrary,  the  initiative it totally consistent with  current 
U.S.  ABM  treaty  obligations. The  initiative contemplates only  research  and 
experimentation on  a  broad  range of  defense  technologies  to  provide  the 
basis  for  a  decision  in  the  future  whether  or  not to develop  systems  which 
would provide an effective ballistic missile defense capability.” 
Rankine then  described  the  technical  scope  of  SDI  and  said  the  program 
was  broken  into  five  major  program  elements:  surveillance,  acquisition, 
tracking and kill,  assessment; directed energy weapons;  kinetic energy weap  
ons;  systems  analysis  and  battle management;  and  an  assortment  of  other 
high-priority technologies  that d id  not warrant separate  program elements. 
Rankine concluded that  the  goal for  SDI  had  not changed since the  Presi- 
dent’s  March 1983 speech  proposing the system, when he “challenged  a l l  of 
us  in  the  scientific  community  to  create  a  means  for  rendering  ballistic 
missiles  impotent and obsolete.”  (Aerospace,  Spring 85,  2)  

lu ly   14:  The  first  in   a  series  of  laser  experiments  in  the  Strategic  Defense 
Initiative (SDI) program  was  only  partly successful  because  laser  operators 
were  unable  to  lock  on  to  a  fast,  high-flying  rocket  target,  the  N Y  Times 
reported. A  laser station on the  island of Maui succeeded in focusing a  laser

beam on the rocket but failed to bounce the beam off an eight-inch reflective 
shield attached to  it,  said unidentified  sources. 
The  Pentagon had announced  i t  was  preparing a new  round of  laser tests 
similar  to  one  conducted  in June when  a  low-power  blue-green  laser  was 
reflected off  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery. On  July 16  the  Pentagon  issued a 
statement saying the  first  of five planned experiments was  conducted  in  the 
early  morning of  July 14  and  that  “it  was  only  partially  successful  due  to 
technical difficulties  not associated with  the experiment.” 
Officials  in   the  SDI  office  refused  to  elaborate  beyond  that  saying  the 
Navy’s  Pacific Missile Range Facility launched a Terrier-Malemute rocket that 
traveled almost 450 miles into space and that the  laser had been fired.  (NYT  
July 16/85,  C7) 

August  4:  In a  study  important to the  U.S.  Strategic  Defense  Initiative (SDI) 
missile defense  program,  Space  Shuttle crew  aboard Challenger on  mission 
51-F  briefly  fired  the  orbiter’s  rocket  engines  while  scientists  in  Australia 
attempted  to  analyze  the  effect  on  the  ionosphere,  the  Washington  Post 
reported . 
Challenger’s engines burned  600  Ib. of  fuel  as  the  spacecraft passed  over 
an  observatory  in   Tasmania  where  telescopes  measured  the  effect  of  the 
rocket exhaust on the charged gas  particles, called plasma,  that made up the 
ionosphere. 
A  second shorter  rocket firing took  place over  observatories in Massachu- 
setts.  ( W  Post,  Aug 5/85,  A4) 

September  6:  The  Department  of  Defense  announced  that, a  large  high- 
powered chemical  laser destroyed at a distance of six-tenths of a mile a  large 
liquid-fuel  booster  stage  from  a  Titan  2  rocket  in   an  experiment  for  the 
Strategic  Defense  Initiative  (SDI) program,  the  Arizona  Republic  reported. 
The experiment, conducted at White Sands Missile Range,  New Mexico, was 
significant  ”because  this  was  the  first  full-scale  test  against  an  object  this 
large,”  said Mary Pshak,  a  spokeswoman for  the  SDI organization. “We  had 
done  a  lot  of  subscale  testing,  but  this  particular experiment  verified  our 
earlier tests,”  she  noted. 
Pshak declined to discuss the amount of power used because the  informa- 
tion was  classified,  but said the  laser was  a  large working  model of MIRACL 
(mid-infrared chemical laser), considered the  largest weapon-grade device of 
its type developed  in  the  U.S.  However, the  SDI  research  program also was 
focusing on other types of  lasers,  some of which were considered even more 
promising.  (Ar iz .  Republic, Sept  14/85,  A28) 

October 4:  Department of Defense scientists the previous week  sent concen- 
trated  laser  beams  adjusted  for  atmospheric  distortion  from  an  Air  Force 

131  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

facility  on Maui,  Hawaii,  to a retroreflector on a Terrier-Malemute sounding 
rocket  launched from  the  Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility in  Hawaii,  the 
Los Angeles  Times reported. The test demonstrated for the first time that the 
U.S.  could fire such a beam through the  atmosphere and  prevent air  mole- 
cules from distorting and weakening it. The  test appeared to be a significant 
technical  achievement  because  distortion,  or  “blooming,”  of  a  laser  as  i t  
passed through air could totally block the beam. 
To  correct  beam  distortion,  engineers  developed  a  flexible  mirror  that, 
taking orders from computers, distorted the beam at  the start of its journey to 
compensate,  or  correct,  in  advance  the  dispersing effects of  the  air  mole- 
cules. 
The sounding rocket reached an altitude of over  350  nautical miles with a 
flight  time  of  10  minutes,  Defense Daily  reported.  Return of  telemetry data 
from the diagnostic array aboard the  rocket confirmed test success. 
Defense Secretary  Caspar Weinberger announced the test during a speech 
at a Philadelphia World Affairs Council  luncheon for what appeared to be the 
start of a Reagan Administration campaign to justify continuing its $26-billion 
Strategic  Defense  Initiative  (SDI)  research  effort  in   the  face  of  intensified 
USSR protests over  the  program.  (LA Times, Oct 4/85,  A5;  D/D, Oct  18/85, 
251) 

October  71 :  The U.S.  Air  Force Space Technology Center‘s  Kirtland Contract- 
ing  Center  awarded  Aerojet  Electro  Systems  a  $17-million  contract  and 
Hughes  Aircraft  a  $21-million  contract  for  work  on  the  Strategic  Defense 
Initiative  (SDI) program,  the  Air  Force  Systems  Command  Newsreview  re- 
ported. 
Under  the  contracts  the  companies  would  develop  and  bu i ld   a  space 
surveillance sensor  called  “the  precursor above  the  horizon sensor,”  which 
would  look  across  space  using  several  frequency  bands  in  the  long-wave 
infrared spectrum to track  the  trajectory of  intercontinental ballistic missiles 
or space  systems.  (AFSC Newsreview, Oct  11/85,  3) 

Nowmber  18:  Britain and  the  U.S.  in  the  last week  of  October  reached an 
outline  agreement  on  British  participation  in  the  U.S.’s  Strategic  Defense 
initiative  (SDI) program that  d id   not  guarantee Britain any  specific  share  in 
SDI  research,  development,  or  production  contract awards,  but d id   provide 
assurances  on  technology  transfer  acceptable  to  Michael  Heseltine,  British 
Secretary  of  State  for  Defense,  Aviation  Week  reported.  However,  Defense 
Daily  later reported that Britain decided to delay signing its formal agreement 
of  participation. 
The delay apparently  stemmed from  Britain’s  political embarassment over 
loss   of  the  United  States  Army’s  Mobile  subscriber  equipment  (MSE) pro- 
gram. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Heseltine had intervened in  the 
MSE  competition,  although reportedly unaware that the disparity in  the bids 

132  

Department of  Defense 

was  beyond the  ability of  political  influence to  set  right. Also,  Britain's  De- 
partment of Trade and Industry was  said to be objecting to certain provisions 
of  the  agreement,  including  property  rights  to  certain  technologies  devel- 
oped during Britain's SDI participation. (AvWk, Nov 4/85,  26;  D /D ,   Nov 18/ 
85 ,  81) 

December 6 :  Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and British Defense Min- 
ister Michael Heseltine signed a memorandum of understanding for Britain's 
participation  in  the  U .S .   Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program,  Defense 
Daily reported. The signing came one day after British Prime Minister Marga- 
ret Thatcher  had told  Parliament that  the  negotiations over  British participa- 
tion  were  not  finished  but  that  she  hoped  for  a  signed  agreement  before 
Christmas. 
Joining Heseltine at a press conference following the signing,  Weinberger 
said it "emphasizes both the closeness of our alliance and the special  nature 
of our  relationship which  i s  a very vital  thing"  to both countries.  "Britain  i s  
the  leader  in  many  of  these  technologies  and we  want  very  much  to  have 
these capabilities placed at  the benefit of the program,"  he said. 
Heseltine explained the signing of the agreement one day  after Thatcher's 
statement to  Parliament, saying both he and Weinberger  had  received com- 
muniques overnight  from  their  teams  in  Washington  permitting  completion 
of  the  agreement.  Heseltine  said  the  agreement  offered  a  "very  significant 
opportunity for British industry and for  British research capability  to be asso- 
ciated w i th  a major and exciting program at  the frontiers of  human capabili- 
ties  in  many of the technologies of  tomorrow."  (D/D,. Dec 9/85, 185) 

December  28: The  Department  of  Energy's  Lawrence  Livermore  National 
Laboratory supervised  detonation of  a  hydrogen  bomb  buried  in a boxcar 
sized canister  1,800 feet  below the  Nevada desert floor  in  a test of  technol- 
ogy  for President Reagan's  Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the  Washington 
Post reported.  An  Energy  Department official  declined  to  discuss  the  test's 
purpose,  but Defense Department and congressional officials said earlier that 
i t  was designed to test the concept of harnessing X-rays  produced by a nuclear 
explosion  into a laser cannon to destroy Soviet missiles. 
The nuclear explosive had a force of 2 0  to 150  kilotons, the Energy Depart- 
ment spokesman said,  registering 5 . 6  on the  Richter scale,  according to an 
official at the  National  Earthquake Information Center  in  Boulder, Colorado. 
i t  measured 5 . 3  at the California  Institute of Technology in  Pasadena. 
The Energy  Department postponed the test several times because of  unfa- 
vorable winds and the Christmas holidays. Scientists routinely delayed under- 
ground nuclear tests  i n  the Nevada desert when winds were blowing toward 
the south and west because of the possibility that  in  an accident a radioactive 
cloud might drift over a populated area.  ( W  Post,.  Dec 29/85, A5)

EUROPEAN  SPACE AGENCY  

January  78:  Ministers from  Belgium,  Denmark,  France, W.  Germany,  Ireland, 
Italy,  The  Netherlands,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  the  U.K.,  Austria,  Nor- 
way,  and Canada would  meet  in  Rome January 30 and  31  to consider  pro- 
posed space  projects and  set  the  agenda for  European Space  Agency  (ESA) 
through  the  remainder of  the  century,  the JSC Roundup reported. Ministers 
would consider  proposals ranging from development of  a  space  station pro- 
gram,  possibly  in  conjunction  with  the  U.S.,  to eventual pursuit of manned 
spaceflight. 
ESA  said i t  would propose a substantial increase in  its activities, particularly 
scientific and  technological  programs;  developments  in  earth  observations, 
telecommunications,  microgravity  processing,  and  technology;  and  con- 
struction of a new version of Ariane 5.  ESA’s  efforts with Spacelab and Ariane 
and  in  a wide range of other activities such  as  the Giotto probe to  intercept 
Halley’s Comet had required the  new decisions. 
With Ariane 3 operational,  ESA  said  it expected to  introduce an  upgraded 
version, Ariane 4,  in  March 1986,  followed  by the proposed Ariane 5,  which 
would  be capable of  generating up to  220,000  Ib. of  thrust,  that  could  be 
used to  launch European astronauts into orbit. The ministers had to decide 
whether to authorize development of the large cryogenic engine to power the 
launcher. USC  Roundup, Jan 18/85,  1;  ESA  release Jan 17/85) 

February  4:  Western  European  cabinet  ministers  in  a  two-day  meeting  in 
Rome agreed to participate in the 1992 U.S.  launch of a permanently manned 
space  station,  the  European Space  Agency  (ESA)  announced. The  ministers 
also  increased the  ESA  budget and  approved funding  for  Ariane  5, making 
clear their  intent to pursue independent European space activities,  but failed 
to  decide on a French-sponsored plan for  a small space  shuttle  (called Her- 
mes). 
ESA  would  base  its  participation  in   the  U.S.  space  station  on  an  Italo- 
German project called Columbus, w i th  an estimated $2-billion project cost. 
Although  W.  Germany,  Britain,  and  Italy had  made funding  commitments, 
France had not announced its project share. 
The ministers’ decision ended controversy over  European cooperation with 
the U.S.,  which had resulted from an earlier U.S./European  cooperative effort 
that ended negatively when a $750 m i l l ion  investment in  the  1973 Spacelab 
produced little significant research or technological spinoffs,  the Washington 
Post  reported. 
ESA  also announced i t s  annual expenditures would  increase 70% to almost 
$1.3  b i l l ion   by  1990.  (ESA  release  Feb  4/85,  Jan 31/85;  W  Post,  Feb  1/85,

Februa1y44:The European Space Agency (ESA )   announced i t  would hand over 
on February 5 M A R K S  8-2  to the International Maritime Satellite organiza- 
tion  (INMARSAT) for  commercial  operation.  The  spacecraft,  launched  N e  
vember  10  and  operational  since January 8, would  complete  INMARSAT’S 
first-generation satellite system,  which would offer worldwide service cover- 
ing three oceans: the Atlantic  region with MARKS -A   positioned a t  26O W, 
the Indian Ocean w i th  INTELSATMCSA at 63O E,  and the Pacificocean with 
M A R K S  8-2  at  176.5O E. 
In preparation for future communications satellite services,  ESA in  coopera- 
tion  with  INMARSAT  was  conducting  experiments  with  M A R K S  B-2  to 
design economically operated equipment compact enough for  installation in 
small whicles.  (ESA  release Feb 4/85) 

February 9: The European launcher Ariane 3  launched two satellites,  Brazil’s 
Brasilsat  7  and the Arab  Arabsat  7,  FBIS AFP  in  Spanish  reported. Frederick 
D’AIlest,  French Center for Space Studies director general,  noted Ariane had 
taken off on schedule,  down to the exact hour planned a year  previously. 
Ariane’s  three  sections functioned  perfectly, and the  3rd one  had  reached 
satelliteejection speed a t  an altitude of 210 km;  three minutes later Arabsat  7 
separated from  the  rocket,  followed  a  half  minute  later by  Brasilsat  7.  The 
satellites would  require  several  weeks  to  reach  their  geostationary  orbits: 
Arabsat  7  over  Zaire,  Brasilsat  7  above  central Brazil.  (FBIS  AFP  in  Spanish, 
Feb 9/85) 

May 7: The  European Space  Agency  (EM) launched at  9:15  p.m.  EST  today 
from  Kourou an  Ariane  rocket that  successfully deployed two telecommuni- 
cations  satellites  including a  U.S.-built  G-Star  7, 
the  Washington Post  re- 
ported.  A  breakdown  in   timing  between  the  rocket  and  the  EWs  various 
earth-based satellite tracking stations delayed launch 79 minutes. 
ESA  officials  described  the  launch  as  “another  success’’  in   the  agency’s 
competition  w i th   the  U.S.  Space  Shuttle  to  capture  the  world  market  for 
satellite  launches.  The  Ariane  rocket  was  the  13th  fired,  including  two 
aborted  launches,  since  1979. The  previous launch February 9 also  put two 
satellites into orbit.  Officials said  they  had nearly 30 orders to  launch com- 
mercial satellites,  compared w i th  about 60 orders for the Space  Shuttle. 
The  Ariane  rocket  deployed  the  G-Star  7  satellite,  owned  by  the  GTE 
Spacenet Corp.,  and the French  Te /ecomdB  20 minutes after  liftoff at about 
22,000 miles above the equator.  ( W  Post,  May 8/85, A261 

May 75:  Roger  Bonnet,  director of the European Space Agency‘s  (ESA)  scien- 
tific  programs,  speaking today  a t  the opening of a  meeting w i th  the  USSR’s 
“lntercosmos”  Council for  International Cooperation, Soviet Academy of Sci- 
ences,  said,  “We  are  keenly  interested  in  extending cooperation with  the 

136 

European Space  Agency 

Soviet Union in  space exploration,”  FBIS,  TASS  in  English reported. “The  first 
results of our  joint  work  and experiments have  given  us  reasons  for  making 
the most optimistic forecasts  and opened up new opportunities for  studying 
and using space  for  peaceful purposes.” 
The program for the threeday meeting included discussion of details of the 
Soviet  “Vega”  mission  to  study  Venus  and  Halley’s  Comet  and  review  of 
preparations  for  a  similar  West  European  program  called  “Giotto,”  which 
would use data from the Soviet probe. 
Attendees also  heard reports on the Soviet  “Phobos”  project for  the com- 
prehensive  study  of  Mars  and  i t s   satellites and  E W s   plans  to  develop  an 
orbital radio telescope.  (FBIS,  Tass  in  English,  May  15/85) 

l u n e   72:  The  European Space  Agency  (ESA) announced  that,  as  a  result of 
decisions  made January 30  and  31   at  i t s   council  meeting  in  Rome,  it had 
created an earth observation and microgravity directorate, a telecommunica- 
tions  directorate,  and,  due  to  the  magnitude of  ESA’s  Columbus  program,  a 
directorate dedicated to that program. 
The ESA  Council at i t s  June 11  and 12 meeting made the following nomina- 
tions to the new director  posts:  Philip Goldsmith,  United Kingdom,  director 
of earth observation and microgravity program;  Giorgio Salvator,  Italy,  direc- 
tor of telecommunications;  and Dr.  Fredrik Engstrom,  Sweden,  director of the 
Columbus program. 
In addition,  the council appointed Marius Le  Fevre,  France,  to the  post of 
director of EWs  space  research and technology establishment.  (ESA  Release, 
June 12/85) 

l u l y   1:  The  European Space  Agency  (ESA)  announced  that  M.  Bignier,  ESA 
director of space transportation systems,  and Ing. Heise,  executive vice presi- 
dent  and  president of  the  Space  Systems  Group of  MesserschmidVBoIkow- 
Blohm (MBB)/Erno,  signed  a  contract  for  the development of  the  European 
Retrievable Carrier,  EURECA,  a  payload carrier  intended for  use on  the  U.S. 
Space  Shuttle.  MBB/Erno  would  serve  as  EURECA  prime  contractor  with 
support  from  some  24   European  industrial  firms.  The  approximately  $95 
m i l l ion  contract called for delivery of the EURECA flight unit to NASA  by the 
end of  1987 for  launch from  the Space  Shuttle  in  March 1988 and  recovery, 
by  the Space Shuttle,  s ix  months  later. 
The  first EURECA  payload, developed  by  European national institutes and 
space  agencies,  would consist primarily of  experiments in  the  microgravity 
sciences (life and material sciences) and a  limited number of experiments in  
space science and technology. Work on the payload would proceed in  paral- 
lel w i th   the  development  of  the  carrier,  and  plans called  for  delivery  of  a l l  
payload  elements  to  MBB/Erno  by  spring  1987  for  integration  onboard 
EURECA  before shipment to the U.S. 

137 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

The  EURECA  payload carrier  incorporated the  more attractive  features of 
Spacelab and  in  addition  provided for  relatively  long duration  flights (up to 
eight months), higher power and mass capability  for  the payload,  and  lower 
costs compared with Spacelab and many conventional satellites because the 
system  occupied only about 2.5  m of the Space Shuttle orbiter cargo bay. 
ESA  also  envisioned  EURECA's  eventual  use  in  association  with  the  pro- 
posed US .  space  station,  with  the  EURECA operating either  in  a freeflying 
mode  (co-orbiting  with  the  space  station  or  in   polar  orbit)  or  as  a  man- 
tended,  semipermanent  payload  carrier  with  modified  docking  facilities. 
(ESA  release July 1/85) 

August  7:  The European Space Agency  (ESA) announced that following vali- 
dation  tests  of  the  second  Ariane  launch  site  (ELA-2)  in   Kourou,  French 
Guiana,  it  accepted  the  new  facilities  and  made  them  available  to   the 
Arianespace  company  for  international use.  ELA-2  would  provide  an  en- 
hanced capability  for  launching the Ariane 2,  3 ,   and 4 and make  it possible 
to reduce the interval between launches to one month and carry out up  to  ten 
launches per year  at  lower operating costs. 
The new complex close to the current Ariane launch site had two separate 
zones,  a launcher preparation zone and the launch zone,  linked by a one-km 
rail line. This configuration made possible two simultaneous launch prepara- 
tions  and  provided  considerable operational  flexibility.  Arianespace  could 
assemble  one  launcher  in  the  preparation zone,  while  another,  previously 
transported on a mobile table to the  launch zone,  underwent final checkout 
prior to  launch. 
The French National Space Centre (CNES) was  prime contractor for ELA-2 
construction,  which took  four years  to complete.  ELA-2  would become Eu- 
rope's  main launch complex;  ELA-1  would  serve as  the backup. Arianespace 
scheduled the first  launch from ELA-2  for December 1985, using an Ariane 3 
to  launch Brasilsat 2 and G-STAR  2.  (ESA  release Aug  1/85) 

August 2: The European Space Agency announced that  it had signed w i th  the 
Commission  of  the  European  Communities an  agreement  to  cooperate  on 
the APOLLO project, which would provide, through the EUTELSAT 1  series of 
communications satellites developed by ESA  and European industry,  a high- 
speed  digital  information  transfer  system  suitable  for  long data  messages, 
particularly document facsimiles,  transmitted from  a small  number of  infor- 
mation providers (up to  10) to many widely dispersed users. 
The agreement provided for development as  specified by  ESA  of prototype 
equipment by European industry and for the Commission with the assistance 
of  ESA  to  provide  overall  coordination  of  APOLLO,  including  archives 
planned for the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 
in  Luxembourg and for several other  large document archives  in  Europe. 

138 

European Space  Agency 

The  commission  estimated  that  APOLLO  would  help  to  provide a  long- 
term  infrastructure for a market expected to expand greatly over the next five 
years and to contribute to  experience i n  the design,  costing, and operation of 
small  dish  earth  terminals  and  other  equipment  developed  for  APOLLO. 
APOLLO  could also  stimulate  the  creation  of  a market for  European earth 
stations and associated equipment. 
Trial  users  transferring  digital  records,  documents,  and  computer  files 
would  assess  the  system  for  high-speed and  high-quality  information.  (ESA 
release Aug 2/85) 

September  12: Arianespace officials blew up  the  European Space Agency's 
(ESA) Ariane V15  rocket, which carried the third in  the European Communi- 
cations  Satellites  (ECS-3)  series and the  U.S.  communications satellite Spa- 
cenet F3,  less than ten minutes after  liftoff when the rocket veered off course 
and began falling,  threatening inhabited areas,  the Washington Post  reported. 
The  failure  was  Ariane's  third  in   15  launches.  French  President  Francois 
Mitterrand, on a stopover on his way  to French Polynesia,  watched the failed 
launching. 
Liftoff at the Kourou (French Guiana) launch site was  on schedule at 8:26 
p.m.  Reports said Ariane was  on course during the first minutes of  its ascent, 
but then i t  suddenly went off course and lost altitude because of a propulsion 
problem  in  the third-stage motor. 
Ariane's  other failures were on May 23,  1980,  on i ts  second launch,  and on 
May 9,  1982, on  i t s  fifth.  ( W  Post,  Sept  13/85,  A12;  ESA  release Sept 2/85) 

October 24: The European Space Agency (ESA) announced today that during 
the  71st meeting October  23  and 24  of the Council  of the European Space 
Agency  i t  unanimously approved the accession of Austria and Noway  to full 
membership status,  bringing ESA  membership to  13  countries. 
The agreement between ESA  and the governments of Austria and Norway 
required  governmental  approval  and  parliamentary  ratification  in   the  two 
countries w i th  the intention of giving them full membership status on January 
1,  1987. 
The decision followed a period of close cooperation between ESA  and the 
two countries,  both of which had been closely associated w i th  many of ESA's

December  70:  ESA  announced  i t  signed  three  contracts  with  Arianespace, 
two  for  future  launches-ECS-4 
scheduled for  the  second  quarter  of  1986 
and Hipparcos scheduled for June 1988-and  one for technical assistance for 
satellite launches on the first  flight of Ariane 4.

ECS-4 would  replace ECS-3,  lost as a  result of the  launch failure Septem- 
ber 12 of Ariane V15.  ECS-4  was  in  production at that time, and ESA  acceler- 
ated  its completion. Arianespace was  providing the earliest possible launch 
slot  in  accordance with  the  relaunch conditions  in  the  ECS-3 
launch con- 
tract. 
Hipparcos would  provide measurements  of  the  positions,  annual  proper 
motions,  and  parallaxes of  some  100,000  stars.  From  its position  in  geosta- 
tionary orbit,  the satellite systematically and  repeatedly throughout  its two- 
and-a-half-year  lifetime would  scan  the whole  sky,  providing measurements 
that would serve as a reference system of unprecedented precision,  important 
i n  studies of earth's  motion,  the solar  system,  and our galaxy,  and forming a 
basis for  future ground and space astrometry. 
Under the third contract, the first flight  of Ariane 4,  part of  ESA's  Ariane 4 
development program,  would  be carried out  under ESA's  responsibility. The 
launch,  scheduled  to  take  place during the  third  quarter  of  1986,  was  de- 
signed to  demonstrate the operational capability of  Europe's  most  powerful 
launcher.  ESA  was  supplying part of the payload,  Meteosat P2,  a refurbished 
spacecraft from the preoperational series,  designed to  bridge a possible gap 
between Meteosat 2  and  the  first  of  the operational meteorological space- 
craft,  MOP-1,  scheduled  for  launch  in   late  1987.  Additional  payload  ele- 
ments would be Amsat Phase Ill-C,  the second unit of the third generation of 
the amateur  radio "Oscar"  series,  and a  telecommunications satellite yet  to 
be selected.  (ESA  release Dec  10/85)

February  4: Under pressure from  the  Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC)  to  define  its  requirements  in  the  internationally authorized  1,544  to 
1,660.5  MHz-frequency band and to make allocations in  this band for com- 
mercial mobile-user  communications and  surveillance systems,  the  Federal 
Aviation Administration  (FAA)  indicated satellites might play a key  role in  air 
navigation,  surveillance,  and  communications  in  its  follow-on  generation, 
air-traffic control  system.  Therefore  the  FCC  was  trying to  protect the  radio 
spectrum required for such services, Aviation  Week reported. In addition, the 
International C iv i l  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO) would  review  at  the  1987 
World Radio Conference the earlier-assigned band,  seeking to  assure  suffic- 
ient spectrum availability for c iv i l  aviation operators’ future global needs. 
The  Special Committee  155 of the Radio Technical Commission for Aero- 
nautics said  i t  would  report at  an  April  26  ICAO meeting results of  its year- 
long study  intended to define  future spectrum operational requirements  for 
the year  2010  and beyond for  all classes of airspace users.  The  report called 
for  service over  both  land and water,  from  the  surface to  a  70,000-foot  a l t i-  
tude,  a  requirement most easily met by spaceborne systems. 
The FAA had considered spaceborne systems for air traffic communications 
for  nearly two decades,  but had  rejected them  as  not cost-effective  replace 
ments  for  terrestrial-based  facilities  (except  for  transoceanic  communica- 
tions). However,  at  the  urging of  the Air  Transport Assn.  (ATA), the  FAA  had 
initiated in  the early  1970s a joint  program w i th  the European Space Agency 
(E%)  to explore satellite use for oceanic aircraft communications,  resulting in 
contracts w i th  Comsat Corp.  for  the  service and GE to  bu i ld  a satellite;  the 
FAA  had  terminated  the  program  when  ATA  lost  interest.  More  recently, 
Aviation  Week said,  the  FAA  had  responded cooly  to  DOD‘s push for  FAA 
adoption of  i t s  Rockwell  Navstar Global  Positioning System,  partly because 
of Pentagon-imposed signal accuracy  limits of 500 miles (1,640  ft.)  for  civil- 
ian users. 
Currently,  commercial  applications  to  the  FCC  for  authorization  to  offer 
domestic communications- and surveillancesatellite services to  users,  rang- 
ing  from  trucks  to  aircraft,  had  raised  serious  FAA  concerns.  FAA  officials 
doubted the  technical  suitability of  some  of  the  proposed  systems  to  meet 
airspace users’  demanding requirements. 
The  government  traditionally  had  owned and  operated  the  surveillance, 
navigation, and communications facilities the FAA  used for air-traffic control. 
If the FCC,  under the Reagan Administration policy of commercializing space 
activities,  should  allocate  spectrum  currently assigned  for  aviation to  non- 
aviation  use,  this could preclude a  future optimum global  spaceborne-avia- 
tion  system.  Therefore,  the  FAA  task  force  was  studying spectrum needs  for 
several  types  of  spaceborne systems,  including multifunction satellites,  and 

141

expected to  have  recommendations ready  for  submission to  the  Future Air 
Navigation  System  Committee  and  the  National  Telecommunications  and 
Information  Agency,  which  addressed  government  frequency-allocation  is-  
sues.  (AvWk, Feb 4/85,  36) 

February  7: The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA) announced  rules  to 
permit  new  two-engine  jetliners  to  fly  lengthy  remote  routes  that  had  re- 
quired  three- or  fourengine planes,  but each airline would  have to prove i t s  
aircraft and flight crews met FAA  standards.  The FAA  took the action because 
of the reliability of modern jet engines and because military and business jets 
with two engines had flown across the North Atlantic safely for several years. 
The  rules also  addressed  special  provisions  for  airframe  reliability, backu,p 
electrical and  hydraulic systems,  maintenance,  carpcompar tmen t  fire  pro- 
tection,  and crew training. 
Under current rules, a two-engine plane could be no farther from an airport 
than  60-minute  flying  time  on one engine;  the  FAA  proposal would  extend 
that to two-hours  flying time on one engine. 
When  the  rules became final,  they would  allow  Boeing’s  two-engine  767 
jumbo  jet  to  fly  the  most  fuelefficient  North Atlantic  routes,  which would 
take  flights far  from  airports  in Greenland and  Iceland.  Boeing had pushed 
hard for  the  rule change,  the  Washington Post  reported,  to expand the sales 
potential of  its 767.  (FAA Release 5-85;  WPost, Feb  7/85,  A7) 

March  74:  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  Administrator  Donald 
Engen,  citing  improvements  in  scheduling  practices and  air  traffic control, 
told airlines today that on April  1 he would remove minute-by-minute restric- 
tions on the number of flights at airports in Atlanta, Chicago,  Denver,  and the 
New  York  City  area,  the  Washington Post  reported.  He said  delays would 
continue  to  occur but should be reduced and more manageable. 
Before the  restrictions,  the air  traffic system  had experienced an  unprece- 
dented  number of  delays,  averaging  1,400  daily  15-minute or  longer delays 
nationwide the previous August.  Between November 1 and January 31,1984, 
average daily delays dropped to 863,  a  reduction of 46%. Not all delays were 
attributable to  airport  congestion  or  air  traffic  control  problems;  the  FAA 
generally blamed about 60% of them on weather. 
Also likely to contribute to a decrease  in  delays was the increasing ability of 
the  FAA  to  monitor traffic  nationwide  through  its  computer  system  and  to 
redirect planes  to  less-busy  routes.  Engen  noted  that  the  airlines had  indi- 
cated they  would  continue  to operate  the  schedules adopted under  the  re- 
strictions  and  would  not  revert  to  the  bunching  of  large  numbers  of 
operations w i th in  short time periods. ( W  Post,  Mar  15/85,  A16)

FAA  

l u n e  7: The  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA) announced  i t  was  using 
sophisticated electronic equipment to identify pilots who were illegally using 
air-traffic  control  radio frequencies  to  harass  nonstriking United Airlines pi- 
lots.  The  FAA  had  already  initiated  enforcement  action  against  the  pilots 
responsible for  such  incidents near  Chicago’s  O’Hare  International Airport 
and  the  Seattle-Tacoma  Airport.  The  equipment also  identified other  flight 
crew  members who  had engaged  in  such  harrassment,  and  additional  en- 
forcement actions were  likely. 
The  equipment  was  a  tracking device  that  helped pinpoint  the  source of 
otherwise  unidentified  radio  transmissions,  of  which  more  than  50,  either 
jamming a radio frequency by  pressing a microphone button or verbal abuse 
over the  radio,  had occurred since the strike  began on May  17. 
FAA  Administrator  Donald Engen said he would  not tolerate misuse of the 
air-traffic control frequencies,  which could  lead to suspension or revocation 
of a pilot’s  license and possibly criminal  penalties of up to 10 years  imprison- 
ment or a  fine of  $10,000.  (FAA Release 24-85) 

August 28: As  a result of a Manchester, England,  airline accident  in which  i t  
was  believed a wing-mounted engine on the Boeing 7 3 7  disintegrated as  the 
plane was  attempting to  take  off  [see Aviation/Civil Aviation,  Aug.  261,  the 
Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) was  trying to decide today  how many 
of  about  5,000  Pratt  &  Whitney  jet  engines  operated  by  U.S.  commercial 
airlines  required  inspection  for  possible cracks,  the  Washington  Times  re- 
ported. Airline officials believed a fire started after the accident when a faulty 
combustion chamber in  the plane’s  Pratt & Whitney JT8D  engine blew apart 
and  a  hot  piece of  the  combustion chamber  pierced  the  plane’s  w ing  fuel 
tank. 
British inspectors said preliminary  investigations into the Manchester acci- 
dent showed that deterioration in the combustion chamber caused overheat- 
ing  and eventually failure of the part.  Investigators said they found “extensive 
cracking”  in  six of the engine’s  nine combustion chambers. 
In addition  to use on the Boeing 737, Pratt & Whitney sold the same kind of 
engine for  Boeing 727s and McDonald Douglas DC9s. Those planes made 
up  about two-thirds of the  3 ,000  planes operated by  the major U .S .  airlines. 
The FAA was attempting to arrange the engine inspections without disrupt- 
ing  U.S.  airline service and indicated there would be no inspections of newer 
engines  because  there  was  insufficient  hours  on  them.  Inspections were 
made  i n  one  of  two  ways:  an  isotope  inspection,  which  was  similar  to  x- 
raying the engine to search  for cracks  or a visual  inspection, which  required 
dismantling  the engine to get to the combustion chambers. 
An  inspection of JT8D engines ordered by the British Civil Aviation Author- 
ity  turned  up serious combustion chamber  cracks  in five Boeing  737s,  and 
the planes were  grounded.  ( W  Times, Aug 29/85,  8B)

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

September  12:  The  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced  it had 
proposed a regulation requiring that a l l  new transponders installed in  aircraft 
after  January 1,  1992,  be  compatible  with  the  new  Mode  S,  ground-based 
radar  beacon  system  to give  controllers more accurate aircraft  position and 
identification information. 
In October  1984, the FAA  ordered  137 Mode S  ground stations from jo in t  
manufacturers WestinghousdSDC-Burroughs and scheduled the first Mode S 
for delivery in  the spring of 1987 to the FAA Technical Center in  Atlantic City, 
N.J. 
In addition  to  position and  identification  information,  the  Mode S  had  a 
"selective" address capability, which gave the system  i t s  name and provided a 
channel for  automatically transmitting weather  and other  data  between air- 
traffic control facilities and aircraft  in  flight. 
The  FAA already  required that airplanes operating above  12,500 feet  or  in  
designated airport  terminal  control  areas  be  equipped with  a  less  sophisti- 
cated transponder. When triggered by the sweep of ground radar,  this e q u i p  
ment sent  back a signal that gave controllers a clean and enhanced target  on 
their  radar displays and also told them  the aircraft's  identity and altitude. 
A  limitation  of  the  current  radar  beacon  system,  which  Mode  S  would 
replace,  was  that ground equipment  interrogated simultaneously all aircraft 
in  a  given area,  often  resulting in  overlapping and  garbled signals  on  radar 
displays. Mode S eliminated this problem by addressing each aircraft on  an 
individual or selective basis. 
The  purpose  of  the  proposed  rule  was  to  promote  early  installation of 
Mode S transponders,  although existing transponders would not be obsolete; 
pilots could continue to fly with that equipment after January 1,  1992, until i t  
needed replacement. (FAA  Release 48-85)

FRANCE 

May 37: French  President  Francois Mitterrand  opened  today  the  Paris  Air 
Show,  stating that the French-led European high-technology program known 
as  Eureka was  "off  to a good start" after gaining approval from West Germany 
and other European partners,  FBIS Paris AFP  i n  English reported. France and 
W.  Germany had previously disagreed over  a US.  invitation to participate in  
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) defense research project. West Germany 
had endorsed the project, but France had rejected it,  fearing i t  would  render 
France's  independent nuclear deterrent  impotent and give the U.S.  an  unas- 
sailable  lead i n  advanced technology. 
In speaking of Eureka,  a space research program primarily for civilian uses 
and the development of ultramodern technology i n  such fields as  lasers and 
high-speed  computers,  Mitterrand  repeated his contention  that  the  Eureka 
and  SDI  projects  were  not  competing  for  the  same  goals,  but  added  that 
Bonn's  participation  in   both would  necessitate  choices  in   its  budget  and 
assignment of scientists. 
He also said France was determined to develop a European fighter plane by 
the  1990s and that  the European Hermes space  plane project was  of  major 
importance  and  could  tie  i n  with  the  European Ariane-5  rocket  program. 
(FBIS  Paris AFP  in  English,  May 31/85) 

Hermes Program 

March  17:  France's  Centre National d'Etudes  Spatiales (CNES) space agency 
was planning to select by midyear a prime contractor for the Hermes manned 
shuttle  and  would  open  the  program  to  participation  by  other  European 
countries before the end of  1985,  Aviation  Week  reported. CNES  had estab 
lished a competition  between Aerospatiale and Dassault-Breguet for the Her- 
mes  leadership  role,  and  the  two  companies  would  make  technical 
presentations i n  April. After review of the data, CNES would make a selection 
w i th in  several months. 
Normally  the  two  companies had  their  separate  niches  in  the  aerospace 
field,  but CNES  had  forced  them  into head-to-head competition  over  Her- 
mes.  In the competition,  Dassault-Breguet would  draw on expertise gained 
from  its Mirage, Jaguar, and Alpha Jet military aircraft and related electronics/ 
avionics  systems;  Aerospatiale  would  emphasize  its  work  on  military  mis- 
siles,  reen t ry   v e h i c l e h u c l e a r   warheads, 
the   A r i a n e   launcher ,  
communications satellites, and civil aircraft such as  the Concorde and Airbus 
lndustrie A300/A3 10/A320.

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

CNES Director General Frederic d’Allest  said several  countries had shown 
interest  in joining the Hermes program following the  European Space Agen- 
cy’s  (ESA)  council  meeting at  which  ministers approved  Phase  B  definition 
work  for  the Ariane  5  launcher  [see  Feb.  41.  Ariane  5  would  be capable of 
orbiting Hermes.  France planned to  retain a  50%  share  in the  Hermes pro- 
gram and open the  rest to participation by  other  European nations. 
The  1985  and  1986 budgets for  Hermes totaled $12  million,  followed  by 
about $20  m i l l ion   in  study work  in  1987.  France would  supply most of  this 
money in 1985,  because other European countries wouldn’t  be involved until 
at  least October. 
Hermes would carry two to s i x  crew members and be about half the size of 
the U.S.  Space Shuttle.  Its approximate length would  be 59 ft. and wingspan, 
about 3 3  ft.  Payload bay volume would be 377 sq .   ft.; diameter of the bay,  9.8 
ft. A typical mission would carry  7,700  to 9,900  Ib. of useful  load to a 248.5- 
mile circular orbit  inclined 0-30°. Mission duration  w i th   four  to  six  crew 
members would be eight days,  extending to 30 days with a reduced crew. 
Start  of  full-scale  Hermes development  in  mid-1988  would  permit  a  first 
flight  in  1997,  according to CNES scheduling.  (AvWk ,  Mar 11/85,  19) 

October  7 8  Jacques Louis Lions,  president of the French National Center for 
Space Studies,  announced today  that  Aerospatiale and the  Dassault-Breguet 
Aviation Company under the center’s  auspices would work together over  the 
next  several  years  to  bu i ld  two  models for  the  European space  shuttle  Her- 
mes,  FBIS  Hong Kong AFP  in English reported. The  European Space Agency 
(ESA) would  likely also sponsor the project, and the center would  undertake 
negotiations w i th   European partners who  would  develop the  main Hermes 
subsystems. 
Aerospatiale would  lead the project and assemble  Hermes components in 
i t s  Toulouse factories;  Dassault would  be  in  charge of aeronautical aspects. 
Hermes,  about  half the  size of the  U.S.  Space Shuttle,  would  carry two to 
s ix   astronauts  and  cargo  up to  4.5  tons  into  low   earth  orbits.  (FBIS,  Hong

During April:  In response to a  request  from  the Johns Hopkins  University's 
Applied  Physics  Laboratory to acquire more  information  on  how  to  predict 
ocean  wave  behavior,  the  Wallops  Flight Facility's  P-3  aircraft  participated 
October  1984 in  NASA's  Seasat  Imaging Radar B (SIR-B)  experiment to moni- 
tor  ocean  waves  while,  140 miles  above  it,  the  Space  Shuttle  Challenger 
produced images of the same waves with  its radar. 
Scientists knew what caused waves to swell,  but found it difficult to predict 
exactly  how  they  would  behave.  Researchers  hoped they  might  be able  to 
predict  through  the  use of  satellite data  the occurrence of dangerous waves 
before they caused serious damage  to ships and coastal towns. 
Analysis of previous data from  the  SIR  had indicated that a synthetic aper- 
ture radar could observe ocean waves from space,  but the  lack of information 
on  the actual directional  wave  spectrum on the ocean at  the time of the  S IR  
observations made i t  difficult to obtain an  accurate assessment of the  radar's 
performance. 
During Challenger's eightday flight,  the P-3  underflew  the  spacecraft for 
five nights off the coast of Chile to obtain sea surface observations. Each night 
the  aircraft  flew  along  several  hundred  kilometers  of  the  Space  Shuttle's 
imaging radar taking sea-surface observations with its complement of remote 
sensing instruments. The  P-3's  airborne oceanographic lidar provided  laser 
elevation profiles of the wave field and the radars (surface contour radar,  radar 
ocean wave spectrometer, and advanced applications flight experiment altim- 
eter) measured significant wave  height and provided  information  on  the di- 
rectional wave  spectrum. 
Because state  of  the  sea  varied over  the  series of  flights from  low  seas  to 
waves w i th  6-m height and 400-m wavelengths,  the data sets collected should 
become classic  and  provide a  basis  for  the  quantitative evaluation  of  syn- 
thetic aperture radars in  space.  (Inside Wallops, Apr  85,  1) 

October 4:  University of Chicago scientists Edward Anden, Wendy Wolbach, 
and  Roy  Lewis  found  evidence  that  continent-sized  firestorms  65  m i l l ion  
years ago raged across much of the earth,  blackening the skies w i th  soot and 
possibly triggering a sudden global freeze that wiped out the dinosaurs,  the 
Washington Post  reported. The event occurred at the time that other scientists 
said a giant asteroid collided w i th  earth,  which may  have generated enough 
heat to start the fires. 
It was  the asteroid theory that  led the  University of Chicago researchers  to 
ask whether a nuclear war could trigger a similar freeze, a phenomenon now 
known as  nuclear winter.  Their  findings suggested  that nuclear winter  theo- 
rists  had  greatly  underestimated the  amount  of  soot  that  would  enter  the 
atmosphere from wildfires. 

147  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

The  researchers  found  some  of  the  soot,  which  eventually  settled  to  the 
ground,  in  the  same  geologic  layers that  five years  previously gave  evidence 
of  the asteroid  impact.  The  layer,  sampled  in  regions as  far  apart  as  Europe 
and  New  Zealand,  contained an  amount  of  soot,  which was  pure  carbon, 
equal to about 10% of the carbon currently incorporated into a l l  forms of  life 
on earth. 
The original impact theory held that an  asteroid, probably at  least s ix  miles 
wide,  hit earth,  blasting enough rock dust into the atmosphere to darken the 
sky for weeks.  Deprived of sunlight, the ground would have cooled, bringing 
on a  global freeze that exterminated not only the dinosaurs but many  other 
species a l l  over the world. Paleontologists knew that the dinosaurs died out in 
the  most  wide-ranging  mass  extinction the  earth  had  even  seen.  Scientists 
working on the asteroid  impact theory  already  had calculated that  airborne 
rock  dust  alone  would  have  been  thick  enough  to  bring on  a  devastating 
freeze. 
The discovery that vast quantities of soot might also have been in  the upper 
atmosphere  indicated  that  the  period  of  darkness  and  freezing would  have 
lasted longer,  perhaps months,  because soot washed  out of  the atmosphere 
more  slowly  than  did  rock  dust,  although  i t  would  have  been  no darker or 
colder than originally thought. 
The  finding  added  two more  factors  that  might  haw  contributed  to  the 
extinction-concentrations  of fireproduced toxic substances,  such as carbon 
monoxide,  and the destruction of  plants and animals by  fire. 
The  researchers  said  the discovery was  an  accident,  resulting from  exami- 
nation of  ancient sediments while  looking for  traces  of gases  that  had been 
part of the asteroid.  Instead,  they  found that the  sediments  contained about 
10,000  times as  much carbon as would have been expected. 
The  layer,  sampled  in  Denmark,  Spain,  and  New Zealand, was  the one  in 
which  other  scientists  previously  found  unusually  high  concentrations  of 
iridium,  an  element  that  i s   rare  on  earth  but  abundant  in   meteorites and 
asteroids.  The  scientists  thought  that  when  the  asteroid  hit  the  earth,  the 
impact would have generated enough heat  to vaporize the asteroid,  sending 
its iridium  into the atmosphere where  i t  spread  around the world. 
Anders  said  the  impact would  have  scattered  white-hot  particles of  rock 
dust as far as 800 and possibly 1,200  miles,  igniting forest fires over  the entire 
area.  "Once  started,"  he  noted,  "such  a  fire  could  spread  over an  entire 
continent,  and the  resulting winds may  disperse the soot worldwide." 
The  impact,  other  scientists calculated, would  have  left a  crater 85  miles 
wide and 20 miles deep.  Since no such crater had been found,  many scien- 
tists assumed  the asteroid hit the ocean,  vaporizing the water before i t  hit the 
sea  floor.  ( W Post,  Oct 4/85,  A2) 

October 7: NASA  announced  that  its associate administrator for  space  sci- 
ence  and  applications,  Dr.  Burton  Edelson,  in  a  speech  today  at  the  36th 

148  

Geophysics 

Congress of the  International Astronautical  Federation in  Stockholm warned 
his audience that the earth‘s  environment as was  presently known might be in  
jeopardy  and  called  on  the  world’s  scientific  community to  accelerate  i t s  
study  of  the  planet.  “Resources,  once  thought  to  be  limitless,  are  slowly 
being depleted,”  Edelson said.  “Earth‘s  atmosphere i s  changing,  and some of 
its  l i fe  forms  are  threatened.  It  i s   imperative that  we,  as  scientists and engi- 
neers,  take  action  now  to  maintain  the  quality  of  l i fe   on  our  planet  and 
improve i t s  biological productivity.” 
Edelson cited  the  many  accomplishments of  planetary  science  since  the 
beginning of spaceflight 28 years  ago.  “We  have examined most of the plan- 
ets  in  the solar system  at  close range and  have performed systematic studies 
of  our  closest  neighbors,  Venus  and  Mars,  through  telescopes  and  more 
recently, through data and imagery received from p lane tab i t ing  spacecraft,” 
he said.  “We  s t i l l   lack synoptic,  systematic,  and temporal knowledge, predic- 
tive skills, and an  understanding of the mechanisms underlying earth’s  global 
processes,”  he pointed out. 
Calling for  an  international study  effort,  Edelson  said,  “Our  sophisticated 
spacecraft;  new air,  sea,  and spaceborne sensors;  and enormous  computing 
capability w i l l   enable  us  to  measure,  monitor,  model,  and  finally  begin to 
understand the earth as a system.  This mission to  planet earth could  unlock 
the secrets of life itself  . . . and could well prow  to be the most  important 
ever  undertaken by humankind.” 
Edelson called  particular  attention  to  the  problems of  water  pollution  in  
rivers,  lakes,  and  streams;  potential  depletion  of  the  ozone  layer;  growing 
atmospheric  concentrations of  carbon dioxide;  and  a  sharp  increase  in  the 
levels of carbon monoxide,  methane, and nitrous oxide.  “Economic develop 
ment over  large portions of the earth have significantly changed the patterns 
of land and water use,”  he said.  “The  results have been mixed-while 
in  some 
cases  the  benefits  have  been  significant-we  have  paid  a  substantial  price. 
We  must study the  land and  learn to use  i t  properly.” 
To  emphasize  the  importance of  his  proposal,  Edelson  said,  “The  U.S. 
National Academy  of Sciences has  reviewed the scientific merit of the global 
habitability  concept  and  has  found  i t   to  be  both  sound  and  worthy.  The 
Academy  i s   now  participating  in   the  broader  efforts  of  the  International 
Council of Scientific Unions in  a program called Global Change.  NASA  and 
several other government agencies,  notably the National Oceanic and Atmo- 
spheric Administration and the National Science Foundation, also w i l l  partic- 
ipate.”  Edelson  said  he  envisioned  multifaceted  investigations  w i th  
oceanographers,  meteorologists,  biologists,  and foresters  studying the  land, 
sea,  atmosphere,  and the air-sea and solar-terrestrial environments. 
“This  i s  truly  an  international challenge,”  he concluded,  ”involving many 
scientific disciplines.  Everyone on  earth  has  a stake  in  our  success.”  (NASA

April  7: In a review of  .  .  .  The Heavens and  the Earth  by Walter McDou- 
gall,  a reviewer for the N Y  Times Book  Review said that the book operated on 
four  levels: as  a narrative history of space activity,  a political analysis of what 
caused Sputnik  1 and what Sputnik  1 caused,  an exposition of the contradic- 
tions inherent in  the Soviet socialist system and the American free-enterprise 
system,  and  an  essay  on  the  eschatology  of  what  i s   called  the  “pursuit  of 
power.”  Reviewer Alex Roland noted the book was  based on a vast published 
literature complemented by archival  research  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe,  inter- 
views w i th  many of the  key  principals,  and  recent declassification of  impor- 
tant  material,  including National Security Council  policy paper 5814.1,  the 
first official national policy on space. 
Roland called the book the  “most  comprehensive history of space activity 
written to date,  the most thorough analysis of the political and social forces at 
work.  It provides a plausible and compelling interpretation of  how and why 
the space age has developed as  i t  has.  And  it poses an  original and stimulat- 
ing  paradigm for analysis of the post-industrial state in  a world of continuing 
cold war.  With  this book:’  Roland concluded,  “the  history of  space  activity 
has come of age.”  (NYT  Book  Review, Apr  7/85,  1) 

April  7 7 :   A  prime time TV  series for  the first  time would offer  a  comprehen- 
sive  look  at  the  history of  manned  U.S.  and  USSR  space  flight,  the  Ames 
Research Center’s  Astrogram  reported.  SPACEFLIGHT, a  series  of  four  o n e  
hour programs sponsored by the Public Broadcasting System and the Du  Pont 
Co . ,  would chronicle man‘s  achievements i n  space from the rocket plane that 
first  broke the  sound barrier  to  the  touchdown  of  the  Space  Shuttle  orbiter 
Co I u m bia. 
The  series’  executive  producer,  Blaine  Baggett,  said  his  staff  interviewed 
some  40  key  participants  in  space  activities-astronauts,  people  on  the 
ground,  scientists,  and  historians.  In addition,  the  Soviet science attache  in  
Washington  provided  about  10  hours  of  film  footage.  Among  those  inter- 
viewed for the series were Chuck Yaeger,  first man to break the sound barrier; 
Scott Crossfield,  first to travel twice the speed of sound and to pilot the X-15; 
Werner  von  Braun,  who worked  on  the  U.S.  rocket  program;  Alan  Shepard 
and John Glenn, first American in  space and first American to orbit the globe, 
respectively;  and Sally Ride,  first American woman  in space. 
From  the  point  of  view  of  the  USSR,  the  series  sought  answers  to  such 
questions as who the chief designer was of the Soviet space program and why 
the Soviets were first  in  the early days of space activities. 
SPACEFLIGHT also  examined  future  space  plans such  as  space  colonies, 
space  stations,  and the Strategic Defense Initiative. (ARC Astrogram, Apr  11/

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

November  6  Hermann Oberth,  considered  by  some  to  be  the  father  of 
spaceflight, watched on TV at Goddard Space  Flight Center (GSFC) the land- 
ing of  the Space  Shuttle Challenger on mission 61-A,  the  Washington P o s t  
reported. Oberth  i s   the  last  scientist survivor of  the  group  that  transformed 
theory  into  modern space exploration.  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,  the  Russian 
who worked out some of the early theory of rocket propulsion, died in  1935; 
Robert Goddard,  the American who experimented w i th  early rockets and for 
whom  GSFC  i s   named,  died  in   1945.  But  Oberth,  who  made  the  most 
complete  analyses  of  the  problems  and  prospects of  human  space  travel, 
lived to "see  i t  happen." 
In  1932  Oberth wrote  a paper  in  which  he  not only showed mathemati- 
cally that  it w a s  possible to escape  earth's  gravity,  but also anticipated a host 
of other aspects of spaceflight not seriously approached for the next 30  years. 
Oberth described  in  the book a spaceship's  propulsion system  and architec- 
tural  form  down  to  the  rocket  engine's  nozzles;  designed  spacesuits  and 
methods  of  eating  in   weightlessness;  conceived  of  astronauts  performing 
spacewalks;  proposed space stations in  earth orbit as transfer points for  inter- 
planetary trawl;  considered the problems of weightlessness and motion sick- 
ness  (which astronauts s t i l l   faced);  proposed that the stations spin  slowly to 
create an artificial gravity; and suggested the use of flying shuttles that could 
take  off  like  a  rocket,  visit  the  space  station,  and  land  back  on  earth  like 
airplanes. 
Oberth  also  worked  out  the  physics  of  joining  two spacecraft  in   orbit 
(referred to now as  rendezvous and docking),  anticipated that photos of earth 
from space would be useful for studying the ground and forecasting weather, 
foresaw  that  telescopes  in  earth  orbit  could  gather  far  better  astronomical 
data than those that  looked through the atmosphere, and claimed that practi- 
cal uses for  space travel would someday make it a profitable enterprise. 
Working unaware of Tsiolkovsky or Goddard, Oberth wrote the paper as an 
amateur physicist and mathematician while serving as a soldier in  the Austro- 
Hungarian army during World War  I. Oberth's commanding officer sent  the 
paper to the War  Ministry,  where  the generals  rejected it as  obvious fantasy. 
After the war,  when Oberth was  at the University of Heidelberg, he submit- 
ted as  his dissertation a  longer version of the paper,  complete with elaborate 
mathematical formulas proving his ideas. Again  i t  was  rejected. 
Eventually  Oberth  paid  to  h m  the  paper  published.  "The  Rocket  Into 
Interplanetary  Space"  gained  a  wide  following and  attracted Wernher  von 
Braun,  who worked  as  Oberth's  assistant  and  then  left to  jo in   the German 
military rocket research program a t  Peenemunde. Von  Braun brought Oberth 
to  work  on  the  V2  rocket,  the  first  major device  based  on  Oberth's  ideas. 
During three years  in  the  1950s, Oberth joined von  Braun in  the U.S.  where 
he  was  developing  the  Redstone  rocket.  In  1958  Oberth  retired  to  West 
Germany.

History 

Oberth had concluded  in  his book that  “the  foregoing demonstrates that  it 
i s  possible,  w i th   present day  science  and  technology,  to  construct vehicles 
which could attain cosmic speed and that  i t  i s  probably possible for men to 
ride in  these vehicles:’  but that  it would  take  more than  a decade  to  realize 
these  possibilities. At  GSFC  today,  Oberth said  it had  “proven  to  be  much 
more complicated  that  I thought.”  (WPost, N o v   7 /85 ,  C1)

January 23:  NASA Administrator James Beggs and U.R.  Rao,  chairman of the 
Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO),  signed a launch services agree 
ment covering the  reimbursable launch of  INSAT  1C around mid-1986 from 
the Space Shuttle, the MarshallStarreported. A multipurpose satellite,  INSAT 
1 C would  provide communications and meteorological services to  India. 
In addition,  the two agreed that an ISRO scientistlengineer would serve as  a 
payload  specialist  during  that  Space  Shuttle  mission  and  discussed  other 
possible  NASNISRO cooperative activities in  space  applications and  space 
science.  (Marshall Star,  Jan 23/85,  4) 

lune   7 5  O n  the fourth  and final day  of  his US. visit,  Indian Prime Minister 
Rajiv  Gandhi,  accompanied  by  Vice  President  Bush,  toured  the  Johnson 
Space  Center’s  mission  control  center  and  then  climbed  into  the  com- 
mander‘s  seat  of a  Space  Shuttle mockup  to  dramatize  his commitment  to 
high  technology,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Later  Gandhi  said  the 
spinoffs of space  technology  “have  become part of our daily  lives,”  and that 
India needed to keep abreast  of  technological advances  in  agriculture,  com- 
munications,  meteorology,  and prospecting. 
Earlier in  the week,  the N Y  Times reported the U.S.  and  India were sched- 
uled during Gandhi’s visit to  announce a joint space effort that would include 
the  launching in  1986 aboard the Space Shuttle of an  Indian payload special- 
i s t  and a satellite that was  partly designed to expand the uses  of  radio and TV 
i n  Indian villages. 
Candhi’s  visit was  intended to ease strains with the U.S.,  reach a series of 
space and technology agreements,  and open a nationwide cultural program, 
the Festival of  India. The previous year  the Soviet Union launched an  Indian 
astronaut into space on  an eightday mission. ( WpOst, June 16/85,  A12,  NYT,

February  7 7 :   NASA announced it had scheduled the 8th  launch in  a series of 
10 lntelsat V-type international telecommunications satellites aboard an Atlas 
Centaur  for  no earlier than  March 7 from Cape Canaveral  Air  Force Station. 
NASA  had successfully  launched s i x   lntelsat V satellites. 
The  Atlas  Centaur-63  was  the  2nd  of  the  new  stretched  version  of  the 
vehicle,  able  to   lift  from  159  to  227  kg   (350  to  500  Ib.) more  than  the 
previous design  for  a  total  of  2,318  kg (5,100  Ib.)  NASA  had extended the 
first-stage Atlas  by  about 2.05  m  (81 in.)  to accommodate more propellant. 
This would be the  1st lntelsat V-A  spacecraft  launched by an Atladcentaur. 
The  lntelsat V-A  satellites were similar to the Vs  except for  improvements 
that  increased reliability and boosting communications-carrying capacity by 
25% from  12,000  to about 15,000  simultaneous telephone calls and two TV 
programs. NASA would for several weeks station the satellite over the equator 
at  about  the  longitude  of  Paris  for  in-orbit  testing;  once  operational,  the 
spacecraft would be in  geosynchronous orbit over  the Atlantic Ocean. 
Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC)  managed  the  Atlas  Centaur  development 
and  operations,  and  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  managed  vehicle 
checkout and  launch.  (NASA Release 85-22) 

February  7 7 :   INTELSAT‘s  Assembly  of  Parties,  representatives  of  INTELSAT 
member nations,  rejected a proposal by 21 nations that all  INTELSAT parties 
and signatories boycott interconnection discussions with  private companies 
planning to  launch  international satellites  and  that  the  U.S.  reconsider  i t s  
favorable  policy  toward  non-INTELSAT  satellites,  Aviation  Week  reported. 
INTELSAT  signatories,  telecommunications  organizations  that  operated 
ground facilities and  represented INTELSAT member nations in  organization 
management, had resolved i n  April 1983 that diversion of international traffic 
would  threaten INTELSAT’s viability. 
A  resolution adopted by  the assembly  urged all signatories and parties to 
“take  into account”  the boycott and the signatories’ econom ic-viabi I ity reso- 
lution and  to   express  opinions  on  separate  systems  to   the  U.S.  and  at  the 
upcoming I NTELSAT assembly. 
U.S.  officials  had joined  the  consensus after  objectionable  language was 
deleted,  but said  naming a specific nation  in  the  resolution could set  a bad 
precedent.  As  one  official  noted,  “The  criticism  of  the  U.S.  we  expected 
turned out to be expressions of concern by developing countries that compe  
tition could mean increased rates for them.”

The assembly asked  the  Board of Governors to  submit  recommendations 
for separatesystem coordination  to the assembly as  soon as  possible,  as  the 
U.S.’s  Federal Communication Commission was  processing five applications 
for  private satellite  launches. (AvWk, Feb  11/85,  29) 

March  73  The  USSR  was  expected  to  sign  an  unprecedented information 
exchange agreement with  INTELSAT,  with a commitment to join the  interna- 
tional  consortium  within  two  years,  the  Washington  Post  reported,  a  tacit 
admission that  its own  Eastern Bloc competitor to  INTELSAT-lntersputnik- 
did not meet all the USSR’s  telecommunications needs.  INTELSAT was await- 
ing  V.A.  Shamshin,  minister of p o s t s  and telecommunications in  the USSR,  to 
sign the  proposed agreement sent  the  previous week. 
The U.S.,  creator of the 21-year-old INTELSAT system and its biggest single 
user,  had no legal means to prevent INTELSAT from sharing technology with, 
or granting admission to,  the USSR. The Reagan Administration said i t  would 
adopt a wait-and-see approach to the proposed agreement, which posed no 
security danger because the U.S.  used  INTELSAT solely  for commercial pur- 
poses. 
In the past the Soviets had used the INTELSAT system on a limited basis and 
never exchanged technical information with the West nor allowed the Eastern 
Bloc countries access to the system  (with the exception of Yugoslavia,  which 
was a full member of the consortium). INTELSAT, however, d id  not encourage 
i t s  members to use the  lntersputnik system.  ( W  Post,  Mar  13/85,  A l l  

August  27: The Soviet Union signed a memorandum of  understanding with 
the  International Telecommunications Satellite Organization  (INTELSAT) to 
formalize its relationship w i th  the 109-member nation global satellite consor- 
tium,  the  Washington Post  reported.  However,  neither  the  USSR   nor  IN- 
TELSAT  indicated  that  the  understanding  wou ld   lead  to  full-fledged 
membership  for  the  nation  that  was  the  largest  nonmember  user  of  the 
satellite network. 
The understanding, which came after  seven years of  negotiations,  laid the 
groundwork for  increased use of  INTELSAT’s  network for  global transmission 
of  Soviet voice,  data,  and TV  transmissions.  If the Soviets  increasingly used 
INTELSAT, experts said,  i t  would be to expand their  broadcasting system  to 
reach Third World countries. 
In 1984 the USSR  broadcast 441 hours of TV programming over  INTELSAT’s 
satellites,  representing 1% of the consortium’s total TV traffic.  By contrast, the 
U.S.  used  INTELSAT TV  transmission capacity over  6,884  hours,  14% of  the 
organization’s TV  traffic. 
INTELSAT had to accept the membership of any nation that belonged to the 
International Telecommunications Union, which included the Soviet Union. 
INTELSAT denied  using the Soviet Union as  a means to deflect competition

satellite systems.  (WPost, Aug 28/85,  G1)

March 18:  NASA announced that  it would  launch lntelsat V-A  (F- lo) ,   first  in 
a series of improved INTELSAT commercial communications satellites,  by an 
Atlas-Centaur (AC-63)  from KSC  no earlier than March 19,  1985. The lntelsat 
V-A  series  had  a  capacity  of  13,500  two-way  voice  circuits  and  two  TV 
channels. 
Aerospace manufacturers around the world,  under the direction  of  prime 
contractor  Ford  Aerospace  and Communications  Corp.,  had contributed  to 
the design, development,  and manufacture of lntelsat V-A.  These contractors 
and  their  responsibilities were:  Aerospatiale  (Francel-designed  the  main 
member  for  the  spacecraft's  modular  construction  and  supplied  the  main 
body  structure  thermal  analysis  and  control;  GEC-Marconi  (United  King- 
dom)-produced 
the  11-GHz  beacon transmitters  used  for  earth  station an- 
tenna  tracking;  Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm  (Federal  Republic  of 
Germany)-designed and  produced the  satellite  control  subsystem  and  the 
solar  array;  Mitsubishi  Electric Corp.  (Japan)-contributed  the  six-GHz  and 
four-GHz earth coverage antennas and manufactured the power control elec- 
tronics  and  the  telemetry  and  command  digital  units;  Selenia  ( I ta ly)-de-  
signed  and  bu i l t   the  s ix   telemetry,  command,  and  ranging  antennas,  two 
11-CHz  beacon antennas,  and two  14/11-GHz  spot-beam antennas and bu i l t  
the  command  receiver  and  telemetry  transmitter  that  combined  to  form  a 
ranging transponder for determination of spacecraft position  in  transfer orbit; 
and Thomson-CSF (Francel-built  the  10-w,  11-GHz traveling wave  tubes. 
The  lntelsat  V-A  spacecraft  would  weigh  about  4,402  Ib.  at  separation 
from the Centaur,  including the solid-propellant apogee kick motor (AKM) for 
circularization  in  the geosynchronous orbit. The separated  spacecraft weight 
of  4,389  would  include  1,963  Ib.  of  AKM  expendables  and  nine  Ib.  of 
transfer orbit propellants. 
NASA would  use  spin-stabilization during the  transfer  orbit coast  to  geo- 
synchronous altitude. After  burnout  of  the  AKM,  NASA  would  despin  the 
spacecraft  and deploy  the antenna and solar  array.  In this configuration  the 
spacecraft would  be about  51  feet wide  (measured across  the  solar  panels) 
and  22  feet  high.  In  orbital  operation,  the  spacecraft  would  be  three-axis 
stabilized w i th   the  body-fixed antenna pointing constantly at  the earth  and 
the solar  array  rotated to point at  the sun. 
The  INTELSAT  global  satellite  system  comprised  two  essential  elements: 
the space segment,  consisting of satellites owned by  Intelsat, and the ground 
segment,  consisting of earth stations owned by  telecommunications entities 

1 5 9  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

in   the  countries  i n  which  they  were  located.  The  space  segment  had  16 
satellites  i n  synchronous  orbit  at  an  altitude of  about  25,780  km  (22,240 
miles). There were 424 communications antennas at 334 earth station sites in  
134 countries and territories in  the ground segment.  The combined system of 
satellites and ground stations provided more than 800 earth station-toearth 
station  communications  pathways.  (NASA  MOR  M-491-203-85-08

in  a series of  10  lntelsat V-type  international telecommunications satellites, 
the  spacecraft would  undergo several  weeks  of on-orbit  testing before pos i-

and  lntelsat /VI  4,000.  A l l  satellites had two TV channels. 
Figures collected as  a result of the  INTELSAT-sponsored global telecommu- 
nications  traffic  conference  indicated  that  an  lntelsat  IV-A  satellite  would 
haw  insufficient capacity by the early  1980s to cope w i th  the traffic and load 
on  the Atlantic  Ocean  primary  satellite  and  on the  Indian Ocean satellite. 
Although one solution  could have been to orbit another lntelsat IV-A  Atlan- 
tic  Ocean and  Indian Ocean  satellite,  subsequent  planning  proceeded  to- 
ward  the  development  of  a  highcapacity  lntelsat  V  satellite.  After  an 
international bidding process,  the  INTELSAT Board of  Governors at  its  Sep 
tember  1976 meeting awarded a contract for development and manufacture 
of seven  lntelsat V satellites to Ford Aerospace and Communication Corp. as 
prime contractor and an  international team of  manufacturers as  subcontrac- 
tors. 
Since that time,  the board decided to order two additional  lntelsat V satel- 
lites and  to  order  six  highercapacity  lntelsat V-A  spacecraft for  launch  in

lanuary  7 2  Japan’s first  deepspace probe had escaped  earth‘s  gravity  on  i t s  
way  to a rendezvous with Halley’s Comet early in  1986,  the  Washington Post 
reported. A domestically developed rocket had  launched Sakigake (Pioneer) 
January 8 from  the  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science’s  launch site 
at  Uchinoura  in  southwestern Japan. 
Dr. Tamiya Nomura, director of the institute‘s office of project coordination, 
said the probe was  580,000  miles from earth the morning of January 12  and 
was  “entering a sphere where the sun’s  gravity  i s  dominant.”  (WPost, Jan 12/

August  7:  Japan nominated three astronaut candidates,  one a woman,  to fly 
in  January 1988 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia,  a UP1 bulletin  in  NASA 
Current News said.  The one selected to fly would  become the first Japanese 
in space. 
Those  selected were  Takao  Doi,  a  researcher at  a NASA  center;  Mamoru 
Mori,  assistant  professor of  nucleonics at  Hokkaido  University;  and  Chiaki 
Naito,  an assistant at  Keio University’s Medical  School  in  Tokyo.  Japan’s  Na-

cants. 
The  Japanese astronaut  would  conduct  a  12-minute  experiment  during 
Columbia’s  one-week  mission.  The  other  two  candidates  would  serve  as 
backups. 
The three would take further medical and space simulation tests at Johnson

February  7 5 :   NASA announced it had signed a memorandum of understand- 
ing  for  i t s  materials  processing i n  space  research  program with  Grumman 
Corp.  to  experiment with  directional solidification of  gallium  arsenide  and 
other  semiconductor materials and  various  metals  and  alloys.  The  process 
would apply to production of semiconductor crystals and magnets for electri- 
cal motors,  with  initial emphasis on semiconductor materials. 
Directional  solidification  would  use  precisely controlled  temperatures  to 
melt and solidify a material, during which the material’s  crystalline structure 
would  align  in  a  fashion that  should virtually  eliminate any  compound  im- 
perfections.  Flawless  semiconductor crystals would  yield  a greater  quantity 
and quality of microcircuit chips,  leading to higher-speed electronic devices 
that would consume less power and to greater miniaturization. 
The agreement called for an  information exchange,  with NASA and Grum- 
man Corp.  designating personnel for  the  program.  NASA would  put  up no 
funds  for  the  program;  Grumman expected to  spend  $6  million  in  the first 
three years.  (NASA Release 85-23;  W limes, Feb  13/85,  8 6 )

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND 
SPACE ADMINISTRATION 

During October: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
announced  that  its  university  programs,  primarily  involving undergraduate 
students,  combined  futuristic space  concepts w i th   realistic  engineering de- 
sign challenges.  The first  program,  cosponsored by  NASA Headquarters and 
Ames  Research Center (ARC) and Johnson Space Center USC),  required stu- 
dents  to   design  a  spacesuit  glove  that  would  allow  astronauts  maximum 
flexibility at eight Ib.-per-sq-in.,  the pressure planned for future extravehicular 
activity.  Ten  universities  responded to  a  request for  proposals,  and a  team 
from  Kansas State  University won the design competition. 
The second broader program,  entering its second phase of a tweyear p i lo t  
effort,  required universities to  adopt  NASA  advanced  space  design  projects 
for  senior  design  classes.  Each  university  received a grant and was  aligned 
w i th  a NASA  center  that  provided  guidance,  data,  and  lecturers during the 
academic year  and  10-week summer work assignments for  three students. 
The initial group of centers,  schools,  and projects were:  ARUUniversity of 
Wisconsin/manned  Mars  habitat;  ARUUniversity  of  Colorado/geosynchre 
nous  space  station;  Langley  Research  Center;  (LaRC)Nirginia  Polytechnic 
Institute/orbital servicing center;  LaRUMassachusetts Institute of Technology/ 
lunar  basemanned  Mars  mission;  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  (MSFCV 
Georgia Institute of Technology/lunar site preparation;  Lewis Research Center 
(LeRC)/U n iversity of Wash i ngtodspace manu fact u r i  ng faci I  ity;  Le RC/U n iver- 
sity  of  MichiganAunar  space  transportation  system;  and  JSUUniversity of 
Texas  and Texas  A  & Wmanned Mars mission. (NASA Activities, Oct 85,  10) 

December 26: NASA announced the highlights of  its  1985 activities,  which 
included nine Space Shuttle flights and  launches of three Atlas Centaurs,  two 
Scouts,  and an Aerobee vehicle,  i t s  last flight.  In 1985 NASA  introduced the 
last and  lightest-weight Space Shuttle orbiter-Atlantis.  McDonnell Douglas 
inaugurated its upper stage booster,  the Payload Assist Module D-2. 
Fifty two  individuals  flew aboard Space Shuttles in  1985. O f  this group  19 
were  scientists  performing observations,  experiments,  or  investigations;  27  
were  US.  military  officers,  and  s ix   were  payload  specialists  from  foreign 
countries (Mexico, Saudi Arabia,  France,  the Netherlands, and two from West 
Germany). The 52  individuals' combined time in  space was nearly 5 5  days or 
over  880  earth  orbits,  for  a  combined  travel  distance of  nearly  22  m i l l ion  
miles. Six Space Shuttle astronauts spent a total of more than a day  in  extrave- 
hicular  activities during the year. 
Two  Spacelab missions aboard the Space Shuttle and an  encounter by the 
International  Cometary  Explorer  (ICE) with  Comet  Giacobini-Zinner  high- 
lighted  the year  for NASA's  Office of Space Science and Applications.

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

On  April  19,  1985,  a l i t t le  more than a year after President Reagan directed 
NASA  to  develop  w i th in   a  decade  a  permanently  manned  space  station, 
NASA  awarded  competitive contracts  to  eight  industry  teams  for  definition 
and preliminary design  (Phase B)  of elements of the station.  NASA  signed a 
memorandum of  understanding w i th  Canada,  the  European Space  Agency, 
and Japan for cooperation during the definition and preliminary design phase 
of the program. 
NASA's  aeronautical  research and  technology  efforts  included continuing 
work  on  such  programs as  the  NM D e p a r tm e n t  of  Defense X-29  X-wing 
research aircraft, the tilt rotor/JVX aircraft,  the advanced X-29  aircraft featur- 
ing a forward-swept wing,  and the mission adaptive wing that could change 
i t s  curvature. 
In the area of space technology,  Langley Research Center completed dew4 
opment,  assembly,  and testing of a  15-meter hoop column deployable struc- 
ture  and  antenna  system.  Other  advances  in   space  technology  included 
significant  modification to  the  Space  Shuttle orbiter  Columbia  to  measure 
dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics, selection of the reactor thermo- 
electric  power  system  concept  for  design  and  testing  for  the  space  station 
space reactor power program,  and completion of space  construction experi- 
ments outside the Space Shuttle orbiter. 

NASA's  advances  in   space  tracking and  data  systems  included  transition 
from ground network station support for  low earth-orbiting spacecraft to use 
of the first Tracking and Data Relay  Satellite in geosynchronous orbit.  NASA 
had scheduled TDRS-2  and  3  for  launch  in January and July 1986,  respec- 
tively.  In February  NASA  completed  consolidation of  the  Deep Space  Net- 
work  (DSN) and  later an  upgrade of the network that would enable the DSN 
to  receiw significantly more images from hyage r  as  i t  encountered Uranus 
in  January 1986. 
NASA's Office of Commercial Programs funded and opened the first five of 
a  planned  series  of  centers  for  commercial  development  of  space,  which 
NASA  expected would become  self-supporting through  research  collabora- 
tion  by  industry,  academia,  and  gm r nm e n t  agencies.  (NASA  Release  85- 
177) 

Budget 

February 4:  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs,  during a  press  conference, 
reported that  President Reagan  had  requested a  NASA  budget of  just  under 
$7.9  billion,  reflecting the  President's  determination to  continue America's 
space  leadership and  to  achieve  the  goal  of  a  permanently  manned  space 
station. 

168 

NASA 

The budget covered some unforeseen items not addressed by  1985 budget- 
planning estimates,  including the Congressionally mandated development of 
the Advanced  Communications Technology  Satellite  (ACTS),  scheduled for 
launch  in   1989,  and  acceleration  of  the  advanced  turboprop  propulsion 
system  for  FY 8 7  flight testing. 
The  budget  contained four  major appropriations  requests:  a total  of  $2 .9  
b i l l ion  for R&D, which included funds for previously approved space science 
and  applications  programs,  development of  ACTS,  initiation of  the  orbiting 
maneuvering vehicle  program,  and  promotion of  commercial  use  of space; 
$3.5  b i l l ion  for  space  flight,  control,  and  data  communications to  support 
Space  Shuttle  production,  operations,  and  tracking and  data  acquisition  (a 
decrease of $92 m i l l ion  from FY 85’s budget plan);  $149 m i l l ion  for facilities 
construction (down $1 m i l l ion  from  FY 85); and $1.3  b i l l ion  for  research and 
program management.  (NASA release Feb. 4/85;  NASA  press briefing, Feb. 4/ 
85) 

February  6 :  President Reagan’s  FY 86  budget for  NASA  sought $7.9 billion- 
just  under  what  it would  take  to  sustain  the  agency’s  programs  a t   current 
levels,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  At  a  press  conference  [see  NASA/ 
Budget,  Feb.  41,  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  had  acknowledged  the 
$23@rnilIion budget request for  the space  station was  $50  m i l l ion   less  than 
the agency  had sought to  keep the project on  schedule.  (W  Post,  Feb  6/85, 
A17) 

kb rua ry  28:  NASA Administrator James Beggs,  in testimony before the Sen- 
ate  science,  technology,  and  space  subcommittee,  said  that  projected cost 
Overruns  for  the  Centaur  G  and  G Prime  vehicles-development  programs 
could run as  high as  $50 to $60  million, but that the agency did not think the 
problems would affect Galileo and Ulysses mission launches planned for the 
2nd half of  1986, Aerospace Daily reported. Another  NASA official testifying 
earlier had estimated the overrun at  $30 to $40  million. 
The discrepancy  in  estimates apparently stemmed from  an  agreement be- 
tween  NASA  and  the  Air  Force  calling for  a  50-50  sharing of  Centaur  G 
programdesign and development costs.  The  Air  Force,  however,  had set a 
$150 m i l l ion  ceiling on basic Centaurdevelopment costs,  which had not yet 
been  reached.  I f   the  overrun  surpassed  the  ceiling,  NASA  would  have  to 
absorb the costs.  ( A D ,  Feb 28/85,  1 ) 

March 26: The  U.S.  House Science and Technology  transportation aviation 
and materials subcommittee completed  i t s  markup of  NASA‘s  FY 86  authori- 
zation,  approving a series of changes that resulted in  reallocations for several 
aeronautics programs and elimination of  proposed funding for ob l iquew ing  
tech no logy, Aerospace Daily reported. 

169 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  requested $522 m i l l ion  for aeronautics and space  technology  in  i t s  
FY  86  budget,  of  which  $354  m i l l ion   was  for  aeronautical  research  and 
technology and $168  m i l l ion  for space  research and technology.  Under the 
proposed changes,  NASA  rotorcraft  systems  technology  funding  would  in- 
crease by $4 m i l l ion  over the agency‘s  request for $20.4  million. Ho t  section 
engine technology,  for  which  NASA  had  requested $5.2  million,  would  in- 
crease by $2 million;  and the subcommittee restored high-speed aeronautics 
funding. 
The  panel  approwd  a  $1.4  m i l l ion   decrease  for  the  fluid  and  thermal 
physics research and technology  program and deletion  of  the ob l iquew ing  
technology,  for which NASA  had requested $4.7  million,  and of funding  for 
altitude wind-tunnel  planning. 
The panel based i t s  decision to  delete ob l iquew ing  technology funding on 
an advisory committee finding that  the  planned flight  portion of  the  NASA/ 
Navy  ob l iquew ing   program  was  one  whose  design  solutions  would  have 
low  payoff to   industry.  Since the  Navy was  the only  identifiable user,  Chair- 
man Dan Glickman  (D-Kans.)  said,  i f  i t  was a program worth their while,  the 
service should provide the funding.  (ND, Mar 27/85,  1) 

A p r i l   7:  The U.S.  House Science and Technology Committee approved Presi- 
dent Reagan’s  request for a $7.9 b i l l ion  NASA budget for FY 86,  the  Washing- 
ton Post reported,  but allocated the funds differently than he had requested. 
By a 32-to-9 vote,  the panel decided to retain a  subcommittee’s  recornmen- 
dation to shift $45 m i l l ion  to  spare parts procurement for the Space Shuttle in  
order  to  keep  the  Space  Shuttle  assembly  line  open  and  thus  increase 
chances for a fifth orbiter. The administration requested $2.1  b i l l ion  in  FY 86 
for  14  Space  Shuttle  flights  and  delivery  of  the  fourth  orbiter,  Atlantis;  i t  
sought no funds for a fifth orbiter.  (WPost, Apr  1/85,  A9)  

May23 :  NASA Administrator James Beggs told Congress that the new version 
of  the  Centaur  rocket  designed  for  Space  Shuttlelaunched  planetary  mis- 
sions would cost about  $110  m i l l ion  more ($90 m i l l ion  for  NASA;  $20 mil- 
l ion   for  the  Air  Force)  than  expected  [see  NASNBudget,  Feb.  281,  the 
Washington Post reported. 
Wider  and shorter than the old-model Centaur to  f i t  i n  the Space Shuttle‘s 
cargo  bay,  the  new  rocket  would  launch  in   1986  two  spacecraft  toward 
Jupiter. An even shorter version starting in 1987 would launch from the Space 
Shuttle two classified missions for  the Air  Force. 
Beggs  told  the  House  Science  and  Technology  subcommittee  on  space 
science and applications that  “We  underestimated the job  of  integrating the 
Centaur  into the  shuttle and General  Dynamics underestimated the  cost of 
changing the configuration of the  rocket.” 
The  new  estimates  raised  Centaur  program  costs  from  $755  m i l l ion   to 
$865 million.  (W  Post,  May 24/85,  A161

lune  27:  The U.S.  Senate passed by voice vote H.R.  1714,  the NASA Authori- 
zation  B i l l  for  FY  86,  NASA’s  Legislathe Activities  Report noted.  As  passed, 
the b i l l  embraced the concept of  a budget freeze at the FY 85  level of  $7.510 
billion;  however,  it also provided for  three specific augmentations that total- 
led $142 million,  accounting for  a  FY 86 growth of  1.9%. 
Among   the   au thor iza t ions   for   research  and  development  were 
$200,000,000  for  the  space  station,  $47Z200,000  for  space  transportation 
capability development, and $608,400,000  for  physics and astronomy. 
Spaceflight,  control,  and  data  communications  authorizations  included 
for  Space  Shuttle  production  and  operational  capability; 
$941,500,000 
$1,700,100,000 
for  space  transportation  operations;  and  $745,300,000  for 
space and ground network, communications,  and data systems. 
Among  the  authorizations  for  space  transportation  fac i l i t ies   were 
$14,000,000  for  construction of  an  orbiter  modification and  refurbishment 
facility  at  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC),  $3,600,000  for  construction  of  a 
thermal protection system facility at KSC,  and $6,500,000  for modification of 
enhanced life support systems  testing at Marshall Space  Flight Center.  (NASA 
Legislathe Activities Report, June 27/85,  1) 

July  1 :  By voice vote the US. Senate approved a FY 86 NASA authorization of 
$7.6  billion,  an  increase of $142  m i l l ion  above the 1985 NASA appropriation 
and  the  House-approved authorization,  the  Washington Post  reported. The 
increase would mainly cover the cost of restoring the Reagan Administration’s 
proposed 5%  pay cut for  federal employees and provide additional funds for 
booster  rockets.  The  Senate  spending ceiling was  $234   m i l l ion   below  the 
Administration’s  request. 
The Senate and House authorization bills were substantially different.  The 
Senate approved cuts in  specific programs, while the House simply approved 
an  across-the-board  freeze  for  the  entire  NASA  budget.  (W  Post,  July 1/85, 
A13) 

Data Tracking and Relay Systems 

lanuary 23:  NASA  announced that the Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC) 
would  transfer  spacecraft  tracking and  data  acquisition  operations  from  i t s  
Beltsville Tracking Station to i t s  Wallops Flight Facility by early 1986, consoli- 
dating the operations to support balloon,  sounding-rocket,  and aeronautical- 
flight research. Diminishing need for ground stations due to the new Tracking 
and Data Relay  Satellite System  (TDRSS) necessitated the  realignment. 
TDRSS  would  consist  of  three  communications  satellites  in  geosynchro- 
nous orbit,  providing global coverage  by earth-orbiting satellites and  replac- 
ing  the worldwide network of ground stations. NASA  had  launched the  first 

171 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

TDRSS  satellite  i n  April  1983 and would  launch the  second about  February 
20.  GSFC would  phase out or  transfer  to other agencies most of  i t s  tracking 
stations.  In  addition  to  Wallops,  however,  GSFC  would  maintain  ground 
stations  at  Bermuda  and  Merritt  Island,  Florida,  to   support  Space  Shuttle 
launches from  KSC.  The White Sands,  New Mexico,  station was  the ground 
terminal  for orbiting TDRSS  satellities (NASA Release 85-11) 

February 26: NASA announced it was donating a 26-m antenna located a t  the 
Orroral  Valley  Tracking Station,  Australia,  which  had  ceased  operations  in  
December 1984,  to the Australian University of Tasmania.  NASA, which had 
used  the antenna in  programs such as  Skylab,  the Apollo Soyuz  test project, 
and  the  Space  Shuttle,  had  offered  to  assist  in   antenna  dismantling  and 
transfer to  Hobart, Tasmania. 
The University of Tasmania’s  physics department,  one of  Australia’s  major 
centers for  astronomy and astrophysics, would use  the antenna as  part of  i t s  
teaching and research activities,  including operation w i th  the Australian tele- 
scope under construction in  New South Wales to  improve telescope perform- 
ance. 
Researchers would also  use the antenna in conjunction w i th  other  instru- 
ments for very-long baseline interferometry, a system employing a number of 
separate antennas to construct a radio telescope with a high-resolution capa- 
bility,  to obtain  more accurate measurements of earth’s  surface.  Researchers 
would also make the antenna available to NASA for  i t s  future geodesy,  geody- 
namics,  and astronomy projects. (NASA Release 85-28) 

May  17:  NASA  announced  that  Harris Corp.  successfully  deployed  on the 
ground a 50-fOOt antenna system,  marking a milestone in  NASA’s  program to 
demonstrate that  large space  antenna concepts were  feasible.  In the  test,  a 
hoopco lumn  antenna unfolded,  umbrella-style,  from a compact package to  
a combination  of  thin  structural members,  quartz  filament  cords,  and gold- 
plated mesh. 
The  mesh,  serving  as  a  precision  reflecting surface  stretching across  the 
diameter of the supporting hoop,  was  shaped  like a dish but could be made 
flat,  spherical,  or  conical,  depending on  the  intended application.  The  an- 
tenna column was a precise telescoping hub,  forming the central structure of 
the antenna,  tensing the cords that shaped  the antenna surface,  and housing 
the electronic feed mechanisms. 
The  size  of  potential  large  space  antennas  meant  a  significant boost  in 
effective  radiated  power  from  space  and  an  increased  sensitivity  to  weak 
signals  from  the  ground  or  from  space.  One  potential application  was  in  
communications,  because at that time each earth station had to have a large 
antenna to  receive the weak  signals  transmitted through  small antennas on 
satellites.  Large antennas  in  space would  greatly  reduce the size and cost of 
the  antennas  required at  ground  sites.  And  a few  super-antennas placed  in  

172 

NASA  

high geosynchronous orbit could cover the globe,  instead of the great num- 
ber  of  smaller  satellites otherwise  required.  Millions  of  inexpensive home 
rooftop  or  land  mobile  unit  antennas  could  receive  satellite  signals  then 
picked  up  only by a few  very  large ground stations. 
NASA  believed the  50-foot  antenna  system  was  the  largest  precision an- 
tenna  designed  for  space  that  could  be  accommodated  in  existing  ground 
electromagnetic test facilities. However,  the ultimate deployable space anten- 
nas might  have  150- to 300-foot diameters. Studies showed that these  larger 
antennas  required space assembly.  (NASA Release 85-76) 

J u n e  6 :  NASA  announced  that  i t s   deep  space  network  (DSN), as  part of  a 
French-led international tracking network, would  track  the  first of  two  inter- 
national  balloon experiments carried aboard the Soviet VEGA  spacecraft to 
study  beginning June 10 Venus‘s  atmosphere. The VEGA  1 and 2 spacecraft 
each  would  drop an  instrumented  lander  and  an  instrument-laden balloon 
into the Venusian atmosphere as they approached the planet on their way to a 
March 1986 rendezvous w i th  Halley’s Comet. 
After  reaching the equatorial  regions of  Venus‘s  atmosphere,  the  balloons 
would  float  free  in   the  middle,  most  active,  layer  of  Venus’s  threetiered 
clouds.  The flight plan called for  the entry packages,  consisting of the atmo- 
spheric balloon and a lander,  to plunge from a 125-km (78 miles) to a 65-km 
(40  miles)  altitude,  where  a  parachute  would  deploy.  The  lander  would 
separate from the balloon at  63  km (39 miles) and head for  the surface. The 
balloon  would  then  inflate  and  carry  its  instrument  package  through  the 
atmosphere at an altitude of  55  km (34 miles) for  more than two days. 
NASA’s  deep space network and other stations around the world would  use 
a technique called very long baseline interferometry to measure the balloon’s 
velocity,  and  therefore the wind velocity,  w i th  a precision of  about  3  km  (2 
miles) per hour at  Venus’s  about  108 million-km  (67 m i l l ion  miles) distance 
from earth. A Soviet  internal network would also track the balloons. 
NASA’s  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory was  cooperating w i th   the  French  Na- 
tional Space Agency  (CNES),  Paris,  i n  the tracking activity. Scientists believed 
data from the balloons would further their understanding of Venus’s  complex 
weather  system.  (NASA Release 85-87) 

Management and Personnel 

J a n u a r y   17:  NASA  announced  appointment  effective  January 13,  1985,  of 
Frank  Penaranda,  a  NASA  exceptional  service  medal  recipient  serving  as 
special  assistant to  the associate administrator  i n  the Office of Aeronautics 

173 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

and Space Technology (OART), as  deputy assistant administrator for commer- 
cial  programs, where  he would  develop and coordinate policies and proce- 
dures  for  implementing  commercial  programs  through  NASA's  in-house 
organizations. 
Penaranda had joined  NASA  in  April  1969 as  a technical program analyst 
w i th   OART;  NASA  later  named  him director of  the  resources and  manage- 
ment systems division  in  1974 and director of  institutional operations  in the 
Office of  Management Operations  in  Jan.  1978.  Penaranda  had  previously 
worked  for  the  Defense Atomic  Support Agency  of  the  Department of  De- 
fense as a nuclear physicist conducting applied research on nuclear radiation 
transport and shielding. 
Penaranda holds an  M.S.  in physics from Marquette University and a  B.S. 
from Manhattan College.  He also graduated from Harvard's Advanced Man- 
agement Program. (NASA announcement, Jan. 17/85) 

April 5 NASA announced that effective today  i t  permanently established the 
office of NASA productivity  programs to direct,  initiate, coordinate, monitor, 
and  evaluate agencywide  productivity  improvement and  quality  enhance- 
ment initiatives.  David Braunstein would continue as the office's director and 
would report to the  NASA administrator. 
The office was established to ensure NASA's  leadership in  the development 
and  application  of  advanced  technology  and  management  practices  that 
contributed  to significant increases in agency  and national productivity. 
In  making the announcement,  NASA  Administrator James Beggs said  that 
NASA  would  provide  a  participative and  challenging  environment  for  all 
employees,  and  i t  would  develop  a  team  approach  with  its  contractors  to 
achieve the highest levels of Productivity. (NASA announcement,  May 15/85) 

April  12  NASA  announced  it honored  a t   a  KSC  reception 200  NASA  and 
NASA  industrial Quality  Circle  employees for  their  volunteer  efforts  in  im- 
proving quality, safety,  and productivity. Jesse Moore, NASA associate admin- 
istrator for space flight,  read  a message from George Burns,  president of the 
International Association of Quality Circles,  congratulating the employees on 
their outstanding performance. 
NASA  selected the  honorees under  an  office of  space  flight  program that 
recognized first-level  supervisory and support  personnel for  their productiv- 
ity efforts. The Manned Flight Awareness Panel,  made up of NASA and indus- 
try  personnel,  managed  the  program.  NASA  had over  120 employee  teams 
w i th   over  1,000  employees  voluntarily  participating  in   Quality  Circles. 
Through the program,  NASA hoped to foster  increased effectiveness through 
improved efficiency  in  the space and aeronautics research and development 
programs.  (NASA  Release 85-55)

June 12 and 13  at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to discuss initiatives to 
improve  quality  and  productivity  in  NASNcontractor  operations,  the  Mar- 
sha// Star  reported. The  first  NASNHardware Contractors Productivity Con- 
ference was  at MSFC  in April  1984. 
Attendees at  the  1985 conference heard an  interim  report on  the  status  of 
activities  implemented  as  a  result of  the  1984 meeting and  related  recom- 
mendations. NASA and contractor panels discussed topics such  as quality  in  
relationship  to  productivity;  productivity  and  quality  initiatives and  incen- 
tives;  efforts  toward  implementing  participative management  techniques; 
and  improvement  in  specification,  preplanning, and measurement. 
The  conference was  part  of  NASA‘s  continuing  effort to  provide  national 
leadership in  the development and application of advanced technology and 
management  practices.  During fiscal  year  1984,  about  85%  of  NASA’s  $7.2 
b i l l ion  budget was placed w i th  contractors. “It’s  very  important,”  said William 
Reynolds,  associate director  for  management  in MSFC’s  science  and  engi- 
neering  directorate,  “that  NASA‘s  productivity  effort  include  an  improved 
relationship w i th  the NASA hardware and service/support contractors.”  (Mar-  
sha// Star, June 12/85,  l )  

l u n e   7 7 :   NASA  announced  i t  appointed  Dr.  Raymond  Colladay  associate 
administrator for aeronautics and space technology to be responsible for the 
overall  management of  the agency’s  aeronautics,  space  technology,  and  ter- 
restrial  energy  programs  including  the  institutional  management of  Ames 
Research Center (ARC), Langley  Research Center (LaRC), and Lewis Research 
Center (LeRC). O n  April  18,  1982, NASA had named Colladay deputy associ- 
ate  administrator for  the  office of  aeronautics  and  space  technology;  since 
April  17,  1985,  he had served as acting associate administrator for that office. 
Colladay began his career with LeRC in  1969, where he conducted analyti- 
cal  and  experimental  research  in   advanced  high-temperature gas  turbine 
engines.  In 1974 NASA  named him head of  the  turbomachinery fundamen- 
tals  section  and  then  temporarily  assigned  him  to  NASA  Headquarters as 
acting chief of  the propulsion branch  in the aircraft energy efficiency office. 
Later  he  served  as  assistant manager of  the  LeRC  efficiency engine  project, 
deputy  manager  of  the  advanced  propulsion  systems  office,  manager  for 
propulsion  research and  technology,  and  beginning  in   1982 director of  the 
research and technology division. 
Colladay  received B.S.,  M.S.,  and Ph.D. degrees from Michigan State Uni- 
versity,  East Lansing. He authored or co-authored more than 20 NASA techni- 
cal  reports and  journal  articles  relating to  aeronautical and  space  research.

Hosenball,  who   received a  B.S.  degree  from  the  University  of  Michigan 
and  his  LL.6.  degree  from  Harvard  Law  School,  was  awarded  the  NASA 
Exceptional Service Medal in  1967,  the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in  
1973,  the  National C iv i l  Service League Career  Service Medal  in  1980,  and 
the Presidential Rank of  Distinguished Executive i n  1983. 
The Center for Space and  Law  Policy, established  in  November 1984, was 
one of a very few such institutions in  the world and was  intended to  guide the 
university  in i t s  space  research efforts. (NASA Release 85-104) 

july 23:  NASA announced that John O’Brien,  currently NASA deputy general 
counsel,  was  appointed effective August 4  NASA general counsel,  succeed- 
ing  S .   Ne i l  Hosenball who was  retiring.

September  20:  NASA  announced  appointment  effective  October  7,  of  R i -  
chard  Barnes  to  be  director  of  the  International Affairs  Division.  Barnes 
would replace Kenneth Pedersen, who had served in  the job  since November 
1978 and would spend the following year on sabbatical as  research professor 
at the Georgetown University School of  Foreign Service. 
Barnes recently had completed four years as  NASA European representative 
based at the American Embassy in  Paris, where he was  responsible for liaison 
w i th  the European Space Agency and the national space agencies of Western 
Europe on cooperative projects and for  identification of potential future joint

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Frankle  had  been  chief  counsel  of  NASA's  Goddard  Space  Flight Center 
since  September  1982  and  prior  to  that  associate director,  policy  develop 
ment  and  administrative  legal  systems,  for  the  Selective  Service  System, 
where he was  responsible for  the development and promulgation of operat- 
ing  regulations for deferment and classification and the selection and training 
of  local and appeal  board members across  the  U.S.  He served  from  1974  to 
1980 as a member of the Office of General Counsel, Department of the Navy. 
Frankle received B.S.  and M.S. degrees  in  aerospace  engineering from the 
Catholic  University of America and a J.D. degree from Georgetown Univer- 
sity School of  Law.  (NASA anno.,  Oct  15/85) 

October  7 8  NASA  deputy  associate  administrator  for  space  science  and 
applications  Samuel  Keller,  speaking  a t   a  weekly  staff  meeting,  said  "We 
expect  1986 w i l l  be the most demanding year we've  ever  had,"  the  Washing- 
ton Post reported. In January Voyager  would encounter the planet Uranus. In 
March the Space Shuttle would fly a mission dedicated to observing Halley's 
comet.  In May NASA would  launch Ulysses,  which would  fly to Jupiter and 
use  the  planet's  gravity  to  "slingshot"  itself  around  the  sun,  and  Galileo, 
which  would  orbit  Jupiter.  In  August  the  Space  Shuttle  would  carry  the 
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. The three  spacecraft cost  $2  b i l l ion  not 
including launch costs. 
Keller's toughest time would occur in May, the Postsaid, when Ulysses and 
Galileo at the same time would be in  the cargo bays of two Space Shuttles on 
their  launch  pads.  NASA  would  try  May  15  to  launch  Ulysses  and  then 
Galileo  four days  later.  If anything delayed the May 15  launch,  NASA had 24 
days  to get the Space Shuttle into space,  a  launch window that allowed the 
two spacecraft to fly to Jupiter using the  least amount of fuel. 
"1'11  be glad when  1986 i s  over,"  Keller said.  (WPost, Oct  18/85,  A 2 1 )  

Oc tobe r24  NASA announced that an October 29 conference in Washington 
sponsored  by  NASA,  the  Department  of  Defense,  and  other  government 
agencies  would  provide  a  forum  for  government executives  to  discuss  the 
Reagan  Administration's  program  to  increase government efficiency and  ef- 
fectiveness. 
Following  welcoming  remarks by  Dennis Whitfield,  chief  of  staff  to  the 
Secretary  of  Labor,  and  David  Braunstein,  director  of  NASA's  productivity 
programs, conference participants would  be briefed on  several  perspectives 
on the President's productivity  improvement program. Stephen Scholossberg, 
deputy  under  secretary  for  labor-management relations,  Department of  La- 
bor,  would  then  provide a labor-management view of quality  and productiv- 
i ty. 
In the afternoon,  NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless,  first  human to freely 
maneuver  in   space  without  a  tether,  would  speak  on  the  importance  of 

178 

NASA  

quality and productivity  in  the space program. John Franke Jr., assistant secre- 
tary  for  administration,  Department  of  Agriculture,  would  then  give  case 
examples of  management’s  commitment  to  quality;  and  Commodore John 
Kirkpatrick, commander,  Naval Aviation  Logistics Center,  would discuss qual- 
ity improvement through total quality  management.  (NASA Release 85-146) 

November 2 5  NASA announced that the  U.S.  Senate confirmed on Novem- 
ber  18  Dr. William Graham to be NASA deputy administrator; Graham, who 
was a founder and executive of R&D Associates,  was  nominated by President 
Reagan on September  12. 
Graham had served  for  three years as  chairman of the President’s General 
Advisory  Committee  on  Arms  Control  and  Disarmament  and  previously 
served as  a member of the President-elect’s transition team. 
Before founding  R&D Associates  in  1971, Graham spent s ix  years w i th  the 
Rand Corp.  and before that three years active duty at  the Air  Force Weapons 
Laboratory,  Kirtland  Air  Force  Base,  as  a  project  officer  directing  a  group 
conducting experimental and theoretical research on strategic system  surviv- 
ability. 
Graham  had  been a consultant  to the  Office of  the  Secretary  of  Defense 
and served on many  international and  national boards and advisory groups 
including the National Academy  of Science/National Research Council Com- 
mittee on  Undersea Warfare,  the Air Force Science Advisory Board Task  Force 
on   Manned  Strategic  System  Vulnerability,  the  U.S.-United  Kingdom Joint 
Working Group on Atomic Weapons,  the Defense Nuclear Agency Scientific 
Advisory  Group on Effects,  and the  Defense Science Board System Vulnera- 
b i l i ty  Task  Force and Associated Task  Forces. 
His memberships in  professional and honorary organizations included Tau 
Beta  Pi,  the  American  Institute for  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics,  the  New 
York  Academy  of  Science,  the  Council  on  Foreign  Relations,  the  board  of 
directors of the Committee on the Present Danger,  the Defense Preparedness 
Association,  the  Ethics and Public Policy Center,  and the American Associa- 
tion for the Advancement of Science. 
In  1959  Graham  received  a  B.S.  degree  in   physics  from  the  California 
Institute of  Technology  and  in  1961 an  M.S.  degree  in  engineering science 
and in  1963 a Ph.D.  in  electrical engineering, both from Stanford University.

December 2:  NASA  announced the  appointment effective  November 25  of 
Joseph Alexander  to  deputy  chief  scientist with  responsibility for  providing 
assistance to the chief scientist  in  advising the Administrator and in  establish- 
ing  policy related to scientific aspects of NASA programs and missions.

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

Alexander  joined Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC)  in  1962,  where he 
participated  i n  the  establishment of  NASA’s  program  in  space  radio astron- 
omy and conducted studies of the sun,  the planets, and the galaxy from earth- 
orbit,  lunar-orbit,  and planetary flyby spacecraft. In 1970 he became head of 
the Galactic Studies Section where  he was  responsible for  scientific studies 
associated with  the  Radio Astronomy  Explorer satellite  program.  Following 
leave  as  a  visiting  scientist  at  the  Department  of  Astro-Geophysics  at  the 
University of  Colorado,  Alexander  became head of  the  Planetary Magneto- 
spheres  Branch and directed a research team conducting both experimental 
and  theoretical studies of  planetary environments  by  using  instruments on 
board spacecraft such  as  the  Interplanetary Monitoring Probes,  Mariner-10, 
Magsat,  Pioneer-11,  and Voyager  1 and 2. 
From January 1984 until March  1985, Alexander  was  a senior  policy  ana- 
lyst at  the White House Office of  Science and Technology  Policy where  he 
concentrated on  issues  related to  space  science and  technology  in  the  civil 
space program. He then returned to GSFC as  associate chief of the laboratory 
for extrater restr i a I  physics . 
A member of the American Geophysical Union, the U.S.  National Commit- 
tee of the  International Union of Radio Science,  and the  International Astro- 
nomical  Union,  Alexander  received  in   1960 a  B.S.  degree  and  in   1962  an 
M.A.  degree,  both in  physics,  from the College of William and Mary.  (NASA 
anno.,  Dec 2/85) 

December 2  A  Federal  grand jury  today  indicted General Dynamics Corp., 
three of  its current executives, and its former executive vice president, James 
Beggs,  currently Administrator of NASA,  for allegedly seeking to defraud the 
Defense  Department  in  connection  with  producing  two  prototypes of  the 
DIVAD, an anti-aircraft gun for  the Army,  Time magazine reported. 
The sevencount,  33-page indictment stated that between January 1978 and 
August  1981,  while  General  Dynamics was  working on a $41  m i l l ion  pro- 
gram to bu i ld  the prototypes,  i t  made false statements to the government and 
was  guilty of fraud. The  indictment  charged the company with  illegally  bill- 
ing $7.5  m i l l ion  of  its expenses to other government accounts, of which $3.2 
m i l l ion   was  paid.  Along  w i th   Beggs,  the  indictment  also  named  Ralph 
Hawes,  division general manager;  David McPherson,  program director;  and 
James Hansen,  assistant director. 
Beggs, who  took a leave of absence from NASA,  denied the charge,  saying, 
“ I   have not been involved in  any criminal  wrongdoing  . . .  I  do not intend 
to   leave,  and this  i s  not the first  step  to a  resignation.”  A General Dynamics 
spokesman said,  “The  issue i s  a highly sophisticated regulatory and account- 
ing  matter, which should be resolved in  a c iv i l  forum,  not in  a criminal case.“

faster  launches desirable. NROSS-1’s  expected lifetime would be three years; 
an  NROSS-2  would  depend  on  needed  oceanographic  data.  The  system 
would help battle group commanders predict ocean  conditions  for  antisub 
marine  warfare  operations,  force  placement,  and  plan  use  of  advanced 
weapon  systems.  ( M D ,  Jan 10/85,  50) 

December4: NASA Administrator James Beggs today took an  indefinite leave 
of  absence from  the  agency  to  fight  fraud  charges  against  him  [see  NASA/ 
Management  and  Personnel,  Dec.  21,  the  Washington Post  reported. With 
White  House  approval,  associate  administrator  Phi I i p  Cu I bertson  became 
general manager. 
Although  Beggs  had  refused  to  resign,  White  House  spokesman  Larry 
Speakes  said  that  President Reagan,  “while  reluctantly  acceding  to  his  re- 
quest for a  leave of absence,”  asked  Beggs to ass is t   in  an  “orderly  transition of 
his responsibilities to his colleagues at  NASA  to facilitate continuity of man- 
agement at  this critically  important agency.  Mr.  Beggs  has  agreed  to do so.” 
Speakes  added that  the  space  program  “has  been  revitalized”  under  Begg’s 
leadership and  “this  important record must continue.” 
Putting Culbertson  in  charge of day-today operations put Begg’s  stamp on 
the  transition,  the  Post  said.  Culbertson was  a  20-year  NASA  veteran,  well- 
known to the House and Senate committees that dealt w i th  the agency,  and 
responsible for  planning the agency’s  next big project, construction of an  $8 
b i l l ion  permanent space  station. 
William  Graham,  a former  planning analyst  at  the  Rand  Corp.  and  chair- 
man for  the previous three years  of  the White  House Advisory Commission 
on Arms Control and Disarmament, had been w i th  NASA eight working days. 
Reagan appointed Graham acting administrator,  so  that Graham could create 
the job  of general manager and name Culbertson to the post. 
“Whoever  i s   running  the  space  agency  in   1986  has  to  know  where  the 
space  station stands,  what  money  i t  needs and who  to  talk  to  to  keep  i t  on 
track,”  said  a  congressional aide  who  dealt  w i th   NASA.  “That’s  why  Phil 
Culbertson i s  getting the job  of  running the agency day-today. He knows the 
issues.” 
In his statement,  Beggs  reiterated that  he  i s  innocent of  the  fraud charges 
resulting from  a Justice Department  investigation.  “ I   have  concluded  there 
was  nothing I did then  that  I would not do again,”  Begg‘s  statement  said.  “I 
have not been involved in  any criminal wrongdoing or,  in  fact,  of wrongdoing 
of any  kind.  I am  totally confident I w i l l  be exonerated.”  (W  Post,  Dec 5/85, 
A3) 

December  5:  Speaking to  a  standing-room-only crowd at  NASA  Headquar- 
ters  and  a l l   NASA  centers via  closedcircuit TV,  former  administrator James 
Beggs said today  that federal  fraud charges against him were  “baseless”  [see 

181 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

NASNManagement and Personnel,  Dec.  21,  that he expected to be cleared, 
and  expressed  thanks  for  an  ”outpouring”  of  support,  the  Washington Post 
reported. 
“These  charges relate to things that happened in  General Dynamics s ix  and 
seven years ago,”  Beggs noted and said that he had reviewed the charges and 
believed,  “we acted  i n  an entirely ethical,  legal and moral sense.“ 
“The  charges,  therefore,  are  baseless  . .  .  They  are  outrageous,  ridicu- 
lous and  I feel  confident  that  once  this  i s   brought to  trial  that  1’11  be com- 
pletely exonerated of the charges.” 
Beggs also noted that the suits against defense firms were creating a climate 
that would  blight the work of NASA and of the defense community. “The very 
adversarial relationship that  i s  being created by  the suits against the contrac- 
tors,  the  very  bad k ind  of  statements that  are  being made  in  the  press,  and 
elsewhere,  i s  going  to  make our  job   in  the  future much more difficult,”  he 
said.  “Not  just here,  but in  the  Defense Department as well.” 
Earlier,  the  N Y  Times reported that all top  2 7  administrators at  NASA and 
field  installations had  sent  a  statement  to  Congress  and  the  White  House 
endorsing  Beggs  as  “an  individual  with  the  highest  standards  of  integrity 
which  have  earned  h im   the  esteem  and  respect  of  his  colleagues.”  The 
statement said  he had  revitalized the  space  program and  regretted “the  un- 
timely  interruption  of  his work,”  calling him a man of the  “highest  integrity, 
totally dedicated to NASA,  an extremely able executive.”  (WPost, Dec 6/85, 
A16;  NYT ,   Dec 6/85,  A5) 

December  5:  Having  served  as  NASA  deputy  administrator  for  only  two 
weeks,  Dr. William Graham was  not known well by most NASA employees; 
but,  as  acting  administrator  replacing James  Beggs,  Graham  had  a  clear 
opinion  of  NASA  and  his  opportunity  to  lead  it,  the  Washington  Post  re- 
ported. Graham,  who  had a Ph.D.  in  electrical engineering, said  in an  inter- 
view  today  that  “NASA’s  a marvelous organization  .  .  .  For  a technologist, 
this  i s  like dying and going to heaven.” 

Thus,  Graham characterized himself as  a professional technologist, which 
his background would certainly indicate. He had worked as  a project officer 
w i th  the Air  Force Weapons Laboratory in  New Mexico,  was  a founder  and 
executive  of  R&D  Associates  in  California,  and  had  served  on  numerous 
advisory panels on nuclear weapons,  strategic military policy,  and undersea 
warfare.  However,  this  emphasis  in   his  career  on  weapons  research  and 
military policy aroused  some  unease  at  NASA,  the  Post commented.  “He’s 
from the other side of the river,”  one NASA official said,  referring to  Graham’s 
long association w i th   the  Pentagon.  But Graham had sought to assure Con- 
gressional  committees  recently  that  his  appointment  was  not  designed  to 
lead to the “militarization  of NASA.” 

182 

NA SA  

Graham‘s  close  ties  to  the  Reagan  Administration  were  seen  as  possibly 
beneficial  to  the  space  agency.  And  Graham  commented  that  he  would 
follow  President Reagan’s  “very  strong and clear space policy.” 
Some  associates  noted  that  even  as  acting  administrator  they  expected 
Graham  to  “take  a strong  hand”  i n  agency affairs.  Graham had already  an- 
nounced that he intended to meet soon with all the agency’s  top executives 
and then visit  the  research and operations center at  Cape Canaveral,  Hous- 
ton,  Pasadena,  and elsewhere.  “I’m  a hands-on kind of  person,”  he said.  “ I  
like to  get  out and walk  the  halls and  talk  to  people.”  (W  Post,  Dec  6/85, 
A29 )  

December 6 :  NASA  announced  that  Acting Administrator  William  Graham 
confirmed  the  appointment  for  an  indefinite  period  of  Philip Culbertson, 
associate  administrator  for  space  station,  to  the  position  of  NASA  general 
manager.  In that capacity he would assist Graham and have specific responsi- 
bility for  the  Offices  of  Space  Science  and  Applications,  Commercial  Pro- 
grams,  Space  Flight,  Aeronautics and Space  Technology,  Space  Station,  and 
Space Tracking and Data Systems. 
Culbertson had held his current position since August  1,  1984, coinciding 
w i th  the establishment of the Office of Space Station. Since November 1981 
he had been associate deputy administrator, serving as  senior staff advisor to 
the administrator and the deputy administrator and directing the formulation 
of policy,  strategy,  and planning for  the space  station.  From 1979 to  1981  he 
served  as  assistant for  the Space Transportation System  (STS),  providing con- 
tinuous  assessment  of  STS  development,  acquisition,  and  operations status 
and otherwise  advising  the  administrator  and deputy  administrator  on  STS 
matters requiring policy decisions. 
His earlier NASA  assignments  included  the  positions of  deputy  associate 
administrator for  STS/technical,  assistant administrator for  planning and pro- 
gram integration, director of advanced manned missions, and manager of the 
institutional  assessment  conducted  in   1977.  He  also  served  as  the  NASA 
representative  in  the  1979 antisatellite treaty  negotiations and  in  1976  and 
1977 was  detailed  to the  Executive Office for a five-month period as  Execu- 
tive Director of the President’s Committee on Science and Technology.

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

her new position, Green would be responsible for  planning and directing a l l  
NASA activities that provided information to and responded to inquiries from 
the public and the media. 
Green  came  to  NASA  w i th   20  years’  experience  in  communications and 
management.  Since  1981,  as  deputy  and  acting press  secretary  to  the Vice 
President of the  United States,  she was  responsible for  planning and coordi- 
nating media activities for  the Vice  President on matters of domestic policy, 
including the task  forces on  regulatory relief and drug interdiction. She  had 
accompanied  the  Vice  President to  61  foreign  countries,  coordinating  a l l  
media activities. 
Green was  a  former  chairman of  public  affairs  for  the Texas  Federation of 
Republican Women,  press assistant  to Congressman Bob Price,  and a  recipi- 
ent of the Ten  Outstanding Republican Women award  in  Texas. 
She received a bachelor of business administration degree in  1956 from the 
University of Texas.  (NASA Release 85-168) 

December  1 6  Former NASA  administrator James Beggs,  General Dynamics, 
and three executives of the company today  pleaded not guilty  to charges  of 
plotting  to  hide  cost  Overruns  during development  of  a  prototype  of  the 
DIVAD antiaircraft gun  [see NWM a n a g em e n t  and  Personnel,  Dec.  21,  the 
Washington Post  reported. ”I plead not guilty to each count,”  Beggs,  a former 
company executive,  told US. District Court Judge Ferdinand Fernandez. 
Fernandez scheduled a  trial  to  begin  April  8 ,   1986, although  prosecutor 
Randy Bellows said the case was  too complex to be heard so quickly. Bellows 
said the government had 2 .7  m i l l ion  documents to  review. 
Thomas Sullivan,  attorney  for General Dynamics,  told  Fernandez that  the 
defendants  wanted  the  trial  to  begin  in  the  spring  because  a  government 
suspension of most contracts w i th  the  company  until the  case  was  resolved 
had  put the defense contractor  “in  a  real  serious  bind  . . . This  company 
could be literally  . . . put out of business by this suspension,” Sullivan said. 
Attorneys estimated the trial could take more than  12  weeks,  w i th  Bellows 
saying he would call at  least 70 witnesses. (WpOst, Dec  17/85, A13) 

December  7 8  NASA  announced  that  H.  William Wood,  deputy  associate

Ames  Research Center 

February  7 :   NASA  announced  that  effective January 24,  Dr.  Dale Compton 
became deputy director of Ames Research Center (ARC), where he had been 
director  for  engineering and  computer systems  since  February  1983. Com- 
pton joined  NASA  in  June 1957, serving as  deputy director  of  astronautics, 
then  chief of  the  space  science division  and  manager of  the  lnfrared Astro- 
nomical  Satellite  (IRAS).  Recipient  of  the  NASA  Outstanding  Leadership 
Medal, Compton earned a  B.S.  degree  in 1957 and an M.S.  degree  in  1958, 
both  in  aeronautical  engineering,  and  a  Ph.D.  degree  in  aeronautical and 
astronautical engineering in  1969. (NASA Release 85-17;  NASA anno.,  Feb 21 
85 )  

During February: Ames  Research Center (ARC) announced i t  had formed the 
information  sciences  office  to  do   basic  and  applied  research  in   artificial 
intelligence  (AI),  automation  sciences,  and  space-related computer  science 
technology,  w i th  emphasis on applications to the NASA space  station. 
NASA  had designated ARC  as  the  lead center  in  AI  research,  and the  new 
office’s  research would cover AI programming languages,  expert-systems de- 
velopment,  knowledge  representation  and  information  understanding,  ma- 
chine vision and  learning, sensor  fusion,  and optical processing. 
Space-related computer-science  research  would  focus  on  symbolic-proc- 
essing  and  data-flow  architectures;  network  design,  protocols,  and  simula- 
tion;  and optical  read/write information-storage technology. 
ARC  would combine  in-house studies,  primarily  on applied  research  and 
development of flight experiments to validate and demonstrate the technolc- 
gies being developed, with the work of outside research organizations,  such 
as  SRI  International, Symbolics Inc.,  Innovative Optics,  Inc.,  Stanford Univer- 
sity,  University of California a t  Berkeley, MIX  University of Texas,  and Univer- 
sity of Michigan, on basic  research issues to accomplish project objectives. 
ARC  would orient  research  toward the  user community,  particularly other 
NASA  centers,  focusing  on  both  technology  development  for  user  applica- 
tions  and  help  to  users  during  implementation.  Space  station  automation 
would  be  the  primary  application,  and  ARC  had  signed  agreements with 
Johnson Space Center and Goddard Space Flight Center to work together on 
this  implementation.  ARC  would  also  advise  on  space  station  automation 

186 

NASA 

through  participation  on  NASA  advisory  groups  such  as  the  space  station 
automation  study  team,  space  station  automation and  robotics  panel,  ad- 
vanced-technology  automation  committee,  and  NASA  headquarters space 
station data systems  steering committee.  (ARC Release 85-6) 

March  12:  NASA announced that  personnel at Ames  Research Center (ARC) 
would  break  ground  March  14  for  the  numerical  aerodynamic  simulation 
(NAS) facility  building to  house the  world’s  most  powerful  supercomputer 
system,  which was  intended to  provide a national computational capability 
that  would  complement  NASA‘s  experimental  facilities  in   maintaining  na- 
tional  preeminence  in  aeronautical  research. Researchers  would  use  high- 
speed  supercomputers  i n   the  system  to   solve  complex  aerodynamic 
equations describing the  fundamental  fluid  physics and  large scale aerody- 
namic  flows  associated w i th   aircraft  flying  in earth’s  atmosphere.  In effect, 
they would test aircraft configurations by “flying”  them in  the NAS supercom- 
puter system,  reducing both time and costs  associated w i th  development of 
new aircraft. 
NAS would also support other research,  including computational materials 
and structures,  chemistry, and astrophysics; weather  predictions; and genetic 
engineering. ARC  also  intended to  make the supercomputer  network availa- 
ble to  remote  users  i n  universities,  private  industry,  and  other  government 
research agencies via satellite. 
Cray  Research‘s  Cray  2  supercomputer,  with an expected operating speed 
of  250   m i l l ion   calculations  per  second when  working  aerodynamic  p r o b  
lems,  would  be the heart of the  initial NAS network when  i t  became opera- 
t i o n a l   i n   m id-1986 .   NASA   i n t e n d e d   t o   i n c o r p o r a t e   even  faster 
supercomputers  as  they  became  commercially  available,  with  the  aim  of 
including supercomputers with up to one b i l l ion  calculations per second  in  
1988 and  10 b i l l ion  calculations per second in  the  1990s. 
In an  effort to  create a partnership between people and machines that,  in  
itself,  would  advance computer simulation,  NASA  had architects  Hunt and 
Co.  design the 90 ,500-sq .  ft.  concrete building so  as  to encourage scientists 
who  would  use the computers for  research to work closely with  the  people 
who  would  operate,  maintain,  and develop the  NAS  system.  Building con- 
tractor was  Perini Co.  (NASA Release 85-37)  

A p r i l  2:  NASA announced that a group of  researchers  led by Dr.  Lelia Coyne, 
San Jose University, working at Ames  Research Center (ARC) discovered new 
clayenergy storage and transfer processes that  supported a clay origin-of-life 
theory,  which contradicted the theory that organic life arose from an acciden- 
tal  combination  of  chemicals  and  energy  in   a  primordial  ”soup”  on  the 
primitive earth. 
Basic to the clay origin-of-life theory were observations suggesting that clay, 
although  composed of  inorganic material,  exhibited  l i fe l ike  characteristics 

187 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

in   its  ability  to  select  out  certain  chemicals  and  to  serve  as  a  catalyst  for 
chemical reactions. Some scientists also theorized that clay might be able to 
perform additional  chemical functions basic to life including self-replication, 
growth, and transfer of  chemical information to other chemical systems. They 
believed that organic chemicals that eventually "learned"  to reproduce them- 
selves and create life could have come together in an orderly process that first 
appeared  in  the structuring and  reproductive processes attributed to clay. 
The  work  at  ARC  strengthened  this  theory  by  finding  that  clay  had  the 
ability  to absorb,  store,  and  transfer energy,  a necessary  process of  organic 
life. This  work  introduced a  new  and  important aspect to  the  clay-life  the- 
ory-that  clay minerals were capable of engaging in  energetic processes that 
were necessary conditions  i f  it was to be shown that clay had l i fe l ike  proper- 
ties. 
The NASA-sponsored investigation grew out of 20 years of research at ARC 
i n  studies of the chemical basis for the origin of  life. Other scientists working 
on various aspects  of clay  research at  ARC  were  Drs.  Sherwood Chang,  Ted 
Bunch, James Lawless,  Noam Lahav,  David White,  and Glenn Pollock. (NASA 
Release 85-48) 

September  7 7 :   NASA  announced  that  the  Ames  Research  Center  (ARC) se- 
lected Informatics General Corp. and Technology Development of California 
for  competitive  negotiations  leading to  an  approximately  $40  m i l l ion  f i v e  
year  contract  to  provide computational  resources for  research in  largescale 
computational fluid dynamics,  aerodynamics design and analysis,  computa- 
tional  chemistry,  astrophysics,  atmospheric  modeling,  and  satellite  image 
processing. 
The  winning  contractor  would  have  to  deliver  a  total  system  capability 
including the  computational  facility,  operational  support,  systems engineer- 
ing,  and management. 
The anticipated contract was  a follow-on  to existing services performed at 
ARC.  (NASA Release 85-130) 

October 2:  NASA's  Ames  Research Center (ARC) announced that the world's 
fastest and most powerful supercomputer,  the Cray-2,  arrived at ARC  to assist 
researchers  in  taking major steps  toward simulating actual aircraft flight and 
thus making possible important advances,  both in  cost savings and perform- 
ance,  in  aircraft design.  The  Cray-2  could  perform 250  m i l l ion  continuous 
calculations  per  second,  which  was  more  than  three  times  faster  than  the 
previous generation of  supercomputers. 
The Cray-2 was the first building block in  the creation of NASA's  Numerical 
Aerodynamic  Simulation  (NAS)  program,  planned  to  provide  the  world's 
most  powerful,  large-scale  high-speed  processor  system.  In addition  to  its 
advantages for aircraft design,  NAS represented an  important national facility 
i n   such  research  areas  as  aerothermodynamics,  computational  chemistry, 

188 

NASA 

atmospheric modeling, and other computationally  intensive scientific appli- 
cations. 
NASA  planned  the  NAS  system  as  an  ongoing  project w i th   continuous 
improvements  in   speed  and  memory.  I t s   objectives were  to  establish  and 
maintain a  leading-edge national  computation  capability  to  ensure  leader- 
ship  in   computational  fluid  dynamics  and  related  disciplines,  provide  an 
integrated  processing  system  capable  of  a  sustained  250  m i l l ion   floating- 
point, operations-per-second processing rate in 1986 and a one b i l l ion  rate in  
1987,  and  ac t   as  a  pathfinder  in   advanced,  large-scale  computer  systems 
capability. 
The Cray-2 was  four  feet  high and four  feet  in  diameter;  its small  size was 
made  possible  by  microminiaturization  of  the  electronic  circuits  and  ex- 
tremely dense  packing of  the  circuit boards.  Since  the  speed of  light was  a 
fundamental l im i t  on computer speed,  super fast machines had to be smaller 
in order  to  reduce  distances  that  information  traveled.  Computer  scientists 
indicated they expected to get  s t i l l  more speed  in  future machines by  further 
reducing size and adding more parallel processors. 
A  main feature of  the Cray-2  was  its  large random-access memory,  which 
was  16  times  larger  than  previous supercomputers' memories.  The  Cray-2's 
memory provided random access  from  any  of the machine's  four main proc- 
essors and any  of  i t s  high-speed data channels. This meant a  user could use 
a l l  or part of this memory quickly,  rather than taking hours to access data for 
large calculations. 
Another  main  feature  of  the  machine  was  that  i t s   tightly-packed,  heat- 
producing electronic  components were  immersed  for  cooling in  a colorless 
odorless,  inert fluorocarbon  liquid, the first such design  in computer history. 
(ARC Release 85-38) 

Goddard Space Flight Center 

lanuary  74  NASA  announced that  Goddard  Space  Flight Center  (GSFC)  is-  
sued  a  Request  for  Proposal (RFP)  to  industry to  develop  a  space  platform 
providing five years of on-orbit services to NASA  payloads while allowing the 
developer to market  it to  commercial  users,  an  innovative approach consid- 
ered a first step toward creating a closer partnership between government and 
industry  in   space.  Industry would  finance,  develop,  own,  and  operate  the 
platform w i th  first use  planned in  late  1988 and would be free  to market the 
platform  (totally  separate  from  NASA's  plans  for  a  governmentdeveloped, 
permanently manned space  station) for materials processing or other  manu- 
facturing activities. 
NASA  stipulated that the platform be capable of providing services for four 
future  projects:  the  extreme  ultraviolet  explorer  (EUVE),  the  x-ray  timing 
explorer (XTE),  a zero-gravity payload,  and an as  yet  unidentified project. 

189 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

The  Space  Shuttle  or  other  launch vehicle  would  place  the  commercial 
platform in  orbit. Commercial payloads would  reimburse the government for 
use of the orbiter and facilities.  (NASA  Release 85-7)

December  16: NASA announced that Gerald Griffin, director of NASA‘s  John- 
son Space Center USC),  would  leave the agency January 14,  1986,  to become 
president  of  the  Houston  Chamber  of  Commerce.  Robert  Goetz,  deputy 
director of JSC, would  become acting director  upon Griffin’s  departure. 
Griffin  had  been JSC’s  director  since  August  1982  and  had  served  with 
NASA  for  more than  20  years  in  a  number  of  key  positions  at  three  NASA 
centers  and  in  Washington,  D.C.  Griffin  served  in   the  U .S .   Air  Force  and 
worked  in  the aerospace industry before joining NASA  in 1964. 
“It  was  a tough decision to leave NASA,”  Griffin said,  but “1’11  depart with 
the  comfort  that  the  NASA  team  of  government,  industry,  and  university 
people w i l l  continue  their outstanding job   in  space  activities for  this coun- 
try. ” 
William Graham,  acting NASA  administrator,  said,  “As one of  NASA’s  key 
senior executives, Gerry has had a long distinguished career. He has received 
many  honors  and  awards  in  recognition  of  the  contributions  he  has  made 
both to  aeronautics  and  space.  We  shall  a l l   miss  h im  very much and wish 
him great success as  he moves on to new accomplishments.”  (NASA Release

Kennedy  Space Center 

August  1 6  Continuing a  project begun  in   1984,  some  of  the  world’s  most 
prominent  lightning experts gathered during the  summer at  Kennedy Space 
Center  (KSC) to  study  lightning  strikes and their effects,  the  Spaceport News 
reported. KSC  attracted scientists with a variety of  research  interests because 
i t  was  one of  the  nation’s  areas  of  highest frequency  of  strikes and the  pres- 
ence of  French experts who  had mastered the  technique of  triggering light- 
ning. 
Taking part in  the summer’s  project were  representatives of NASA,  the U.S. 
A ir  Force’s Wright Aeronautical  Lab,  the Federal Aviation Administration,  the 
U.S.  Naval Laboratory, France’s Center for Nuclear Studies, three U.S.  univer- 
sities,  and two  industry organizations. 
Since  late May,  the  36  lightning investigators had conducted studies  at  a 
specially  equipped  lightning research  facility  located on  the  shore of  Mos- 
quito  Lagoon about  nine miles north of  the vehicle  assembly  building.  The 

191 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

facility  included a launch site for  the three-foot  rockets used  to trigger  light- 
ning and two nearby trailers that housed the research teams and their e q u i p  
ment. 
From their control  center,  the  French experts triggered  lightning events  by 
launching a small rocket that trailed a thin copper wire to an altitude of about 
2000 feet. The wire acted as  a trigger, attracting a stroke, which vaporized the 
wire while traveling down an electrical pathway to the ground. Special instru- 
ments and cameras  near the  launch site recorded the strike  in  detail. 
The triggered  lightning events  allowed  researchers  to obtain ground  mea- 
surements  that  they  could  use  in   atmospheric  and  lightning  research.  R e  
searchers  might  eventually  use  information  from  the  studies  to  design 
advanced lightning protection systems  for  KSC  facilities and for  greater pro- 
tection  for aircraft such as  the Space Shuttle that  contained electronic flight 
control  systems. 
Other  research at  the  facilities included  using a Convair C-580  to obtain 
measurements  on  a  lightning  strike;  a  study  to  determine  how  lightning 
strokes gained access  to  power  lines;  investigation of  the Maxwell  Current, 
which  developed  in  a  particular pattern before,  during,  and after  thunder- 
storms;  and attempts to obtain three-dimensional photos of  lightning strikes. 
In  addition to hosting the project,  KSC was contributing funding to some of 
the university  research. Project managers hoped to attract more participants

lightning protection and prediction.  (Spaceport News, Aug  16/85,  7) 

September  11:  Kennedy Space Center  (KSC) announced  i t  had extended an 
existing contract w i th  Planning Research Corp.  (PRC) to provide engineering 
services for  the  Directorate of  Engineering Development at  KSC  and at Van- 
denberg Air  Force Base (VAFB). The $12,421,841  extension brought the total 
contract value to  $66,187,413  and extended the period of  performance from 
January 1,  1986,  through September 30,  1986. 
Under  the  contract,  PRC  would  design  ground-support  systems  for  the 
Space ShuttleKentaur program, which NASA would  use to inject space vehi- 
cles  into interplanetary trajectories after deployment from the Space Shuttle. 
PRC  would  also  provide designs  for  Space  Shuttle  launch-support e q u i p  
ment for  the  Department of  Defense (DOD) at VAFB,  which would  become 
the second launch and landing facility for the Space Shuttle in  the mid-l980s, 
particularly for  launching DOD payloads into polar orbit. 
Another  PRC  task  under the contract was  to provide KSC with designs for 
Space Shuttle cargo ground-support equipment.  (KSC Release 186-85) 

September  73: Kennedy Space Center (KSC) selected Boeing Aerospace O p  
erations,  General  Electric  Co.,  Grumman  Technical  Service  Inc.,  Hughes 
Aircraft  Co.,  Messerschmidt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB)/Erno  (the West  German

NASA 

firm that produced Spacelab), and McDonnell Douglas Technical Services to 
serve as  prime assessment teams to observe payload processing activities, the 
Spaceport  News  reported.  KSC  made the  selection  in  connection w i th   the 
initiation  of  a competitive  procurement for  a single  payload ground  opera- 
tions contract (PGOC) during the Space Transportation System's  operational 
period. 
NASA expected to  request proposals from  the  companies near the end of 
1985 or the beginning of  1986 and would  award a contract during fall  1986. 
This contract along with  those for  shuttle  processing and base operations 
were the  last major contracts to streamline operations as  the Space Transpor- 
tation  System  matured.  The  PGOC  contract would  consolidate operations, 
minimize interfaces,  and focus clear responsibility on a single payload con- 
tractor at KSC. 
Under  the  new  arrangement,  NASA  would  consolidate  work  then  per- 
formed by four  KSC contractors into a single contractor with prime  responsi- 
bility  for  processing of  payloads  at  KSC,  primarily  for  the  Space  Shuttle. 
Other  contract  duties  would  include  sustaining engineering,  communica- 
tions,  instrumentation, and telemetry operations, and miscellaneous support.

November  7:  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  awarded  ASEA  Robotics  Inc.  a 
$1,143,622 contract  to  bu i ld  a  robotic development prototype system  to  be 
installed  in  the  Robotic Applications  Development  Laboratory  (RADL) and 
serve  as  KSC's  control  center  for  robotics,  Spaceport  News  reported.  KSC 
currently  had  two  labs  for  robotics  research:  Lab  A  was  a  test  facility  for 
training  devices,  sensor  and  endeffector  development,  and  small  robotic 
projects;  Lab B functioned as  a control center made up of complex work cells 
and  "smart  systems"  (independent control  systems  integrated into one coor- 
dinated system) for  large robotic applications. 
The  objective  of  the  new  system  was  to  permit  engineers  to  combine 
existing  and  new  technology  to  create  advanced  independent  and  semi- 
independent  machines  and  machines  with  independent  decision-making 
capabilities or  a  "computer  brain,"  which  could  accomplish more on  their 
own   without  stepbystep  instructions  from  human  supervisors.  The  initial 
thrust of the new system would  be to develop the technology and techniques 
needed  to   automatically  load  and  unload  hazardous  fuels  aboard  space 
vehicles  and  payloads  during  prelaunch  ground  operations.  Future  chal- 
lenges included application of these refueling techniques to other fuels such 
as  cryogenic propellants. 
RADL would  have  an  electrically driven  articulated  robot composed of  a 
six-axes arm and  interchangeable endeffectors or  "hands,"  a  computer w i th  
user-friendly software,  and a vision  tracking system.  The facility would  serve 
as  the  focal  point  for  combining  robotics  hardware,  algorithms,  software, 

I 9 3  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

sensors,  and control  systems.  Leon Davis,  a development engineer and elec- 
trical  lead for  the  Robotic Control Systems,  said of  the new system,  “This  i s  
not a manipulator that  i s  teleoperated by a man,  but a robot with a computer 
brain capable of memorizing the contours and panels of  i t s  intended subject 
and carrying out its functions autonomously.”  Because NASA would  be ask- 
ing KSC  to  design  processing  facilities for  new-generation  launch  vehicles 
such as  the second generation Space  Shuttle and the  heavy  lift launch vehi- 
cles,  KSC  would  need  these  state-of-the-art  robotics  to  provide  the  most 
efficient  and  effective  processing  methods.  Hazardous,  time  critical,  and 
repetitive Space  Shuttle  and  payload  operations all  had  potential uses  for 
robotics. 
A  special  feature  of  the  system  was  a  “real  time”  tracking  system  using 
”closed-loop”  responsive adaptive  control  commands,  feedback,  and  error 
signals. “Adaptive control” meant that the robot altered its path automatically 
in  response to sensory feedback from its environment. The KSC  robot‘s servo- 
controls and  software utilities would  allow  its arm  to  operate adaptively  to 
control  positions and orientation  of all s ix  axes,  not only the endeffector  as 
found  in standard applications. 
An  electrically driven,  servo-controlled robot had several  advantages  over 
hydraulic robots,  the major one being that smooth motion, speed,  and trajec- 
tory  controls were  possible when  the  robot handled  loads up to  200  Ib.  As 
Davis said,  “We  really don’t  have applications for hydraulic robots. Hydraulic 
robots  can  leak,  proving  a  potential  hazard  to  the  tile  and  other  sensitive 
areas  of the orbiter.” 
KSC’s  robotics research would  progress  in  four  phases:  phase one was  the 
development  of  the  robotic  arm  in   static  work  cells;  phase  two  proposed 
advancing the  robotic  capabilities to  operate  in dynamic work  cells;  phase 
three would  include off-line programming using 3-D  graphics and simulated 
work cells;  and phase  four  entertained the  possibility of employing artificial 
i n tel I i gence.  Possible  future  ca pa bi I i t  i es  of  robots  were  t h reed  i men s i  onal 
scanning;  higher  order  processing;  artificial  intelligence;  sonic,  laser,  and 
other  ranging systems;  and  “touch”  and mobility  systems.  (Spaceport News,

Langley Research Center 

February  7:  NASA  announced  that  Robert Nunamaker,  formerly  chief  engi- 
neer  at  Ames  Research  Center  (ARC),  became  Langley  Research  Center’s 
(LaRC) space director w i th   responsibility for  advanced space  transportation, 
planetary  entry,  space  station  and  large  space  antenna  research,  and  for 
LaRC’s  atmospheric science program. Nunamaker began his NASA  career  at 
Lewis Research Center in  1958, where he acquired extensive experience with 
Project Mercury; he joined ARC  in 1963. Nunamaker received a  B.S.  degree

in  mechanical engineering in 1957,  followed  by  graduate work at Case  Insti- 
tute of  Technology  and  the  University  of  California  at  Los  Angeles.  (NASA 
Release 85-17;  NASA anno.,  Feb  2/85;  LaRC  Release 85-8) 

ju ly  8:  Langley Research Center (LaRC) announced that NASA would  sponsor 
an exhibition July 2 2  through July 30  at the  1985 National Scout Jamboree at 
Fort A.P.  Hill,  Virginia. The  jamboree,  celebrating  scouting’s  75th  anniver- 
sary,  was  expected to draw  more than  35,000  U.S.  and  international scouts 
and  leaders and many thousands of general public participants. 
The NASA exhibit, for which  LaRC was  serving as  lead coordinator,  would 
include information on subjects ranging from current aeronautics research to 
the Space Shuttle and man’s  future  in  space.  A  100-seat  theater would have 
video presentations and  live programs throughout each day. 
Astronaut Frederick Gregory, a former scout and long-time scouting enthu- 
siast,  would  participate in  the  jamboree’s  opening  program on July 24  and 
would  talk w i th  scouts  in  the  NASA exhibition area on that day. 
NASA would sponsor July 24 through 28 model rocket launch demonstra- 
tions and presentations on earning the Space Exploration merit badge. (LaRC 
Release 85-38) 

ju ly   23:  NASA  announced that  in  a two-andane-half-year  effort costing $15 
m i l l ion   i t  had  lengthened and  improved its Aircraft  Landing Dynamics Facil- 
ity at  Langley Research Center. 
The track,  used to test aircraft wheels,  tires,  and landing gear, used a high- 
pressure water jet system to  propel the test carriage along the raiI/track system 
where  researchers conducted  experiments under  simulated  runway  condi- 
tions.  Track  testing options  included choosing between concrete or  asphalt 
runway  surfaces  and  among a  full  range of  weather-related  surface  condi- 
tions,  including dry,  damp,  or  flooded  runways or  slush- or  icecovered  sur- 
faces.  Even  before  the  expansion,  NASA  believed  the  track  to  be  the  only 
facility  i n  the world capable of  testing full-size aircraft  landing gear  systems 
under closely controlled  conditions simulating takeoffs and  landings. 
Lengthening the  track  to  more than  one-half  mile  increased  the  facility’s 
maximum  test  speed from  120 to  250  mph and made possible,  for  the  first 
time,  simulated  landing  tests  of  all  modern aircraft and  the  Space  Shuttle. 
Other  facility  improvements included a higher capacity water jet system and 
a  newly  designed  high-speed  test  carriage.  The  improved  catapult  system 
produced a  1.7-million-lb.  thrust on the carriage,  resulting in  a 17-g  (gravity 
force) acceleration that pushed the carriage in  only 400 feet from zero to  250 
mph  in  two  seconds,  and  the  new  carriage  had a 20-by-40-foot  test  bay  to 
accommodate larger test articles. NASA used ten thousand gallons of water in  
maximum  speed  run. 

195 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Initial  research at  the  modified facility  would  study  the  cornering  forces 
and spin-up characteristics of  the  Space  Shuttle main gear  tire,  which spun 
up from zero to  landing speeds almost instantly at touchdown.  NASA would 
mount a tire-wheel-brake assembly on the carriage for  tests  of tire wear  and 
applied  loads and would run these first tests on the facility's  existing smooth 
concrete surface.  Later  runs would  require the  touchdown  area of  the  track 
altered to simulate the roughness and grooving of the Space Shuttle runway at 
Kennedy Space Center. NASA would then  paint smooth the  relatively  rough 
runway  to  determine  the  best  KSC  runway  characteristics  to  lessen  Space 
Shuttle tire wear. 
Later tests would  include a variety of aircraft landing hardware tests,  averag- 
ing  about 75 to 100 runs each. NASA estimated the facility could accomplish 
300 runs a year w i th  as  many as  s ix  a day during the height of a test program. 
One  test  program,  for  example,  would  compare  the  performance of  radial 
tires,  not  commonly  used  on aircraft,  to  that  of  conventional  bias  p ly  tires. 
NASA would run these tests  in  conjunction w i th  a Federal Aviation Adminis- 
tration/NASA  program to gather  information on  runway surface traction. 
NASA  had  scheduled  over  the  next  several  years  test  programs  that  in- 
cluded  track  tests  to  develop  a data  based  for  the  National  Tire  Modeling 
Program,  an analytical computer model to aid  in  design of  new tires,  and a 
tire failure study.  (NASA Release 85-109) 

Lewis  Research Center 

A p r i l   77:  NASA announced  that  Lewis  Research Center  (LeRC) was  develop 
ing  a liquid droplet  radiator intended to solve the problem of dissipating heat 
that  builds  up   inside a spacecraft,  allowing a  livable temperature  for  astro- 
nauts. Heat removal was currently accomplished through a heavy,  bulky,  rigid 
metal  heat transfer system,  which added considerable weight  to  the  space- 
craft. 
The LeRC system would  use the surface of a l iqu id  coolant to radiate away 
excess  heat and  save  as  much as  90% of  the  current  hardware weight.  The 
system entailed exposing a moving stream of  hot droplets,  the diameter of a 
human hair,  directly  into space,  allowing the heat to  radiate from  the drop- 
lets'  surface.  In   the  process,  a  generator  would  eject  the  droplets  into  a 
collector  where  they  would  rejoin  to  form  a  liquid;  the  system  would  then 
recirculate and  reuse this coolant. 
Selection or  development  of  a heat  transfer  fluid w i th   proper vapor  pres- 
sure and  a sufficiently  long life was  essential  to  the  project.  Also  crucial to 
system  feasibility was  development  of  a  micromachining  capability  to   pro- 
duce holes w i th  0.002-in.  diameters for use  in  the  l iqu id  droplet  generator. 
"This  i s  a very  advanced concept,"  Alden  Presler,  LeRC  program manager, 
said.  "The  technology  we're  developing here  at  Lewis w i l l   result  in  a very 
lightweight and compact piece of hardware."  (NASA Release 85-53)

April  22: NASA  announced  Lewis  Research Center  awarded  a $58,291,440 
contract to General Dynamics Corp.  to modify three Centaur G vehicles,  the 
nation's  most  powerful  upper  stage  vehicles,  to  fit  into  the  Space  Shuttle's 
payload  bay  to  launch  various  large  spacecraft  including the  Calileo  and 
Ulysses missions, both scheduled for spring 1986. 
The  so I e-sou rce,  cost-p I us-i n cen t i =fee  contract for  fabrication,  assem b I y, 
test,  checkout,  and  delivery  of  the  vehicles  would  begin  April  1985  and 
continue through October  1987.  (NASA Release 85-61) 

May 2: Lewis Research Center  (LeRC) researchers were working on  improve- 
ments  in   the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS) air-traffic  control  system  to 
provide more efficient air transportation in  the U.S. and to maintain the U.S. 
position of  leadership in  c iv i l  aviation,  the  Lewis  News  reported. 
A major NAS requirement was  accurate upper-air w ind  information, neces- 
sary for efficient movement and control of aircraft. Dating back to 1982,  LeRC 
recognized this need and proposed and developed,  in  cooperation w i th  the 
Environmental  Research  Laboratories of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmo- 
spheric  Administration  (NOAA),  an  interactive  data  management  and  en- 
hancement  system  (MERIT)  to  improve  significantly  the  accuracy  of 
upper-wind forecasts  in  the  U.S. 
To  evaluate  the  potential  of  MERIT,  the  Federal  Aviation  Agency  (FAA) 
formed an aviation weather  task  force of a dozen experts from NOAA,  NASA, 
and universities that was  fed  by Dr. John McCarthy of the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research. Over  18  months at a cost of half a m i l l ion  dollars, the 
task  force would examine a l l  aviation weather forecast products concurrently 
w i th   MERIT.  If the MERIT  system  could  provide  improved  upper-level wind 
information  (initial  tests  at  N O M  showed  a  20  to  30% reduction  in  wind 
error  compared  to  the  existing  system),  i t  was  possible  that  MERIT  could 
become  an  important contribution  to  the  NAS  of  the  1990s.  (LeRC News, 
May 2/85,  2 )  

lune 3: Lewis Research Center (LeRC) announced it awarded Honeywell Inc., 
Avionics  Division,  a  $14,900,000  contract  for  fabrication  and  delivery  of 
three flight  inertial measurement groups (IMG) for  the ShuttldCentaur guid- 
ance and  navigation system,  which maintained a fixed  reference orientation 
for  and measured acceleration of the Centaur. 
Work  under the sole-source firm-fixed-price contract would begin  in  May 
1985 at  the contractor's  plant in  Clearwater,  Florida. 
NASA was  modifying the Centaur,  which had launched domestic and m i l i-  
tary  communications  satellites and  sent  spacecraft  to  investigate  planetary 
systems,  to fit  into the Space Shuttle.  NASA  would first  use  the Shuttle Cen- 
taur combination to  launch the Galileo and then the Ulysses missions. (LeRC

August  26:  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC)  announced  today  that  i t  would 
open  in  September the microgravity materials science  laboratory (MMSL) to  
help experimenters make better decisions about what  i s  and  i s  not feasible 
for science experiments in  space.  Such experiments are expected to provide 
knowledge leading to new materials, more efficient use of earth‘s  nonrenew- 
able  fuel  resources,  new  medicines,  advanced  computers  and  lasers,  and 
better com m u n i cat ions. 
Providing a  capability  that  existed  nowhere else  in   the  world,  the  new 
laboratory would offer  U.S.  scientists and engineers a low-cost,  low-risk way 
to test new ideas for materials science research in space.  Initial research plans 
would  support  metal  and  alloy  solidification  and  electronic  crystal  growth 
studies. The  laboratory should give U.S.  companies a competitive advantage 
in  developing better  ground-based materials and/or  processing of  materials 
through microgravity research. 
The laboratory, along with LeRC’s  assignment to develop the power system 
for  the  proposed space  station,  would  put  LeRC  into the  mainstream of  the 
U.S.’s space  research efforts.  (LeRC Release 85-63) 

Marshall Space Flight Center 

january 29: NASA  announced  i t  had selected Grumman Data System  Corp. 
for negotiations leading to  the award of a contract for a high-speed (Class VI) 
computer  system  for  Marshall Space  Flight Center  (MSFC). The  fixed-price 
contract would require Grumman to provide hardware, software,  documenta- 
tion,  and services  for  installation and maintenance of a scientific- and engi- 
neeringcomputations  system  in   support  of  MSFC’s  programs  in  thermal, 
electrical,  load,  and structuraldesign  characteristics that  influence flight-ve- 
hicle and payload performance. 
The  five-year  contract,  to  begin  no  later  than  August  1985, would  cost 
about  $42 m i l l ion   and  provide  for  a  total  lease  period,  with  renewal  in  
periods of one to  12 months,  not to exceed  60  months.  (NASA Release 85- 
15) 

/u ly   7:  Marshall Space  Flight Center  (MSFC) announced that July 1  marked 
the center’s  25th anniversary. MSFC currently managed a budget of about $2 
b i l l ion  annually  and employed  some  3,300 people,  while  thousands  more 
worked w i th   numerous aerospace and other  high-tech organizations  in  the 
Huntsville, Alabama,  area to support the center’s  projects. 
During the  25 years,  MSFC  had  moved beyond  its  initial  role as  NASA‘s 
developer of  launch vehicles and  propulsion  systems  to  that  of  a scientific 
and  engineering organization  also  responsible for  spacecraft  and  scientific 
experiments. The  center  was  currently  responsible for  a  number  of  NASA 
programs including the Space Shuttle’s engines,  propellant tank,  and booster

Rockwell International for  Space  Shuttle systems  integration work  at  MSFC, 
Kennedy Space Center,  and Vandenberg Air  Force Base. The contract called 
for  provision  of  management,  personnel,  equipment,  materials,  and  re- 
sources from July 1,  1985 to June 30,  1988. (MSFC Release 85-34) 

December  79: Marshall Space  Flight Center (MSFC)  announced selection of 
Teledyne Brown  Engineering for  negotiation  leading to  the  award  of  a five-

pressurants facilities for the center. Total price for the first three contract years 
was approximately $8.8  million. 
Teledyne  Brown  would  furnish  the  necessary  management,  personnel, 
equipment,  and  materials  required  to  operate  and  maintain  the  gaseous 
pressurants equipment  and  distribution  systems,  liquid  propellants storage 
and transfer systems,  fluid  transporter  services,  valve and component  refur- 
bishment,  and  retention of  certification status  of  high-pressure systems,  in-

Wallops Flight  Facility 

lune 29: Goddard Space Flight Center announced the Wallops Flight Facility 
would celebrate i t s  40th anniversary on June 29. The events planned were i n  
recognition  of  the  scientific  and  technological  achievements  at  Wallops, 
which  had  conducted  rocketborne  experiments since  July 4,  1945,  when 
researchers first  launched a  17-fOOt Tiamat. 
Since  that  original  flight,  Wallops  had  launched  approximately  13,000 
rocket-propelled research vehicles and conducted thousands of aeronautical 
and aircraft tests to obtain information on aircraft and spacecraft flight charac- 
teristics  and  to  increase knowledge of  the  upper  atmosphere and  the  near- 
space  environment.  This  research  led  to  major  contributions  to  the  U.S.3 
aeronautical and space  programs. 
The breakthroughs to supersonic flight  by  aircraft and to hypersonic flight 
by rocket systems  were  largely  attributed to  fundamental  aerodynamic  re- 
search  conducted at Wallops by means of aerodynamic models propelled by 
multiple-stage rocket systems. 

199 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Using sounding rockets Wallops personnel developed the technologies for 
measuring atmospheric  structure and  the  space  environment,  such  as  tem- 
perature,  pressure and density,  micrometeorite densities, electric fields,  ener- 
getic particles, and radiation levels. These measurements formed the basis for 
developing design criteria for  scientific satellites  and manned spacecraft. 
Wallops's  researchers  also  pursued  technology  development  for  the 
manned  space  program,  such  as  manned  capsuleescape  techniques  and 
maximum dynamic  pressure tests  for  the Mercury Program. 
Most  recently Wallops  w a s   known  as  a  center  for  the  NASA  suborbital 
program.  Sounding rockets,  balloons,  and  aircraft conducted space  science 
and aeronautical research missions. 
The  island  obtained  i ts   name  from John Wallops,  appointed deputy  sur- 
veyor  of  Virginia  in   the  17th  century  by  Col.  Edmund  Scarburgh. Wallops 
received  a Crown  Patent  to  the  island  in  1672.  At  present,  the  facility,  in  
addition to the  island,  included the mainland area  in  back of the  island and 
the  main  base  (formerly the  Chincoteague  Naval  Air  Station)  about  sewn 
miles northwest. 
In addition to an  open  house,  the day's  anniversary events would  include 
an  Air  Force  F-15  aerial  demonstration  and  demonstrations  in   crash/fire/ 
rescue,  space  sciences,  model  rocketry,  and  radio  controlled  model  air- 
planes.  (GSFC Release 85-16) 

Office of  Inspector General 

kb rua ry   7:  NASA  announced  that  June Gibbs  Brown,  appointed  NASA's

Procurement 

February&?: NASA announced i t  had selected Dr. M i l ton  Silveira,  NASA’s  chief 
engineer,  as  its competition  advocate responsible for  recommending annual 
goals  and  objectives,  approving  organization  and  personal  accountability, 
assuring training,  and reviewing noncompetitive procurement to remove con- 
straints to  competition.  Silveira named David Austin  his principal  staff mem- 
ber.  A  NASA  management instruction would  designate each  center  deputy 
director  as  the center competition  advocate. 
NASA competitively  awarded 72% of its procurements in  FY 84,  represent- 
ing  a significant increase over  68 .8%   in  FY 83.  (NASA Release 85-21) 

A p r i l   10:  NASA  announced  selection  of  RMS  Associates  for  negotiations 
leading to  award of a contract for the operation and maintenance of the NASA 
Scientific and  Technical  Information  Facility  (STIF),  which  acquired,  orga- 
nized,  processed  and  stored  worldwide  aerospace  information  including 

201 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

published articles,  papers,  books,  and reports.  STlF  i s  located near the Balti- 
more/Washington International Airport. Under the contract terms,  RMS  Asso- 
ciates would acquire and process documents and data approved by NASA for 
entry into the collection; catalog, abstract,  index, announce, and disseminate 
these materials; maintain a supporting reference service; compile specialized 
bibliographies; and provide other technical  support. 
The one-year contract,  commencing July 1,  1985,  and preceded by a one- 
month phase  in,  included  provision  for  two  one-year  priced option  exten- 
sions  and  two  one-year  unpriced  options.  RMS   Associates  estimated  the 
one-year  contract value at about $5 million, with a total of approximately $15 
m i l l ion  for the first three years.  (NASA Release 85-54) 

September 30: NASA  announced  selection of  150  research proposals from 
small  business  high-technology  firms  under  a  program  established  by  the 
Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (PL 97-219)  to stimulate 
technological  innovation  in  the  private sector,  strengthen  the  role of  small 
businesses in  meeting NASA's research and development needs,  and con t r ib  
Ute to the growth  and strength of  the nation's  economy.  NASA  selected pro- 
posals  on  the  basis  of  their  technical  merit  from  the  1,164  submitted and 
expected to award contracts  in  four  to eight weeks. 

Contractors funded under the program would conduct work  in  two phases: 
first,  a  six-month  fixed-price  effort  to  explore  the  feasibility  of  the  small 
business-proposed innovations and,  i f  the  results warranted,  a second phase 
effort of up to two years  in  duration to proceed further w i th  the technological 
innovation.  Commercial firms  or  government agency  programs would  fund 
any work  beyond the second phase. 

The selections resulted from NASA's  third solicitation for Phase I proposals 
in  areas of research and development of  interest to the agency.  NASA's FY 85 
budget  included approximately  $7.5  m i l l ion   for  Phase  I,  managed  by  the 
Office  of  Commercial  Programs,  NASA  Headquarters.  (NASA  Release  85- 
136) 

November 27:  NASA  announced  selection  of  64  research  proposals  from 
high-technology small business firms  for  negotiation of  Phase  I I  contracts  in 
its  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program  established  under  Public 
Law  97-219.  The  contract  awards  would  total  approximately  $30  million. 
NASA  selected the  Phase  I I   programs,  follow-ons  to  previous Phase  I con- 
tracts,  from  113  proposals submitted  by  Phase  I contractors in  the  1984 pro- 
gram.  Phase I included 127 awards selected from  919  proposals. 
Objectives  of  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program  were  to 
stimulate  technological  innovation,  strengthen  the  role of  small  business in

meeting  federal  agencies’  research  and  development  needs,  and  foster  in- 
creased  private  sector  commercialization  of  innovations  from  federal  r e  
search  and  development.  The  program  also  encouraged  minority  and 
disadvantaged business participation. 

In Phase  I,  NASA  awarded six-month  fixed-price contracts  to  explore the 
feasibility  of  the  proposed  innovation and  the  value  of  conducting  further 
research and development. Continuation of the activity  into Phase  II, which 
could extend up to two years,  depended on the merit of the work and agency 
program  plans  and  needs.  Selection  might  also  depend  on  availability of 
funds from the private sector and/or government for development or commer- 
cialization beyond the scope of the Small Business  Innovation Research pro- 
gram.  (NASA Release 85-157)

Review Boards 

March 8:  NASA announced that,  following launch of Atladcentaur  62 carry- 
ing the seventh  lntelsat V  payload, a significant  leak occurred in the Centaur 
liquid  oxygen  (LO,)  tank  during Atlas  and  Centaur  separation,  resulting  in 
loss of  LO,  and  precipitation of  a  series  of  anomalous events  that  compro- 
mised vehicle  performance and caused  loss of the mlssion. 
Centaur  main  engine  start  and  steady-state operation  began  for  the  first 
burn  sequence;  however,  the  engines  burned  fuel  rich  as  a  result  of  an 
attempted correction of the  LO,  loss. Also,  Centaur’s  f i rs t   main engine cutoff 
had  occurred  approximately  11  seconds  early,  as  a  result of  LO,  mass  loss 
(approximately 1483  lb.) through  the  tank  opening.  After  first  main engine 
cutoff,  the  leading LO,  ullage gasses  (HE and GO,)  created a disturbing force 
on the vehicle,  causing it to tumble  out of control  during the ensuing coast 
period. 
During the coast period, the LO,  tank pressure vented down to less than the 
hydrogen tank  pressure at  1040 seconds,  causing reversal and  rupture of the 
intermediate bulkhead  so  that  the  two  tank  pressures  were  essentially the 
same  throughout the  remainder of the flight. 
Although  2nd  Centaur engine start was  achieved,  the engines shut  down 
after  less  than  seven  seconds of  operation  because  of  inadequate tank  pres- 
surization  and  subsequent  engine  cavitation.  This  made  i t   impossible  to 
achieve proper orbit,  and  NASA terminated the mission. 
Following the failure,  NASA  Headquarters initiated a Flight Review Board 
composed  of  representatives from  the  NASA  centers,  U.S.  Air  Force,  and 
INTELSAT.  During the  investigation,  NASA  obtained special  assistance  from 
Physics International for  analytical shock analysis of various blast-shield and 
tank-pressure  configurations,  General  DynamicdFt.  Worth  Division  for 
shaped charge firing tests and consultations, and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft for 
special  engine  testing  to   resolve  LO,  back  flow  anomaly  and  special 
postflight reconstructions. 
The investigation teams’  findings indicated that the most probable cause of 
the  failure was  due  to  shock  induced  loads  on  the  LO,  tank  at  high  tank 
pressures  causing tank  failure. Corrective actions  taken  to  clear  AC-63  for 
flight would  include  reduced  tank  pressures to  prior  levels,  increase  in the 
interstage adaptor to blast-shield gap,  and a check for ambient flight pressure 
and  leaks on each tank.  (NASA MOR M-491-203-84-07

lune   4:  NASA  announced  that  an  eight-member  review  team  at  Goddard 
Space  Flight Center  concluded  that  the  failure of  the  Global  Low  Orbiting 
Message Relay Satellite (GLOMR) to deploy from  its canister during the April 
1985  Space  Shuttle  51-6  mission  was  due  to  the  failure  of  two  switches

NASA  

designed  to activate bolt cutters on  the  canister. On  June 7 the  team would 
issue a final  report along with  recommendations for  a solution  to  the  prob- 
lem. 
The Northern Utah Satellite (NUSAT) along with GLOMR would be the first 
satellites successfully deployed from canisters aboard the Space Shuttle. The 
door  of  the  GLOMR  canister  opened,  indicating  normal  battery operation, 
but the bolt cutters would  not activate. After  a second deployment attempt, 
NASA decided to  return GLOMR  to earth for evaluation. (NASA Release 85- 
85) 

lune  20: NASA announced that a mishap investigation board had completed 
its  report  on  a  March  8  accident  in  which  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery’s 
payload  bay  door  was  damaged  and  a  technician  was  injured  during  pre- 
launch preparations for  mission 51-D  at  KSC  [see  Space Transportation Sys- 
tem/Launch Schedules, March 81. 
In its executive summary,  the board reported that  “the  immediate cause of 
the mishap was  the failure of  a master  link in one of the two  redundant hoist 
systems  that  raise  and  lower  the  payload  bay  access  platform.”  The  report 
then noted,  “The  mishap can be characterized as  the culmination  of a series 
of  events  and  conditions  that  pushed  the  mechanical  components  to  and 
beyond their  limits.” 
In the accident,  a payload bay access platform used to provide access to the 
orbiter’s  cargo  bay  fell  from  its  stowed  position  on  a  rolling bridge  crane. 
Tracing the  events  and conditions  that  led to the  accident,  the  board  noted 
that  “Operators of  the  payload bay access  platforms customarily stowed the 
platforms by  raising them  until the  telescoping  tubes  contacted  the  (single) 
upper-limit switch that  stopped  its upward travel. 
“On  March  4,  a  Lockheed  Space  Operations  Co.  (LSOC)  technician  re- 
ported a broken upper-limit  switch that had caused  the telescoping structure 
to  impact the supporting structure.  In crane and hoist parlance, this is called 
‘two-blocking.’  The  inboard master  link  failed at  this  time,  and  cable over- 
wrap was  noted on that portion of  the winch.  The entire updown  portion of 
this system was tagged out with a ‘Do Not Operate’ tag,  since only one half of 
the  redundant  hoist  system  remained  intact.  This  tag  was  placed  on  the 
operating controls along with two other similarly appearing tags,  both several 
months old,  describing limitations on the operation of the platforms.” 

The board’s summary then noted the platforms were operated at least twice 
and stowed at  least once between March 4 and the March 8 accident.  “Dur- 
ing  the stowing operation(s), given the fact of a broken upper-limit switch and 
the  standard operating procedure,  i t  i s  an  inescapable conclusion  that addi- 
tional  two-blocking  occurred.  This  imparted  extremely  high  loads  to  the 
master  link  in  the  remaining wire  rope assembly,  fracturing i t  almost to the 

205 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985  

point of sufficient separation for the assembly  to fall. When the bridge assem- 
b ly  was  moved on  the morning of March 8 ,  the  resulting jolt was  enough to 
complete the break,  and the  platform assembly  fell.” 
The board recommended that  there be a revision of operating procedures 
and  operator  training  to  ensure  the  upper-limit  switches  not  be  used  as 
operational  stops,  of tagout/lockout  procedures to prevent unauthorized use 
of equipment that had been identified as  unsafe,  and of the platform preven- 
tive maintenance procedures to meet a l l   KSC  and Occupational  Safety  and 
Health Administration  (OSHA) standards;  a modification  of  the design of  the 
payload  bay  access  platform  to  include  the  addition  of  an  operational  stop 
and  ‘load  sensing  device  in  the  wire  rope  system;  and  a  redesign  of  the 
telescoping tubes  to facilitate the  required inspection of  critical  linkages. 
The  board  estimated  damage  to  Discovery  and  access  platform  at 
$200,000  and noted that the accident delayed rollover to the vehicle  assem- 
b ly  building from March 8 until March 2 3 .  (NASA  Release 85-95) 

Technology Transfers 

February 8: Los Angeles’s  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center announced develop 
ment of a new surgical tool,  using JPCs excimer  (excited “dimer”)  laser tech- 
nology,  for  one of medicine‘s most difficult and  long-awaited procedures-a 
means to clean out clogged vascular passages without surgical  intervention, 
the JPL  Universe reported. The  lasers  would  be  a  significant alternative  to 
existing  treatments-that  of  angioplasty,  in   which  a  balloon  catheter 
squeezed blockage out of the way,  or bypass surgery. 
A JPL  research team with Cedars-Sinai colleagues had developed the new 
laser  technology,  which  used  glass-magnetic  switches  in  which  a  xenon 
chloride-excimer  laser  produced  a  uniform  beam of  energy  controlled  and 
pulsed  to  extremely  short  periods,  to  overcome  the  problems  of  lack  of 
precision and  control  and  high  heat of  current  medical  lasers.  The JPUCe- 
darshinai  procedure would  allow a fiber-optic catheter,  placed nonsurgically 
in  the  brachial and  femoral  arteries and  threaded  to the  site of  the  obstruc- 
tion,  to  transmit  the  laser’s  energy  to  the  clogged  vessel.  The  fiber-optic 
imaging system would enable doctors to view the artery on a TV screen as  the 
laser  cleared  the  material  forming  the  blockage. The  speed  of  the  laser’s 
delivery-10 
to 200 billionths of a second bursts of ultraviolet light-allowed 
the  laser  to  cut  through arterial  plaque with  precision and  l i t t le   damage  to 
surrounding tissue. 
Although  researchers  were  cautious  in  predictions of  the  laser’s  medical 
potential,  they  believed  results of experimentation,  though  not yet  done on 
living human patients, signaled additional future medical applications,  rang- 
ing from removal of kidney stones to changing the eye shape of patients with 
myopia. UPL  Universe, Feb  8/85,  1)

May  2:  NASA  announced  that  research  scientist  Dr.  Billy  Wolverton  and 
research chemist Rebecca McDonald at  its National Space Technology Labo- 
ratory  (NSTL),  Bay  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  had  shown  that  the  water  hyacinth, 
when  used  under  controlled  conditions,  was  ideally  suited  for  purifying 
domestic  and  certain  industrial wastewaters.  In  addition  to  the  water  hya- 
cinths ability to produce large quantities of fresh water,  the  researchers deter- 
mined  the  plant could  be  harvested and  ground  into fertilizers and  used  to 
produce biogas and fiber. The water  hyacinth also showed promise for  parti- 
ally  supplying  life-sustaining  functions  for  space  travel  including  oxygen, 
food,  pure water,  and waste  treatment. 
Researchers  at  NSTL  had  for  11  years  tested  the  vascular  aquatic  water 
hyacinth (the floating species) as  an  inexpensive method of treating wastewa- 
ter.  The  research led to  installation of a simple and cost-effective wastewater- 
treatment  system  at  NSTL  and  development communities  in  Florida,  Texas, 
and California. 
More recently,  NASA developed an advanced natural wastewater-treatment 
process that combined anaerobic microbial  filter technology with the vascu- 
lar  plant  wastewater  treatment  technology  to  produce  an  efficient  hybrid 
system  that used  rooted,  cold-tolerant plants such  as  common  reed growing 
on  the  surface  of  a  microbial  rock  filter  bed.  The  filter  reed  system  had 
advantages over  the floating aquatic system because wastewater  was exposed 
to  the  atmosphere only  after  treatment and  higher  chemical concentrations 
could  be  tolerated  because  of  the  high  surface  microbial  filter.  Although 
NASA  developed  the  system  for  domestic  sewage,  the  system  had shown a 
potential for  chemical  waste  and  drinking water  treatment.  (NASA  Release 
85 -65 )  

May  2:  In elaborating on a report that appeared  in the Jet Propulsion Labora- 
tory’s  UPL)  Universe  [see  NASmechnology Transfer,  Feb.  81,  NASA  issued 
information on a system called the excimer laser,  a laser system developed by 
a team of  physicians at  Los  Angeles’s  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and  laser 
scientists at  JPL  to  nonsurgically  clean clogged arteries with  unprecedented 
precision. The system  may  eventually allow  patients with  arteriosclerosis to 
avoid coronary  bypass surgery. 
JPL  scientists originally developed the excimer laser to measure gases  such 
as  ozone  in   the  earth’s  atmosphere.  Investigations  into  its  application  to 
medicine  began a  year  and a half previously when  Cedars-Sinai physicians 
Warren Grundfest,  Frank  Litvack,  and James Forrester,  who were conducting 
research into the potential of  lasers  in  cardiology,  sought a more precise and 
cooler  laser than  those currently available for  use  in medicine. 
They  found  such a laser  in  the excimer developed by JPL  laser researchers 
Drs. James Laudenslager, Thomas Pacala,  Stuart McDermid,  and David Rider. 
Working  w i th   the  Cedars-Sinai physicians and a fiber optics  consultant,  Dr.

Tsvi Goldenberg, the JPL team  refined the  laser for  the delicate cardiovascu- 
lar  cleaning  procedure devised  by  the  medical  researchers.  Although  the 
researchers were properly cautious in  their predictions of the  laser's  medical 
potential,  the  results of experiments were encouraging. 
NASA's  office of space science and applications funded development of the 
excimer  laser.  (NASA Release 85-66) 

May  2:  NASA announced that Inorganic Coatings,  Inc. was providing interior 
corrosion protection to the refurbished Statue of Liberty by means of a primer 
coating  known  as  K-Zinc  531,  an  aerospace  spinoff  product  developed  at 
Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to protect gantries and other structures 
a t   NASA's  primary  launch site,  Kennedy Space Center (KSC). 
Because  KSC  was  located on  Florida's Atlantic  Coast,  its  launch facilities 
required greater corrosion protection due to constant exposure to salt  spray 
and fog. GSFC undertook a research program to develop a coating that would 
not only resist salt corrosion, but also protect KSC  launch structures from very 
hot  rocket  exhaust  and  the  thermal  shock  created  by  rapid  temperature 
changes  during a space  launch. The GSFC  research resulted in  an  inorganic 
water-based potassium silicate  binder,  a  compound  that  provided  long-term 
protection w i th  a single application. 
NASA granted in  1981 a  license for the coating to Shane Associates,  which 
signed an  agreement with  Inorganic Coatings to allow  i t  to become the sole 
manufacturer and  sales  agent  under  the  Shane  license.  Inorganic Coatings 
assigned the trade name K-Zinc 531 to the compound,  which was  nontoxic, 
nonflammable,  and had no organic emissions. The high ratio silicate formu- 
lation bonded to steel  in 30  minutes and created a hard ceramic  finish with 
superior  adhesion  and  abrasion  resistance.  It  required  no  straining  before 
application  and could be mixed on site.  (NASA Release 85-64) 

May  6 :  NASA announced that space age technology was  in  use in the Repub 
lic of Gabon, Africa,  where solar photovoltaic power systems installed in four 
rural villages would  improve public health and education facilities and  light- 
ing and  sanitary water  supplies.  NASA's  Lewis  Research Center  (LeRC) rnan- 
aged the project, which was  jointly funded by the U.S  Department of Energy 
(DOE) and the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulic Resources of the Republic of 
Gabon;  the  Gabon  government  selected  the  villages  to  participate  in  the 
program. 
The  project  provided a  photovoltaic power  system,  lights,  a i r   circulation 
fan,  and a refrigeratodfreezer for  vaccine storage  to each village dispensary 
and a power system,  lights, and a color TV and video cassette  recorder/player 
to  each  village  school.  The  villages'  sanitary  water  systems  had  a  newly 
drilled well,  a photovoltaic system,  a submersible well  pump, a water storage 
tank,  and  a water  distribution  system  that  piped water  to  village fountains. 
Public  lighting systems  included  a  power  system  and  sodium  vapor  lamps 

208  

NASA  

mounted on poles. All systems were instrumented to collect data for perform- 
ance analyses. 
Total photovoltaic array capacity for all systems was  12.1  kw;  output of the 
smallest array  was  80 watts  for  street  lights,  the  largest 3  kw  for  one water 
pump. Batteries for the solar arrays should  last about 10 years before replace- 
ment;  solar arrays had a life expectancy of at  least 20  years. 
According to Tony  Ratajczak,  project manager at  LeRC,  ”The  goal of  DOE 
and the Republic of Gabon, for this project,  i s  to investigate and evaluate the 
economic,  social and technical value of photovoltaic power systems in  aiding 
progress and  improving the quality of  life in Gabon.”  (NASA Release 85-68) 

During November:  NASA announced that three physicians from Washington 
University Medical Center,  St.  Louis, Misssouri, met the previous month with 
NASA scientists from  National Space Technology Laboratories (NSTL) to dis- 
cuss using remote sensing techniques as  an analytical tool for use in  the field 
of  body  scanning known as  nuclear magnetic  resonance or  NMR.  Dr.  Mi- 
chael Vannier,  radiologist and principal investigator for the project, said NMR 
was  already  used  on  a  number  of  organ  systems  in   the  brain.  However, 
interest  had  grown  in   how  magnetic  resonance  imaging might  fit  into  the 
scope of breast diagnostic techniques. So  Drs. John Gohagan and Ed Spitzna- 
gel,  also  of  Washington  University,  on  behalf  of  the  National  Cancer  Insti- 
tute’s  Breast  imaging Project joined Vannier  at  the discussions. 
The  meeting  resulted  i n  a  three-year collaborative effort among the  Mal- 
linckrodt  institute of  Radiology in  St.  Louis,  NSTL,  and  the  Kennedy Space 
Center. 
Vannier  commented that  the  union w i th   NASA  was  vital  to maximize the 
potential  of  NMR  scanning.  “One  of  the  characteristics  of  these  magnetic 
resonance scanners  i s  that  they  provide very  specific  anatomic  information 
about the  location and size of a tumor.  However there are other ways  to get 
the same  information,  one being the use of a mammogram,  or  breast X-ray.” 
At  NSTL,  scientists Doug Rickman and J im  Anderson were  responsible for 
applying the analytical capabilities to  make NMR scans  a notable advance- 
ment over  other methods of  X-ray  and  body scanning techniques.  They  had 
demonstrated the  use  of  ELAS  software  to  enhance  NMR  images,  thus  in- 
creasing disease detection accuracy. Vannier explained,  “NO one in medicine 
really has the kind of experience with classifying or analyzing these types of 
images this way.  That’s  why we  are  using NASA expertise to help us.” 
By  incorporating  the  ELAS  software  used  in  processing satellite  imagery 
into  the  system,  NMR  scans  could  provide  not  only  information  on  the 
location  and size of  a  tumor,  but also  i t s  biological  behavior. That  is,  physi- 
cians could determine the  status  of  a  mass of  tumor  directly from  the  NMR 
image without  having to enter the body surgically.

Close affiliation w i th   pathoiogists while working  on  actual  cases  was  im- 
portant  in determining  whether  there  had  been misclassification on  the  im- 
age  processing machines, Gohagan said.  “Our  goal  is  to  ultimately  get  the 
kind of  discrimination  necessary  to  distinguish different anamolous  condi- 
tions,’’  he explained.  For example,  blood clots would appear distinctly differ- 
ent from benign tumors,  and a marked difference would  be evident between 
benign and malignant tumors. 
Vannier  concluded  that,  as  a  result of  the  collaboration,  an  improvement 
should  evolve  in  the  way  NMR  images  are  acquired.  “ I   think  it  w i l l   have 
significant influence on what we do in  the future,”  he said.  (NASA Activities, 
Nov 8 5 ,  7) 

December 5: NASA announced that a NASA scientist and a Stanford Univer- 
sity engineer developed the bone stiffness analyzer, an  instrument that might 
aid  in  treating  bone  fractures  and  bone-weaking  diseases  including  os- 
teoporosis,  which afflicted millions of  the  elderly. The two originally devel- 
oped  the  instrument,  which  measured  bone  mass  and  stiffness,  to  help 
scientists combat bone  loss That  might occur  during  long-term spaceflights, 
particularly on  manned space  stations or  extended  space  journeys  such  as 
trips to Mars. 
The  instrument  was  based  on  a  theory,  initially  demonstrated  by  Dr. 
Donald  Young,  a  physiologist  at  NASA’s  Ames  Research  Center,  that  bone 
behaved as  a structural beam and that welldeveloped  concepts for testing the 
stiffness and displacement properties of structural beams could be applied to 
measuring the  same  properties  in  arm  and  leg  bones.  Dr.  Charles  Steele, 
professor of  mechanical  engineering at  Stanford  University,  adapted  the  in- 
strument for  clinical application. 
The analyzer gauged  the  bone’s  resistance to  a small amount of  pressure 
applied  to  the  forearm  or  leg  bone,  while  the  subject’s  arm  or  leg  was 
positioned  so  the  ends were  immobile.  The  instrument’s  probe,  an  electro- 
magnetic “shaker”  or  iron core wrapped with wire,  was  placed at  mid bone 
and current was  run through  it,  causing the bone to vibrate. A microproces- 
sor  then  measured  the  bone’s  displacement  using  algorithms  stored  in  its 
memory, deducing the bone’s  stiffness and effective mass. 
Since  the  analyzer  responded quickly-a 
test  took  less  than  one  minute 
and d id  not damage the bone or tissue-the  analyzer might have wide appli- 
cations for  screening diseases such  as  osteoporosis,  which weakened bones 
but  was  usually  diagnosed  only  after  a  fracture  occurred  when  the  disease 
was  well  advanced.  Although  the  bone analyzer could not  be  used  on  the 
spine  where  osteoporosis  often  first  appeared,  i t  could  detect  the  disease 
long before X-rays,  which d id  not show evidence of change until after at  least 
20%  bone  loss.  Steele  was  planning to adapt the device  for  use  on  fingers, 
which also showed early evidence of  the  bone disease.

Since  the  analyzer  could also  monitor  a bone’s  strength as  i t  healed,  the 
device might also aid in  the treatment of fractures. The analyzer’s quantitative 
measure of  bone  strength  could  replace  the  inference and  guesswork  that 
usually was the basis for a decision on removing a cast from a fractured bone. 
After  three  years  of  clinical  testing  on  more  than  300  subjects,  Steele 
believed the device was  at a useful  level of  precision. To  find  normal values 
for  bone stiffness, Young and Steele tested participants in  the Stanford Invita- 
tional  Rugby  Tournament  in  1984.  In the  coming  year,  they  would  conduct 
more tests  on  healthy subjects and a data search  to find  normal “loads,”  the 
amount of stresses  and strains needed to maintain healthy bones. 
After further tests,  Young and Steele planned to use the instrument to create 
an  exercise  program  for  maintaining  bone  strength  during  the  weightless 
environment  associated  with  extended  spaceflight  missions  when  bones 
tended to atrophy. 
Young hoped to develop a program efficient enough to place the necessary 
stresses on bones through short periods of daily exercise. “It would  be great i f  
i t  could be done in  an hour a day,”  Young commented. He believed a trampo- 
line-like device,  with  restraints to  hold the  body,  might be effective. Eventu- 
ally,  the analyzer  itself might go  into space  with astronauts, who could test 
their own  bone strength,  perhaps determining when they needed to return to 
earth.  (NASA  Release 85,  163) 

December 23:  In order to  improve communications among Indonesia’s  East- 
ern  Island  University’s  member  campuses,  which  were  spread  over  1,600 
miles  of  ocean,  NASA’s  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC)  recently  supervised 
installation of  a  solar  power  system  for  a  teleconferencing center  and earth 
station  in the village of Wawotobi.  The earth station provided the communi- 
cations link among Wawotobi,  Djakarta, and an earth communications satel- 
lite  system  and  helped  make  the  member  campuses’  scarce  professors, 
research findings,  and  library resources more widely available to the  rapidly 
increasing number of students throughout the  region. 
The teleconferencing center, a classroom large enough for  50 people,  was 
equipped  with  a  speaker  system,  microphones,  a  telecopier,  an  electronic 
blackboard, and a computer graphics display. The system was  interactive and 
could connect with 11  main campus locations of the Eastern Island University 
Association and a conference room  in the offices of  the  Director General of 
Higher  Education in Djakarta. 
Purpose  of  the  teleconferencing  system  was  to  demonstrate  the  use  of 
satellite communication  in  developing countries, and the solar power system 
showed  the feasibility and  practicality of  solar  (photovoltaic) power systems 
for small earth stations  in remote areas. 
Although diesel electric generators generally powered earth stations in  the 
absence of conventional power lines,  the high cost of diesel fuel and the high 
operation,  security,  and maintenance costs for diesel generators made use of 

2 1  1 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

a  photovoltaic  system  attractive.  The  total  photovoltaic  array  capacity  to 
power  the  earth  station  a t  Wawotobi was  1.5  kilowatts,  and  LeRC  expected 
the  battery  used  in  conjunction  w i th   the  array  to  last  about  10  years.  The 
photovoltaic array  had a life expectancy of more than  20 years. 
The existing satellite system provided national communications services by 
radio,  telephone,  and telegraph to the 5000 inhabited  islands. 
Hughes Aircraft Co.  was  prime  contractor  for  the  photovoltaic power sys- 
tem,  and  their  subcontractor  in  Indonesia was  P.  T.  Elektrindo  Nusantara. 
LeRC and Hughes would provide operations support for repair, maintenance, 
and  spare  parts through June 1986, when  NASA  would  turn  over  complete 
responsibility for the system to PERUMTAL, the  Indonesian national telecom- 
munications authority. 
The project  completed  the  renewable energy  systems  programs managed 
by  LeRC for the  Department of  Energy and the  U.S.  Agency  for  International 
Development. Since  1976 LeRC  had been  responsible for  the  installation of 
71 photovoltaic power systems  in 27 countries and the  United States.  These 
systems  provided  power  for  entire villages for  water  pumps,  grain  grinders, 
lights,  vaccine  refrigerators,  schools,  highway  signs,  forest  lookout  towers, 
insect traps,  rural dispensaries,  and  the Wawotobi  teleconferencing center/ 
earth station.  (NASA  Release 85-176)

February  17:  L i   Xue,  vice  minister of  the  Peoples  Republic  of  China  (PRC) 
astronautics  industry,  indicated  in   London  recently  that  the  PRC  wanted  to 
compete with  the  U.S.  and West  European countries  for  rocket  launches of 
other countries’ satellites,  FBIS,  Shanghai  City Service in  Mandarin reported. 
He said  the  PRC  had not decided to  launch charges  or  how to market the 
service,  but i t  was  ready to talk to western countries needing launch services. 
(FBIS,  Shanghai City Service in Mandarin,  Feb  17/85) 

May 30:  The Peoples Republic of China (PRC) State Council  decided to  use 
an  international communications satellite over  the  Indian Ocean to transmit 
TV  programs to  people  in  outlying areas,  FBIS  Beijing  XINHUA  Domestic 
Service in  Chinese reported. Although satellite transmission of TV  programs 
covered areas  where  62%  of  the  population  lived,  reception  in some areas 
was  poor. Therefore,  the  State  Council  decided  to  create a  special  fund  to 
present 50 ground stations to outlying areas  and over  the  next  two  to  three 
years  to expand this ground-station network. 
In addition  to TV programs, the satellite would  transmit newspaper facsim- 
ile,  educational  programs,  medical  consultations,  weather  information,  and 
computer  linkages. (Beijing XINHUA  Domestic Service in Chinese, May 301

June 6 Scientists  from  China’s Ministry of Astronautics  announced the  pre- 
vious week plans to improve the design of their existing rockets so they could 
launch heavier satellites into geostationary orbits,  thus challenging the west- 
ern nations’ domination of commercial exploitation of space,  the New Scien- 
tist  reported. 
China  had a  rocket that  could  put  750-kg communications satellites  into 
geostationary orbit,  which  they  used  the  previous year  to  launch their  first 
such  satellite.  Jean Vandenkerckhove  of  the  European Space  Agency  (ESA) 
said  the  rocket  made  ”Chinese  launch  capability  equivalent  to  Europe’s 
Ariane 3  rocket.” 
China’s  rocket,  the  Long  March  3,  had  two  liquid-fuel  stages  and  one 
cryogenic stage  fuelled  by  liquid hydrogen and oxygen.  Chinese engineers 
said  they  planned to add extra boosters to allow  them  to  put  heavier  loads, 
possibly  two  satellites,  into  space.  The  engineers  also  spoke  of  plans  to 
develop  a  cryogenic  upper  stage  for  the  rocket  that  could  launch  2.5-ton 
satellites 35,000  km high  into geostationary orbit.  That would  give China a 
capability  close to that of Ariane 4,  Europe’s  newest  rocket. However, Wu Ke 
Li,  in  charge of Chinese interest at the Paris Air Show where China for the first 
time had an  exhibit, would not confirm  or deny the plans.

Western engineers were impressed by China’s  existing ability because Long 
March  3  placed  their  satellite  into correct  orbit  without  flight  tests,  since 
China could not afford  such  tests.  Instead,  the  Chinese  relied on  elaborate 
space simulators  for checking satellites and  launch components. 
Vandenkerckhove  said  China’s  launch  facilities  were  at  a  disadvantage 
compared w i th  Ariane because the compartment for satellites on Long March 
3  was  smaller  than  on Ariane  3,  measuring 2.3  m  rather than  2.9  m.  How- 
ever,  Yi  Zluo Hyang,  one of  the  Long March 3  designers,  said,  “Our  launch 
costs  w i l l   be  lower  than  any  other  service,  partly  because we  have  lower 
labor  costs,  but  also  because we  w i l l   be  supported  by  the  government.” 
During  the  past  year,  China  had  signed  cooperative  agreements  in   space 
science and technology with the U.S.,  W.  Germany,  France,  and Britian; and 
they  were  pursuing an  interest  in  remote-sensing satellites.  (New Scientist, 
June 6 /85 ,  4)  

l u l y 2 9  Peoples Republic of China President L i  Xiannian today made a three- 
hour  visit  to  the  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory,  the  JPL   Universe  reported.  JPL  
Director  Dr.  Lew   Allen  welcomed  him,  then  said,  “We  are  aware  of  the 
ongoing discussions between our governments regarding future space c o o p  
eration  .  . . We  l o o k  forward to cooperative scientific investigations.” 
Xiannian  then viewed JPL‘s  newly  revised multi-media presentation,  “Wel- 
come  to Outer  Space,”  which  had  been  translated  into Chinese.  After  the 
show,  Allen presented the president with a color photograph of Saturn and i t s  
moons;  Dr.  Taylor  Wang-the 
first  Chinese-American  in  space-gave  him a 
photographic collage showing Wang  in space during his May Space  Shuttle 
flight and his drop dynamics module equipment. 
Xiannian completed his visit with a tour of the Spacecraft Assembly Facility 
where he heard about the Galileo mission and saw  a model of the spacecraft 
as  well  as  actual pieces of  its hardware. UPL  Universe,  July 85,  1 )  

August 5: Weather satellite engineers from  the Shanghai  Institute of  Satellite 
Engineering in  the Peoples Republic of China planned to visit the U .S .  to seek 
technological  help  to  complete  within  the  next  few  years  assembly  and 
launch of China‘s  first  polar orbit weather  satellite,  Aviation  Week  reported. 
The institute was  building a primary and backup spacecraft for China’s first 
weather  satellite mission  and  had  started  preliminary  design  of  a  Chinese 
geosynchronous  orbit  weather  spacecraft  planned  for  launch  in   the  early 
1990s. 
The  Shanghai  Institute of  Technical  Physics  was  working  on  the  imaging 
system  the  weather  satellites would  use  to  take  cloud  photos  and  collect 
other data comparable to that from the  U . S .  Tiros weather  satellite series. 
Ground  test  data  from  the  Chinese-designed  tape  recorder  system  and 
elements  of  the  gyro  system  for  the  new  polar  orbit  weather  spacecraft,

however,  had  not achieved a high enough  reliability  standard. The weather 
satellite manager planned to visit the U.S.  in  late 1985 or early  1986 to try to 
procure a  U.5-built  tape  recorder  that  could  fly  in  the  satellite  in  tandem 
w i th  a Chinese-built  recorder to  improve reliability of the spacecraft. 
A  U.S.  space team visiting the satellite engineering  institute said the satel- 
lite was  relatively large,  about 4 feet tall and 4.5  feet wide. With solar arrays 
deployed,  total spacecraft span  was  about 30 feet. 
The spacecraft would weigh  1,500  Ib. at  launch and be in  a 500-mile-high 
orbit  at  99O  orbital  inclination.  The  Chinese State  Bureau of  Meteorology, 
Beijing,  supplied performance specifications and funding for  satellite. 
The Chinese weather  spacecraft,  like  U.S. weather  satellites,  would  trans- 
m i t  data  continuously. Any  nation with  the  receivers used  for  U.S.  weather 
data could pick up the Chinese data as  well.  (AvWk, Aug 5/85,  79) 

October 26:  Peoples  Republic  of  China  astronautics  minister  Li  Xue  said 
China  would  put  their  Long March  2  and  3  rockets  on  the  international 
market to  provide satellite  launching services  for  local and  foreign  clients, 
FBIS Beijing XINHUA  Hong Kong Service in Chinese reported. The decision 
resulted from  the October  21   launch by  a  Long March 2  rocket  of  an  earth 
surveying satellite and an  April  8,  1984 launch by  a Long March 3  rocket of 
China’s  first experimental  telecommunications  satellite. 
L i  Xue  said  the  recent  Long March 2  launch was  its  seventh  consecutive 
success,  indicating the two-stage liquid-propellant  rocket could  reliably put a 
satellite of about two tons  into a near-earth orbit from the Jiuquan launching 
center,  in  addition  the  Long March  3  launch  from  the  Xichang  launching 
center of  a satellite into geosynchronous orbit  showed China had mastered 
the technology for  placing a satellite  in that orbit. 
He  added that  in  addition  to  launch services from  the two  centers,  China 
could  provide  satellite  orbital  control  and  support  from  the  Xian  control 
center, which had an ocean-based survey vessel component. And he pointed 
out that China could provide preferential prices for foreign customers, would 
train technicians, and had the capability, through the Chinese People’s  Insur- 
ance Co.,  to underwrite satellites that were  launched. 
In conclusion,  he said that,  after  the  Long March 2  and  3  rockets were on 
the  international  market,  they  would  promote  international technical  and 
economic cooperation in  the astronautics field and contribute to the mainte- 
nance of world  peace.  (FBIS,  XINHUA  Kong Hong Service  in  Chinese,  Oct

January  70 :   Four  years  after  cancellation  of  the  National  Oceanic  Satellite 
System  (NOSS),  the  U.S.  Navy  had  begun  to  develop  a  simple,  low-cost 
system  to  monitor ocean conditions  routinely  from  space,  Aerospace Daily 
reported.  Budgeted at  about  a  third  the  estimated  cost  of  NOSS,  the  Navy 
Remote Ocean Sensing System  (NROSS) would  have  nearly the  same  capa- 
b i l i ty  as  NOSS by  1989,  lacking particularly the synthetic aperture radar,  and 
would use many of the ocean observation capabilities NASA’s Seasat program 
demonstrated in  1979. 
The Pentagon had avoided $591.5  m i l l ion  in  FY  1981-88  costs  by  cancel- 
ling NOSS (NASA and NOAA contributions would  have made the total over 
$1  billion). NROSS would  use  a single-satellite system with  no backup;  the 
Navy would resolve later the  issue of replenishment satellites. NROSS would 
also use existing or already planned data-processing equipment at the Navy’s 
Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center and the USAF’s  Defense Meteorologi- 
cal Satellite Program command and control  facilities. 
The Navy expected to spend about $200 m i l l ion  from FY 85 development 
through  a  launch  in   1989,  with  a  NASA  contribution  of  $115  m i l l ion   ($35 
m i l l ion  for the satellite program and $80 m i l l ion  in  research). The Office of 
Management and Budget had vetoed use of  NOAA’s  NOAA-D  spacecraft as 
the  NROSS bus,  so NROSS would  use a Block 5D-2  DMSP spacecraft. The 
Navy had planned an Atlas E launch, but was considering a  refurbished Titan 
I I   ICBM.  Planners  rejected a Space Shuttle  launch as  too expensive. 

lanuary  2 5  The  Mutual  Broadcasting  System  announced  plans  to  use  its 
excess  satellite space  to  deliver  messages  at  rates  low   enough  to  compete 
w i th   the  postal  service,  the  Washingfon Post  reported.  The  company  esti- 
mated that telecommunications business from the new Mutual Satellite Serv- 
ices division would generate 50% of  its revenue by  1990. Mutual’s  principal 
business was  the  Mutual  Radio Network,  which  owned  receiving dishes  at 
more than  700  locations nationwide. 
Mutual planned starting in  mid-1985 to send audio and da ta  transmissions 
over a  little-used portion of the  FM  radio spectrum to specially  tuned  radios 
in  clients’  offices.  Cassette  tape  recorders attached  to  the  radios would  re- 
ceive  voice  communications and  send  them  to  high-speed printers. Called 
MultiComm,  the  system  would  allow  any  organization  to  create  i t s   own  
private network for  sending encrypted audio,  data,  printed material,  or com- 
puter software to a number of locations simultaneously. Senders could relay a 
300- to 450-word message to 500  receivers for  25  to 30 cents per recipient, 
compared to a first-class letter at 22 cents. Other electronic mail systems use 
a  wire  hookup  between  the  company  providing  the  satellite  link  and  the

message recipient; Mutual would provide the first system  in which  the signal 
was  transmitted by  radio.  (WPost, Jan 25/85,  D2) 

Duringjanuary:  A six-man Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) team at  the 
South Pole on   December  14,  1984,  had taken turns  talking to  colleagues  in 
Greenbelt, Maryland, using one of  two unprecedented satellite communica- 
tions  links  the  group  had  installed over  the  previous month,  the  Goddard 
News reported. “The  conversation was  amazingly  audible,”  said Tony  Com- 
beriate,  a  GSFC  communications  expert  and  member  of  the  South  Pole 
satellite data-link project team. ”The  folks at Goddard sounded like they were 
just a few  feet away.“ 
Although  voice  communications  capabilities from  the  South  Pole  using 
Ham  radio had existed for  some  time,  the  systems were weather dependent 
and  usually very  noisy.  The  GSFC  group  used  the  17-year-old Applications 
Technology  Satellite  (ATS-3)  to  establish  the  two-way  voice  link.  The  key 
breakthrough was  installation of the scientific data  link, which enabled daily 
transmittal of  information  from the  Pole, across Antarctica,  and to the  U .S .  
Before system  installation,  scientific data from  the  pole was  stored during 
the  region’s  winter  months  and  shipped  out  by  aircraft  from  November 
through  February.  The  new  system  permitted  transmission  of  high-quality 
scientific  data  by  using  three  existing  polar  orbiting  satellites  (a  4th  was 
scheduled  soon).  Each  satellite  passed  the  pole  about  14  times  daily  and 
relayed data to McMurdo Sound,  which retransmitted i t  to a geosynchronous 
satellite,  which  in  turn  transmitted  it to the  US. Since the  Pole signals were 
too  far  below the  horizon to  be acquired  by  normal communications satel- 
lites,  the relay route was  necessary.  Researchers had previously considered a 
communications  link from the South Pole,  but decided  i t  was  too costly and 
impractical,  perhaps taking several  years  and costing an  estimated $35  mil- 
lion. The GSFC approach had cost about $250,000  and taken  nine months, 
because i t  used existing satellites,  excess  equipment,  and  had  support from 
several organizations. 
Scientists  could  receive  daily  transmission  of  re l iab le   data  on  global 
weather  patterns,  the  magnetospheric  cusp,  upper  atmosphere,  and  glacio- 
logical and seismic studies to name a  few.  The  link also could evolve  into a 
data  collection  network  for  many  of  the  unmanned observatories (ground- 
based  satellites) scattered throughout Antarctica.  (Goddard News, Jan 85,  6 )  

March  7:  NASA  announced  plans  to  deploy  for  the  first  time  two  small 
experimental satellites  from Get Away  Special  (GAS) containers mounted in 
the  cargo  bay  of  the  Space  Shuttle orbiter  Challenger during  the  STS  51-B 
mission scheduled for  iaunch  in  late April.  Under the GAS  program,  NASA 
would  deploy  for  $10,000  each  the  Global  Low  Orbiting Message  Relay 
Satellite  (GLOMR) and  the  Northern  Utah  Satellite  (NUSAT)  in   hopes  of 
establishing  an  inexpensive way  to  deploy  small  satellites  during  routine 
Space Shuttle operations. 

218  

Sa te l l i tes  

Clarke  Prouty,  technical  liaison officer  for  the  GAS  program  at  Goddard 
Space Flight Center (GSFC), said the GAS containers had been upgraded with 
ejection systems for the 51-B  mission and that GSFC had developed a motor- 
ized door (full diameter motorized door assembly) for  the can similar to the 
one first flown on the seventh Space Shuttle mission, which would  allow the 
GAS  payload  to  be  exposed  to  space.  The  door  assembly  permitted  GAS 
container  insulation before  and  after  satellite  deployment  and  provided  a 
means for keeping the satellite in  the container  in case of malfunction. GSFC 
had also adapted the  spacecraft separation system  used  in the  Delta  rocket 
program for  the GAS  ejection  systems. 
The GLOMR  satellite,  designed  and  built by  Defense Systems  Inc. was  a 
data  relay,  communications spacecraft that  was  expected to  remain  in  orbit 
for  about  a  year.  The  NUSAT,  designed,  built,  and  tested  by  Weber  State 
College, Ogden,  Utah,  in  coordination with the Federal Aviation Administra- 
tion,  was  an  air  traffic  control  radar  system  calibrator that  would  measure 
antenna patterns for  ground-based radars operating in  the  U.S.  and member 
countries of the  International Civil Aviation Organization. 
NASA  would  first  launch  the  NUSAT,  then  the  GLOMR,  at  the  end  of 
Spacelab 3 science activities on the sixth day of the sevenday 51-8  mission. 
Independent user  ground stations would  operate the  satellites following de- 
ployment. 
The  GAS  program  was  available  to  anyone  wishing  to  fly  a  small  (for 
containment in 2%-  by  5- f t  area) scientific research and development experi- 
ment. The Space  Shuttle had flown 29 GAS  containers,  including those for 
materials  processing,  life  sciences,  biology,  seed  and  crystal  growth,  and 
cosmic radiation. (NASA  Release 85-35)  

March  25:  The  Arab  League’s  Arabsat  7  telecommunications  satellite, 
launched  February 8  by  an  Ariane  3  from  Kourou,  French Guiana,  experi- 
enced  control  problems  during  initial  in-orbit  checkout,  but  was  reported 
stabilized  with  all  systems  functioning  normally,  Aviation  Week  reported. 
Anomalies  in the  spacecraft’s  gyro  package caused  the  problems,  detected 
March  16  by  operators  at  Arabsat‘s  Dihrab,  Saudi  Arabia,  ground  station 
when  the  satellite  was  a t   its  final  on-station  location  at  19O  E  longitude. 
Investigators were attempting to pinpoint the problem. 
An electrostatic discharge may have caused one of the gyro package anom- 
alies.  Although  the  gyros  provided  pitch,  roll,  and  yaw  information,  “we 
never  lost control  of  the  satellite:  said Michel  Duigot, Aerospatiale’s  Space 
and  Ballistic  Systems  Division  communications  satellite  system  manager. 
“There  is  redundancy in the satellite because we  have two  packages of three 
gyros each,”  he pointed out. 
The  satellite  experienced  solar  array  deployment  difficulties  soon  after 
launch, but the arrays eventually extended successfully. Program officials said 
the two problems were  unrelated. 

219 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

The solar array deployment problems had resulted in  minor modifications 
to the  solar panels on the  No.  2  Arabsat,  originally scheduled for  launch by 
NASA from  KSC  in  May,  but rescheduled for June. 
The  22-member  Arab  Satellite Communications Organization would  use 
the  Ardbsat  I  for  national and  regional communications and TV  broadcast 
requirements. The schedule called for  an  operational satellite by  the end of 
April,  and program officials believed this might still be possible. (AvWk, Mar 
25.85,  22) 

March  2 9  NASA  announced  that  its  first  Applications  Technology Satellite 
(ATS-I), after more than  18  years of  service,  failed to  respond to commands 
to  correct  i t s  eastward  drift  from  geostationary position over  the  Gilbert  Is- 
lands in  the western Pacific. Robert Wales,  ATS  project operations director at 
Coddard Space  Flight Center  (CFSC), said that  the ground control  station  in  
Hawaii could no longer keep ATS-I  at  its present location and i t  would likely 
drift out of  useful orbital  position during the  next s ix   months. 
ATS-I,  launched  in   December  1966 with  an  expected  lifespan of  three 
years,  most recently had provided a voice and data communications capabil- 
ity  to  several  information  networks  in   the  Pacific  basin.  The  pan  Pacific 
education  and  communications  experiments  by  satellite  (PEACESAT)  pro- 
gram,  the major user of ATS-7,  would dissolve w i th  the  loss of the  satellite. 
Program participants had transmitted educational,  health,  research,  technol- 
ogy,  and  community  services  through  ATS-I 
to  23  autonomous  terminals 
located  in  Hawaii, Cook  Islands, the Mariana and Caroline  Islands, Western 
and American  Samoa,  the  Marshall  Islands, Melanesia,  New Zealand,  and 
Australia. 
Some of ATS-7’s  notable achievements were the first  transmission  in  1967 
of  fullearth,  cloud cover  pictures from  geosynchronous orbit;  first  transmis- 
sion  in  1967 of  real-time TV  pictures (Apollo 4  splashdown);  two-way com- 
munication  tests  with  commercial airliners  to determine aircraft orientation 
effects on  satellite communications,  a cooperative venture with  the  Federal 
Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  and  the  airlines  in  1967  and  1968;  link-up 
between U.S.  and USSR  scientists during an atmospheric,  sea,  and ice condi- 
tion  experiment  in   the  Bering  Sea  in  1971;  transmission  of  electrocardio- 
graphs  from  Hawaii  to  New  Zealand  and  from  Alaska  to  the  University  of 
Washington;  and  presentation  of  medical  conferences over  the  PEACESAT 
network. 
The medical world had praised the Alaskan ”doctor  call”  service provided 
by ATS-I  as  the first  innovative approach to rural medicine  in the US .  In the 
program,  Public Health Service physicians could communicate daily through 
ATS-1  with  trained  health aides  in the  remote Alaskan bush country. 
Loss  of  ATS-1  would  leave  one  other  comparable  satellite,  ATS-3, 
launched  in   November  1967,  in  operation.  Positioned  in   geosynchronous 
orbit over the Pacific Ocean south of Mexico, ATS-3  covered the U.S.,  most of

March  29:  Arnold  Engineering  Development  Center  (AEDC) qualification 
tests  had shown the Star  30C apogee kick motor, designed to place satellites 
in  orbits  around  the  earth  and  manufactured by  Morton-Thiokol  Inc.,  was 
ready  for  production,  the Air  Force  Systems  Command (AFSC) Newsreview 
reported. 
Sverdrup Technology  Inc.,  operating contractor of AEDC‘s  propulsion  test 
facilities,  had conducted qualification checks  in one of AEDC’s  high-altitude 
rocket development  test  cells at  a simulated altitude of  about  100,000  feet. 
Test  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  component  structural  integrity and  to 
determine ballistic performance. Sverdrup temperature conditioned  the mo- 
tors and then  test  fired them while they  spun about their axial  centerline to 
simulate spin stabilization during firing in space. 
The Star  30C,  designed to be carried by the Space Shuttle, was  the propul- 
sion system for the RCA  G-STAR  satellite. Once i n  space,  i t  would  ignite and 
carry the satellite to  i t s  designated orbit.  (AFSC Newsreview, Mar 29/85,  6) 

April  4 :  President Reagan announced that March 31  through  April  6,  1985, 
would be National Weather Satellite Week  in  a proclamation that said,  “The 
United States‘  weather satellites have tracked the earth’s  weather  since April 
1,  1960, and have brought unique  benefits to the American  people and the 
world. 
“Weather  satellites have proven exceptionally valuable in  detecting, moni- 
toring,  and  giving  early  warning  of  hurricanes,  severe  storms,  flash  floods, 
arid other  life-threatening natural hazards,  on a  local,  national,  and  interna- 
tional basis. 
“The  international weather  satellite search-and-rescue program  has  saved 
over  three hundred lives since  1982. The achievements of the scientific and 
aerospace  communities  in   developing  weather  satellites  have  contributed 
significantly to the  United States‘  leadership in  satellite technology,  interna- 
tional  cooperation  in   space,  and  an  integrated  global  weather  forecasting 
system  .  .  .” 
The proclamation concluded that NASA  “has  been the world  leader  in the 
development  of  experimental and  prototypical  weather  and  environmental 
satellites. The  National  Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration  has  dem- 
onstrated outstanding leadership in  the management of  operational weather 
and  environmental  satellite  systems  and  programs.”  (Admin.  of  Ronald

proper orbit [see Apr.  181,  aerospace  engineers said astronauts might be able 
to   salvage  the  satellite,  the  Washington  Times  reported.  Payload  specialists 
originally believed  it would  be too dangerous to  return the  satellite to earth 
on the Space Shuttle because of the nearly s i x   tons  of  highly  volatile rocket 
fuel  i t  carried. Jerome Hammack,  a  spacecraft safety operations expert,  said 
deactivating the  satellite’s  electronic  systems  would  significantly reduce the 
chance of stray sparks igniting the fuel, most of which would turn to gas  upon 
descent.  To  ensure  that  there  was  no  power  going  to  any  of  the  electrical 
circuits,  a spacewalking astronaut would  have  to cut  power circuits running 
to the satellite’s batteries and solar power cells. However,  NASA would mount 
a rescue attempt only  i f   Hughes Communications  Inc.,  Leasat  3’s  manufac- 
turer,  and  Hughes’  insurance underwriters agreed  to  a  salvage  contract.  ( W

May 5:  In a commencement address  today at the George Washington Univer- 
sity School of  Public and  International Affairs,  Charles Wick,  director of the 
U.S.  Information Agency,  said that the ”very  survival”  of the U.S.  may depend 
on the extent to which its citizens use and master the tools of mass communi- 
cations, the  NY  Times  reported. 
“Through  the explosion of  global satellite communications,  a  technologi- 
cal  ’genie’  has  been unleashed which w i l l  change  forever  the way  that  gov- 
ernments communicate ideas and information abroad,”  he said.  However,  he 
noted that “.  .  .  not a l l  countries believe in freedom of  ideas. Not all accept 
the  Western  tradition  that  free  expression  i s   a  basic  human  right.  These 
opposing  forces  are  attempting  to  persuade  other  countries,  particularly 
those  in the  third world,  that  the  state,  not  the  people,  must decide which 
ideas circulate in  their magazines and newspapers  and on  the TV  and  radio 
stations  .  .  . 
“Since  the  1970s,  the Soviet Union has  introduced resolutions at  Unesco, 
in  the guise of a ’New World  Information Order;  to impose this control of the 
mass media on a l l   nations of  the world  .  .  . 
“Unless  you  and  I do  a better job  of explaining to the world  how  the free 
f low  of information can benefit mankind, other nations w i l l  not be persuaded 
to  open  their  borders to  the  ideas and opinions  of  others.  This  could  have 
damaging, even fa ta l  consequences for a dangerous world,  in  which coopera- 
tion-and  survival-depend so heavily on mutual understanding:’  Wick con- 
cluded.  (NYT, May  7/85,  B8) 

May  7:  The  European  Space  Agency  (ESA)  and  the  Department  of  Com- 
merce’s  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  an- 
nounced that the  U.S. agreed to  lend ESA  its GOES-4  standby geostationary 
weather  satellite  as  a temporary  substitute  for  ESA’s  Meteosat-7  spacecraft. 
Meteosat-7,  launched in 1977 with a planned 3-year  lifetime,  had run out of

Sa te l l i tes  

station-keeping fuel  and would drift out of view  of  ESA's  ground-station net- 
work  in July. 
NOAA would  move GOES-4,  which  had been at  140° W  longitude  over 
the  Pacific Ocean,  westward  by  4O a day  to bring it by mid-June to  its  new 
position  at  loo W  longitude  above  the Atlantic Ocean. Because  ESA  group 
equipment was  not compatible with  the  GOES-4  command system,  NOAA 
would  operate  the  satellite  for  ESA  from  its  satellite  guidance  facilities  at 
Suitland,  Maryland,  and  Wallops  Station,  Virginia.  ESA's  Meteosat  ground 
facilities i n  Darmstadt would receive data from  the spacecraft. 
When  NOAA's  Atlantic-area GOES-East Satellite lost  its  imaging capability 
in  1984, ESA's  Meteosat-2  provided U . S .  weather watchers with weather data, 
including information  on  the  eastern Atlantic  hurricane breeding grounds.

May  24: NASA  announced  i t  was  negotiating an  agreement  with  Hughes 
Communications, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Co.) to 
develop jointly  plans  for  a Space  Shuttle mission to  attempt  salvage  of  the 
Hughes  Leasat  3  satellite then  i n  orbit  [see  Space  Transportation  System/ 
Missions,  Apr.  17. 

As  a  result  of  Hughes's  negotiations  with  New  York-  and  London-based 
underwriters insuring Leasat 3,  Lloyd's and other European underwriters had 
agreed to proceed with the attempted salvage.  Hughes was  continuing nego- 
tiations w i th  U.S.  underwriters. 
Although  the  joint  salvage  effort  would  include  activities  never  before 
attempted,  i t  was  based  in  large part on experience gained by  NASA during 
its Apr i l   1984 repair of the Solar  Maximum Mission satellite and  its  retrieval 
November 1984 of  the Palapa 8-2  and Westar  VI satellites. 
Pending an  independent review of safety considerations by  the Aerospace 
Safety  Advisory  Panel,  the  mission would  occur during Space  Shuttle  flight 
51-L  scheduled for  no earlier  than  August  24.  The  salvage  plan called  for 
modification  to the satellite by  two of the Space Shuttle crew during rendez- 
vous  w i th   i t  to  permit  ground command of  the  satellite.  Ground command 
would  then  perform  the  activation  sequence,  normally  performed  by  an 
automatic timer onboard the satellite. Modification made during the rendez- 
vous  would  bypass  a l l   hardware  likely  to  have  caused  the  Leasat  3 failure. 
(Although Hughes had identified satellite activation components and circuits 
as  the cause of the failure,  the company  had not determined, due to  limited 
flight  data,  a specific cause of the failure.) 
In its dormant state,  the satellite was experiencing temperatures well  below 
the  design  and  test  limits  of  the  liquid-  and  sold-fuel  propellant  systems, 
electronic  units,  batteries,  and  all  other  components. These  factors,  com- 
bined w i th   the  complexity  of  the  modifications  by  the  Space  Shuttle  crew, 
limited the chances of success.

Hughes Communications,  Inc. would contract with  NASA for the costs,  at 
that  time  under  assessment,  for  preparation and  execution  of  the  mission.

May 2 4  NASA  had  brought  under  control  a  $SO-mil!ion  weather  satellite, 
NOM-8,  that  had  tumbled  helplessly  in  space  for  nearly  a year  due  to  a 
malfunctioning  oscillator,  the  Washington Times reported. 
The defective oscillator gave out during April, allowing NASA and National 
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  scientists  to  activate  a 
backup oscillator and reprogram the satellite via remote control. NOAA was 
checking and calibrating the spacecraft's  instruments before putting i t  July 8 
into service to transmit daily weather photos and information. ( W  Times,  May 
24/85,  3A;  W Post, May 24,  85,  A81 

May 2 9  M.  Peter McPherson, head of the Agency for  International Develop 
ment (AID), said a  U.S.-financed and -built satellite weather-alert system may 
have  given  Bangladesh up to  24  hours notice of  a devastating cyclone that 
killed  approximately  10,000  people,  the  Washington Times  reported.  The 
advance notice may  have saved  "a  substantial number of  lives:'  along coastal 
areas of  the Bay of  Bengal,  McPherson said. 
McPherson pointed out that the satellite system  in  Bangladesh, developed 
i n   phases  since  1978  by  NASA,  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric 
Administration,  and  AID  warned  of  the  storm.  He said  Bangladesh techni- 
cians had tracked the cyclone for four days and had the capability of predict- 
ing  landfall and w ind  speed within  18  to 24 hr.  ( W  Times, May 29/85,  5A) 

May 30:  NASA announced i t  had selected Ford Aerospace and Communica- 
tions  Corp.,  Western  Development  Laboratories,  to  negotiate  a  cost-plus- 
award-fee  contract  for  the  next  generation  of  Geostationary  Operational 
Environmental Satellites (GOES) that would  include three spacecraft (GOES- 
I, J,  and K) and a two spacecraft option (GOES4 and M). The contract had a 
proposed  cost  of  $221  m i l l ion   and  would  provide  for  a  series  of  GOES 
satellite  systems,  each with  a  five-year  design  life,  that  would  contribute  to 
continuation  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration's 
(NOAA) GOFS program in the  1990 to 2000 era.  NASA had scheduled a late 
1989 launch for  the  first GOES satellite  in this new series. 
The contract statement of work  covered the  satellite  bus;  imaging,  sound- 
ing,  and  spaceenvironment  monitor  instruments; and  flight-support  e q u i p  
ment  and  services  to  accomplish  deployment  of  the  spacecraft  into 
geosynchronous  orbit  from  the  Space  Shuttle.  The  contract  also  included 
operations  ground  equipment  and  support  to  ensure  compatibility  of  the 
spacecraft systems with established ground systems operated by NOAA.

May 30:  NASA  announced  that  NASA,  National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration  (NOAA),  and  RCA  engineers  had  stabilized  the  N O A A - 8  
satellite  after  i t   began  tumbling  out  of  control  when  an  oscillator  in   the 
spacecraft's altitude control system failed.  Engineers were continuing a three  
week  checkout of the spacecraft to ensure that all calibrations were  in  order, 
at which time the satellite would be fully  operaticnal. 
The  satellite  carried  search  and  rescue  (SARSAT)  equipment  that  would 
resume operation  as  part of  an  international program  begun  in  September 
1983  to  use  satellites  to  save  people  in  downed  airplanes  or  on  ships  in  
distress. During the  11  months NOAA-8  malfunctioned,  three USSR and one 
US. satellite were  picking up distress signals  and  relaying them  to  ground 
stations. 
The  reactivated  NOAA-8  would  assume  weather  data  collection  that 
NOAA-6  had  been doing.  NOAA-6  had  no  search  and  rescue  equipment 
and  i t s   infrared  radiometer  for  taking  temperature  measurements was  not 
working.  (NASA Release 85-81 1 

J d y  8: Recently completed agreements between  insurance underwriters a a d  
Hughes  Communications  Services  acknowledged  l o s s   of  the  disabled 
Leasat-3  spacecraft  but  established  a  plan  under  which  Hughes  and  the 
underwriters would share  in  communication  lease revenues i f  a plan to repair 
the  satellite during the  Space Shuttle 51-1  mission was  successfuI,  Aviation 
Week reported. 
Under the agreement with American  and  Europeari underwriters who  in- 
sured  Leasaf-3,  Hughes would  provide  the  funds,  estimated  at  about  $10 
million,  for  the  rescue attempt.  If the  rescue was  successful,  Hughes would 
regain  the  cost  of  the  sa!vage  mission  through  initial  lease  revenues.  The 
agreements  recognized  a  loss of  $85  m i l l ion  for  the  spacecraft and  launch 
costs. 
The  loss   resulted from  the  failure of  the  spacecraft on April  13  to activate 
during an  automatic  deployment sequence after  the  spacecraft was  ejected 
from  the  Space  Shuttle orbiter  Discovery's cargo bay  [see  Space Transporta- 
tion  Systemlhiiissions, Apr.  17. 
H q h e s  and NASA were developing equipment and  ptocedures to mount 
the  rescue attempt.  iohnson  Space Center  had concluded a critical  design 
review  for  rescue hardware such  as  a  worksite,  stowage  assembly,  and  the 
capture,  handling,  grapple,  and spinup bars that would  be used  to  stabiiize, 
restrain, and spin the satellite once modifications aimed at  restoring ground 
control  were  made on  orbit.  The  design  review  also  covered  components 
Hughes was  building,  such as the remote power w i t ,  spur! bypass unit, and a 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

checkout box that would  be used to test electronic components on orbit prior 
to the  rescue attempt. 
Completion of the critical design  review enabled NASA  to obtain  informa- 
tion on the electronic components Hughes was  building and to build rescue 
equipment  for  the  mission,  conduct  vacuum  chamber  testing,  and  begin 
training for the salvage mission. 
NASA  had  already  conducted  initial  neutral  buoyancy  training  in   the 
weightless training environment facility and mass simulation tests  in prepara- 
tion for  the mission.  (AvWk ,  July 8/85,  24) 

July 23:  In its postlaunch report dated July 23,  1986,  NASA announced that it 
had  launched  on  September  9,  1980,  GOES-D  (subsequently  designated 
GO E S 4  from  KSC  by  a  Delta  3914  launch  vehicle.  The  GOES  (Geosta- 
tionary Operational Environmental Satellite) satellites provided near-continu- 
ous  high-quality  day  and  night  observations of  earth  and  its  environment, 
including cloud cover; weather;  proton, electron,  and solar X-ray  fluxes;  and 
magnetic fields. 
During  placement  of  GOES-4  and  its  apogee  boost  motor  (ABM)  into 
transfer orbit,  NASA observed lower than expected temperatures for the A B M  
and decided to f i re   the motor at  second apogee in  lieu of  the nominal  third 
apogee. Performance of  the ABM was  nominal and resulted in  placement of 
the spacecraft in desired drift orbit. GOES-4  arrived September 20 ,  1980, on- 
station at  the 98'  west  longitude checkout position. O n  February 26,  1981, 
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  moved 
GOES-4  to  the  GOES-west  operational  position  a t   135'  west  longitude, 
replacing the  ailing GOES-3  spacecraft.  NASA  modified  the  ABM  thermal 
design  for  follow-on spacecraft  to  avoid  recurrence of  the  low  temperature 
pro b I em. 
O n   May  22,  1981,  NASA  launched  GOES-E  (subsequently  designated 
GOES-5)  from  KSC on the Delta 3914. Spacecraft performance during trans- 
fer  orbit  maneuvers  was  nominal,  and  NASA  fired  the  ABM  on  the  third 
apogee of  the transfer  orbit.  GOES-5  arrived on-station June 5,  1981,  at  the 
predetermined checkout position of 85'  west  longitude. O n  August  5,  1981, 
NOAA  placed GOES4 at  7 5 O  west  longitude where  i t  became the opera- 
tional GOES-east satellite. 
An  additional  mission  objective  for  both  GOES-4  and  5 was  demonstra- 
tion  and  assessment  of  the  temperature  and  moisture  soundings  from  the 
VISSR  Atmospheric  Sounder (VAS); Goddard Space Flight Center  initiated a 
VAS  demonstration project to achieve this objective. In 1981 the VAS  demon- 
stration project conducted a ground truth field experiment that  provided four 
days  of  simultaneous,  highdensity  ground-based observations and  satellite 
data.  This  data  showed VAS  to  be  a  versatile and  valuable  instrument  with 
potential  applications  beyond  the  severe  local  storm  discipline.  Some  of 

2 26  

Sat e l  I ites 

these  additional  areas  included  hurricane  and  tropical  cyclone  research, 
cloud climatology,  and diagnosis of moisture patterns and  upper-air circula- 
tion. As  a result of the VAS  demonstration project, NOAA made provision for 
geosynchronous soundings  a requirement  for  the  next generation of  GOES 
satellites. 
Under a  1973 basic agreement,  NASA had the  responsibility under NOAA 
reimbursable  funding  to  design,  engineer,  procure,  and  launch  polar  and 
geosynchronous weather satellites to  implement the U.S.’s  operational mete- 
orological  satellite program. After on-orbit checkout, NASA  handed over  the 
spacecraft to NOAA for  routine operations. (NASA MOR E-612-80-02

j u l y 2 3 :  Astronauts James van Hoften and Dr. William Fisher said at a Johnson 
Space Center  news  conference that  they would  attempt to  activate the  Syn- 
com satellite deployed  in April  from the Space Shuttle,  the  Washington Post 
reported.  Although  the  satellite was  loaded with  rocket fuel,  the astronauts 
said  they  didn’t  think  their  mission was  any  more dangerous than  the  two 
other  rescue missions by  astronauts  in  the  previous two  years.  Because  the 
satellite was  “armed,”  (in the  position  in  which  i t  was  ready  to  fire  its  en- 
gines),  the  danger  was  great  i f   the  engines  ignited  accidentally  while  the 
astronauts were working. 
However, the astronauts indicated the hardest part of  their upcoming mis- 
sion was  its awkwardness, not the danger.  They  said they would  attempt the 
rescue on the seventh day  of  the August  2 4  Space Shuttle 51-1  mission with 
the orbiter Discovery. Van  Hoften would  stand in  foot  restraints at  the end of 
the Space Shuttle’s 50-foot-long mechanical arm 3 5  feet below the satellite to 
affix a capture bar to the side of the satellite,  then  force the satellite to come 
to a  standstill  from  its once-a-minute spin. 
Fisher,  standing in  temporary foot  restraints fixed to the side of Discovery‘s 
cargo bay,  would put two plugs on either side of the arming switch to prevent 
the satellite from accidentally turning  itself on. 
Then,  standing  on  opposite  sides  of  the  satellite,  the  astronauts  would 
bypass the  satellite’s  electronics  so  that  flight  directors on the ground could 
begin to command i t  from earth. NASA gave the operation a 50-50  chance of 
succeeding.  ( W  Post, July 23/85,  A2)

Ju ly  3 7 :  NASA  announced  that one of  the  satellites  in the  COSPASISARSAT 
system,  an  international program with  the  U.S.,  USSR,  Canada,  and  France 
sening as  major partners,  made possible the  rescue of  a man  146 miles off 
Cape  Henry, Virginia. 
On  April  17 jack  Boye departed Miami to  sa i l   to  New York  Harbor for  the 
dedication  of  a memorial  to Vietnam  veteraw  of Airborne  173,  his wartime

S~OOP’S electrical and electronic equipment and engine to fail and the boat to 
capsize. When  the boat  rolled over  and  started f i i l ing  with water,  Boye acti- 
vated an emergency position-indicating  radiq beacon that trailed at the stern 
of  the boat. 
An orbiting Soviet sea  and rescue satellite,  one of three USSR and two U.S. 
satellites  eqilipped with  sea  and  rescue  equipment  in  the  COSPASISARSAT 
satellite system,  first  received the distress signal and beamed i t  to the Rescue 
and  Command Center  at  Scott Air  Force  Base,  Illinois,  who  alerted  rescue 
forces. After an electronic search for the distress signal,  a Coast Guard aircraft 
located the  sloop and  requested assistance f r a n  a naval ship  in  the vicinity. 
The USS  Detroit  sent  a whaleboat with the ship’s  doctor to the sloop. 
To  date,  the COSPASISARSAT system had been instrumental in  the rescue of 
more than 400 people. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-

Vandenberg Air  Force Base. 
4 s  a result of  a  1962 NGSNDepartment of  Defense (DOLI) agreement for 
joint  use  of the Scout  launch vehicle,  the  U.S. Navy asked  NASA  to  provide

and mission support  requirements as  needed. 
The Navy and other vessels  used the Transit program,  an  operational  navi- 
gation system,  for worldwide ocean navigation. Prior to the August  1  launch 
there were s ix   operating satellites  in  the system.  NASA maintained two Scout 
vehicles on  standby  status to  launch replacement satellites to f i l l  any  opera- 
tional gaps occurring  in  the system.

Augus t   9 A  conflict  between  industrial and  developing countries  over  the 
use  of  space  would  likely  be  the  dominant  issue  at  the  five-week  World 
Administrative Radio Conference that  would  open August  9  in Geneva,  the 
NY  Times reported. The  meeting was  intended  to  negotiate a plan  to  avert 
traffic jams  in the space  used by orbiting communications satellites. 
The conflict existed as  a result of the desire of  industrial countries  to gain 
an advantage from  their technical  lead with a flexible approach to assigning 
orbital  slots  and  the  desire of  some  developing countries  to  reserve  orbital 
slots years  before they might be used. 
Communications experts around the world  said the  increased use of  low- 
cost  satellites  to  expedite  domestic,  regional,  and  world  communications 
was  leading to a virtual traffic jam  in the satellite belt, 22,300  miles above the 
equator. The radio frequencies that gave the clearest signals also were rapidly 
filling.  The  U.S.  and  INTELSAT used most of  the orbit space and  radio spec- 
trum. 
Reagan Administration  officials said  they  would  offer  a  proposal that  the 
U.S.  refrain  for  10  years  from  using parts  of  the  radio  spectrum  opened  to 
satellite use by a 1979 conference. By staying out of  the expanded spectrum, 
U.S.  officials said,  the  US. would  reassure  lessdeveloped nations that  there 
would be radio room for them when their satellite-launching  plans matured. 
The  U.S.  plan  would  let  a  country  ask  for  radio  frequencies  15  years  in 
advance against the current five years. 
The  U.S.  plan  would  also  establish  a  requirement  that  countries  with  a 
satellite in  operation  made compensatory  payments to  countries  forced  to 
put  satellites  in   less  desirable  orbits  or  forced  to  use  less  desirable  radio 
frequencies. 
The  most  persuasive  aspect  of  the  U.S.  proposal was  the  prospect  that 
between 50 and  100 U.S.  satellites were at some stage of  planning, develop 
ment,  or scheduled for  launch over  the next three years. 
Lessdeveloped countries,  particularly those  in  the  tropical  zone,  wanted 
rigid assignments of radio bands,  including the lower frequencies then domi- 
nated  by the  developed  nations,  because the  bad weather  common  in  the 
tropics d id  not noticeably disturb those frequencies.  (NYT, Aug  7/85,  D1) 

August  25:  NASA  said  that  the  GOES-6  weather  satellite  turned  i t s   eye 
toward space  for  about four  and a half hours today  before NASA  personnel 
reversed  it,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Located  at  a  fixed  point  about 
22,000  miles  above  earth,  the  satellite  transmitted  weather  photos  widely 
used by TV  stations and newspapers across  the nation. 

229  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  repositioned  the  satellite  in  a  reprogramming effort  that  required 
transmission  of  14  groups  of  256  commands  each,  retiming  the  revolving 
satellite so that  its  instruments would  come on when facing the earth. 
Since  August  1984 when  GOES-5  lost  its  ability  to  transmit  photos  be- 
cause  a  light  in  i t  failed,  GOES-6  was  the  lone  fixed-point  satellite making 
transmissions. NASA had scheduled for  launch in  spring 1986 a  replacement 
for  GOES-5. 
If a failure like the one  that  occurred on August  25 were  to  last  longer,  i t  
could  have  a  serious  impact  on  the  National  Oceanographic  and  Atmo- 
spheric  Administration's  (NOAA) ability  to  monitor  severe  storms.  ( W  Post, 
Aug 29/85,  A8) 

August 37 :  During Space Shuttle mission  51-1  astronauts James van  Hoften 
and William  Fisher spent seven  hours and eight minutes,  a new  record for a 
spacewalk,  in  the first stage of  repair of the  Leasat 3 satellite,  the  Washington 
Post  reported.  During  the  walk,  they  retrieved  the  15,000-lb.  satellite,  fas- 
tened  Discovery's  mechanical  arm  onto  it,  disarmed  its  Minuteman  rocket 
motor, and exposed i t s  electronic connections. Later Fisher said he could see 
no  evidence of what caused the satellite to go dead after astronauts deployed 
i t   in April.  "There  i s  no evidence of debris on  anything that would  cause  a 
problem.  It's  clean as  a whistle,"  He said. 
Van Hoften and Fisher were outside the Space Shuttle from about 8:OO  a.m. 
to shortly after  3 : O O  p.m.  EDT,  breaking by one minute the spacewalk record 
set  April  1984  by  van  Hoften  and  George  Nelson when  they  repaired the 
scientific satellite Solar Max. 
Although the astronauts accomplished more than  half of what was  needed 
in  the salvage mission,  they were planning a four-hour spacewalk on Septem- 
ber 1 to finish the job. They would  put a "space  blanket"  over the engine bell 
that served as  the Minuteman motor's  rocket nozzle to trap more of the sun's 
heat to warm  it,  because Leasat-3  had been in the cold of space so long that 
its  rocket  motor  was  too  cold  to  fire  correctly.  Then  the  astronauts would 
install  a  vertical  bar  along  the  20-foot  length  of  the  satellite  to  serve  as  a 
handle for  van  Hoften to spin  the  satellite and  push  i t  away  from  Discovery 
into space. 
It would  then be seven days before the satellite acquired enough power to 
thaw  its  liquid-fuel tanks and almost two months before the solid-fuel rocket 
motor was  warm enough for  ground controllers  to command  it to  ignite. ( W  
Post,  Sept  1/85,  A5) 

September  1 :   Astronauts  James van  Hoften  and  William  Fisher  on  Space 
Shuttle  mission  51-1  today  completed  repair  of  the  Leasat  1 satellite,  the 
Washington Post  reported. Steven  Dorfman, president of  Hughes Communi- 
cations Corp.,  satellite owner,  referred to  the effort as  the  "most  remarkable 
salvage mission"  tried  in space. 

230 

Satellites 

During  the  second  day  of  the  salvage  mission  [see  Satellites,  Aug.  311, 
astronaut John Lounge,  using the Space Shuttle’s mechanical arm,  raised the 
satellite 35  feet  above  the  cargo  bay  and  placed  i t s   center  of  gravity  on  a 
straight  l ine  with  that of  the orbiter  Discovery. Outside,  van  Hoften stepped 
into  foot  restraints  on  the  end  of  the  arm,  and  Lounge  lifted  him  to  the 
satel I i te. 
Reaching up,  van  Hoften  placed gloved  hands on  the  bar  he  had  earlier 
attached  to  the  satellite  and  pushed down  as  hard  as  he could  to  start  the 
satellite spinning.  Three more pushes  sent  the  satellite  spinning evenly  into 
space over the equator near the west  coast of South America where officials 
planned to operate  i t  as  a  Navy radio relay. 
Although  Hughes was  still  concerned  that  very  cold  temperatures might 
have  permanently damaged the satellite,  i t  d id  beam to earth  its first  signals 
since deployment on April  13. The signals  indicated that temperatures in  the 
satellite’s outer shell were normal, suggesting that the inner drum holding the 
two  onboard  rocket  engines  and  more  than  7,500  Ib. of  rocket  fuel  might 
have  survived  the  varying  temperatures of  space  and  be  ready  to  carry  the 
satellite into permanent position 22,300  miles above earth.  (WPost, Sept 2/ 
85,  A3) 

September 16 Hughes Communications Inc., manufacturer and owner of the 
Syncom  4  satellite  launched August  27  from  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery 
during mission 51-1,  today declared it a failure due to a faulty cable between 
the  satellite’s  UHF  radio transmission  system  and  its broadcast antenna,  the 
Washington Post  reported. 
Failure of the $85  m i l l ion  satellite,  known as  Leasat 4 after  its  lease to the 
Navy,  pushed satellite insurance losses to $234 m i l l ion  in a single week and 
to  about  $570  m i l l ion   for  the  past  18  months.  Satellites  insured  for  $84 
m i l l ion  and $65  m i l l ion  were also  lost that week  when Arianespace blew up 
a malfunctioning  Ariane  rocket.  (W  Post, Sept  17/85,  A l l )  

September 23 :  Hughes Communications faced  the  possibility of  a  $10,000 
per day  fine,  up to a total of $5  million,  i f  the Leasat communications system 
was  not  fully  operational  by  November  30,  Aviation  Week  reported.  The 
potential  of  a fine  resulted from  the  failure of  its  Leasat 4 satellite following 
deployment from the Space Shuttle Discovery during mission 51-1,  reducing 
significantly the  likelihood of three  Leasat satellites being operational  by the 
November 30 deadline. 
Hughes could avoid the fee  i f  the  repaired Leasat  3 activated  in  late Octo- 
ber;  otherwise the firm had the option of  launching a ground spare.  Teleme- 
try  data  from  Leasat  3 ,   repaired  during  the  Space  Shuttle  51-1  mission, 
continued to confirm the satellite’s functioning. The liquid propulsion system 
was  intact,  and  the  solid  propellant  perigee kick  motor  temperatures were 
rising toward acceptable levels. However,  the satellite could explode when its 

231  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

main  rocket  fired  late  in  September,  and  Hughes officials gave  i t   no  more 
than a 50-50  chance of  reaching geosynchronous orbit. 
Leasat  7  and 2,  launched in  August and November  1984,  respectively, were 
operating according to  specifications,  and the  Navy was  leasing them. 
Hughes  had  to  provide  the  US. Navy  with  four  operational  satellites  by 
March 31,  1986,  to meet the second contract deadline and could at  that time 
again face  fines for  noncompliance. Company officials estimated December 
as  the earliest date for a Leasat  5 launch. 
Albert Wheelon,  Hughes Aircraft Co.  senior vice president and president of 
Hughes’s  space and communications group, said the  Leasat 4 loss  and other 
recent spacecraft  losses were having an  impact on the  industry. “My  reading 
i s  that generally the whole insurance market for  satellites has just gone belly- 
up,”  he  commented.  “I think  it‘s  going  to  have  a  major  impact  on  startup 
companies.  I think  it‘s  going to be a narrowing,  both on the operator and the 
development  side.”  He   added  that  the  status  of  spacecraft  underwriters 
would  have  less  of  an  impact on companies  like Hughes,  because  i t  could 
provide self-insurance.  (AvWk, Sept 23/85,  21 

September  2 6  NASA  announced  that  its  AST-3  communications satellite, 
located  at  105’  west  longitude,  was  providing  communications  support 
through its control center at Malabar, Florida, to American Red Cross and Pan 
American  World  Health  Organization  rescue  and  relief  efforts  following 
Mexico City‘s  earthquake. 
The voice communications  link with the outside world was  crucial,  since 
the  earthquake  disrupted  all  other  forms  of  communications  in   the  city. 
George Manno, director of media relations for the Red Cross,  said “the  ATS-3 
i s   providing  us  w i th   the  most  critical  communications  link.  Although  ham 
radio operators have been doing a swell job,  they are  serving as  our backup 
communications  system,  while  we  rely  primarily  on  the  ATS  as  our  main 
communications vehicle.” 
Immediately  after  the  earthquake  occurred,  NASA  implemented  the ATS 
emergency  preemption  plan;  within  24  hours ATS-3  was  on the  air,  giving 
priority to  satellite communications traffic  for  the  emergency  rescue opera- 
tions.  (NASA Release 85-133) 

October 3 :  The Syncom  I /  communications satellite  lost one of  its  13  chan- 
nels,  described as  an  important wide-band  channel,  and efforts were  under- 
way  to  reactivate  it,  Defense  Daily  reported.  The  US. Navy  leased  the 
satellite  from  Hughes  Communications  Inc.,  which  was  under  contract  to 
provide four  such  Leasats to the  Navy. 
NASA  in  September 1984 launched Syncom I and  I /  from the Space Shuttle 
and launched in  April from the Space Shuttle Syncom / / I ,  which failed to fire 
in  orbit.  The Space  Shuttle crew  in  July repaired Syncom  / / I ,  with a reboost

attempt scheduled for October. NASA  launched in July from the Space Shut- 
tle Syncom IV,  but its communications failed in  orbit. ( O D ,  Oct 3/85,  174) 

October  27:  Engineers w i th   Hughes  Communications  Inc.,  owner  of  the 
Syncom 3 communications satellite,  sent at  11 :53  a.m.  today  from  the com- 
pany‘s  Guam ground station a radio command to fire the marooned satellite’s 
rocket booster,  causing the  satellite’s  ICBM-type rocket motor  to  fire  for  64 
seconds  as  planned,  the  Washington  Times  reported.  The  undertaking 
capped  the  most  ambitious  space  salvage  effort ever  attempted,  the  Times 
said,  a twoday  effort in  August  by  two astronauts aboard the  Space  Shuttle 
Discovery (see Satellites Apr  22  and Aug 31).  The engineers fired the  rocket 
without knowing whether  i t  would  b low   up or work  properly  after  months 
exposed to freezing temperatures. 
“We  really nailed  it,”  said Albert Wheelon,  president of the Hughes space 
communications group.  “We’ll  have  i t  in  synchronous orbit  round about the 
first  of  November and then we  s t i l l   have  30 days  of  checking out the  radio 
equipment and all the systems.” 
Insurance underwriters  stood  to  recoup  85%  of  the  insured  cost  of  the 
satellite,  a boost for  an  industry that  had lost more than  $600 m i l l ion   in  the 
past  20  months because of  seven  satellite failures  including Syncom 3 .  ( W  
Times,  Oct 28/85,  3A) 

November 7:  The  Naval Research  Laboratory (NRL), Washington,  D.C.,  an- 
nounced  its scientists devised a precise timing system  that  used  highly  effi- 
cient and relatively small hydrogen maser clocks that the laboratory expected 
would enhance timing in  the  Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS). 
GPS,  a  navigational  system  based  on  synchronized  clocks  (accurate  to 
billionths of a second), would permit users to pinpoint their position within a 
30-foot  radius by  measuring differences in  the  arrival  times of  radio signals 
received  from  Navstar’s  satellites.  And  GPS  would  disseminate  the  Naval 
Observatory’s  master clock  time  to  fleet  units  for  their  command,  control, 
communications, and intelligence. 
Maser clocks were considered the most accurate clocks available;  however 
their  bulky  size  and weight  (lighter ones  weighed  over  500  Ib.)  prevented 
their  use  aboard  GPS  satellites.  Also,  the  massive,  tuned  cavity  where  the 
maser  action  took  place required temperature  control  and magnetic shield- 
ing, which made masers  impractical for  use  in  satellites. 
The  research team  at  N R L   led  by  Ron  Beard  reduced  the  size  of  maser 
clocks by a factor of  16 and their weight  to  50  Ib. And  by making the cavity 
smaller,  using different resonant structures,  and dielectric  (sapphire) loading 
to  produce  the  effect  of  a  larger  cavity,  NRL  “passive”  masers  (so called 
because they d id  not oscillate on their own) proved to be as  accurate as  the 
larger  versions.  Beard  noted  that  NRCs  involvement  with  masers  and  the 

2 3 3  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

subsequent  idea to reduce cavity size came about only after two astro-indus- 
trial companies were unsuccessful in meeting GPS’s  timing demands. 
NRL  bu i l t  and  tested  two  experimental  maser  development  models  and 
two advanced development models. An additional  NRL project with Hughes 
Research  Laboratories used  a Q-multiplier  approach  to offset  the  inherently 
higher signal  losses  in small cavities. 
Research  in  the  NRL  maser  program  included  advances  in small  loaded- 
cavity properties,  beam optics,  dissociator reliability, quadropole state  selec- 
tion,  thermal/mechanical  design,  magnetic  shieldingldesign,  and  vacuum 
design for  space applications. 
The NRLdeveloped technology formed the basis for a $12 million contract 
awarded to Hughes Aircraft Corp. to produce two types of engineering devel- 
opment  models  of  hydrogen-maser clocks.  One  clock  type  was  for  use  i n  
satellites; the other,  for GPS ground stations and possibly ships. (NRL Release 
58-85  R) 

November 30:  The  U.S.  Navy today  took  control  of  Syncom 3 from  Hughes 
Communications  Inc.,  certifying  the  satellite  as  a  complete,  though  tardy, 
success,  the  Washington  Post reported. Space Shuttle astronauts repaired the 
$85  m i l l ion  satellite in space  [see  Satellites,  Aug.  311 by  bypassing a failed 
circuit and  relaunching  i t  on  September  1.  Hughes ground  controllers then 
tilted the satellite to face  the  sun,  which,  with the help of a thermal  blanket 
installed by the astronauts, warmed  the solid fuel. 
O n  October  27,  Hughes engineers  ignited the  satellite‘s  engines to take  it 
up  to  its  intended orbit 22,300  miles above  the Pacific Ocean,  then  Hughes 
and Navy engineers completed a month of testing. 
Following  the  certification,  Hughes  president  Steven  Dorfman  com- 
mented,  “We  are meeting a l l  our  specifications. Six  months later than origi- 
nally intended, we are going into service.” 
The  successful  repair  turned  around  a  loss  for  Hughes and  its  insurance 
carrier,  which  had paid the company  $85 million.  Dorfman said the  insurer 
would get  back $65  m i l l ion  by  sharing revenues with  Hughes over  the satel- 
lites’s  ten-year  lifespan. (WPost ,  Dec  1/85,  A3)

SEARCH  F O R   EXTRATERRESTRIAL  INTELLIGENCE 
(SETI) 

March 22:  Dr. John Billingham, chief of the Extraterrestrial Research Division 
at  Ames  Research  Center  (ARC)  and  founder  of  the  ARC-based  Search  for 
Extraterrestrial  Intelligence  (SETI),  said  at  a  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC) 
ALERT  colloquium that study of the earth‘s  part in  the  15-billion-year cosmic 
evolution  held the key to searching for  l i f e  beyond the solar system,  the Lewis 
News  reported.  “By  studying  how  our  own  planet  formed  and  how  basic 
elements required for  life evolved, we can theorize that a similar life-structur- 
ing  process may  be occurring  or  had occurred  elsewhere  i n  the  universe,” 
Billingham said. 
As  an  example,  he mentioned the  collection  of  microorganisms scientists 
observed  i n   3.5-billion-year-old  rock  formations  discovered  in   the  marine 
environment  of  Western  Australia.  Scientists  could  use  that  data  to  study 
rock-like formations  on other  planets that  might display  a similar evolution- 
ary  process. 
Billingham believed  that  it was  reasonable to  assume  that  life,  including 
intelligent  life,  existed  in   the  universe  because,  with  400  m i l l ion   stars  in  
earth’s  galaxy alone,  the  natural cosmic process  included formation of  plan- 
ets-a 
rule,  not an  exception-and 
the basic stuff  of  life existed  throughout 
the universe. 
Because the Viking program had failed to turn up signs of life on Mars,  SET1 
would  focus  i t s   sights on  life beyond the  solar  system,  Billingham  said.  To 
accomplish  this would  require either a manned interstellar vehicle or  radio 
telescopes. The former option would require, to reach the nearest star,  a four- 
stage  spacecraft weighing 34,000  tons,  traveling 3/10  the  speed of  light and 
using electrical power equal to  500,000  years  of earth  usage driven by  anti- 
matter-hardly  a feasible option,  he noted.  However,  researchers  could de- 
sign and bu i ld  radio telescopes to listen to life from other cosmic sources,  he 
said. 
Such a system would make use of the microwave window frequency range, 
a quiet  region of  the  spectrum  that  provided the  best chance of  picking up 
extraterrestrial signals. To  accomplish this,  SETl‘s  information  system  would 
need to develop the technology using the  largest radio telescopes to amplify 
the  signal  (1  to  3  CHz) and  to bu i ld  a signal  processing system  driven  by  a 
specially designed SET1 computer. 
Billingham  said  the  biggest  challenge  facing  the  SET1  program would  be 
identifying the format,  frequency resolution, and time of the signals  in order 
to  recognize and eliminate as  much interference as  possible, thus  separating 
noise from sound manifestations. To  determine signals of non-natural origin, 

235  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985  

SET1 would  apply a sequence of  logical tests coupled with a huge computer- 
based storehouse of  information that would filter out most of the  interference 
signals. 
‘A radio telescope placed in low earth orbit w i l l  help eliminate some of the 
interference problems,”  Billingham  said,  “and  the  prospect of a much larger 
lunar orbiting radio telescope would offer  an  even more advantageous  inter- 
ference-reducing  listening position  that  would  cover  a  radius of  1,000  light 
years. ” 
SET1 was  then preparing its first system radio telescope prototype for testing 
a t  Arecibo,  Puerto Rico,  where a  1,000-ft. radio  telescope conducted signal 
searches.  Once  fully  operational  and  in   orbit,  the  new  telescope  would 
receive signals originating  30  to 40  light years  away. 
“Either  we  are  alone or  not,”  Billingham concluded,  “and  either  has  large 
implications.  And  we  wonder,  indeed  if  there  i s   intelligent  life elsewhere, 
w i l l   it help us  understand our own.”  (Lewis News, March 2 2 / 8 5 ,  2)

SMITHSONIAN  INSTITUTION 

January 29: Regents of the Smithsonian Institution announced they had can- 
celled  plans to  construct a  new  facility  at Washington  Dulles  International 
Airport  that  would  have  housed  NASA‘s  obsolete vehicles,  the  Washington 
Times reported. The Smithsonian had also expected to display the prototype 
of  the  French Concorde  and  numerous  other  non-NASA  aircraft.  However, 
the  regents had decided the facility was  a  low  priority. 
“I don‘t  think the only place to store those aircraft and spacecraft i s  Dulles,” 
said Smithsonian secretary Kobert Adams.  “I would  be concerned to take on 
another major construction program at this time.”  He concluded that empha- 
sis would  be  on  completing  projects already  begun.  (W  Times,  Jan 29/85, 
D3) 

A p r i l   18:  The Smithsonian Institution’s  Air  and  Space Museum  received a p  
proximately  $400,000  from  the  Johnson Wax  Co.,  which  was  needed  to 
construct a life-sized,  remote-controlled model of a pterosaur,  a flying dino- 
saur  that  existed  in various  forms  for  about  145  m i l l ion  years  and  became 
extinct  about  60  m i l l ion   years  ago,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  The 
Smithsonian had announced the project the previous summer with the caveat 
that  i t  would  need  corporate  funding.  “We  always  planned  to  do   it,”  said 
museum deputy director Don Lopez,  “but  now we can be sure  i t  w i l l  be built 
on the scale that we wanted.’’ 
The  Smithsonian asked  Paul  MacCready, a  pr izew inn ing  aerodynamicist 
whose  experiments  with  pedal-  and  solar-powered  aircraft  were  known 
around  th e   world  and whose  Gossamer Condor,  a  lightweight, pedal-pow- 
ered  plane,  hung  in   the  Air  and  Space  Museum,  to  design  and  bu i ld   the 
model.  MacCready  and  a  team  of  experts  i n  paleontology,  bird  flight,  arid 
aerodynamics were  experimenting in  California with  a  small,  glider version 
of the pterosaur. ?he  Smithsonian expected the final  version to weigh about 
125  Ib.  and  have  a wingspan  of  36   feet,  roughly  the  size  of  a  four-person 
airplane.  MacCready would  construct  the  moael  of  graphite,  carbon,  and 
epoxy fibers. 
The challenge,  a Smithsonian spokesman said,  was  to design a computer- 
ized  “brain”  for  the  model  to  simulate  the slight,  constant wing movement 
that  researchers  believed the pterosaur used to maintain i t s  balance. ( WPost, 
Apr  18/85,  D2) 

May 8:  The Smithsonian Institution announced that  “Celestial  Images: Astro- 
noniical Charts,  1500-1900,”  a special exhibition  of 39 rare depictions of star 
patterns and planetary system, would open May  16  at  its National Museum 
of American History. 

237 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

The exhibition,  intended to  illustrate a  unity  of  science and  art  from  the 
Renaissance to the  19OOs,  would  include two woodcuts,  the first  printed star 
charts w i th   coordinates  and  scales  from  which  positions of  stars  could  be 
plotted,  from the workshop of Renaissance artist and mathematician Albrecht 
Durer (1471-1528).  The  museum would  also  display  from  Lahore,  India,  a 
17thcentury  Islamic celestial globe made of brass and  inlaid with silver stars; 
the  only  extant  copy  of  engraved  paper  gores  (1599) for  the  first  celestial 
globe  by  Willem Janszoon Blaeu  (1571-16381,  the  first  to  incorporate  the 
Danish astronomer Tycho  Brahe’s  unexcelled positions for  1,000  stars;  and a 
17thcentury  celestial atlas by Andreas Cellarius. 
In addition  to reflecting artistic s ty les  and conventions of their periods, the 
works  represented differing  points  of  scientific and  philosophical  debate. 
Charts that  accurately fixed  many  constellations and thousands of  stars  also 
depicted Ptolemy’s view of the earth as  the center of the  universe. Constella- 
tions rendered as  mythological figures  in one work  might appear as  Biblical 
figures in  another. However,  as  a result of astronomer’s access to stronger and 
technically  improved  instruments,  the  works  showed  increasing  accuracy 
over  the  400  years  covered  in  the  exhibition.  (Smithsonian  Institution  Re-

lune  21:  “The  Dream Is  Alive:’  a new IMAX movie that was  perhaps the most 
advanced f i lm  of  its kind ever made, opened today at the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion’s  National Air  and  Space Museum,  the  Washington Post  reported. The 
$3.6 m i l l ion  production,  narrated by Walter Cronkite, was  the first ever  shot 
almost completely on location in  space and was  an  informal sequel to ”Hail, 
Columbia:’ 
the story of the U.S.’s first Space Shuttle. 
Because the f i lm  was shot on three of the most dramatic and action-packed 
Space Shuttle flights of the previous year,  i t  was essentially a video yearbook 
full  of special  happenings, the  Washington Times reported. 
The  film  showed  the  rescue  and  repair  of  the  Solar  Max  satellite,  the 
deployment of  the  100-foot-tall solar  array  that  someday  could  help  power 
the  space  station,  launching of  two  communications satellites,  and  the  first 
spacewalk by an American woman. 
Among what  appeared to be special effects produced  in  Hollywood were 
the  immensity of Hurricane Josephine as  seen  from  200 miles overhead and 
the silence of a satellite drifting noiselessly in  the blackness of space. 
The astronauts who shot the footage said the IMAX format came as close to 
capturing the real view and the true feel of spaceflight as  any format ever had. 
IMAX expert Graeme Ferguson, who produced and directed the film, said the 
next  step  was  to  modify an  IMAX camera so  i t  could  be taken  outside  the 
Space Shuttle.  ( W  Post, June 22/85,  D1; W Times, June 20185,  3B) 
Ju ly  24:  In testimony  today  before the  Senate  Committee on Rules  and Ad- 
ministration,  Smithsonian  Institution  Secretary  Robert  McCormick  Adams

Smithsonian  Institution 

said the Smithsonian opposed a  b i l l  introduced by  Sen.  Barry Goldwater (R- 
Ariz.) that would authorize funds to construct a museum administered by the 
National  Air  and  Space  Museum  for  historic  airplanes  and  spacecraft  at 
Dulles International Airport, the  Washington Post  reported.  He said the  Insti- 
tution  had more  immediate legislative priorities, although  i t  would  support 
planning  appropriations.  In  1976  Goldwater  was  instrumental  in   pushing 
funds  through Congress  for  the  National Air  and Space Museum. 
The b i l l  Goldwater  introduced  in June called for  $42.6  m i l l ion   in  govern- 
ment appropriations in FY 89 and beyond, contingent on an equal amount in  
matching donations from  the  private sector. Adams  questioned whether  the 
Institution should,  or could,  raise that much money,  particularly because the 
Institution had more pressing fund-raising commitments. 
Although  Goldwater was  on  the  Smithsonian’s  Board of  Regents,  he was 
pushing the  issue now,  Terry  Emerson,  his  legislative assistant said,  because 
“its  just an  interest in  priorities.”  Emerson noted that politicians had a greater 
sense  than  d id   Smithsonian  officials  of  the  interest  in  technology-related 
museums.  “Later  they’ll come in once they see  the overwhelming interest in 
it,”  he added. 
“Once  enabling  legislation i s  enacted,”  Goldwater said,  “I believe numer- 
ous  private  individuals  and  firms w i l l   begin  a  major fund-raising campaign 
that w i l l  produce enough matching monies to get the first construction going 
by  fiscal year  1989.” 
The Smithsonian’s  Board of  Regents  initially  approved in September  1983 
the concept for the air museum,  citing insufficient space  at the  National Air 
and Space Museum and the difficulty of transporting large aircraft  and space- 
craft  to  the Ma l l  building.  Under the  plan,  the  Federal Aviation  Administra- 
tion  would  lease  100  acres  of  i t s   land  at  Dulles  without  compensation. 
Proximity to a runway was essential,  because many of the aircraft and space- 
craft,  such  as  the  Concorde and  Space  Shuttle,  were  too  large to  be  trans- 
ported on roads. 
The committee would  rule on  the  proposed  legislation in  September.  (W  
Post, July 25/85,  69) 

September 20: Rep.  Norman Mineta,  (D-Calif.)  introduced  legislation today 
for the planning and construction of an expansion of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion’s  National  Air  and  Space  Museum  at  Washington  Dulles  Airport,  the 
Congressional Record  reported. 
When  introducing H.R. 3403, Mineta said,  ”Th is   legislation i s  proposed to 
solve two  major  problems confronting  the Air  and Space Museum.  First,  as 
my colleagues know,  this  is  perhaps the most popular museum in the world. 
The  public’s  demand  for  exhibits and  information  concerning our  aviation 
history  i s   enormous,  and  growing.  We  need  the  additional  facilities to  re- 
spond to this demand. 

239  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

“But  why  Dulles? Why  not bu i ld  the  new  facility  in  downtown Washing- 
ton? The answer  i s  simple:  there  i s   no site  large enough for  the  needs envi- 
sioned and  of  paraniount  importance,  there  i s   no other  site  adjacent  to  a 
major airport. 
‘An  airport site  i s  critical  because of the second problem we  are  trying to 
solve,  which  i s   how  to  display  objects of  the  scale of  the  space  shuttle or 
other  modern aircraft.  l h e  museum  needs  to  be at  Dulles Airport  because 
that i s  the only site to  which these exhibits can be transported m d  disp!ayed. 
“In  particular,  this legislation authorizes the transfer  to the Smithsonian of 
land  at  the  airport. This  bill authorizes a  total of  $2 .4   m i l l ion   in funds  for 
planning of the new museum,  to be appropriated in  the  1986 to 1988 period. 
“In  addition,  the  b i l l   authorizes  the  appropriation  of  $42.6  million  in 
Federal  funds  beginning  in  1989 to finance half of  the  cost of  actually  con- 
structing the museum. These Federal funds would not be available unless and 
un t i l   a  private  fundraising  effort  has  raised  an  identical  amount.”  (Cong. 
Record,  Sept  20/85,  E41651 

Nowmber 8:  NASA announced i t  would  transfer on December 6,  1985, the 
title  to  the  Space  Shuttle orbiter  Enterprise to  the  Smithsonian  Institution’s 
National Air and Space Museum. The NASA Shuttle Carrier Aircraft,  a modi- 
fied  Boeing  747,  on  November  16  would  deliver  Enterprise to Washington 
Dulles International Airport, where cranes would  remove Enterprise from the 
top of the  747  and  lower  i t  to Dulles’s  tarmac. 
Rockwell  Internatl.,  NASA’s  Space  Shuttle  prime  contractor,  constructed 
Enterprise,  which  was  the  first  orbiter  built.  NASA  used  Enterprise,  Space 
Shuttle orbiter  vehicle  101  (OV  1011,  to  test  airframe  loads,  flight  dynamics 
characteristics,  and  other  aspects  of  the  orbiter  as  i t   flew  through  earth’s 
atmosphere. NASA also used Enterprise as  a test bed for manufacturing tech- 
niques,  aerodynamics, and flight control  tests,  and mating and fit checks for 
the remainder of the Space Shuttle components-the  external tank,  solid-fuel 
rocket boosters, and mobile launch platforms at  both Kennedy Space Center 
and Vandenberg Air  Force Base. 
O n  September  17,  1976,  Enterprise rolled out  from  Rockwell’s  assembly 
facility  at  Palmdale,  California,  and  was  first  flown  on  kb ruan /   15,  197i: 
aboard the modified 747  in  taxi tests  at  Edwards Air  Force Base. 
There were then five approach and landing tests,  commanded and piloted 
alternately by astronaut teams of Fred Haise, Jr. (commander) and C .  Gordon 
Fullerton (pilot! and Joe Engie (commander) and Richard Truly  (piiot). 
After  ground vibration  tests,  engineers at  Kennedy Space Center used  En- 
terprise  for  fit  checks  with  the  other  Space  Shuttle  components  and  the 
mobile  launch  systems.  More  recently,  engineer;  used  Enterprise  for  fit 
checks at  the  Space  Shuttle  launch complex  at  Vandenberg Air  Force  Base.

November 18:  The Space Shuttle Enterprise arrived the afternoon of Novem- 
ber 18 at Washington Dulles International Airport after a two-hour delay due 
to  inclement weather,  the  Washington Post  reported.  NASA had announced 
earlier that  it would transfer title to Enterprise to the Smithsonian Institution’s 
National Air and Space Museum [see Smithsonian Institution, Nov. 81.  NASA 
delayed Enterprise’s  takeoff from Kennedy Space Center until an early morn- 
ing   fog  burned  off  so  more  people  along  the  route  could  see  the  craft. 
Enterprise,  atop  a  Boeing  747,  was  visible  to  onlookers  in  Annapolis  and 
Baltimore before i t  began a counterclockwise circuit over Washington’s  Capi- 
tal Beltway. 
Officials  at  Dulles  would  store  the  spacecraft  in  a temporary  shed  about 
two  miles  from  the  airport  terminal  until  a  permanent  facility  was  con- 
structed.  (W  Post,  N w  19/85, B 1 )

lanuary  7': NASA announced it signed with Rockwell Internatl. Corp. a mem- 
orandum of  understanding (MOU)  covering Space Shuttle flight assignments 
for Rockwell's materials-processing laboratory, which flew on STS  41 -D  and, 
using the  float-zone  technique,  grew  a  single  indium  crystal  with  a  lattice 
structure originating  from a crystal seed.  The agreement called for  Rockwell 
to  develop  an  industrial  space-processing  program  under  which  research 
institutions and commercial firms would  install and operate experiments in  
the  modular  laboratory.  Rockwell  designed  its  fluids-experiment  apparatus 
(FEA), the first  zero-gravity  laboratory for  basic and product  research  in  low- 
earth  orbit,  to  fit  in  the  Space  Shuttle's  m iddeck  stowage  area  where  crew 
could  operate  and  monitor  it.  Experiments  could  range  from  processing 
applications  to  liquid  chemistry,  fluid  physics,  thermodynamics,  crystal 
growth,  and biological-cell culturing. 
The  laboratory,  about the size of a 19-inch TV,  could heat,  cool,  expose to 
vacuum,  and manipulate experiment samples that might be gaseous,  liquid, 
or solid,  and could mix or stir,  remove, and change samples during a mission. 
A motion-picture or video camera would  record sample behavior and  instru- 
ment data displays.  (NASA  Release 85-2) 

lanuary   77: NASA  successfully  launched  today  an  Aerobee  liquid-fueled, 
sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range,  New Mexico, marking the 
end of that  rocket series,  which was  the oldest continuous  rocket-firing pro- 
gram.  NASA's  Sounding Rocket Division had launched 536  Aerobees with a 
94% success  rate. The Aerobee's  reliability made i t  the workhorse vehicle for 
high-altitude  studies.  Commenting on the  program, Maury  Dubin,  Goddard 
Space  Flight Center  (GSFC)  physicist,  said  "virtually  everything  that's  been 
done  in  space  research can be attributed to sounding-rocket technology. The 
Aerobee  and  other  sounding-rocket  research precipitated the  rise  of  many 
disciplines, from astronomy to the upper atmosphere." 
The  Aerobee  program  began  in   1946  when  Aerojet  Engineering Corp. 
received a U.S.  Navy contract to  bu i ld  the  rockets,  and the Applied  Physics 
Laboratory  (APL) had supplied technical direction; Dr. James Van  Allen  had 
been  project director.  The Aerobee  name,  the  Bumblebees, derived  from  a 
combination  of  Aerojet  and  APCs  series  of  Navy  missiles.  NASA  had  used 
Aerobees  extensively  during  the  internatl. Geophysical Year  duly  1957  to 
December 1958) to gather  information on the atmosphere, cosmic radiation, 
auroras, and geomagnetism. 
The Aerobee  rockets consisted of a series of five with each  rocket carrying 
as  many as  s ix  experiments that  included equipment such as cameras,  vac- 
uum  bottles,  mirrors,  grids,  sensing devices,  lenses,  and  other  mechanical

units.  Most  rockets  recorded  data  and  simultaneously  transmitted  i t  via  te- 
lemetry to ground stations. The final Aerobee  payload tested a new spectro- 
graph  that  would  be  flown  on  NASA’s  Astro  mission  to  record  extreme 
ultraviolet Dayglow emissions in  earths upper atmosphere. 
George Kraft, GSFC  flight  support section director,  said that,  although the 
demise  of  small  liquid-fueled  sounding  rockets  was  imminent,  “sounding 
rockets would continue to be an  important element  in NASA‘s support of the 
scientific community.  They’re  virtually  the  only  vehicles  that  can  conduct 
studies  in   the  40  km  ( 2 5   miles)  to  200   km  (125   miles)  high  zone  of  the 
atmosphere.”  Balloons could  trawl  only  about  50  kni  (31 miles) high  and 
satellites  were  ineffective below 200 km  (125  miles) high. CSFC’s  Wallops 
Flight Fac i l i ty  managed the  NASA sounding-rocket program.  (GSFC  Release

May  77:  Dr.  George Wetherill,  director of  the department of  terrestrial mag- 
netism at  the  Carnegie  Institution of Washington,  said  in  an  interview  with 
the New York  Times that  his report to appear  in  the May  i 7  issue of  Science 
discussed  his hypothesis that  the  inner planets of  the solar  system  appeared 
to   have  been formed when  a number of  planets,  some of  them  three  times 
larger  than  Mars,  repeatedly collided with  one  another  until only  one  sur- 
vived  in  each of the present planetary orbits. 
Wetherill believed the present planets had “lots  of brothers and sisters”  not 
much smaller than themselves, which collided to form “trial”  planets, the N Y  
Times reported.  “The  four we  s e e   today  [Mercury, Venus,  Earth,  and Mars]:’ 
he said,  ”are  the survivors. One of the final collisions,”  he added,  “probably 
increased  the  spin  of  earth  sufficiently to  throw  off  materials that  consoli- 
dated to  form the moon.” 

244 

Space  Science  and  Applications 

Wetherill derived his hypothesis from a computer simulation of what p r o b  
ably  happened after  the  solar  system  began  to  take  shape  from  a  rotating 
cloud  of  dust  and  gas  about  4.5  b i l l ion   years  ago.  The  analysis  took  into 
consideration various factors affecting the formation process once some 500 
bodies, each one-third the size of the moon,  had formed in the region around 
the  sun  now  occupied  by  the  four  planets  mentioned above.  These  factors 
included the  gravitational  fields around  each object,  the  frequency of  near 
misses that would throw  the objects  into eccentric orbits,  and the collisions 
that may  have canceled the eccentricity. 
Collisions  would  have  generated  enough  heat  within  the  earth  to  melt 
most,  i f  not all,  of its interior, allowing heavy material to sink and form earth's 
metallic  core. 
Wetherill's  calculations assumed that not enough gas  was  present to affect 
motions of  the  objects  as  they  sped  past  one another;  many  scientists con- 
curred that a violent "wind"  blowing out from the sun swept the  inner solar 
system clear of gas. 
Each collision would have driven off most of any planetary atmosphere that 
had begun to accumulate, and since impact histories of Earth and k n u s  were 
different,  this could  account  for  the differences in  their  atmospheric abun- 
dances of such  inert gasses  as  argon. 
initially,  material  destined  to  form  the  planets was  so  uniformly  spread 
around  the  sun  that  their  motions  were  determined  by  multiple  collisions 
much  like those  of  molecules  i n  a  hot  gas.  By  the  time  this  material  had 
formed  into  larger  bodies,  Wetherill  said,  their  mutual  gravitational  attrac- 
tions would have become a significant factor.  During the ensuing collisions, 
Wetherill  believed,  the  existing  planets  had  acquired  50%  of  their  present 
material;  after  100 m i l l ion  years  the process was  99% completed. 
Age  determinations  of  moon  rocks  indicated  that  the  last  great  crashes, 
enough to  produce the  lunar seas,  d id  not end until 3.8  b i l l ion  years ago,  or 
several  hundred  m i l l ion   years  after  the  formative  process  began.  By  then, 
however,  the  impacting bodies were "quite  small:'  Wetherill  said,  "about  30 
miles  in  diameter."  What  remained  in  the  form  of  asteroids  and  meteorites 
was  far  less than that  needed to produce even a small planet. 
Jupiter and the  large planets beyond i t  were not  in  a region swept clear of 
gas,  making their formation histories very different, Wetherill concluded. (NY  
Times,  May  11/85,  12) 

May  7 4   NASA  announced  its  National  Space  Technology  Laboratories 
(NSTL),  through  its  Earth  Resources  Laboratory,  signed  a  memoraridum of 
understanding (MOU) with  the Anthropology  Department of  the  University 
of Colorado at Boulder to use satellite  imaging and  remote sensing technol- 
ogy to probe the tropical Andean jungles for archaelogical remains in  Peru's 
Rio Abiseo  National  Park. 

245 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

O f  particular interest in the park were the ancient site of Gran Patajen,  the 
subtropical cloud forest,  and the park’s  diverse ecology.  Using sophisticated 
instrumentation  that  would  allow  researchers  to  ”see”  through  the  dense 
vegetation  to  locate  evidence  of  past  settlements  in   the  now  uninhabited 
region,  researchers  would  combine  data  from  the  Landsat  earth  resources 
satellite  w i th   information  gathered  by  a  specially  equipped  aircraft  from 
NSTL. The  researchers  might also observe and map interesting geographical 
features and variations in  vegetation. 
Thomas  Lennon,  codirector of  the  university’s  Rio Abiseo  National  Park 
Research Project, said of  the  undertaking,  “NASA’s  assistance w i l l  enable  us 
to  take a good look at  the  1,060-sq-mile  park from above-immensely  easier 
than trekking through the jungle on foot. When cultural resources are  identi- 
fied through  image analysis,  we’ll  be able to check  it out on the ground. This 
approach allows us to make the best use of the  limited researchers as  well as 
the time we’ll  have  in  the field.” 
The university,  NASA,  and a remote sensing team at Peru’s  National Agrar- 
ian University in  Lima would work together to extract  information from vari- 
ous  sensing  devices.  An  early  outcome  of  the  project  should  be  accurate 
u p t o d a t e  maps of the uncharted parkland. 
The  project  was  one  of  three  archaeological  research  investigations  s u p  
ported by  NASA‘s remote sensing program administered by  NASA’s Office of 
Space  Science and Applications,  Washington,  D.C.  In another  project with 
the  University  of  Colorado,  NASA  was  examining  volcanic  destruction  of 
cities and vegetation in  Costa Rica.  In the third project, NASA was supporting 
Richard Leakey of the  Leaky  Foundation who was  searching for  evidence of 
human evolution  in  Kenya,  Africa. 
NASA’s work  on  the  projects  resulted  from  i t s   interest  in  expanding  the 
scientific applications of space technology,  in these cases to archaeology and 
anthropology,  which  could  benefit  from  advancements  in  remote  sensing 
technology. (NASA Release 85-73) 

May  17:  NASA  announced that  seven world class  gymnasts  would  undergo 
testing  May  20-22  at  Johnson Space  Center  USC)  as  part  of  a  continuing 
study  of  the  space  adaptation  syndrome  that  affected  about  half  the  astro- 
nauts who had flown in  space.  Researchers wanted to know  i f  gymnasts were 
less  susceptible to  the  malaise because  of  their experience of  moving and 
spinning  in  three dimensions. 
The  gymnasts  underwent  baseline testing at  JSC in  mid-April.  A  second 
battery of tests would measure their responses in  the laboratory and aboard a 
jet aircraft that  induced brief periods of  reduced gravity. 
Testing was co-sponsored by the U.S. Gymnastics Federation, of which the 
participants were  members. They were  Kathy Johnson, Patty Gerard,  Megan 
Marsden,  Krista Canary,  Tom  Beach,  Scott Johnson, and Steve  Elliot. (NASA

During May: Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) personnel were testing the 
interface of the software in the space telescope data capture facility (ST DCF) 
with other elements of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ground system,  the 
GSFC  News  reported. The DCF,  which  had arrived at GSFC  ahead of sched- 
ule and  on  target  w i th   program costs,  would  accept science data  from  the 
telescope’s  five  instruments through  the  NASA  communications (NASCOM) 
system via the  Tracking and Da ta  Relay Satelhte (TDRS) and the NASA ground 
terminal  at White Sands,  New Mexico. 
William Stalling,  head of GSFC’s  data capture systems section and project 
manager for  ST  DCF development,  said,  ”Within  24  hours of  receipt of  the 
science data stream from NASCOM, the facility w i l l  preprocess the data and 
forward  i t  to the Space Telescope  Science Institute (STSI) for  further  process- 
ing  and  use  by  scientists.”  The  DCF  had  two  identical Could  32-87  com- 
puter  systems  and  special  hardware to  provide the  science data  processing 
requirements. 
The  DCF  had  previously  demonstrated  the  ability  to  capture  the  1.024 
megabit and 4 k i lob i t  per-second data streams,  processing the data  into user 
data sets,  and transmitting them to the Science Institute at  the daily  required 
volume  level  of  three  billion  bits of  science data.  Because  the  space  tele- 
scope’s  science  instrument data were packetized,  future  refurbishment of the 
space  telescope with  new  instruments would  require only  table  updates  in  
the DCF’s  software. Also,  the DCF had automated quality control that should 
reduce operational costs. (Goddard News, May 85,  3 )  

During July  After  preliminary  examination of  Spartan  1 data,  mission man- 
ager  Dave Shrewsberry said the  spacecraft appeared to  have  performed well 
during the Space  Shuttle 5 1 4  mission. Astronauts deployed the  spacecraft 
on the fourth day of the mission into a free-flying orbit and retrieved i t  on the 
sixth day,  Goddard News reported. Final evaluation required analysis of Spar- 
tan  1’s  tape  recordings. 
”Although the grapple fixture wasn‘t  pointed  in  the direction  we  thought  it 
would be when we were retrieved,”  Shrewsberry said,  “that  i s  not a matter of 
concern. The  running lights were on and the experiment doors closed,  indi- 
cating that the program we  had computed was  completed.”  Early indications 
also  showed  that  all  s i x   of  the  Get  Away  Special  experiments  turned  on

(TSS),  which NASA  had scheduled for  a  first flight  in  1988 aboard the Space

investigations in  the upper atmosphere and  in  plasmaelectrodynamic inter- 
actions. 101 The overall objectives of the TSS  program were to demonstrate the 
successful operation of a tethered satellite,  perform the initial electrodynamic 
science and plasma investigations, and develop a reusable facility capable of 
supporting a broad range of electrodynamic experiments in  the  ionosphere. 
O n   the  first  TSS  mission,  a  NASAsupplied  deployer  mechanism  would 
send the  ltaliandeveloped  and -built satellite upward from the Space Shuttle 
orbiter  to  a distance of as  much as  12  miles. The motion of  the conducting 
tether across geomagnetic field  lines would  generate several  thousand volts 
of  energy  to  provide  a  broad  range of  electrical operating  conditions.  R e  
searchers  could also  use  the  overall system  to artifically  generate and study 
field-aligned currents and associated plasma effects. 
O n  the second TSS  mission,  the satellite would be at  the end of a noncon- 
ducting  tether  at  62  miles  in   the  earth's  atmosphere,  an  area  previously 
explored only sporadically,  mainly with sounding rocket payloads. The teth- 
ered satellite would permit  investigation of the  region on a  global scale over 
several  days. 
The  TSS-3  mission  would  be  a  follow-up  to  the  TSS-1  electrodynamics 
mission,  w i th   deployment  from  either  the  Space  Shuttle  or  the  proposed 
space station. 
A memorandum of  understanding signed  in  1984 by  NASA and P S N K N R  
established  the  TSS  program.  NASA's Marshall  Space  flight  Center  had  re- 
sponsibility for  project  implementation.

August  7 5 :   A sophomore at Purdue University and a senior at San  Francisco's 
Lowell High School designed experiments to be carried on two  1986 Space 
Shuttle Flights, the Washington Post reported. Kentucky Fried Chicken would 
sponsor  an  experiment  in   which  eggs  would  fly  in   orbit  to  determine 
whether  chicken  embryos  could  survive  the  rigors  of  weightlessness. The 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at  the  University of California would  sponsor 

248  

Space  Science  and Applications 

an  experiment  to measure the  effects  of  weightlessness on cell  division  in  
yeast. 
Greg Delory,  16,  said  he got  the  idea for  flying baker’s  yeast  from the  first 
Spacelab  mission  where  bread  mold  was  grown  in  orbit.  “The  mold  was 
supposed to produce spores every 22  hours,  but i n  space  i t  lost  its circadian 
rhythm and produced spores a l l  the time,”  he said.  Delory won a competition 
to design a Space  Shuttle experiment while attending the  U.S.  Space Camp 
under the auspices of Marshall Space  Flight Center. 
John Vellinger, 20, who won a competition  to design a NASA experiment, 
said,  “We  hope  this w i l l   give  us  some  data  about  the  feasibility of  raising 
chickens as  a food source i n  space.”  ( W  Post,  Aug  15/85,  A191 

August 2 3  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s  UPL) Geobotanical Remote Sens- 
ing Group was developing technologies of spectral analysis to acquire a total 
picture of  earth’s  vegetation-wild  and cultivated,  trees  and  plants-the  JPL 
Universe  reported. The group was  adapting techniques developed  for  space 
exploration  to  devise,  build,  and  test  spaceborne  instruments  that  would 
work  in   conjunction  with  ground-based  monitoring,  data-recording,  and 
analysis devices. 
The  group was  employing  every  available  technology-radar,  microwave, 
and  infrared analysis-as  well  as  effective  procedures  for  using them.  The 
goal was  to  develop  technology to  identify  types  of  vegetation,  the area  of 
coverage,  and general conditions from field to field,  area to area,  continent to 
continent.  JPL was  working  closely w i th   the  University of  California  in  the 
project,  particularly the university’s Kearney Agricultural Center,  to diagnose 
crop conditions based on factors such as  irrigation, insect infestation,  and the 
spread of  plant diseases. 
In the  program,  satellites  bounced radar off earth‘s  vegetation,  i n  a sense 
taking  i t s   pulse and  temperature.  At  the  same  time,  ground-based studies 
used, among other techniques, a truck-transported basket like a cherry picker 
to gather radar as  well as  infrared measurements similar to those from Landsat 
and other earth-surveillance satellites. Particularly helpful to the program was 
JPCs Space  Shuttle  imaging radar,  which was  unaffected by  darkness or  o b  
scuring clouds. The  instrument was  on  an October  1984 Space Shuttle mis- 
sion and would fly again  in  1987. 
Data analysis in  the program employed several approaches. In one,  analysts 
gave  a computer  a  statistical  model  and  commanded  i t  to  survey  recorded 
data  to  seek  out  similar  conditions  throughout  the  globe,  thus  providing 
insights  into vegetation  identity and  condition.  Other  studies  concentrated 
on  the  use of  physical models  to  relate spectral  data  to  parameters such  as 
green-leaf area and water  status. 
Comparison of  space-derived  and  ground-based  images  and  data  deter- 
mined  how  they  differed and  how  they  complimented  one  another.  This 

249 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

permitted monitoring of  crop and  natural vegetation conditions on a world- 
wide basis and offered  insights  into the effects of  acid  rain and other  pollu- 
tion  on  crops  and  forests,  in   lakes  and  ponds,  and  into  conditions  and 
changes of arid  lands. (JPL Universe, Aug 23185,  1) 

During October: The Space Shuttle Discovery on mission 5 1 4  was  not the 
first NASA orbiter to carry  retroreflectors for  laser ranging in  space,  the God- 
dard News  reported. Apollo astronauts in  the  late 1960s placed reflectors on 
the  moon,  and  NASA  launched  in  1976  Lageos,  a  retroreflector  equipped 
satellite.  Laser  ranging had become routine in space  and was  available for  a 
variety of measurement tasks. 
At Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC), Crustal  Dynamics Project (CDP) 
scientists analyzed  data  received  from  satellite  laser  ranging (SLR) to  study 
the  movement  and  deformation  of  crustal  plates  that  determined  earth’s 
shape.  The  scientists  also  analyzed  data  received  from  lunar  laser  ranging 
(LLR) to study polar motion and earth  rotation, which  led to earth’s  wobble. 
At GSFC  there was  an  international system  of cooperating laser networks. 
A l l   systems,  such  as  the Goddard  Laser Tracking Network  (GLTN),  provided 
data to the CDP through conventional SLR and lunar laser ranging. The GLTN 
consisted of a series of transportable and fixed systems throughout the world 
and other  international laser networks also supported the CDP. 
Satellite  laser  ranging had attained major advances  since  the  inception  in  
1965 of  the  GLTN.  Tracking efficiency  had  improved from  65%  in   1981  to 
75%  in 1985;  instrument accuracy,  from  10 cm to  1 cm. 
The  laser transmitter and sensitive photomultiplier  receiver were the most 
essential equipment  in  any  laser tracking system,  because they provided and 
processed  the  signals  from  which  the  measurements were  made.  Current 
laser  transmitters  shot  short-pulsed  beams  that  lasted  200  trillionths  of  a 
second,  the time i t  took  light to travel about two  inches. 
Recently,  the  Federal  Republic of Germany asked  GSFC  scientists to assist 
i n  preoperational tests  of  i t s  new Modular Transportation Laser Ranging Sys- 
tem  (MTLRS)  1,  because  GSFC  had  the  Mob i le   Laser  Ranging  System 
(MOBLAS) 7 for a calibration standard of comparison. During the daily  tests, 
the  two  systems  simultaneously  tracked  the  same  satellite,  then  scientists 
compared data obtained from MTLRS  1  to that  from MOBLAS 7.  The closer 
the  measurements,  the  better  the  calibration;  MTLRS  1 measured within  1 
cm of the MOBLAS 7. 
MTLRS  1  later would participate with other  European and U.S.  systems  to 
perform satellite  laser  ranging in West  Germany,  Italy, Greece,  Egypt,  Israel, 
and Turkey.  (Goddard News, Oct 85,  4) 

November 6 :  Eighteen European governments agreed today to finance a plan, 
known as  Eureka,  to increase Europe’s  technological presence through devel- 
opment  of  10  pilot  technology  projects,  the  NY  Times reported. Although 

2 50  

Space  Science  and Applications 

some  observers  considered  Eureka  a  counterweight  to  the  U.S.’s  Strategic 
Defense Initiative (SDI) program,  most of  the  Eureka projects,  ranging from 
high-powered  industrial  lasers  to  a  diagnostic  k i t   for  sexually  transmitted 
diseases,  were under discussion well before French President Francois Mitter- 
rand proposed them  i n  April  1985 as  the Eureka project. 
The agreement was  reached at  the same  time that several European coun- 
tries were  considering whether  to  support  the  Reagan  Administration’s  SDI 
program. Britain agreed  in  October  to  full  participation in  SDI,  France had 
withheld support,  and West Germany said  i t  would  decide before the end of 
the year. 
In  the Eureka agreement,  ministers from the European Economic Commu- 
nity (EEC), joined by Spain,  Portugal, Sweden,  Norway,  Finland, Switzerland, 
Austria,  and Turkey,  said  i n  a seven-page  “declaration of  principles”  that  the 
program‘s  aim was  to “strengthen  the basis for  lasting prosperity and employ- 
ment”  by  furthering  “closer  cooperation  among  enterprises  and  research 
institutes  in  the field of advance technologies.” 
Widely  differing conceptions of  how Eureka should work  had slowed the 
plan,  but the  governments finally  found  ways  around several  obstacles,  in- 
cluding questions on government versus private financing and a secretariat to 
oversee  the agreement.  Emphasizing that funding  should come  largely from 
the private sector,  the declaration called for “adequate financial commitment 
by  participating enterprises.” 
The  ten  p i lo t  Eureka  projects and  nations to  participate approved by  the 
ministers were:  production  of  a standard microcomputer for  education and 
d o m e s t i c   u s e   ( B r i t a i n ,   F rance ,   I ta ly ) ;   p r o d u c t i o n  of a   n e w   type of  c o m p u t e r  
chip made of amorphous, or uncrystallized,  silicon (France, West Germany); 
development of a high-speed computer (France,  Norway); development of a 
laser for cutting cloth in  the apparel  industry (France,  Portugal); development 
of membranes for water filtration that could be used to desalinate sea  water 
(Denmark,  France);  development  of  high-power  laser  systems  (West  Ger- 
many,  France,  Italy,  Britain); development  of  a system  to  trace pollutants  in  
European air (West Germany,  Austria,  Finland, the Netherlands, Norway,  and 
the EEC);  development of a European research computer network (West Ger- 
many,  Austria,  Finland,  France,  the  Netherlands,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  and 
the  EEC);  development  of  a  diagnosis  k i t   for  sexually  transmitted  diseases 
(Spain,  Britain);  and  development of  advanced optic  electronics  (France,  It- 
aly). (NYT ,  Nov 7/85,  D1) 

November 27: NASA announced that  1986 would  be its most productive year 
ever  in   space  science  activities,  including  a  variety  of  “space  firsts”  and 
several  major  scientific studies  that  would  be  started  or  continued.  To  in- 
crease  the  public’s  knowledge and  understanding of  NASA’s  scientific pro- 
grams,  NASA’s  Office of Space Science and Applications and the Smithsonian 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Institution’s  National Air and Space Museum would work  together  in  a year- 
long program entitled “1986-A  Year  for Space Science.” 
The two organizations planned exhibits,  audievisual presentations,  publi- 
cations,  and a lecture series at  the Air and Space Museum and several  other 
locations throughout  the  U.S.  In addition,  the  National Air  and  Space  Mu- 
seum would  carry NASA mission events on W at designated locations in  the 
museum. 
Major  space  science  activities in   1986 would  include  the  Voyager  2  en- 
counter  i n  January w i th  Uranus; the culmination  of several scientific investi- 
gations of  Comet  Halley;  launch  in  May  from  the  Space  Shuttle of  Galileo 
toward Jupiter; and also in  May  launch from the Space Shuttle Challenger of 
the  European  Space  Agency’s  Ulysses  spacecraft  to  conduct  comparative 
studies  of  the  sun  and  its  heliosphere.  In  addition,  NASA  scheduled  for 
launch i n  late summer the Hubble Space Telescope,  the  largest telescope to 
be placed i n  earth orbit.  (NASA Release 85-159) 

November 2 9  NASA announced that  its National Space Technology Labora- 
tories,  working w i th  the  University of Colorado at  Boulder,  uncovered infor- 
mation  using  remote  sensing  techniques  suggesting a  civilization  existed 
before the  Incas  i n  subtropical Peruvian jungles. The  university’s anthropol- 
ogy department  requested NSTL collaboration on  the  investigation because 
of the  laboratories’  expertise in  satellite remote sensing and  image analysis. 
After remote sensing by satellites and aircraft permitted mapping and deter- 
mining priorities for  field  investigation sites,  Tom  Sever,  NASA  principal  in- 
vestigator,  and  Tom  Lennon,  an  archaeologist  and  cod irec tor   of  the 
university’s  Rio Abiseo  National  Park  project,  completed a five-day expedi- 
tion  into the jungles of  Peru’s  Rio Abiseo  National Park. 
Remote sensing had discovered Cerro Central,  a site  including more than 
350 buildings. The previous major point of  interest was  the ancient site Gran 
Pajaten, which  included only 30 buildings. 
“We  now know that Pajaten  i s  probably the smallest and least important of 
the sites,”  Sever explained.  “We  are fairly confident that we have approached 
the very edges of a new civilization,  and we believe that the farther  in  we go, 
the higher and more complicated the elevation and architecture and civiliza- 
tion w i l l  be.” 
Sever  added  that  the  investigation  represented  in   his  opinion  the  best 
example of  a  remote  sensing application  to  archaeology  and  perhaps  the 
only  known means  by  which  to  obtain  his  project‘s  objectives.  (NASA  Re- 
lease 85-160) 

During Nowmber: Gene Gilbert, a technician i n  Goddard Space Flight Cen- 
ter‘s  (GSFC) Laboratory for Oceans was  searching for a way  to measure rain- 
fall at sea  by using an o i l  rig,  Goddad News reported,  in  order to assist  in  the 
development  of  a  system  called  the  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission 

2 5 2  

Space  Science  and  Applications 

(TRMM). TRMM could take the form of a satellite or space station attachment 
operational  in   the  mid-1990s  to  improve  upon  rainfall  sensors  that  flew 
aboard  Nimbus satellites.  But developing better sensing capabilities first  re- 
quired  accurate ground  truth  measurements to  test  the  accuracy  of  remote 
observations. 
Over  the  years,  meteorologists had  developed  a  good  picture of  weather 
over  land  masses.  But  they  s t i l l   needed  to  know what  happened  over  the 
remaining two-thirds  of  earth. When  putting a collection bucket on  a  ship, 
Gilbert explained,  different  locations on deck  gave differing results depend- 
ing  on  whether  the  bucket  was  sheltered  from  the  wind.  In  addition,  the 
ship’s  movement  gave  angular  measurement of  the  rain,  not  a true  vertical 
one.  And a buoy was  not an  improvement.  “It  may  look  stationary,”  Gilbert 
said,  “but  it really  i s  not.”  Even  the  largest ones,  which were  50  feet  across, 
tossed  in  a storm,  splashing and spraying and negating results. 
“What  i s   needed,”  Gilbert  pointed  out,  “ i s   a  surface  that  i s   stationary, 
vibration  free,  and  splash-proof.  I think  o i l   platforms could  satisfy  a l l   those 
conditions.”  GSFC‘s  Microwave  Sensors  and  Data  Acquisition  Systems 
Branch in  July placed the first  rain gauge on  a o i l  producing platform  in the 
Gu l f  of Mexico off  Lafayette,  Louisiana.  “The  very  next month a  hurricane 
knocked out our  data  transmission antenna,”  Gilbert  recalled.  “But  we  re- 
paired the damage easily,  and we have been getting good data since then.” 
The  rain gauge was  a teeter-totter with a shot-glass  sized  cup at each end. 
The cups filled successively w i th  1/100th of an  inch of rain and then dropped 
the measure back  into the ocean.  Each count was  transmitted to the National 
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration’s  (NOAA) Geostationary  Opera- 
tional  Environmental Satellite  (GOES) and  then  back  to  GSFC  via  NOAA‘s 
data processing facility in  Suitland,  Maryland. 
“The  goal  i s  to demonstrate  that  using a  gauge on an  o i l   rig gives  us  our 
most accurate ocean  rainfall data to  date,”  Gilbert said.  “If  i t  does,  we  may 
expand to  include other o i l  rigs. Then we w i l l  finally have good ground truth 
data  for  measuring  rainfall  over  the  ocean  by  satellite,  at  least  for  those 
oceans that  include o i l  rigs.”  (G o d d a d  News,  Nov 85/ 2 )

SPACE  STATION PROGRAM 

January  17: The  Washington  Post  reported that W.  Germany  had  agreed  to 
contribute $900 m i l l ion  over  the next decade to participate in  an American- 
led  program  to  bu i ld  an  $8 b i l l ion   permanently  manned  space  station  for 
initial operations  in  1992,  the 500th anniversary of Columbus‘s  discovery of 
America.  The W.  Germans would negotiate detailed contracts over  the next 
two  years  to  ensure  a  fair  return  on  their  investment  and  access  to  space- 
based  technology,  as  U.S.  restrictions on  technology  transfer  (ostensibly to 
prevent  USSR  acquisition  of  sensitive  information,  the  W  Post  said)  had 
increasingly  irked  European  allies.  W.  German  and  Italian  companies 
planned  a  special  laboratory  module  that  would  plug  into  the  U.S.-built 
spacecraft’s  main structure for experiments in zero gravity and vacuum condi- 
tions. 
A  W.  German  ministerial  report  had  said  cooperation  embodied  in   the 
space  station  program  “should  be  welcomed  in  W.  Germany  not  just  for 
technical  and  economic  reasons,  but  for  political  ones,  as  a  transatlantic 
connecting  link.”  However,  the  venture  had  evoked  controversy,  as  some 
European scientists contended that  robots could conduct the work  planned 
for the space station, and others alleged that a  $750 m i l l ion  European invest- 
ment  in  1973 to underwrite Spacelab  had attained few  research  benefits. 
Heinz Riesenhuber, W.  German minister for  research and technology,  said 
that  Bonn  would  also  contribute  nearly  $500 m i l l ion   to  develop  a  more 
powerful  and  versatile Ariane  rocket  to  achieve  some  European  indepen- 
dence in  space travel by the 199Os,  although he admitted a major W.  German 
investment in  the French space shuttle project “Hermes”  was  impossible. ( W  
Post,  Jan 17/85,  A l )  

January 18: The  Washington Post reported that Britain would accept a Reagan 
administration  invitation to contribute an  expected $300 m i l l ion  to  bu i ld  a 
permanent space station scheduled for  launch in  1992,  making Britain along 
w i th  W.  Germany  [see Jan. 17J the first noncommunist industrialized nations 
to participate in  the space station program. Geoffrey Pattie,  British minister of 
state  for  industry  and  information technology  who  was  in  Washington  to 
consult w i th   lawmakers and Reagan  Administration officials about  scientific 
cooperation, technology transfer,  and telecommunications policies, said Brit- 
ain would announce the contribution  at the  European Space  Agency’s  (ESA) 
Rome meeting [see European Space Agency,  jan.  181. 
President Reagan had invited Australia, Canada, Japan, and the U.S.3  West- 
ern European allies to join  in  funding and building the modular space station 
and  expected  France,  Italy,  and  Japan to  announce  soon  their  intention  to 
participate.

Pattie said Britain wanted access to technologies to design and build space 
stations as  well  as  the  results  of  research  carried  out  in  space  laboratories; 
initial  space  station  plans  called  for  biological  and  physical  sciences  labs. 
Wh i le  France and Germany were  interested in  rocketry research,  Britain had 
focused i t s  space expenditures on  improving data transmission and expected 
the  space  station  to  enhance  these  technical  capabilities.  Pattie  d id   note, 
however,  that Britain feared the U.S.  would  impose export controls on  some 
of this technology and that technology transfer  questions required resolution 
during two years of space  station feasibility studies.  He emphasized the U.S. 
had  to  fashion  “sensible”  restrictions  “instead  of  saying  no  to  [exports  ofl 
everything, which i s  counterproductive to U.S.  as well as European interests.” 
( N U ,  Jan 18/85,  A l l  

February  7: In his “State  of the Union” address,  President Reagan commented 
on  funding  requested for  activities  in  space,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
“We  have  seen  the  success  of  the  Space  Shuttle.  Now  we  are  going  to 
develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free 
enterprise  because,  in  the  next decade,  Americans  and  our  friends  around 
the world w i l l  be l iv ing  and working together  in space. 
“In  the zero-gravity of  space,  we  could manufacture  in  30  days  lifesaving 
medicines  i t  would take  30  years  to make on earth.  We  can make crystals of 
exceptional  purity to  produce  supercomputers,  creating jobs,  technologies, 
and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible.”  (W  
Post,  Feb  7/85,  A161 

February  8: The  L ew i s  News reported that NASA  had completed conceptual 
designs  for  i t s   space  station and  that  industry  had  submitted  proposals for 
definition studies and preliminary designs  of various station components for 
which  NASA  expected  to  award  18-month contracts  in  April.  NASA  would 
award  contracts  in  April  1987 for  the  next  phase of  the  program-the 
final 
design, development,  launch,  and assembly of  the station. 
Contrary to most  large  NASA  projects,  for  which an  industrial prime con- 
tractor  coordinated  various  aspects  of  a  project,  NASA  would  m r s e e  the 
entire  space  station  program  because  the  station’s  operational  life  would 
extend me r  a  long and  indefinite period. Johnson Space Center U S 0  would 
manage  the  system  engineering and  integration  function;  Lewis  Research 
Center (LeRC) was  responsible for  the power system. 
The space station power system w a s  vital for two major reasons:  the quan- 
tity  of  electrical  power  available to  gm r n e d  station capabilities and,  since 
the  power system  required  large areas  of  solars c e l l s  or  mirrors,  the size of 
these  areas  affected  station  configuration  and  operation.  Plans  called  for 
initial power demands of 25 kw  for  housekeeping needs of a crew of six and 
50   kw   for  experiments  and  customer  applications.  Comparing t h i s   power

system  to  the  largest  previously  in  space-the  Skylab  manned-mission sys- 
tem,  which generated  16 kw-the  magnitude of the power station challenge 
became evident. 
LeRC  personnel would  consider  a  variety  of  power  system  technologies, 
making selections based on detailed studies of the tradeoffs among options. 
Studies would examine  how  the  options  influenced  the  performance,  risk, 
and cost of the power system  and space  station,  w i th  consideration given to 
station growth and satisfaction of later needs.  In addition,  LeRC had to design 
a system  that would be available on schedule,  function reliably for an  indefi- 
nite life w i th  only on-orbit maintenance, be user-friendly, and remain within 
cost  limits.  (LeRC News,  Feb  8/85,  2) 

kb rua ty  20:  Ne i l   Hutchinson,  Johnson Space  Center's  USC)  space  station 
program  manager,  at  a  U.S.  House  Science  and  Technology  space  science 
and  application subcommittee authorization  hearing,  said that  ferrying and 
assembling a space station would  require seven  Space  Shuttle flights over  a 
period of  nine  months  to  a  year,  Aerospace  Daily reported,  and  assembly 
would rely on automation and  robotics, not Space  Shuttle crew  extravehicu- 
lar activities. Assembly would begin with a beam of solar  panels and a 9 0 4 .  
truss  structure.  Space  Shuttle  orbiters  would  dock  with  the  space  station 
structure at different points to assemble the facility,  using the orbiter's  remote 
manipulator  system  (RMS)  arm  and  a  remote  arm  operated  on  the  space 
station. 
The  3rd  and 4th  Space  Shuttle flights would take  up habitation modules; 
the   5 th   f l igh t  would  ferry  two more  sets  o f   solar  pane ls   and  a   3rd  module, 
possibly for  logistics. Hutchinson said current planning called for permanent 
manning of the station after the 5th flight; the 6th flight would carry the 1 st  of 
two planned laboratories w i th  the baseline configuration producing 75 kw of 
power, which would be completed after the  7th flight. 
Phil Culbertson,  NASA  associate administrator,  said  a  new  program  plan 
envisioned a 21-month definition and preliminary design effort beginning in  
April  and  extending through January 1987,  which  reflected  the  lower  than 
anticipated  funding level of  $230 m i l l ion  for  space  station activities  in  the 
NASA's  FY  86 budget. O f  the $230 million,  $15 m i l l ion  was  for  utilization, 
$82  m i l l ion  for  advanced  development,  $52  m i l l ion  for  program manage 
mentlintegration,  $7 m i l l ion  for  operational  readiness,  and  $P4 m i l l ion  for 
systemdefinition contracts.  Defense Da i ly  noted that Culbertson said  NASA 
would have to "stretch"  to meet the $&billion  price of the space  station and 
that i t  would ask  i t s  contractors to "stretch  w i th  US." (ND, Feb 2W85,  1;  DID,

Office of Technology Assessment  (OTA) study that had asserted NASA's  plans 

2 5 7  

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

for a permanent space  station were  not scientifically,  economically,  or mili- 
tarily  justified,  Robert Melton,  assistant professor at  Pennsylvania State  Uni- 
versity,  wrote  that  the  study  missed  the  point  of  NASA's  current  efforts  to 
define better what  should go  into the  station before proceeding with actual 
design  and  construction.  He  wrote  that  NASA  had  entered  Phase  B,  the 
definition  study  of  the  project,  in  which  contractors  would  provide NASA 
w i th   thorough  analyses  of  exactly  what  missions would  be  carried  out  in  
what time schedule and w i th  descriptions of necessary equipment and tech- 
nology together w i th  a breakdown of costs. Such a detailed study was neces- 
sary  to  avoid  premature  overemphasis  on  design  and  to  avert  technical 
problems as  the program progressed. 
Melton argued  that  the  permanent space  station  was  a  logical next  step 
after  the  Space  Shuttle  program  and  could  serve  as  both a  laboratory and 
base  of  operations  for  scientific,  commercial,  and  security  purposes.  The 
space station could also serve as  a permanent base for repairing and routinely 
servicing satellites,  as  a depot  for  permanently, spacebased orbital  transfer 
vehicles  capable of  delivering  and  retrieving high-orbit  payloads,  and  as  a 
base for  building other  large structures that would remain  in  orbit. 
Melton noted that  the  benefits of  a permanent space  station would make 
the  $8  b i l l ion   expenditure  spread  over  several  years  seem  a  fairly  small 
amount,  especially  when  compared  to   other  items  in   the  federal  budget. 
However,  Melton acknowledged that the OTA  study proved NASA had to do a 
better  job  of  defining  its  space  station  goals  and  of  impressing  upon  the 
public the  importance of the project.  ( W  Times,  Mar 13/85,  2D) 

March  14:  NASA  announced  it had selected  six  industry teams  for  negotia- 
tions leading to 21-month fixed-price contracts for definition and preliminary 
design  (Phase B) of elements for  a permanently manned space  station.  Four 
NASA centers previously d id  this work. 
The  responsible centers and  the  industry teams  selected for  negotiations 
were: Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) w i th  Boeing Aerospace Co.,  Seat- 
tle,  and Martin  Marietta Aerospace,  Denver;  Goddard Space  Flight Center 
(GSFC) with RCA Astro Electronics,  Princeton, New Jersey, and General Elec- 
tric  Co.,  Space  Systems  Division,  Philadelphia;  and  Lewis  Research Center 
(LeRC) w i th  Rockwell Internatl.,  Rocketdyne Division,  Canoga Park,  Califor- 
nia,  and TRW  Federal Systems  Division,  Redondo Beach,  Calif.  In addition, 
NASA  would  negotiate  w i th   Lockheed  Missiles  &  Space  Co.,  Sunnyvale, 
California;  McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.,  Huntington  Beach, Califor- 
nia;  and  Rockwell  Internatl.,  Space  Station  Systems  Division,  Downey Cali- 
fornia,  the  proposers for  work  to  be  performed  under  the  management of 
Johnson Space Center USC).  Negotiators would  present a report to the NASA 
Administrator who  would then award one or more contracts. 
Although  negotiations would determine values of  the  contracts,  the  Sep 
tember  14,  1984,  Request for  Proposal (RFP)  indicated that  the approximate 

258  

Space  Station  Program 

value  of  contracts could  be  $24  m i l l ion  a t  MSFC,  $27   m i l l ion  at  JSC,  $10 
m i l l ion  at CSFC,  and $6 m i l l ion  at  LeRC. 
In addition to  Phase B work,  NASA  required the contractors to study  how 
those elements of the space station would change depending on whether  the 
station was  man-tended rather than permanently manned and to pay particu- 
lar  attention  to  the  recommendations of  the  NASA  advanced  technology 
advisory  committee  that  was  identifying automation  and  robotic  technolo- 
gies  that could be used in  the space  station. 
Following completion of  the  contracts,  NASA  planned to move  into final 
design and development (Phase C/D) of the space station. 
A major objective of the space station program was  to involve international 
partners as  builders,  users,  and operators of the space  station. The European 
Space  Agency  (ESA),  Canada,  and Japan had  indicated interest in  participat- 
ing. They would provide their own funding and award definition and prelimi- 
nary design contracts  in  coordination w i th   NASA  activities.  NASA,  through 
JSC management,  would  retain responsibility for  overall  program definition 
and for  systems engineering and  integration throughout the program. (NASA 
Release 85-38) 

March 20: Ames  Research  Center  (ARC) announced  that  Dr.  David  Black 
would become chief scientist for  the office of  space  station at  NASA  Head- 
quarters,  leaving a  position  he  held as  research  scientist  in  the  theoretical 
studies branch at ARC  since  1972. 
In his new job,  Black would ensure  that  the space  station would accom- 
odate the needs of the scientists who would use  it, advising Phillip Culbert- 
son,  associate administrator for  space  station,  about steps  to make the space 
station  an  accessible  research  facility  for  scientists  from  many  disciplines. 
Black‘s  appointment  coincided  w i th   selection  of  contractors  who  would 
spend  21  months working out details of space station design  [see Mar.  141. 
Since other  countries  intended to  cooperate w i th   NASA  in  the space  sta- 
t ion  project,  Black would work w i th  the agencies representing the interests of 
European  and  Japanese  scientists  to  coordinate  their  plans  w i th   those  of 
NASA. 
Black had been studying scientists’ needs for  the space  station since April 
1984,  when  he  had  joined  the  task  force  on  scientific  uses  of  the  space 
station. That committee brought together 30  scientists from various universi- 
ties  and  represented the disciplines that were  interested in  using the  space 
station.  Also,  Black was  serving on  a  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study 
group called “space  sciences,  1995-2015,”  which was  attempting to  identify 
the  future  directions  for  research  in   the  space  sciences,  thus  identifying 
which  technologies would be  needed to  support future  research.  (ARC Re- 
lease 85-14)

March 2 7:  Aerospace  Da i ly  reported that  NASA  would  submit  to  Congress 
that week  the space station automation and  robotics study,  "Advancing Aut@ 
mation and Robotics Technology for the Space  Station and for the U.S.  Econ- 
omy:  which appropriations legislation enacted in  1984 had directed NASA to 
prepare  by  April  1.  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  approved  the  report 
compiled by  the advanced  technology advisory committee and  augmented 
by  the  work  of  an  automation  and  robotics  panel,  SRI  International,  and 
aerospace contractors. 
The  report  consisted of  two  volumes,  an  executive  overview,  which  out- 
lined major  findings  and  contained  proposed goals for  automation  and  r e  
botics  applications  in   relation  to  the  initial  space  station,  and  a  technical 
report, which outlined the potential of automation and robotics technologies 
and would serve a major focus of definition and preliminary design (Phase B) 
space  station contractor efforts. 
Under  an  agreement with  the  Senate  Appropriations Committee  the  pre- 
vious  April,  NASA  had  funded  and  managed  several  studies  in  automation 
and robotics that had included industry case studies of advanced automation 
and robotics. From these the committee determined what should be incorpo- 
rated  in  space  station  initial  operational  capability  and  what  the  design 
should be so  that these  elements could be  incorporated at a  later date. 
The  firms  and  functional  areas  studied were:  General  Electric Co.,  space 
manufacturing concepts;  TRW,  satellite  servicing;  Hughes,  subsystem  and 
mission  ground  support;  Boeing,  madmachine  interface;  and  Martin Ma- 
rietta, automation technology for  assembly of the facility. 
Although  NASA believed a commitment to the efforts outlined in  the com- 
mittee report would increase space station efficiency and result in  significant 
cost savings,  a breakdown of actual costs would not be available until NASA 
contractors completed the overall plan for  implementation of the automation 
and  robotics systems  in  initial space  station studies. 
The  report did recommend that automation and robotics be a key element 
of  the  basis  space  station  program  and  that  the  initial  space  station design 
take  into account  evolution and  growth  in   robotics.  Examples of  proposed 
goals  for  automation  and  robotics applications for  the  initial  space  station 
included  a  mobile remote manipulator with  collision  avoidance capability 
and dexterous manipulator  systems  that could  inspect and exchange orbital 
replaceable units.  (MD, Mar 21/85,  1 )  

March 22:The  NASA exhibit entitled "Living,  Learning, Working in  Space"  at 
the  36th  Paris Air  Show,  May  30  through June 9  in  Le  Bourget, would  high- 
light  full-scale elements  of  a space  station,  including mockups  of  working

scope and Galileo. Exhibits would also  showcase NASA’s latest aeronautical 
research.  (NASA Release 8 5 - 4 1 )  

March  22:  The  Canadian  government  decided  to  jo in   the  U.S.  and  other 
allies  in  producing an  orbiting space  station,  agreeing in  principle to spend 
up to $600 m i l l ion  over  the next  10  years,  the  Washington Times reported. 
U.S. space officials had encouraged Canada for more than a year to jo in  the 
U.S.-led  project, which already  had the  participation of the European Space 
Agency  (ESA) and japan,  together expected to spend about $4 billion. 
Canada‘s  science minister Tom  Siddon said  that  Canada’s  involvement  in  
the  space  station could produce economic benefits valued  at  more than  $2 
b i l l ion  by  the year  2000.  ( W  Times, Mar 22/85,  5A) 

March 29: Tom  Rogers,  project director of  the Congressional Office of Tech- 
nology Assessment‘s  (OTA) space  station study,  said  in  testimony before the 
U.S.  House space subcommittee that OTA  in  i t s  controversial November 1984 
space  station  report  [see  Space  Station  Program,  Mar.  131  never  meant  to 
oppose development of a space  station but only to suggest  that  i t s  elements 
might be altered for more adequate attainment of space goals,  Defense Daily 
reported. 
“I want to make  i t  clear that OTA  remains convinced that there  i s  a strong 
rationale for some  long-term habitable infrastructure in  a  low earth o rb i t .  . . 
In other  words,  OTA  i s  very  positive about  the  principle  behind the  Presi- 
dent‘s  call  for  a  ’space  station‘  and  Congress’s  decision  to  fund  a  ‘space 
station’  line  item  in   NASA’s budget,”  Rogers  said.  However,  he  pointed out 
that OTA’s  concerns about the space  station centered on  i t s  cost and the fact 
that  there was  no proper  assessment  of  long-range U.S.  space  goals,  which 
made  it infeasible to determine what elements should make up the station. 
“To  be  more  certain  that  the  facilities  actually  constructed  are  the  ones 
most likely to lead to optimum space development, they must be Constructed 
w i th   an  eye  to  the  nation’s  long-range civilian  space  goals  and  objectives,” 
Rogers  testified.  “Unfortunately,  the only space  goals discussed  to  date are 
those formulated by  the space  community itself;  there has  been  little broad- 
based discussion and agreement on  a set of  long-range goals for  the  United 
States.”  He  recommended particularly that,  in  parallel with  NASA’s  Phase  B 
station  studies,  “Congress  seek  independent  studies  suggesting  goals  and 
specific  objectives  for  the  nation’s  future  activities  in  space,  studies  con- 
ducted primarily by people outside the space community.” 
Rogers  then  outlined  OTA’s  alternatives  for  the  space  station  program. 
These  included  using  the  $3   b i l l ion   in   foreign  funding  as  part  of  the  $8  
b i l l ion  station  cost,  not as  an  addition;  using private  investment  to  pay  for 
elements  of  the  station;  increasing use  of  the  human-tended approach  and 

261 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

automatiodrobotics  to  reduce  station  costs;  examining  alternative  station 
designs  costing  less  than  “the  canonical $8  billion”;  developing the  orbital 
maneuvering vehicle and any  reusable orbital transfer  vehicle “in  close con- 
cert  w i th   those  in   the  private  sector  who  look  forward  to  using  them  to 
provide satellite  support  services,”  thus  reducing NASA’s  costs;  and  having 
contractors work  to  performance specifications  rather than  to detailed engi- 
neering specifications for other than  ‘#cutting edge”  technologies. ( L ID ,  Mar 
29/85,  162) 

Ap r i l   I :   NASA  announced  i t   had  submitted  to  the  U.S.  Congress  today  a 
report  by  i ts   Advanced  Technology  Advisory  Committee  (ATAC)  that  said 
automatidn and  robotics would be significant elements of  the  NASA  Space 
Station program and  that  the  initial Space  Station design should accomme 
date evolution and growth in  these technologies. 
The  report,  required  under  Public  Law  98-371  that  appropriated  FY  85 
NASA funds,  noted that a l l  Space Station elements,  including the core station 
and  associated  unmanned  platforms,  vehicles,  and  ground  facilities  were 
candidates  for  the  technologies,  necessitating accelerated  R&D  in  automa- 
tion  and  robotics.  The  Automation  and  Robotics Panel,  which  assisted  the 
Advisory  Committee  in  a  six-month  study  led by  the California Space  Insti- 
tute,  said that a desired level of funding for automation and robotics research 
would be  13%  of the total Space  Station costs;  a minimum acceptable  level 
was  7%.  An  augmented  research  program,  the  report said,  would  result  in  
improved productivity from  the  initial station and much greater  productivity 
from  later versions of the Space Station. 
The  report also  said successful  incorporation of automation and  robotics 
into the Space Station program could lead to deployment of a new generation 
of flexible and adaptable space  systems,  which could  provide the  U.S.  w i th  
new methods of generating and exploiting space  knowledge in  commercial 
activities and thus preserving U.S.  leadership in  space and industrial systems. 
Other report recommendations included: development of criteria for  incor- 
porating automation and  robotics technology  in  the  Space  Station;  verifica- 
t ion  of  automated equipment  performance,  including terrestrial  and  space 
demonstration to validate  technology for  Space  Station  use;  use  of  automa- 
tion techniques to enhance NASA’s  management capability; establishment of 
measurements  to  verify  inclusion of  automation and  robotics  in  the  Space 
Station; development of a program for technology transfer  to US. industries; 
and  design  of  satellites and  payloads accessible from  the  Space  Station  to 
accommodate service and  repair by  robots.  NASA  would  incorporate report 
recommendations  into  the  Phase  B  definition  and  preliminary design  con- 
tracts [see Mar.  141 i t  was  negotiating w i th   industry teams. 
The Advisory Committee,  made up of personnel from NASA  Headquarters 
and  centers,  would continue  to  monitor  automation and  robotics develop 
ments and would report semi-annually to Congress.  (NASA Release 8 5 - 4 6 )

Space  Station  Program 

April  7 :   NASA overcame the final obstacle to achieving four-way  international 
cooperation (the U.S.,  Europe, Japan, and Canada) on the U.S. manned space 
station when NASA and The European Space Agency (ESA) compromised in  a 
memorandum of  understanding (MOU) on wording  in  three areas:  technol- 
ogy  transfer,  nondiscriminatory access  for  European  users  to  the Space  Sta- 
tion,  and  station  elements  that  wou ld   be  candidates  for  European 
participation, Aviation Week  reported. NASA Administrator James Beggs and 
ESA  Director General  Reimer  Lust  resolved  a t   an  early  March meeting the 
differences over wording concerning technology transfer and  European user 
access.  A  compromise  formulated  by  W.  Germany  and  approved  in   late 
March by  ESA  members  resolved  the  issue of which  components would  be 
open to European development. 
”The  final step for Europe i s  approval of the MOU  by  ESA’s  council, which 
has  i t s  next meeting at the end of April,” Michel Bignier,  ESA  director of space 
transportation systems, said.  “I don’t  foresee any difficulties there because the 
ESA  member delegates have been informed of the negotiations and are aware 
of the final wording.” 
Bignier went on to say  NASA accepted  “certain small nuances” concerning 
nondiscriminatory access for  Europe to the station and that both sides made 
compromises on  the  issue of which  elements would  be  included for  Euro- 
pean  cooperation. And  he added  that  ESA  “basically  accepted  NASAs  pro- 
posed text” on technology transfer for the Phase B memorandum but said the 
wording would  not apply to  follow-on agreements covering hardware devel- 
opment. “We  felt this was  not as critical an  issue in  Phase B as  it w i l l  be in  the 
later Phase C/D,”  Bignier explained. 
Philip Culbertson, NASA associate administrator for the Space Station, said 
international participation in  the station was essential to overall US. planning 
for  the  facility.  “The  investment of  our  potential partners  from  around  the 
world  w i l l   give the  station a significantly greater  capability than we  in  the 
US. could provide alone,”  Culbertson said.  “We  believe we w i l l  end up  with 
a capable Space Station for a l l  of us  to use.”  (AvWk, Apr  1/85,  16) 

April  8  I. V.  Franklin,  manager  of  future  projects at  British Aerospace  Dy- 
namics Group’s  Space and Communications Division,  said  at a  recent inter- 
national  space  meeting  in   Italy  that  British  Aerospace  had  completed 
preliminary definition  of  a  50-  by  60-foot-long,  24,250-lb.  unmanned plat- 
form  that  Europe could  develop as  part of  i t s  Columbus space  station  pro- 
gram,  Aviation  Week  reported. The  platform would  use  a  long  beam  as  a 
common backbone that would contain docking ports for  standardized plug- 
i n  payload and resources modules. A single Space  Shuttle flight would carry 
the  basic platform  into  orbit,  and  the  company envisioned  that  astronauts 
could assemble  it in  s i x   hours of extravehicular activity. 
Franklin  said  the  company  would  submit  the  platform  proposal  to  the 
European Space Agency  as one of the work  packages  in  Europe’s Columbus 

263 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

program.  “The  space  platform  i s  of  particular  interest to  Europe,  following 
President Reagan’s  invitation for  international participation in  the space sta- 
tion  program,”  Franklin continued,  “because  i t  represents an  element with 
relatively few  direct interfaces to the rest of the program. Although  it i s  not a 
’core’  component,  i t  would be an  important component of  the space  station 
complex  and  [a component]  in  which there would  be substantial  European 
user  interest.  The  platform  provides  a  point  for  reducing  space  operation 
costs  at  a price that Europe could afford.” 
In  addition  to  evaluating the  platform  in   low  earth  orbit  in  conjunction 
w i th   the  U.S.  manned Space  Station,  British Aerospace also  considered the 
platform  in  a  polar,  sun  synchronous  orbit.  The  polar-orbiting platform of- 
fered  possibilities  for  earth  observation and  earth  resources  missions.  U.S. 
officials  had  encouraged  European  development  of  the  polar  platform  to 
supplement low earth orbit activities performed on board the manned Space 
Station and  its associated free-flying elements. 
“The  polar platform does  not need to work w i th  a manned space station- 
and indeed,  i t  cannot until a station facility i s  available in  polar orbit:’  Frank- 
l in   said.  ”The  platform  can  be  man-tended  by  a  polar  orbiting  shuttle, 
although the shuttle’s  altitude i s  well below that of the platform.” 
This problem could be Overcome  by using the platform’s  on-board propul- 
sion  to  deorbit  and  dock  with  the  Space  Shuttle for  payload  replacement, 
repair,  and maintenance and then  return to the operational altitude. 
Franklin concluded that the concept of a polar space platform was  justified 
by the l e d  of user  interest in  both Europe and the U.S.  and by the  relatively 
favorable economics when  compared  with  other  systems.  “The  polar  plat- 
form does  not require use of a manned space  station,  and  it therefore i s  not 
paced by development of the space station,”  he noted. (AvWk, Apr  8 /85 ,60)  

April  12:  Reiichi Takeuchi,  chief of Japan’s  science and  technology agency, 
said Japan had decided to take part in  the U.S.  space  station beginning with 
the preliminary design stage,  FBIS,  KYODO in  English reported. He said the 
Japanese would sign with  NASA Administrator James Beggs a memorandum 
on  the  decision  when  Beggs  visited  Tokyo  early  in   May.  The  agreement 
would cover  two years  of work,  at which time,  Takeuchi said,  the two coun- 
tries would probably sign  a similar document for  later stages of the project. 
Takeuchi noted he expected the U.S.  would ask Japan to design the  labora- 
tory  room  of  the  Space  Station,  scheduled  for  operation  in   1992.  He esti- 
mated the cost a t  200  to 300 b i l l ion  yen.  Under the memorandum,  the U.S. 
would provide Japan w i th   technical  information on  how  the  Space  Station 
would be used.  (FBIS,  KYODO  in  English,  Apr  12/85)

Space  Center  USC)  would  manage  the  21-month  contracts,  which  had  an 
estimated  value  of  $27   m i l l ion   each.  NASA  previously  announced  other 
industry teams selected for negotiations for definition and preliminary design 
of other Space Station elements [see   March  141. 
In  addition  to  work  on  the  Space  Station  structural  framework,  the  JSC 
contracts would cover  interface between the Space Station and Space Shuttle; 
mechanisms such  as  the  remote manipulator systems;  attitude and  thermal 
control; communications and data management systems;  plans for equipping 
a  module w i th   sleeping  quarters,  wardroom,  and  galley;  and  plans  for  ex- 
travehicular activity. (NASA Release 85-56) 

A p r i l   7 6  NASA announced that its Administrator, James Beggs,  and Canadian 
Minister of Science and Technology, The Honorable Tom  Sidden,  signed on 
April  16 a memorandum of understanding to conduct a cooperative program 
for  detailed  definition  and  preliminary design  (Phase  6) of  a  permanently 
manned  Space  Station.  Under  the memorandum,  the countries for  the  next 
two years would conduct parallel Phase B studies and exchange  information 
on their work.  Canada, which had approved $ 8 . 8  m i l l ion  for  the first year  of 
Phase 6, would study a space construction and servicing system,  a solar array 
for  a platform o r   as a potential auxiliary power source for  the Space  Station, 
and a remote sensing facility. 
At the  signing,  Administrator  Beggs  said that  ”we  are  pleased Canada has 
become an  international partner in  [this]  phase of the Space  Station’s  devel- 
opment. We  look forward to working w i th  our friends in  Canada,  Europe, and 
japan  in  building a firm foundation for future cooperation on a permanently 
manned Space  Station to serve  the needs of the free world in  developing the 
peaceful uses of  space well  into the next century.” 
Separate agreements would cover cooperatiw efforts during development, 
operation,  and use  phases of the Space Station. (NASA Release 85-58) 

May 5 The text of a joint declaration made public today at the end of a seven- 
nation economic conference in  Bonn, West Germany, contained a statement

European space plan and  i t s  objectives.”  ( N M ,  May  5/85,  A16) 

May  9: NASA announced that NASA Administrator James Beggs and Japanese 
Minister of  State  for  Science and Technology,  Reiichi Takeuchi,  signed that 
day  in  Tokyo  a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) for  the conduct of a 
cooperative program concerning detailed definition and  preliminary design 
(Phase B) of a  permanently manned Space  Station. 
Under the MOU,  the  U.S.  and Japan would conduct and  coordinate m r  
the next two years  parallel Phase B studies  and exchange  information. Japan 
would study an experimental module that had pressurized workspace and an 
exposed workdeck.  Cooperation during the space station’s  development, o p  
erations,  and use  phases would require separate agreements. 
In a speech that day to the Federation of Japanese Economic Organizations, 
Beggs  outlined  initial  uses  of  the  space  station  and  reported  on  specific 
projects undertaken by other countries participating in  space station develop 
ment.  He  then  noted,  “.  . .  in   negotiating with  our  potential  partners, 
NASA  has emphasized that we view the space station as a potential long-term 
international partnership-one that  should  last  for  decades.  Any  nation that 
joins w i th  us  in  such a full partnership must be prepared to make significant 
investments in  the station,  and also be prepared to help operate and use  it. 
“We  expect our  partners to continue to shoulder responsibility for owning 
and  maintaining their  portions of  the  facility,  while continuing to  enjoy  the 
overall  benefits  our  jo in t   efforts  w i l l   make  possible.  And  we  expect  their 
contributions to  remain a permanent part of the station’s  infrastructure.” 
Beggs  then  added,  “To  cement  our  long-term  relationships,  the  United 
States w i l l   provide partners with assurance on  equitable access  to all of  the 
space station’s  facilities. We  also w i l l  protect their technology and intellectual 
property  and  ensure  them  suitable  roles  in   the  station’s  management  and 
operation.”  (NASA  Release 85-71,  NASA  Note To  Editors,  May  8/85) 

May  19:  NASA  announced  i t s   Administrator  James Beggs  and  the  Director 
General of the  European Space  Agency  (ESA)  would sign  June 3  at  the  ESA  
pavillion at  the Paris Air Show  a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) for 
the conduct of a cooperative program for detailed definition and preliminary 
design  (Phase B) of a  permanently manned  space  station  [see Space  Station 
Program,  Apr.  11. 
The cost of the Phase B studies carried out by European industry under ESA 
management,  together  w i th   the  corresponding  technology  program, 
amounted to 80 m i l l ion  accounting units or $64 m i l l ion  at the current rate of 
exchange.  Cooperation  during the  space  station’s  development,  operations, 
and  use  phases  required separate agreements.  (NASA Release 85-78)

Space Station  Program 

July 72  : Marshall Space Flight Center awarded a $139,000 follow-on contract 
to Martin Marietta Corp.  to study a system  for  reclaiming unused  propellant 
from Space Shuttle external fuel tanks and transferring i t  to an orbiting space 
station, Aerospace Daily reported. Martin Marietta Corp's  New Orleans,  Lou- 
isiana,  manufacturing facility  would  perform  the  work  on  the  preliminary 
design study.  The  contract  followed one  let in  February 1984 and valued at 
$250,000 to examine the basic "propellant  scavenging" concept. 
The system  under study would consist of two to four  propellant collecting 
or  scavenging tanks  in  an  aft  cargo  carrier  affixed  to  the  rear  of  the  Space 
Shuttle  external  tank.  After  Space  Shuttle  launch  and  cutoff  of  the  main 
engines,  residual  l iqu id  oxygen  and  liquid  hydrogen would drain  from  the 
external tank  into the collection tanks  aided by a thrust system  designed for 
zero-gravity conditions. Once filled w i th  fuel,  the scavenging tank assembly 
would  separate  from  the  aft  cargo  carrier  as  a  self-contained,  remote-con- 
trolled vehicle w i th   i t s  own  propulsion system. 
After  the vehicle moved into position beside the space station,  technicians 
aboard  the  station  would  send  an  orbital  maneuvering vehicle  (OMV) to 
bring it to the space station fuel depot for transfer of the reclaimed propellant 
to  permanent tanks.  When out of fuel,  the scavenger vehicle would return to 
earth  in  the Space Shuttle cargo bay  for  reuse on  later missions. 
The  proposed system would be capable of reclaiming and  transporting up 
to   25,000  Ib.  of  propellant  per  mission,  depending  on  the  Space  Shuttle 
payload.  Unused  fuel  on  Space  Shuttle  missions  to  date  had  ranged  from 
9,500 to  28,300 Ib.  of  the  total  1.6  m i l l ion   Ib. of  propellant  carried  by  the 
external fuel  tank  on  each  flight.  I t  was  currently estimated that  the  space 
station would  require some  250,000  Ib. of  l iqu id  hydrogen and  l iqu id  oxy- 
gen  propellants each year. 
Martin Marietta said the proposed system would result in  reduced costs for 
transporting the cryogenic fuels to the space station;  the company estimated 
the  system  could  provide  propellants a t   an  average  cost  of  approximately 
$350 per  Ib.  NASA  had  studied other  methods of  scavenging fuel  from  the 
Space Shuttle external tank but found them to have a higher cost per  Ib. or to 
provide fewer opportunities for transporting the cryogenic fuels to the station.

During July: Yvonne Clearwater,  in  an article in  Psychology T i a y ,  described 
the  work  of  the  Space  Human  Factors  team,  an  interdisciplinary  team  of 
which she was a member, to determine what could make the proposed space 
station  a  congenial  habitat  for  l iv ing  and  performing  highly  sophisticated 
work.  The  team-representing  psychology,  architecture,  and  engineering- 
was  defining what  "habitability"  meant  in   space  by  looking at  the  critical 
relationships among  environment,  psychological  well-being,  and  perform- 
ance. 

267  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Clearwater  said  the  team  would  begin  by  developing  architectural  and 
interiordesign guidelines  based  on  behavioral  research.  NASA  contractors 
and  development  engineers  at  Johnson Space  Center  would  then  use  the 
guidelines i n  designing and building the space  station. 
The  team  would  then  turn  to  examining social  and  psychological  issues 
such as  crew selection, training,  and support; organization and management; 
and  operations  planning.  Although  recommendations would  focus  on  the 
physical and  social-psychological environments  separately,  the  team had to 
consider all the factors  together  i n  the planning process,  because they  inter- 
acted  in  the  real world,  whether  on earth or  in  space. 
In contrast to the  Soviets,  who  placed a high priority on  the mental well- 
being of  their  space  crews,  NASA  originally  had  focused  on  technological 
engineering rather than behavioral science.  In addition,  the early astronauts 
had little interest in  psychological support or intervention;  reportedly the first 
seven  U.S.  astronauts announced they would not tolerate psychologists. 
Clearwater pointed out,  however,  that NASA had grown more sophisticated 
and  more  sensitive  to   the  fact  that  body-mindenvironment  interactions  af- 
fected  the  health  and  performance of  people.  The  formation  of  the  Space 
Human  Factors  Office  at  Ames  Research  Center  reflected  NASA's  commit- 
ment to  psychological as  well as  physical health of space workers. 
The challenge was to  troubleshoot the proposed space station systems and 
settings wh i le  they were still being developed conceptually by,  first,  identify- 
ing  the environmental  conditions  likely  to  be significant stressors;  second, 
defining  the  kinds  of  psychological,  emotional,  and  behavioral  problems 
these could produce;  and finally,  showing how such  problems might  affect 
work  performance. 
Clearwater concluded that by defining and meeting human needs  in  space 
environments,  it might be possible to create more supportive places for  living 
and working on earth.  (Psychology Tiday, July 85,  34) 

October 2 5  NASA  selected the dual keel  reference configuration,  a modifi- 
cation  of  the  power tower  concept,  for  the  proposed permanently  manned 
space  station,  the  Spaceport  News  reported.  It  was  called  the  dual  keel 
because of tw in  vertical booms that would provide the framework  for attach- 
ment of other structures. The concept's  primary attributes were that  i t  would 
provide  better  customer  accommodations  and  servicing,  increased  attach- 
ment area,  and a more versatile design  for  growth  based on  future  requ ire  
ments and changing station roles. 
Another  change  in space  station  planning  was  placement of  the  pressur- 
ized modules near  the  station's  center  of  gravity  to  increase the  amount of 
space available for experiments,  such as  crystal growth,  that needed a micro- 
gravity environment. 
NASA selected the dual keel configuration from a variety of layouts devised 
by  teams  of  contractors  working  on  tweyear  space  station  definition  and

preliminary studies.  Overall space station shape and module placement were 
just  two of  the  many  significant  technical  decisions  program  officials  had 
made since the space station definition period began in  April  1985. 
NASA would conduct over  the next three to five months a series of reviews 
to  narrow  design  choices  so  that  it could  select  by  early  1986  a  baseline 
structure for  the proposed space  station. Contractor teams  would spend  the 
second  half  of  the  study  phase  doing  space  station  subsystem  preliminary 
designs,  leading  to  start  in   mid-1987  of  the  planned  development  phase. 
(Spaceport News, Oct 25/85,  2) 

October 25: NASA  earmarked about $3.2  m i l l ion  in  FY  86  funding for  con- 
tinuing work  on  the proposed space  station at  Kennedy Space  Center  (KSC) 
to  define  processing  requirements,  evaluate  maintenance and  resupply ac- 
tivities,  and assess facility needs,  the Spaceport News reported. The funding, 
an  increase over  the previous year,  would pay for studies to further  the Phase 
B definition and preliminary design effort expected to continue through early 
1987.  NASA  planned for  the  early  1990s the  first  launch  of  a space  station 
element. 
KSC  studies  were  intended  to  identify  ground  processing  options  and 
launch preparation  concepts.  In addition,  KSC  contractors were  evaluating 
what facilities were needed for processing the station elements and payloads. 
KSC  was  also  studying  how  NASA  should  approach  the  ongoing mainte- 
nance and resupply activities that would support continuous on-orbit opera- 
tions. 
KSC space  station activity  in  FY 86 was  expected to require the equivalent 
of about  180 NASA and contractor workers.  (Spaceport News, Oct 25/85,  2) 

November  7 7 :   European Space  Agency  (ESA),  Japanese, and  Canadian  offi- 
cials the previous week  expressed concern about NASA's  expectations of how 
the costs  of operating the  proposed space  station should  be shared,  as  fears 
increased that  the  US. Congress or  the Office of  Management and  Budget 
might  slip  the  planned  1993  operational  date  for  the  $10  to  $13  b i l l ion  
facility, Aviation Week  reported. The officials were meeting w i th  NASA  man- 
agers  to  lay  the groundwork  for  critical space  station decisions due  by  De- 
cember that would determine what  type of contribution they would make to 
the basic $8  b i l l ion  U.S.  investment. 
The  international space  officials were  unanimous  in   their  view  that  the 
non-U.S.  contribution to  the  station's  operational  costs  should  be  largely 
amortized  through  open  access  and  use  of  their  respective portions of  the 
through funding transferred to the U.S.  As  the discussions 
station system-not 
progressed, the  possibility of  a space  station schedule delay  to  help cut  the 
U.S.  budget deficit in  FY 87 became a growing factor.

Sen.  Slade Gorton (R-Wash.),  chairman of  the Senate  science subcommit- 
tee,  and Rep.  Don Fuqua (D-Fla.),  chairman of the House Science and Tech- 
nology  Committee,  both  influential  space  supporters,  were  cautioning  that 
congressional  action  on  the  FY  87   NASA  budget  could  trim  space  station 
funding and delay the  project's  1993  planned operational date by a year  or 
more. 
Fuqua  told  a  meeting of  the  Washington  Space  Business  Roundtable,  a 
group formed to  foster space commercialization, that a slip now, while unde- 
sirable and  likely to drive  up  costs  later,  could be absorbed by  the program 
more easily than one  later when the hardware phase was  underway. (AvWk, 
Nov  11/85,  18) 

November  7 5 :   NASA's  Lewis  Research  Center  (LeRC)  announced  it  had 
awarded a total of  $8.7  m i l l ion   in  contracts to Sundstrand Corp.,  Grurnrnan 
Aerospace  Corp.,  Boeing Aerospace  Co.,  and  Harris  Corp.  for  advanced 
development contracts for definition and preliminary design (Phase B) of the 
power system for the proposed permanently manned space  station. 
A major technical  issue in  Phase B was determination of whether photovol- 
taic  arrays  or  a  solar  dynamic  (heat  engine)  system  should  supply  solar- 
generated power for the space station. Photovoltaic arrays were the accepted 
system for electricity  production  in  manned and unmanned space missions. 
However,  the  space  station's  electrical power  requirements were  ten  times 
greater  than  any  mission  flown  to date and would  necessitate arrays  of  a p  
proximately one-half acre for the  initial station. Therefore,  there was  interest 
i n  solar dynamic  systems  because of their higher overall efficiency and  rela- 
tively smaller size. 
In  a  solar  dynamic  system,  an  alternator  driven  by  a  turbine  in   a  heat 
engine  cycle  produces  electricity.  Focusing the  sun's  rays  by  means  of  a 
concentrating mirror into a heat  receiver heats the engine gas  or  liquid. The 
system  operates  as  a  closedcycle  heat  engine,  and  a  radiator  cools  the 
working f lu id  and  rejects waste  heat into space. 
Su ndstrand Corp.,  under  i t s  $1,010,3 03 cost-pl us-fi xed-fee contract,  wou Id 
study  the  magnitude of  possible chemical  and  thermal  degradation  in  the 
working fluid of an organic rankine cycle engine.  Under i t s  $1,010,000 cost- 
reimbursement  contract,  Grumman would  study  solar  dynamic  waste  heat 
radiator  technology.  Boeing Aerospace  Co.,  under  i t s   $3,117,059  cost-plus- 
fixed-fee contract, would study the heat receiver/storage unit and identify and 
recommend testing required for concept verification. And  Harris Corp.,  un- 
der  i t s  $3,619,870 cost-sharing contract,  would generate conceptual designs 
for the solar dynamic dish concentrator, as  well as  identify and test materials, 
identify and  recommend testing  required  for  concept verification,  perform 
engineering designs, fabricate the concentrator, and conduct verification and 
testing.  (LeRC Release 85-77)

February  21:  NASA  and  the  Council  of  Chief  State  School  Officers  an- 
nounced that  10,690 teachers applied for a Space Shuttle flight. The Council 
was  responsible  for  application  and  screening  processes;  NASA  would 
choose the teacher to go  into space. 
The  Council’s  review  panel  would  screen  all  applications  to  eliminate 
those  not  meeting  basic  requirements and  forward  the  remaining applica- 
tions to statereview panels to select two teachers per state by May 1,  1985. A 
national  panel  would  then  review  applications  of  the  approximately  118 
nominees  (two per  state  plus  the  District of  Columbia,  Puerto Rico,  Virgin 
Islands,  territories and  trusts,  and  Department of  Defense and  independent 
schools)  to  recommend  10  semifinalists  to  NASA’s  spaceflight  participant 
evaluation committee. 
All  nominees would  attend a teacher-workshop and  orientation  program 
from June 24  to  28,  1985,  in  Washington to learn of current developments in 
the aeronautics and spaceeducation program and to undergo further evalua- 
tion and screening;  10 semifinalists would report to JSC for thorough medical 
examinations,  indep th  briefings,  and  interviews by  NASA’s  evaluation com- 
mittee. 
NASA’s  administrator and the evaluation committee would  select a primary 
and  a  backup candidate  to  undergo  training.  NASA  had  not  decided on a 
specific flight opportunity,  but was  aiming to  fly  the teacher on a mission in  
late  1985. 
California  had  the  greatest  number  of  applications,  926.  (NASA  Release

May 3:  NASA  announced  that  the  Council  of  Chief  State  School  Officers 
(CCSSO) had that day  named  114  elementary and secondary school teacher 
nominees  in   the  NASA  Teacher  in   Space  Project.  Selection  followed  the 
review of  more than  10,000 applications [see  Space Transportation System/ 
Civilian  in Space Program,  Feb.  21 1. 
Dr.  William  Pierce,  CCSSO  executive director,  said  after  announcing the 
names that “It  i s  a great pleasure for the Council to be involved in  this historic 
project. The calibre of the applications from teachers throughout the country 
has been truly  impressive. If their applications are any  indication, we can be 
proud of the quality  of teaching that occurs in  the classrooms of the elemen- 
tary  and secondary school teachers who applied for  this unique educational 
opportunity.” 
NASA would  host the  114 nominees at a national workshop, June 22-27,  in 
Washington,  D.C.,  during which NASA would discuss current developments

STS 

Concord,  New  Hampshire,  was  the  finalist  in  the  NASA  Teacher  in  Space 
Program that was announced by President Reagan in  August 1984. Her back- 
up  was  Barbara  Morgan  of  McCall-Donnelly  Elementary  School,  McCall, 
Idaho. 
McAuliffe proposed that,  while  in  space,  she would  gather  information for 
a personal journal,  "just as  the pioneer travelers of the Conestoga wagon days 
kept personal journals. My  journal would be a trilogy.  I  would like to begin i t  
at the point of selection through the training program. The second part would 
cover the actual flight. Part three would cover my thoughts and reactions after 
my return:'  McAuliffe said. 
Vice  President  Bush,  in   his  announcement  of  the  selection  at  a  White 
House ceremony in  the Roosevelt Room, where McAuliffe was accompanied 
by  the  other  nine  finalists  selected  from  among  11,416  applicants,  said, 
"We're  here  today  to   announce  the  first  private  citizen  passenger  in   the 
history of spaceflight  .  .  . We're  honoring all [the teacher applicants] today, 
and we're  doing something else because the finalists  here w i th  me and the 
more than a hundred semifinalists w i l l  all in  the months ahead serve as  a link 
between NASA and the  nation's school system." 
McAuliffe,  a  teacher  of  15  years  and  the  mother  of  two  children,  would 
work  a year  for  NASA. She  and Morgan would  report  in  September to John- 
son Space Center for  114  hours of training over  four months. 
The  Washington Post  reported that a top NASA official said McAuliffe was 
an  early  favorite  of  the  20-member  selection  panel.  The  official  said  "the 
judges  thought  McAuliffe appeared to  be  a good  team  player  and-vital 
to 
her  image-making duties-stood  out as  a good  communicator," the  Post  re- 
ported. (NASA Release 85-107;  Admin of Ronald Reagan, July 19/85,  913;  W

September 6  NASA today  invited Rep.  B i l l  Nelson (D-Fla.), who chaired the 
US.  House  science  and  technology  subcommittee  on  space  science  and 
applications,  to be a congressional passenger on an  unspecified flight of the 
Space  Shuttle,  the  Washington Post  reported.  Nelson,  who  represented the 
district  i n  which  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  launch site  was  located,  later 
held a  news  conference at  his office  i n  Melbourne,  Florida,  to  announce 
acceptance of the  invitation. 
The first congressional Space Shuttle passenger on an April 1985 flight was 
Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah),  chairman  of  the  committee  that  oversaw  NASA

Roundup  reported.  Reporters,  photographers,  and  Tv  crews  accompanied 
the two as  they arrived at building 100 to  receive their  identification badges. 
Mission  commander  Francis  "Dick"  Scobee  that  afternoon  welcomed 
McAuliffe and Morgan at  a meeting w i th   the crew of mission  51-L,  sched- 
uled  for  launch  in   January  1986.  Other  51-L  crew  members  were  p i lo t  
Michael Smith and mission specialists Ronald McNair,  Ellison Onizuka,  and 
Judith Resnik. 
JSC personnel the next day measured them for flight suits,  helmets, and G- 
suits.  McAuliffe said  she would  be allowed  to  select either  a jumpsuit  or a 
standard flight  suit to take  home with her following her flight. 
After  a  food  tasting  and  rating session,  in  which  food  lab  manager  Dr. 
Charles  Bourland asked  McAuliffe and Morgan to  taste  about 40  food  and 
drink  items and rate them on a scale of  1 to 9,  both teachers commented on 
their  surprise  in   finding  space  food  so  flavorful.  They  would  have  several 
more opportunities for taste tests  before McAuliffe selected her flight menu. 
Other  first-week  activities included  orientation  briefings by  management 
and  training  officials and  familiarization tours of  training facilities and mis- 
sion control. 
Asked  by  a  reporter  how drastically  her  life had changed since her selec- 
tion, McAuliffe said that other than having the opportunity to  fly onboard the 
Space Shuttle and the accompanying publicity she didn't  perceive that much 
difference. She pointed out that as  a teacher for a long time she had to gather 
material  and  present  information  to  students  daily.  'As  I  see  it,  I'm  doing 
basically the  same  things,  only  my  audience has  changed."  USC  Roundup,

Project,  for  Space Shuttle mission 51-L. 
The  first  live  lesson,  entitled  "The  Ultimate  Field Trip,"  would  allow  stu- 
dents to  compare daily life on the Space Shuttle w i th  that on earth. McAuliffe 
would take viewers on a tour of the orbiter,  explaining crew members'  roles, 
showing the location of computers and controls, and explaining experiments 
being conducted on the mission. She would  also demonstrate how daily  life 
i n  space was  different from  that on earth  in  the  preparation of  food,  move- 
ment,  exercise,  personal hygiene,  sleep,  and the use of  leisure time. 
The  second  lesson,  called  "Where  We've  Been,  Where  We're  Going," 
would  help the audience understand why  people use and explore space  by 
demonstrating the advantages of manufacturing in  the microgravity environ- 
ment,  explaining  technological  advances  that  evolved  from  the  space  pro- 
gram,  and projecting the future of humans in  space.

Also during the flight,  McAuliffe would participate in  activities that would 
be filmed and later used in  educational products. Possible activities included 
demonstrating earth magnetism by photographing and observing the  lines of 
magnetic force  in  three dimensions  in  a microgravity environment;  demon- 
strating Newton‘s  first,  second, and third l a w s  in  a microgravity environment; 
discussing why  products  might  or  might  not  effervesce  in   a  microgravity 
environment;  encouraging  creative works  from  students  that  reflected  their 
interpretation of the space  program/experience; explaining the use of simple 
machinedtools and  the  similarities  and  differences  between  their  uses  in  
space  and  on  earth;  showing  the  effect  of  microgravity on  plant  growth, 
growth  of  plants without soil  (hydroponics), and capillary action;  and dem- 
onstrating chromatographic separation of pigments in  a microgravity environ- 
ment. 
In  addition,  McAuliffe would  assist  mission  specialists  conducting  three 
Shuttle Student Involvement Project experiments that would fly onboard the 
Space Shuttle. The experiments dealt with using a semipermeable membrane 
to direct crystal growth,  studying chicken embryo development in  space,  and 
the effect of weightlessness on grain formation and strength in  metals.  (NASA

October 4  NASA  announced today  that Rep.  B i l l  Nelson (D-Fla.),  chairman 
of  the  subcommittee  on  space  science  and  applications,  would  fly  as  a 
payload specialist aboard Space  Shuttle mission 61-C  scheduled for  launch 
no earlier than December 20. 
NASA  said  i t  was  w i l l ing  to  schedule  flights  for  the  chairmen of  i t s   four 
Congressional  appropriations and  authorization  subcommittees  in  connec- 
tion w i th  their  NASA oversight duties.  Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah),  chairman of 
the subcommittee on  HUDhndependent agencies,  was  a payload specialist 
the previous April  aboard mission 51-D. 
NASA assigned Nelson to mission 61-C  after reassigning Gregory Jarvis, a 
Hughes Communications,  Inc. payload specialist,  from  that flight to mission 
51-L  which was  scheduled for  launch January 22,  1986. Hughes’s  decision 
not to  launch  its  Syncom  IV-5  spacecraft on the  December  mission elimi- 
nated the need for  a company  payload specialist on that flight. Jarvis would 
conduct experiments in  fluid  dynamics on the January flight.  (NASA Release 
85-141) 

October 2 4  NASA  announced today  that  an  American  journalist  would fly 
on a Space Shuttle mission in  late 1986 as the second in  a series of communi- 
cators to be selected as  part of the agency’s  Space  Flight Participant Program. 
The  first  candidate  selected  under  this  program  was  Christa  McAuliffe, a 
classroom teacher scheduled to fly  in  January 1986. 

2 75 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

In today's  announcement NASA  said  it would select  the journalist,  like the 
teacher candidate,  after a  nationwide competition conducted  by  profession- 
als  representing a broad spectrum of  individuals in  the candidates' field. The 
competition  would  be  limited  to  full-time  working  media  representatives 
(U .S .   citizens) w i th   five or  more years'  experience covering or  commenting 
on the news for  U.S.-based  audio,  video,  or print media.  Demonstrated abil- 
ity to communicate clearly and effectively to mass  audiences in  both broad- 
cast  and  print  media  would  be  the  basis  for  evaluation  of  applications, 
although i t  was  not necessary for the candidate to have worked professionally 
in  both. 
The selection process would first  require identification of eight candidates 
from  each  of  five  regions  in   the  U.S.;  from  the  40  regional  nominees,  a 
National Selection  Panel  would  recommend five  for  final  consideration  by 
the NASA  Space  Flight Participant Evaluation Committee composed of seven 
senior NASA officials. 
The  five  semifinalists would  undergo  medical  examinations and  receive 
briefings on  the spaceflight experience at  the Johnson Space  Center.  Based 
on results of the physicals and subsequent interviews, the evaluation commit- 
tee would recommend a primary and backup candidate to the NASA Admin- 
istrator who would approve the final selection. 
The  Association  of  Schools  of  Journalism and  Mass  Communication  in  
cooperation w i th  the Association for Education in  Journalism and Mass Com- 
munication and a Journalism Advisory Committee comprised of  representa- 
tives  from  16  professional journalism  organizations  including the American 
Newspaper Publishers Association,  Radio Television News Directors Associa- 
tion,  American Society of Newspaper Editors,  National Association of Broad- 
casters,  Society of Professional JournalistdSigma Delta Chi,  and the National 
Newspaper Association  would  administer  the  competition.  (NASA  Release 
8 5-  14 7) 

November 26:  NASA  announced that students  in  classrooms throughout the 
continental  U.S.  would  have  an  opportunity  to  observe  various  aspects  of 
Space  Shuttle  mission  51-L  and  to  listen,  look,  and  learn  from  NASA's 
Teacher  in  Space,  Christa McAuliffe,  during her  flight on  Challenger. A  few 
students would also be able to question McAuliffe about the mission. 
W viewers w i th   satellite dishes would  be  able  to  access  the  live  lessons 
directly  from  the  RCA  satellite  Satcom  F-2R,  Transponder  13.  The  Public 
Broadcasting Service,  as  a result of an agreement w i th  NASA, would carry the 
l ive  lessons  via  the satellite Westar  IV,  Transponder 12.  PBS would offer  the 
programs to  member  stations after  requesting that  they  preempt  regular  in- 
structional TV  or classroom programming to carry the  lessons  live. 
McAuliffe would teach two lessons on the sixth day  of the flight [see Space 
Transportation SystedCivilian in  Space Program,  Oct. 21;  the first at approxi- 
mately  11 :00 a.m.  EST,  the second at about  1 :00 p.m.  EST.

Classrooms w i th   access  to  a  satellite dish  or  cable  network  that  carried 
NASASelect would also be able to  participate in  a  “Mission  Watch,”  which 
covered aspects of the entire Space Shuttle flight from the day  before launch 
through  the  conclusion  of  the  mission.  Barbara  Morgan,  backup  for 
McAuliffe,  would  moderate  the  Mission Watch  broadcast.  (NASA  Release

December 6: The Johnson Space  Center‘s  USC)  Space News Roundup con- 
ducted  an  interview  w i th   Christa McAuliffe,  selected  by  NASA  to  be  the 
teacher  in  space,  and  her backup,  Barbara Morgan. When asked  to give  her 
impressions of JSC, McAuliffe said,  “Big.  Wry big  . . . But that‘s  one of the 
messages  we  want  to  get  across.  There  are,  what,  100  astronauts  in   the 
program,  but thousands of employees here  . . . And we’ve  gotten so  much 
information. When  I’m  62,  1‘11  finally read the  last piece of paper that  I  bring 
back from  here.” 
The  Roundup  reporter  questioned  the  two teachers  about  the  national 
attention they  had received,  the effect  it had on them,  and the possibility of 
moving into different careers after the flight. McAuliffe commented,  “Oh,  but 
you’re  talking to a teacher.  I didn’t  choose my career so  I could get monetary 
rewards. My God,  I never would haw gone into teaching  .  .  . A year  of this 
i s  going to be fun and I’m  enjoying what I’m doing. I see  i t  as an extraordinary 
year  out of my  life  . . . We  don’t  see  this as  a stepping stone to something 
else.  When I go  into a radio or TV station,  I am  looking at  everything that  is 
happening and  I  can’t  wait  to  te l l   my  kids  what  happens  in  a  TV  studio, 
because I have  newr  been in  one before.” 
Morgan then  said  that  one  of  the  funny  things  that  had  happened  since 
beginning their  training was  that,  “all  of a sudden we  are  being asked ques- 
tions as  i f  we are the experts on the Space Shuttle.”  McAuliffe agreed,  noting 
that  she  received a phone call from a reporter asking her what  she  believed 
was  the cause of a problem the previous summer w i th  the orbiter Challenger. 
In answer to the question,  “What message w i l l  you take to people after this 
experience?” McAuliffe said,  “That  space  i s  for  everybody.  It‘s  not just for  a 
few  people in  science or math,  or for a select  group of astronauts.  That‘s  our 
new  frontier out there,  and  it‘s  everybody’s  business to  know about  space.”

Crews 

January  77:  NASA  announced  the  assignment  of  Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah), 
chairman  of  the  Senate  subcommittee  overseeing  the  NASA  budget,  as  a 
payload specialist on Space  Shuttle mission 51-E,  a fourday flight using the 
orbiter  Challenger  to  deploy  the  second  Tracking and  Data  Relay  Satellite

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

(TDRS) and  the Canadian Telesat  I communications satellite. The  flight was 
scheduled for  launch February 20,  1985,  from KSC.  Garn was  in  preliminary 
training  at  Johnson Space  Center  and  would  soon  begin  training with  the 
other members of the crew. 
The  N Y  Times reported  that  Garn’s  activities  in  space  would  include  re- 
search on space sickness and,  i f  he d id  not become sick  in  orbit,  he might be 
made  ill as  part of the experiment. 
NASA  astronauts assigned  to the flight  included Karol Bobko,  commander; 
Donald  Williams,  pilot;  mission  specialists  M.  Rhea  Seddon,  S .   David 
Griggs,  and Jeffrey Hoffman;  and  French  payload  specialist Patrick  Baudry.

January 29: NASA  announced  Space  Shuttle  crews  for  flights  in  November 
and December 1985. 
Francis Scobee would command orbiter Atlantis flight 51-L  in  November 
to  deploy  the  third  NASA  Tracking  and  Data  Relay  Satellite  (TDRS)  and 
relaunch one of the communications satellites retrieved during flight 51-A; 
Michael  Smith  would  pilot;  Judith Resnick,  Ellison  Onizuka,  and  Ronald 
McNair would serve as mission specialists. 
Michael Coats  would command the orbiter Columbia  flight  61-C  in  De- 
cember carrying Western Union’s Westar  7 and RCA’s  Satcom KU-2  satellites 
for  launch,  3M Corp.’s  Material Sciences Laboratory 3,  and the EASVACCESS 
space  manufacturing experiment.  The  p i lo t  would  be John Blaha;  mission 
specialists, Anna Fisher,  Norman Thagard,  and  Robert Springer. 
NASA also assigned Vance  Brand,  commander,  and S.  David Griggs,  pilot, 
for  flight  61-D/Spacelab  4  in  January 1986,  and Jon McBride,  commander, 
and  Richard Richards,  pilot,  for  flight  61-VAstro  1  in  March  1986.  (NASA 
Release 85-14) 

kb rua ry   IS: NASA announced the astronaut crews for two upcoming Depart- 
ment of Defense (DOD) Space Shuttle missions,  including the  1st from Van- 
denberg AFB. 
Robert Crippen  (Capt.,  USN) would  command mission  62-A,  scheduled 
for  launch  no  earlier  than  Jan.  29,  1986,  from  Vandenberg.  Other  crew 
members  named  were  Guy  Gardner  (Lt.  Col.,  USAF),  pilot;  and  mission 
specialists Dale Gardner (Commander, USN), Jerry Ross (Maj.,  USAF),  and R. 
Michael Mullane (Lt. Col.,  USAF). 
Crippen  had  flown  w i th   John Young  on  the  orbiter  Columbia’s  maiden 
flight  in  April  1981 and was  commander  of  STS-7,  41-C,  and  4 1 4 .  Dale 
Gardner had served  as  a mission specialist on STS-8  and  51-A;  Mullane on 
41-D. 
Karol  Bobko  (Col.,  USAF)  would  command mission  51-J,  scheduled  for 
launch  September  1985  from  KSC.  Ronald  Grabe  (Lt.  Col.,  USAF)  would 

278 

STS 

serve as pilot; David Hilmers (Maj.,  USMC) and Robert Stewart (Col.,  USA) as 
mission specialists. 
Bobko had served as pilot on STS-6  and would command 51-E  scheduled 
for  launch  in  March;  Stewart  had  flown  as  mission specialist on 41-8  and 
had been the 2nd person to fly  the manned maneuvering unit on that flight. 
(NASA Release 85-25) 

March 6: NASA announced new crew assignments for the STS  51-D  mission 
set  for  late Marchearly  April  would  be  Karol  Bobko,  commander;  Donald 
Williams,  pilot;  M.  Rhea  Seddon,  Jeffrey Hoffman,  and  S .   David  Griggs, 
mission specialists;  and Charles Walker  (McDonnell Douglas) and Sen.  E.  1. 
“Jake”  Garn,  payload  specialists.  NASA  would  assign  the  originally  an- 
nounced  51-D  crew  of  commander  Daniel  Brandenstein,  p i lo t   John 
Creighton,  and mission specialists Shannon  Lucid, John Fabian,  and Steven 
Nagel to a future mission. 
The Centre National d’Etudes  Spatiales  (CNES) and  NASA  had agreed  to 
reassign payload specialist Patrick Baudry (France) from the 51 -E  mission to 
STS  5 1 4 ,  as  the earliest flight  opportunity with  adequate  middeck experi- 
ment stowage capability for the French medical experiments. As  a s m n d a y  
mission,  51-G  would also offer more time for data collection. 
For  fluid-transfer  experiments  designed  to  assist  Hughes Aircraft  in   the 
refinement of their  satellite design activities,  NASA would assign  a Hughes 
payload specialist to the 51-1  flight  to  substitute for  the  lost opportunity on 
51-D.  Hughes would announce later whether John Konrad or Gregory Jarvis 
would fly  the mission scheduled for early August. 
Preservation of  the year’s  flight  and  crew  training schedules  had  necessi- 
tated  the changes.  Bobko’s  crew  had to fly  soon  in  order to  preserve subse- 
quent  training  schedules  for  the  51-J  dedicated  Department of  Defense 
(DOD) mission,  the first flight of the Atlantis orbiter. 
The  reassignment  was  consistent  with  NASA’s  crew  selection  policy  of 
separating crew from payload flight assignments except  in  the case of Space- 
lab and dedicated DOD  missions,  for which  substantial crew/payload inter- 
action was  required. (NASA Release 85-34) 

A p r i l  24:  NASA  announced  it  selected  Dr.  F.  Drew  Gaffney,  an  associate 
professor of medicine and cardiology and  director of echocardiology at  the 
University  of  Texas  Health  Science  Center,  Southwestern  Medical  School, 
Dallas,  and  Dr.  Robert  Phillips,  a  veterinarian  and  professor of  physiology 
and nutrition at Colorado State University,  to serve as  payload specialists for 
the initial Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1)  flight. NASA also selected Dr. M i l l ie  
Hughes-Fulford, an  associate professor of  biochemistry a t   the  University of 
California Medical  Center,  San  Francisco,  and  a  medical  researcher  at  the 
Veterans  Administration Medical Center,  to  serve  as  a  payload specialist for

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

SLS-2.  Dr.  Hughes-Fulford was  the first woman  to sene  as  a  prime payload 
specialist for  a Space Shuttle flight. 
The flights were  intended to  imprave significantly knowledge about  l iv ing  
beings in  the space environment and were a major step in  preparing men and 
women  for  life aboard  the  space  station  scheduled for  launch  in  the  early 
1990s. 
NASA would shortly select for the SLS-2 mission a second payload special- 
ist,  who would then train w i th  the three already announced.  (NASA Release

May 4: NASA announced that Sultan Salman Abdelazize AI-Saud,  an Arabsat 
payload specialist scheduled to fly on the 5 1 4  7day Space  Shuttle mission 
in June, would conduct  70mm photography over  Saudi  Arabia,  35mm pho- 
tography of a fluids experiment,  and would participate in  the French posture 
experiment.  AI-Saud's  flight was  part of  a reimbursable agreement w i th   the 
Arab  Satellite  Communications  Organization  cavering  the  launch  of  the 
Arabsat  1 B communications satellite. 
AI-Saud would  use  the  70mm camera to take  pictures on  daylight orbital 
passes aver  Saudi Arabia and the 35mm camera to document such phenom- 
ena as  surface  tension effects on  mixed fluids  in  the absence of  gravity.  His 
other  activities would  include  photography  of  the  new  moon  in   a  lunar 
crescent  observation  and  assisting the  French  payload  specialist  as  a  test 
subject  in  the French experiment. 
At  a May  28  news conference at Johnson Space  Center,  AI-Saud  said  his 
flight was  bound to  imprave diplomatic  relations between the  U.S.  and  the 
Islamic  world,  the  Washington Post reported.  "You  w i l l   have  800  m i l l ion  
Moslems and 155 m i l l ion  Arabs glued to their TV sets watching an American 
spaceship carrying an Arab  into space,"  he commented. 
NASA  selected AI-Saud,  nephew  of  Saudi's  King Fahd,  from  hundreds of 
Saudi  applicants. He had  logged more than  1,000  hours  in  jet aircraft. 
Other crew  for  the mission were  Daniel Brandenstein,  commander;  John 
Creighton,  pilot;  Shannon  Lucid,  John Fabian,  and  Steven  Nagel,  mission 
specialists;  and  Patrick  Baudry,  French  payload specialist.  Backup  payload 
specialist for  Arabsat was  Abdulmohsen  Hamad AI-Bassam.  (NASA  Release

June  79  NASA  announced  i t  assigned  Robert Cenker,  a senior staff engineer 
at  RCA  Astro-Electronics,  as  a  payload  specialist on  Space  Shuttle mission 
61-C  scheduled for  launch on  December 20,  1985.  Cenker would  support 
deployment of  the Astro-Electronics-built RCA  Satcom  Ku-Band-1  communi- 
cations  satellite  from  orbiter  Columbia  and  perform  experiments  with  an 
infrared camera developed at  RC&  David Sarnoff  Research Center and man- 
ufactured at Astro-Electronics. 
During his  13-year  career  at  RCA,  Cenker  held a  number of  engineering 
positions  in  the  Satcom  program  that  included work  on  spacecraft design, 
integration and  test  scheduling,  cost  control,  and  launch site activity  plan- 
ning. 
During  November  NASA  would  launch  the  first  RCA  Satcom  Ku-Band 
satellite, KU-2,  on Space Shuttle mission 61-B.  Three RCA  Satcom  Ku-Band 
satellites would complement the operating Satcom  C-Band system  in  provid- 
ing distribution of Tv  services  to  customers  in  metropolitan  areas.  (NASA

lune  79 The  crew  of  Space  Shuttle Discovery on mission 5 1 4  designated 
Stewn  Nagel as  the  100th American  to  reach space,  the  Washington  Times 
reported.  Before  that  flight,  96  Americans  on  48  missions dating  back  to 
1961 had flown  in  space. 
There were five Americans aboard the Space Shuttle,  but commander Dan- 
iel Brandenstein decided Nagel took  the  100th honor because three Ameri- 
cans sat  in  front of  him on Discovery’s flight deck.  “Shannon  Lucid was  the 
first  runner-up,”  Brandenstein said.  “She  got  to  space  three  inches ahead of 
Steven  Nagel.”  To  mark  the  occasion,  which  was  televised  back  to  earth, 
Brandenstein presented Nagel w i th  a cake that had “100th”  written on it.

September  7 9 :   NASA  announced  that John Young  would  command  Space 
Shuttle flight 61-J  scheduled for  launch August  1986,  Vance  Brand mission 
61-K  scheduled for  September 1986,  and  Donald Williams mission 61-1. 
Other  crew  for  the  61-J  mission,  during which  astronauts would deploy 
the  Hubble Space  Telescope,  were  p i lo t  Charles  Bolden Jr. and  previously 
named mission specialists  Kathryn Sullivan,  Steven  Hawley,  and  Bruce Mc- 
Candless. 
S.  David  Griggs  would  p i lo t   mission  61-K,  and  other  crew  would  be 
mission  specialists  Robert  Steward,  Owen  Garriott,  and  European  Space 
Agency  astronaut Claude Nicollier.  NASA  previously assigned  payload spe-  
cialists Michael Lampton and Byron Lichtenberg to the mission. 
Remaining mission 61-1  crew would be p i lo t  Michael Smith and mission 
specialists James Bagian,  Bonnie Dunbar and Manley  "Sonny"  Carter. 
NASA also announced that Norman Thagard would replace John Fabian on 
mission 61-G  scheduled for May  1986 during which crew would deploy the 
Galileo interplanetary spacecraft.  Fabian was  leaving NASA;  he had  not an- 
nounced his plans. James Buchli would replace Thagard on mission 61-H  in  
June 1986.  (NASA Release 85-131) 

September  19:  Saudi  Arabian  Prince Sultan  bin  Salman bin Abdul Aziz  Al- 
Saud,  the first Arab  in  space on the June 1985 Space Shuttle flight 6 1 4 ,  was 
in  Washington  to  give  interviews,  attend  receptions,  and  pay  courtesy  calls 
on  government  officials,  including President Reagan,  as  part of a goodwill 
tour,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
The  prince commented  that  his flight,  coming as  it did during Ramadan, 
the holiest month  in  Islam,  was  a  spiritual ascent.  "I remember  being up in  
space  and  I'd  read  a verse  from  the  Koran  and  then  get  up and  go  to  the 
window  . . . It's  quite an  experience when the sun  rises and sets  every  45 
minutes.  F irs t  you  notice countries. Then you  start  paying attention to conti- 
nents.  And by  the fifth  day  a l l  you  can  see  i s  one b ig  blue ball tumbling in  
front of you." 
Dispensing,  under  the  circumstances,  with  the  ritual  facing  of  Mecca- 
after  checking  first  that  it  would  be  acceptable  to  Moslem  scholars-the 
prince nevertheless prayed five times a day  and fasted  for  part of the flight  in  
observance of  Ramadan. 
He also  commented,  "I  had  a  small  experience after  I came  back  from 
space.  ! always jogged over  the same area  in  Houston, sometimes  15 miles a 
day,  but when  I came back and jogged over the same course,  I  noticed at least 
50 percent more things  in nature."

helicopters throwing ticker tape,  people touching you,”  he said,  “Saudi  Ara- 
bians have never done this before. Our people are  usually  not so  emotional 
as  to  throw ticker tape.  But the Saudies w i l l  always  surprise you.”  The  Post 
also  noted that  his  face  was  on  thousands of  T-shirts  and  he  received  hun- 
dreds of letters a day. 
The  prince pointed out to the reporter that,  “I am  a bachelor.  I don’t  drink 
and I’m a nonsmoker, but I’m  not boring. No way  am  I boring.”  ( WPost, Sept 
19/85,  C1) 

October  1:  NASA  announced  today  the  selection of  Dr.  Samuel  Durrance, 
associate  research scientist  in  the  Department of  Physics and  Astronomy  at 
Johns Hopkins Uniwrsity,  and  Dr.  Ronald Parise,  manager of Advanced  As- 
tronomy  Programs at Computer  Sciences Corp.,  to serve as  payload special- 
ists  on  Space  Shuttle  mission  61-E, 
for  an  ultraviolet  astronomy  mission 
known as  Astro-1  scheduled for  launch March 6 ,  1986.  Dr.  Kenneth  Nord- 
sieck,  associate professor at Washburn Observatory, University of Wisconsin, 
would serve as  the backup. 
The  Astro-1  mission would study  HalIey’s  Comet  and other  celestial ob 
jects through three ultraviolet astronomical instruments. In addition, a special 
visible-light,  wide-field  camera  was  incorporated  into  the  payload  to  aug- 
ment  the  Halley‘s  Comet  studies.  The  payload  specialists,  all  experienced 
astronomers,  would make  decisions during  the  mission  to  ensure  the  b e s t  
possible scientific  return. 
The  payload specialists were each members of one of three science teams 
that developed the ultraviolet instruments.  Durrance and Parise would oper- 
ate  the  ultraviolet  instruments;  astronaut mission  specialists would  operate 
the  instrument  pointing  system  (IPS),  d e d o p e d   by  the  European  Space 
Agency  (ESA)   for  precise aiming at  celestial targets  and  first  flown  in  early 
August  1985 on Spacelab 2, on wh ich  the three  instruments were mounted. 
NASA scheduled the Astro-1  flight to coincide w i th  the Halley encounter 
missions by  ESA,  the USSR,  and Japan. Dr.  Burton Edelson,  NASA  associate 
administrator for space science and applications, said,  “The  opportunities for 
science  synergism  between  Astro-1  and  the  armada  of  Halley  encounter 
spacecraft are  significant. The  scientific  study  of  Halley’s  Comet w i l l   be an 
internationally coordinated effort.” 
In addition to the Halley’s observations, the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope 
on Astro-1  would  study  faint  astronomical  objects  such  as  quasars,  a c t i e  
galactic nuclei, and normal galaxies in  the far  ultraviolet range;  the Ultravio- 
let Imaging Telescope would record imageintensified photos of faint objects 
such  as  hot  stars  and  galaxies  in  broad  ultraviolet wavelengths  and  with  a 

283 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

wide field  of  view;  and  the Wisconsin  Ultraviolet Photopolarimetry Experi- 
ment would study the polarization of hot stars,  galactic nuclei,  and quasars. 
The  instruments would make a  total of  200  to  300  observations during the 
mission, the first of three in  a series scheduled for  launch within the next two 
years.  (NASA Release 85-137) 

N m m b e r  8:  The  Indian Department of  Space  announced today  the  selec- 
tion of two  Indian astronaut candidates,  one of whom would fly aboard  the 
Space Shuttle carrying India's  INSAT-1C  satellite, FBIS Delhi Domestic Sew 
ice in  English reported. The candidates were  N.C.  Bhatt of  the  Indian Space 
Research  Organization,  Bangalore,  and  P.  Radhakrishmam  of  Vikram 
Sarabhai  Space Center,  Trivandrum. 
The  chairman of  India's  Space Commission,  Professor  U.  R.  Rao,  said  the 
commission would  select one of  them  to  fly  on  the  mission  scheduled for 
July 1986.  (FBIS Delhi Domestic Service  in  English,  Nov 8/85) 

Nowmber  77:  European space program managers were urging the creation of 
a science astronaut classification to distinguish crew members w i th  scientific 
backgrounds from other  payload specialists who  flew  on  the Space  Shuttle, 
Aviation  Wee& reported.  European managers were  using the  science  astro- 
naut designation for  Ernst Messerschmid,  Reinhard Furrer,  and Wubbo Ock- 
els,  the  European  crew  members  who  flew  aboard  Space  Shuttle  mission 
61-A  w i th  West Germany's  Spacelab D-1  [see Space Transportation System/ 
Missions,  Oct.  301;  NASA  used  its regular  payload specialist designation for 
the three. 
"There  has to be a difference between some senator or Arab prince and the 
qualified scientists who fly aboard the shuttle,"  said U l f  Merbold,  crew  inter- 
face coordinator for the D-1  mission. "We  demand that the science astronaut 
concept be developed so  that  these  proficient crew  members can  be desig- 
nated  for  such  a  flight,"  said  Hans-Ulrich  Steimle,  Spacelab  D-1  mission 
manager at  the German aerospace  research  establishment.  "Instead,  NASA 
now  has  become  involved  in  running a  travel  office for  visiting dignitaries, 
and  this  i s  counterproductive when  you  want  to  perform a serious  science 
mission." 
German officials said  they  might raise the  issue again when  planning was 
finalized  for  a  f o l l o w n   Spacelab  D-2  mission  targeted  for  1988.  (AvWk, 
Nov  11/85,  24) 

December 27: NASA  announced that  its Administrator  selected Dr.  Charles 
Chappell of Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Dr.  Dirk Frimout of the 
European Space Agency  (ESA)  to serve as alternate payload specialists for the 
first Earth Observation Mission (EOM), which would use the Spacelab sched- 
uled for  launch on the Space Shuttle orbiter Atlantis in  the latter half of  1986. 

284 

STS 

Chappell and Frimout would serve as backups to flight payload specialists Dr. 
Byron Lichtenberg and his alternate,  Dr. Michael Lampton. 
Chappell was chief of the Solar Terrestrial  Div.,  Space Science Laboratory at 
MSFC  and  was  responsible for  directing a  research  group  that  studied  the 
physics of the sun-earth environment.  He  s e d  as  mission scientist for  the 
l o -d a y   Spacelab 1 mission, during which 70 investigations were carried out. 
Frimout  was  the  senior  engineer  supporting  European  researchers  who 
would  have  experiments  on  the  mission,  and  he  had  served  as  ESA  crew 
coordinator and operations manager for  Spacelab  1. 
Chappell and  Frimout would train with the flight crew and serve as  mem- 
bers  of  the  mission  management  team  in   the  Payload  Operations  Control 
Center during the flight. They would communicate directly w i th  the crew on 
orbit,  assist  the payload operations team during normal operations,  and aid 
in  trouble shooting problems and in  changing crew procedures when  neces- 
sary.  They  would also  advise  the  mission  scientist,  Dr. Marsha  Torr,  of  the 
possible impact of problems and timeline changes. 
The  EOM flight was  the first in  a series of Space  Shuttle missions primarily 
dedicated to measuring solar irradiance and the chemical composition of the 
earth’s  stratosphere  and  mesosphere  during  an  11-year  solar  cycle.  NASA 
would  refly  several  instruments originally carried on  the  Spacelab  1 and  3 
missions to accomplish these measurements. 
The mission would use the short version of the Spacelab module,  in  which 
a single Spacelab pallet and special support structure would hold instruments 
that  required exposure to the space environment. The mission would consist 
of  15  experiments conducted  in  six  disciplines-atmospheric  science,  solar 
physics,  plasma physics,  earth  resources,  astronomy,  and  life sciences.  The 
international mission  included experiments sponsored by  Belgium,  France, 
Japan, Federal Republic of Germany,  and the U.S.  ESA  would provide opera- 
tions support for  the European investigations. 
The  Investigators Working Group (IWG), which consisted of the principal 
investigator  for  each  of  the  mission  experiments,  recommended  alternate 
payload  specialist  candidates  for  selection  by  NASA’s  administrator.  (NASA 
Release 85-179) 

External Tank 

Nowmber  27: The  U.S.  Senate  awarded  Martin Marietta Corp.  the  United 
States  Senate Productivity Award for  the state of Louisiana for manufacturing 
improvements and costs savings  in  production of the Space Shuttle’s  external 
tank,  Defense Daily reported. The Senate cited the company for  its innovative 
across-the-board productivity  program  that  included  plant  modernization, 

285  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

installation of automated production processes,  and development of an  em- 
ployee participation program  that  led to  a  number  of  improvements  in  the 
manufacturing process. 
“Estimates  are  that  this  increased  productivity  w i l l   save NASA  and  ulti- 
mately the American  taxpayer  more than a b i l l ion  dollars over  the  long run,” 
said Louisiana Senators J. Bennett lohnston (D) and Russell Long (D) in  a joint 
statement.  The  two also  cited  the  “flawless  performance”  of  the  tanks  in  
Space Shuttle missions to date.  (D/D, Nov 27/85,  142) 

Launch and Landing Facilities 

February  7: NASA  and the  U.S.  Air  Force completed for  the first time Space 
Shuttle vehicle  stacking at Vandenberg AFB’s  Space  Launch Complex-6,  the 
Marshall  Star  reported.  Begun  January 12,  the  stacking  consisted  of  inert 
solid-fuel rocket-motor segments,  an external tank,  and the orbiter Enterprise. 
Unlike facilities at  KSC where NASA  stacked  the Space Shuttle in  the vehicle 
assembly building and  rolled i t  to the  launch pad,  at Vandenberg NASA  and 
the Air  Force stacked the Space Shuttle vehicle on  the  launch mount (pad). 
Workers at Vandenberg  rolled a mobile service tower and a shuttleassem- 
b ly   building  to  the  launch  mount,  then  brought  booster  segments  to  the 
launch  complex  from  the  booster  facility  and  lifted  them  into  place  by  a 
mobile  servicetower  crane.  This  first  vehicle  stacking  at  the  Vandenberg 
launch complex was  part of facilityverification testing before the first Space 
Shuttle launch from the complex  in  early  1986. 
Col. Walter Yager,  commander of the Air  Force shuttle assembly task  force, 
said minor problems had occurred,  but “that‘s  why we  have  facility verifica- 
tion. Wk  want  to ensure properly working systems  before we  start  handling 
actual  flight  hardware.”  F i t   and  function  checks,  payload  operations,  and 
launch-processing simulations would complete facility verification. (Marshall 
Star, Feb  7/85,  1)  

April  72:  Three quarters of a m i l l ion  gallons of water  flooded Space  Launch 
Complex-6 at Vandenberg AFB during a March test to determine whether the 
system,  intended to  suppress  sound waves  from  the  Space  Shuttle during a 
launch,  would  operate  properly,  the  Air  Force  Systems  Command  (AFSC) 
Newsreview  reported.  Sound  waves,  reflected  off  the  launch  mount  and 
flame ducts,  could seriously damage the orbiter and  its payload. 
To  prevent such damage,  nozzles on the mount would begin spraying water 
into the three pad exhaust ducts  seven and a  half seconds  before the Space 
Shuttle’s  main  engines  ignited.  By  ignition  time,  the  spray  system  would 

286 

STS 

reach i t s  fu l l  flow  rate of  985,000  gallons per minute and maintain that  rate 
for nearly 30 seconds before tapering off after the Space Shuttle left the pad. 
Although Vandenberg officials had tested the spray  system  s ix  times previ- 
ously,  the March test was  the first time the nonflying prototype orbiter Enter- 
prise,  inert solid-fuel rocket boosters,  and an  external  tank were  in  place on 
the  mount during a test.  Remotely controlled  by the  launch control  center, 
the splash pattern of the gravity-fed water system  resulted in  no water splash- 
ing  up  into  the  main  engines,  where  ice might  form  before  ignition.  The 
system  sprayed  water  exactly  where  it would  be  needed  at  launch-down  
into the flame ducts and out over  the concrete pad surface. 
George O’Gorman,  site manager for complex-6, said most of the complex’s 
construction work was  complete,  although some modifications were sched- 
uled  before the  orbiter  Discovery would  arrive  in  September for  launch  in  
January 1986. 
The Air  Force expected to make about four  Space Shuttle launches a year 
by the late 1980s from Vandenberg AFB.  The facility could handle as  many as 
ten  launches a year.  (AFCS Newsreview, Apr  12/85,  3) 

April  15: The turnaround clock  began running when  the Space Shuttle Dis- 
covery  left the  KSC  launch pad at 8:59  a.m.  April  12  and stopped  70  hours 
and 35 minutes later when NASA declared the orbiter Challenger, configured 
for  launch  of  the  Spacelab  3  mission,  “hard  down”  on  the  pad,  the  KSC 
Spaceport News  reported. 
The tightly coordinated effort began approximately one minute  after  Dis- 
covery’s  launch. After  launch control  center‘s  firing room  1 issued the com- 
mand for automatic washdown of the pad structures, an operational TV scan, 
ordnance  system  resistance checks,  and  statusing  fire  and  leak  detectors 
commenced operation.  About  15  minutes after  launch,  when  i t  was  certain 
the  Space  Shuttle would  not  return  to  the  launch  site,  a convoy of  waiting 
vehicles moved into action. 
Workers dumped small cryogenic (hydrogen and oxygen) tanks at the  155- 
foot  level  of  the  fixed  service  structures  (FSS). Two  Lockheed  and  EG&G 
teams  inspected  in  minutes  the  hydrogen and  oxygen  farms,  high-pressure 
hydrogen gas  battery,  and the gaseous  battery beneath the  pad,  clearing the 
way  for  another  team  to  safe  and  secure  the  oxygen  and  hydrogen  farms. 
Following dumping of the cryogenic tanks,  two other teams began a level-by- 
level quick-look  inspection of  the  FSS  and  rotating service structure,  setting 
the stage for safety and security procedures,  including configuring purge line 
valves  and doors,  making environmental checks  in  the mobile  launch plat- 
form  (MLP),  and  checking operation of  elevators. A t   the  same  time,  others 
rem& 
ordnance  from  the  external  tank  vent  arm  and  tail  service  masts, 
secured guard rails where necessary, and cleared the pad for entry of general 
repair crews. 

287 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

Some  damage  was  anticipated  during  a  launch.  In  this  case,  pins  had 
melted off some of the solid-fuel rocket booster holddown p o s t s  on the MLP; 
burnaway (or sacrificial) plates needed repairing;  FSS  light bulbs had blown 
at various levels;  and some SRB waste residue was  present. A 40-foot piece of 
waterpipe at the 95-foot level of the FSS,  part of the Firex system,  was  bent at 
a 90°  angle. 
The  KSC  integrated control  schedule  called  for  removal of  the M L P  by  7 
p.m.  the day after  launch and for  i t  to be at the doors of the vehicle assembly 
building NAB )  by midnight. To  accomplish this,  workers  had to mount s ew  
ice platforms,  disconnect waterpipes,  and move flame  deflectors. They  also 
serviced the hydrogen burn pond and  i t s  several  igniters. 
O n  schedule,  the  crawlerhransporter crew  moved  into  position  to  begin 
the return of the MLP  to the VAB.  At  11 :30 p.m.  April  13, crawler 1 and MLP  1 
reached the entrance of high bay  3; at  12:17  the next day the crew started  the 
journey  to the pad w i th  Challenger. The  Space  Shuttle was  “hard  down”  on 
the pad at 6:25  a.m.  April  15.  (KSC Spaceport News,  Apr  26/85,  4) 

May 3:  Effective today  Lockheed Corp.  reassigned s ix  officers of its Lockheed 
Space  Operations Co. at  Kennedy Space Center  after a six-month corporate 
investigation  of  the  management  practices  and  work  procedures  used  to 
process  the  Space  Shuttle for  launch,  Aviation  W k
 reported.  E.  Douglas 
Sargent  replaced A.R.  Schroter  as  president of  Lockheed Space  Operations 
Co.  and became program manager of the Space  Shuttle processing contract, 
David  Owen  replaced W.  John Denson  as  deputy  program  manager  and 
became  executive  vice  president  of  the  space  operations  company,  and 
David Dickenson replaced Ronald Petersen as vice president and director of 
Kennedy Space Center operations. 
Although  the  replaced Lockheed managers had previously received unfa- 
vorable  management  evaluations,  the  management  realignment  came  as 
NASA completed a report on  i ts  investigation of a March 8 incident in  which 
a work  platform fell  in  the Orbiter  Processing Facility,  damaging the orbiter 
D i s c m r y  and injuring a workman [see Space Transportation System,  Launch 
Schedules,  Mar. 81.  The  report would assign a large  part of the  responsibility 
for the accident to  Lockheed safety  and quality control procedures. 
However,  a NASA  official said the platform incident did not precipitate the 
realignment.  He said a Lockheed Corp.  investigating team,  which  had ana- 
lyzed Lockheed’s  performance at  KSC  since the previous October, had made 
detailed  recommendations on  how to streamline and  improve performance. 
Also,  after  receiving a  grade of excellent  in  the award  fee  evaluation during 
the  transition  period when  Lockheed  took  over  Space  Shuttle  processing 
work  previously done by  15  separate contractors, NASA  gave  Lockheed a low  
score in  the next evaluation period of April  1 to September 30,  1984. 
Lockheed’s  basic  space  processing contract with  NASA  ran  through  Sep 
tember 30,  1986,  and there was  a priced option period for three more years. 

288 

STS 

The  two priced contracts were worth  $2.5  billion;  three additional unpriced 
threeyear options could bring the contract life to  15 years  and value to more 
than  $6  billion.  NASA  said  i t  had  no  plans to  recompete the  Space  Shuttle 
processing contract.  (AvWk, May  13/85,  14) 

May 75: NASA  announced  i t  was  discussing with  representatives of the Chil- 
ean  Government  possible  arrangements  for  landing support  for  the  Space 
Shuttle  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  during  launch  from  Vandenberg  Air 
Force  Base.  The  discussions were  consistent with  arrangements made with 
other countries since  1981  supporting launches from  Kennedy Space Center 
(KSC). 
Space  Shuttle  operational  planning provided  for  emergency  landing o p  
tions  for  all  phases  of  the  flight  to  protect  the  l i v e s   of  the  crew  and  the 
integrity of the space vehicle.  Since the first  launch of the Space Shuttle from 
KSC,  NASA  had plans for  each mission for  trans-Atlantic  landing sites  (TAL) 
and contingency landing sites  (CLS) in  addition to the primary  landing sites. 
This  was  consistent  with  relevant  international  agreements  relating  to  the 
rescue and  recovery of astronauts in  distress and  return of the space vehicle. 
Space  Shuttle  launches,  scheduled  to  begin  from  Vandenberg  in   early 
1986,  required one  or  more trans-Pacific landing (TPL) and  CLS  sites  in  the 
Pacific Basin.  NASA had determined that Mataveri Airfield on  ls la  de Pascua 
(Easter  Island) could  serve  as  a  Space  Shuttle  TPUCLS  in   the  event  of  an 
emergency. 
A  Chilean  contractor was  working on  preliminary  designs  for  minor  im- 
provements at  the airfield, which would be necessary  in  the event an  agree- 
ment was  reached.  Improvements would be in  accordance w i th  existing land 
use  statutes  and  regulations  on  the  island.  Any  actual  improvements were 
contingent on final agreement w i th  the Government of Chile. (NASA Release 
85-74) 

lune   72:  Chilean government member Admiral Jose Toribio Merino said  to- 
day  that  he  favored  accepting the  NASA  request  to  bu i ld   a  Space  Shuttle 
emergency landing airfield on Easter Island and that i t  was essential to build a 
port for  the operation of  larger and faster  ships,  FBlS Santiago Radio Chilena 
in  Spanish  reported.  “If  someone offers to  extend  the  Easter  Island airport,” 
Merino said,  “we  should accept because Chile does  not have  the money to 
do  it.“ 
The  need  to  supplement  the  project with  the  construction  of  a  port  for 
security reasons was  a new element added by Merino to the NASA  proposal. 
Merino explained that the operation of  an  international airport near the sea 
called  for  fast  ships  to  act  in  case  a  plane went  down  in  the  ocean.  It was 
imperative to  have  a  port for  the operation  of  such  ships,  and  Easter  Island 

289 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

had only a small bay,  he said.  "If  someone offers to bu i ld  a port,  I would  let 
them,"  he added. 
In referring to criticism of the  project because of  possible military uses  of 
the  airfield,  Merino  said  that  those  who  said  that  about  the  project were 
"ignorant  people who  were  politicians  in  the  past  but  not  now."  (Santiago 
Radio Chilena in  Spanish,  June 12/85) 

/ m e  21:  For  the first time since the  1975 Apollo-Soyuz project,  liquid-hydro- 
gen  rocket fuel  flowed  through the  lines at  Kennedy Space  Center's  launch 
pad 39-8,  the Spaceport New s  reported. Nearing i t s  January 1,  1986, dead- 
line  for  completion  of  pad  B  renovations  and  improvements,  NASA  was 
entering final work stages including functional testing for such  ins ta l la t ions  as 
the  new  100-foot-rall flare  stacks  that would  replace  the o ld   burn  pond  for 
disposal of vented gaseous hydrogen. NASA  planned first use of  pad B for the 
51-L  Space Shuttle mission scheduled for  launch no earlier than January 22 ,  
1986. 
One  of  the  flare  stacks,  26   inches  in  diameter,  would  vent  off  and  burn 
gaseous  hydrogen from the Space Shuttle's  external tank and the orbiter fuel 
cells service system;  the other,  18 inches in  diameter, would handle hydrogen 
from  the  Centaur  upper  stage,  the  facility  storage  tank,  and  the  mobile 
launcher  platform. 
Also new to the complex were two rooms on the rotating service structure, 
one  of  which  was  designed  for  storage  of  equipment  used  in   the  payload 
changeout room in  order to avoid the necessity for temporary removal of the 
equipment  from  the site  for  each  launch. The  other was  a  new  clean  room/ 
suit changing room. 
Another  major  new  item was  the  rolling  beam  that  would  supply  l iqu id  
hydrogen  to  the  Centaur  upper  stage.  Plans  called  for  use  of  the  Centaur 
upper  stage  during  the  Galileo  and  Ulysses  missions  scheduled  for  May 
1986. 
Work  began on  pad B  renovations about  seven years  previously;  total cost 
would be approximately $150 million.  (Spaceport News, June 21/85,  4) 

j u / y  26:  Chilean  toreign  Minister Jaime del  Valle  announced  that  Chilean 
and  US. delegations  reached agreement on  extending the  Easter  Island air- 
field  for  Space  Shuttle emergency  landings,  FBlS  Santiago Radio Chilena in  
Spanish  reported.  Del Valle  said  Chile  received favorable answers  from  the 
U .S .   gowrnment to  two major questions  raised by Chile and  that  he would 
recommend the Chilean president approve the project. 
Earlier  De l  Valle  had  said  that  a  possible agreement  with  NASA  on  the 
extension of  Mataveri Airport  would  not  imply the  surrendering of  Chilean 
sovereignty over  the  airfield nor  would  i t  constitute  the  establishment of  a 
foreign  military  base  on  Chilean  territory.  Del  Valle  was  quoted  as  saying, 
"On  the e w  of the beginning of formal  negotiations, I want to reaffirm to the 

290 

STS 

country that  the agreement  proposed by the  United States  refers exclusively 
to the emergency  landings of space  shuttles of the type  that are  currently in  
operation.  It i s  appropriate to  note that  the  possible emergency  landings at 
Easter  Island include only those  isolated flights originating in  California and 
those taking off from Cape Canaveral,  which take  a different orbit.” 
Del Valle concluded  the earlier statement by  saying the  “cultural,  archee 
logical, and ecological structure of the island w i l l  be preserved.”  (FBIS Santi- 
ago  Radio Chilena  in  Spanish,  July 2/85,  July 26/85) 

August  2:  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  service  and  contractor  personnel 
completed w i th in  90 days  installation of a  launch environment  instrumenta- 
tion  system  (LEIS)  for  Space  Shuttle launches at  Vandenberg Air  Force Base, 
the Spaceport News  reported. The  LEIS,  a 400channel instrumented system, 
was designed to acquire data on the environment in  the vicinity of the launch 
pad and support facilities during launch. 
The  system’s  transducers  measured  in   the  launch  pad  vicinity  pressure, 
acoustics,  strain,  vibration,  and temperature for  use  in  determining baseline 
data,  sources  of  problems,  and  possible solutions.  Such  equipment  at  KSC, 
for  example,  pinpointed  engine  gas  leaks  during  the  first  mission  of  the 
orbiter  Challenger  and  provided design  measurements of  the  overpressure 
problem that occurred during the first  Space  Shuttle  launch. 
The  KSC  engineering development directorate, w i th  the assistance of Plan- 
ning Research Corp.,  completed design,  management,  and  integration of the 
system,  which Fairchild Weston Systems  Inc. bu i l t  under the direction of KSC 
for  the Air  Force.  Fairchild began work on the system  in  March 1984 under a 
$4,549,256 contract.  (Spaceport News, Aug 2/85,  7) 

August  3:  NASA  announced  that  the  governments  of  Chile  and  the  U.S. 
signed  agreements  concerning  use  of  Mataveri  Airport  on lsla  de  Pascua 
(Easter  Island) as an  emergency  landing site for  the Space  Shuttle. The  inter- 
governmental  agreements  provided  the  basis  for  contingency  planning for 
launches of the Space Shuttle from Vandenberg Air  Force Base beginning in  
March  1986.  This  planning  was  consistent  with  arrangements  already  in  
place to support  launches from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). 
Space  Shuttle operational planning had to provide for  emergency  landing 
options  for  all  phases  of  a  flight  to  protect  the  l i v e s   of  the  crew  and  the 
integrity of the space vehicle.  The  Vandenberg  launches would also  h m  a 
requirement  (analogous  to  those  from  KSC)  for  one  or  more  trans-Pacific 
landing sites  in  the  Pacific Basin.  Although  the probability of a contingency 
Space  Shuttle  landing was  extremely  remote,  identification and  preparation 
of suitable contingency landing sites was  consistent w i th  prudent operational 
planning. 
A  Chilean  contractor  had ,prepared designs,  in  accordance with  existing 
land use  statutes  and  regulations on  the  island,  for  improvements at  the air 

291

field that were necessary to support a Space Shuttle landing. These  improve- 
ments included an  extension of  the existing runway and associated lighting 
system,  construction of a storage  building,  and enhancement of certain per- 
manent and temporary  navigation equipment  in  the area.  The modifications 
would not affect the historical treasures  for which ls la  de Pascua was  known. 
As  part of the agreement, the two countries would undertake enhancement 
of the existing program of scientific cooperation in  the exploration and use of 
outer space for peaceful purposes, thereby building upon a long and success- 
ful  relationship  of  technical  cooperation  in  this  arena.  (NASA  Release  85-

October  77:  The  information  gathered  by  several  Space  Shuttle  missions 
underscored the  need  for  improved weather  forecasting at  Kennedy  Space 
Center  (KSC).  NASA  along  w i th   the  U.S.  Air  Force  developed  a  plan  to 
improve the quality of weather data available at KSC  as well as  the manner in  
which  i t  was  presented to the forecaster,  Spaceport N ew s  reported. 
KSC officials recently held a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Range Control 
Center  on  Cape  Canaveral  Air  Force  Station  to  inaugurate  the  new  Cape 
Canaveral Forecast Facility (CCFF), marking completion of a $ 3  m i l l ion  three- 
year  effort by  NASA,  the Air  Force,  and contractor Pan  Am  World Services. 
The  facility was  the  first  important  tool  for  improving the  efficiency  of  the 
weather  forecaster during launches and  landings of  the Space  Shuttle. 
The facility housed a system called MIDDS, meteorological interactive data 
display  system,  which  animated and  overlaid  data  from  various  forecasting 
tools  in  color graphic  displays.  For  example,  a  forecaster  could  begin w i th  
display  of  a  current  satellite  picture;  over  that  he  could  place  a  color  en- 
hanced radar display of shower activity. Next he might add a graphic presen- 
tation  of  indications from wind  towers around  KSC;  and over  that  he could 
display  locations of lightning potential as well as  where lightning was  striking 
cloud-teground. Motion added  to  the entire composite picture would  illus- 
trate trends  in  weather activity over  a period of time. 
The system could overlay maps of upper wind data or barometric pressures 
collected  from  weather  balloons or  sounding  rockets.  The  forecaster  could 
also display  figures from  the data  network of other  weather  stations around 
the country or the world. 
Although  the console was  at  the Cape Canaveral  facility,  the new  rotating 
antenna  was  at  Patrick  Air  Force  Base  to  compensate  for  the  b l ind   spot 
directly above  the  radar.  A  National Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra- 
tion  radar  located  in   Dayton  Beach  supplemented  the  Cape  radar.  A  fore- 
caster could call up a current graphic display of any  official weather  radar  in  
the  U.S. 
A  lightning  location  and  protection  (LLP)  system  would  show  cloud-to- 
ground strikes up to 100 miles away,  from which antennas were  located ten 
miles north of the vehicle assembly building and at Melbourne Regional and 

292  

STS 

Orlando  International Airports.  These  antennas  supplemented  an  existing 
network of  30  area  field mills that detected  lightning potential. 
NASA  officials  hoped  w i th in   five  years  to  ham at  the  facility  a  clear  air 
doppler radar,  of which  there were  only s ix   in  the  country.  It would  reduce 
the number of w ind  towers needed and improve forecasting efficiency.  In the 
meantime, Space Shuttle weather officer Scott Funk said,  “We  haven’t  tapped 
the  full  potential of  the  new  MlDDS system.  Most weather  forecasters  haw 
never seen anything like this. But there are s t i l l  a number of potential capabil- 
ities the system  has which we  w i l l  add  next year.”  (Spaceport News,  Oct  11/ 
85,  7) 

Nowmber  22: The  successful  landing test  on  October  30  of  a  new  nose- 
wheel  steering  system  on  the  Space  Shuttle  Challenger  on  mission  61-A 
meant that the orbiter Columbia would resume Space Shuttle landings on the 
concrete runway a t  Kennedy Space Center  (KSC) when  it returned following 
the  Washington Post  reported.  A l l   Space  Shuttle  landings 
mission  61-C, 
since  April  had  been  a t   Edwards  Air  Force  Base,  where  the  long desert 
runways allowed pilots to  roll to a stop without excessive  brake use. 
At  KSC  crosswinds  tended  to  push  the  orbiter  toward  the  edges  of  the 
narrow runway after the spacecraft touched down,  which pilots countered by 
making “preferential”  use of brake assemblies  on the  landing gear  under the 
Space  Shuttle’s  wings.  By  braking on  one  side  or  the other,  pilots  kept  the 
orbiter on  the  runway. But a  landing in  April  shredded  three of  the orbiter‘s 
tires and burned out a brake assembly.  NASA  bu i l t  the new nosewheel steer- 
ing mechanism into the orbiter so the pilot could steer the spacecraft without 
using his brakes. 
Challenger Commander  Henry Hartsfield said after the Challenger landing 
that  he was  “very  pleased”  w i th   the assembly,  but  recommended  one more 
test on the concrete  runway a t  Edwards Air  Force Base.  (W  Post,  Nov 22/85, 
A21) 

December 9: NASA officials confirmed a schedule calling for the next Space 
Shuttle  orbiter  to  land  at  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC),  Aviation  Week   re- 
ported, as a result of the successful hard-surface runway landing December 3 
at  Edwards  Air  Force  Base  by  the  orbiter  Atlantis  on  mission  61-8.  The 
landing was  the first on  a concrete surface since the orbiter  Discowry dam- 
aged  its brakes and tires while  landing April  19  a t  KSC. 
NASA  scheduled  the  orbiter  Columbia  on  mission  61-C  to  land  at  KSC 
following  i ts   planned  December  18  launch.  Columbia  was  equipped  with 
the  necessary  nosewheel  steering system  upgrades and would  use  steering 
instead of  brakes as  a primary control method for  the KSC  landing. 
During the December 3  landing, control  inputs by mission commander Lt. 
Col.  Brewster Shawl  Jr. appeared to cause Atlantis to float slightly just before 

293 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

landing on the 15,000 ft.  runway. The orbiter's wheels touched down approx- 
imately  2400 feet  from  the  runway  threshold,  and  Shaw  applied only  light 
braking during a 17,759-ft.  landing roll. 
NASA slightly altered the Space Shuttle post-landing processing in  an effort 
to r e m m  Atlantis from the runway as soon as possible to allow the Air Force 
to reopen  i t  for aircraft use.  Normally personnel rem& 
the orbiter's  brakes 
in   parallel  w i th   other  close-out  tasks  before  towing  the  vehicle  back  to 
NASA's  Ames-Dryden Space Shuttle processing area at  Edwards. They  left on 
the brakes so  that Atlantis could be m d
 
to an apron area at the end and off 
to the side of the runway. H.W.  Widick, chief of the Space Shuttle Integration 
Div.,  said  a preliminary  inspection of  the  brakes d id  not reveal  any  damage 
and that m r a l l  condition of  the orbiter was  good.  (AvWk, Dec 9/85, 23) 

December  13: Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC) director  Dick Smith  and  Lock- 
heed  Space  Operations Co .  president Doug Sargent  today  hosted a dedica- 
tion ceremony for  KSC's  launch pad B after s ix  years of modification at a cost 
of  $150 million,  the Spaceport N ew s  reported. NASA  would use  pad B,  the 
second of the two complex 39 launch pads to undergo modification from the 
Apollo  configuration,  to  support  Space  Shuttle and  Shuttle Centaur  upper 
stage  launches.  First  launch from  the modified pad would be Space  Shuttle 
mission 51-L, scheduled for January 22, 1986. 
NASA first used pad B in  May  1969 for the Apollo  10,  third manned Saturn 
V/Apollo  launch.  Its  last use was  for  the  launch of the Apollo/Soyuz  mission 
in  Ju ly  1975. 
Pad  modifications included a  new Centaur  rolling beam,  permanent orbi- 
ter weather  protection system,  TV  camera  floodlights  and a  TV  camera sys- 
tem,  boxcars,  upgrading  of  the  payload  changeout  room,  a  cost-saving 
lighting system,  variable speed  motors for  loading l iqu id  oxygen,  and hydro- 
gen flare stacks. 
Although  there were  currently  minor differences between  pads  A  and  B, 
the  work  underway  at  pad A  would  eventually  make  the  two  functionally 
identical.  (Spaceport New s ,   D e c   20/85, 1;  Kennedy  Space  Center  Release

launch Schedules 

lanuary 8:  NASA  announced  it had agreed  w i th  the  U.S.  Air  Force  to delay 
the first Space Shuttle launch from Vandenberg AFB,  originally scheduled for 
October 15, 1985, until no earlier than January 29, 1986. 
NASA  and Air  Force officials had conducted  in  December  1984 an  exten- 
s ive   review  of Vandenberg Space  Shuttle  launch-facility readiness,  the  D e  
partment of  Defense (DOD) payload,  and  impact of  the  orbiter Challenger

tile  problems on  the Space  Shuttle program schedule. They  had decided  to 
delay  launch  to  maintain  the  current  Space  Shuttle manifest  and  to  insure 
adequate margin  in  development of the DOD  payload for the initial Vanden- 
berg launch. 
NASA  and the Air  Force agreed that the orbiter Discovery would be deliw 
ered  to Vandenberg  in  early  September  1985  instead of  May;  NASA  would 
use  Discovery  for  two flights  from  KSC  in   mid-1985  to  accommodate  the 
impact  of  t i le   problems  on  the  schedule  and  would  deliver  other  Space 
Shuttle flight hardware (filament-wound cases  and external tank)  as  soon  as 
possible  to  Vandenberg  to  provide  maximum  schedule  flexibility  for  the 
earliest launch. 
The Air  Force had corrected  problems w i th   pipe welds  and cleanliness at 
the Vandenberg  launch site and  was  conducting  ground  systems  tests  with 
the orbiter Enterprise in  preparation for  initial checkout. NASA  had delivered 
an  external tank  and solid-fuel  rocket booster skirt ahead of schedule. 
NASA  was  completing the  remainder of  the  1985  Space  Shuttle manifest 
w i th  commercial and  DOD  payloads and would release a manifest covering 
August  1985 through  1989 in  the near  future. 
In reporting the delay,  the  Washington Post noted that Vandenberg was  the 
only base from which Space  Shuttles could fly  into north-south orbits cross- 
ing the poles,  an orbit  ideal for  surveillance and other earth-watching space- 
craft because they could fly w r
 the entire globe once every  18  days.  (NASA 
Release 85-4;  W Post,  Jan 9/85,  A9) 

lanuary 23: NASA  postponed for  24  hours the  first classified Space  Shuttle 
flight, scheduled for launch the afternoon of  January 23,  as freezing tempera- 
tures threatened to cause severe  icing on the external fuel tank,  the Washing- 
ton  Post  reported.  Officials  said  ice  chunks  could  drop  off,  damaging the 
Space Shuttle, and also that NASA staff was  conducting inspection of fuel and 
water  pipes to determine i f  they  had frozen shut. 
The  Department of  Defense (DOD)  had classified nearly a l l  aspects of the 
mission.  The  crew  consisting of  Navy  Capt.  Thomas  Mattingly,  AF  Lt.  Col. 
Loren Shriver, Marine Lt. Col. James Buchli, AF  Maj. Ellison Onizuka,  and AF 
Maj. Gary  Payton would not conduct the traditional prelaunch news confer- 
ence nor ho ld  one after  landing. The  US. Air  Force would not disclose how 
long the crew would stay  in  orbit or what flight path they would take on the 
premise it might help the USSR determine mission purpose or  interfere with 
the mission. 
Previously the  Washington Post  had reported that Challenger would carry 
into orbit a sigint (signals intelligence) satellite that could intercept telemetry 
from  Soviet  missile tests.  The  Associated  Press  later  had  reported  that  the 
satellite  could  pick  up  radio,  ground-tespace communications,  and  long- 
distance telephone calls made by microwave relay. Defense Secretary Caspar 
Weinberger would not comment on  the reports’ accuracy. 

295  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

The  USAF had not filed a flight-path plan w i th  the United Nations, and the 
location of  two ships  that  would  r e c m r  the  solid-fuel  rocket boosters w a s  
also secret.  There would be no public air-to-ground communications during 
the flight.  (W  Post,  Jan 23/85,  A3) 

January 30: Tile work  on  the  orbiter Challenger had  remained the  “pacing 
item”  in  meeting NASA’s next scheduled Space  Shuttle mission, 51-E,  set  for 
no earlier than  February 20,  Aerospace Daily  reported.  Randy  Stone,  51-E 
lead flight director,  said a t  a press briefing that  NASA would make an  assess- 
ment a t  KSC and that he didn’t  know “what  the slip w i l l  be or i f  there i s  one.” 
Stone had  indicated work  on the orbiter originating from  adhesion  p r o b  
lems w i th   thermal  protection t i les   was  progressing well;  however,  workers 
s t i l l  needed to  attach ow r  300 tiles before NASA  could m m  the orbiter  to 
the Vehicle Assembly  Building for  mating w i th   the external  tank  and  solid- 
fuel  rocket boosters.  If all went well,  NASA  would  launch Challenger Febru- 
ary  20  from  KSC  and  land  it there at about  9:21  am  EST  February 24.  ( A D ,  
Jan 30/85,  1) 

February 6: NASA  announced it had delayed for a t  least a week  the February 
20 Space  Shuttle flight that would carry Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah),  because of 
thermal  tiles  problems  and  a  backlog  of  paperwork,  the  Washington Post 
reported.  A  chemical  reaction  in  the  thermal  tiles’  adhesive  on  the  orbiter 
Challenger‘s  underside had caused about 4,000  of the more than 30,000  tiles 
to  loosen during return to  earth  on  the orbiter‘s  last  flight.  Although  NASA 
had replaced all but 47 of the faulty tiles,  i t  had not certified the repair work. 
(WpOst, Feb 6/85,  A12) 

February 7: NASA  announced  i t  had scheduled the 51-E  Space Shuttle mis- 
sion  from  KSC  for  no earlier than  March 3,  1985,  w i th   landing on March  7, 
1985,  at  KSC. 
The  7th  flight of  the orbiter Challenger would  include deployment of  the 
2nd Tracking and  Data Relay  Satellite CTDRS-B)  and  Telesat  Canada’s  Anik 
C1  communications  satellite and  the  French echocardiograph and  postural 
experiments. 
Mission 51-E  crew would be Karol Bobko,  commander;  Donald Williams, 
pilot;  mission specialists M.  Rhea Seddon,  S.  David Griggs,  and Jeffrey Hof- 
fman;  and  payload specialists Patrick Baudry and  Sen.  E.  1.  “Jake”  Garn  (R- 
Utah). 
Thermal  protection  system  refurbishment  [see Space  Transportation  Sys -  
tem/Launch Schedules,  Feb.  61  had necessitated the delay from  February 20. 
NASA  had y t  to accomplish step  measurements, gap  filler  installation, and 
tile-bond  and quality wrifications. 
NASA  said  the current 51-E  launch date d id  not affect the planned March 
19  launch date of the Space  Shuttle 51-D  mission. (NASA Release 85-20)

STS 

February27: NASA announced plans for a March 4,  1985, Space Shuttle 51- 
E launch from KSC,  w i th  a landing at KSC on March 8.  NASA  based i t s  launch 
decision on flight  readiness-review results. The completion of cargo  integra- 
tion and orbiter-systems testing necessitated additional time in  the schedule. 
The current 51-E  launch date would not change the planned launch of STS 
mission 51-D,  which was  planned for  no earlier than March  19,  to  retrieve 
the Long-Duration Exposure Facility and to launch the Navy Syncom satellite. 
(NASA Release 85-27) 

February 27:  NASA  announced a new  launch date of no earlier than March 7 
from KSC  for  the 51-E  Space  Shuttle mission with  landing at  KSC  on March 
11. 
Routine checkout of  the  Tracking and  Data  Relay  Satellite had  disclosed 
that one cell in  a 24-celI flight battery would not accept a charge.  Reschedul- 
ing  the  launch would  permit battery repair and  retesting. The  three  nickel- 
cadmium  batteries  would  supply  fu l l   power  to  the  satellite  dur ing  
orbital-flight,  solareclipse  periods when  its solar  panels could  not provide 
the  required electrical  power.  Final  checkout  of  the  Space  Shuttle  orbiter 
systems was  progressing satisfactorily. 
The  51-E  launch date would cause an  STS  51-D  launch date of no earlier 
than March 22.  (NASA Release 85-29) 

February 28: The  Washington Times,  in  its report on the Space  Shuttle 51-E 
mission delay,  said  that  NASA  Administrator James Beggs  had  indicated the 
delay might be a week or two. 
In  announcing earlier  delays,  NASA  had  said  they  would  not  alter  the 
planned  March  19  launch  of  the  51-D  Space  Shuttle mission,  Aerospace 
Daily  reported.  However,  in  announcing the  new  51-E  launch date,  NASA 
said the current 51-D  mission  launch would slip three days.  (W  Times, Feb 
27/85,4A;  N D ,  Feb 28/85,  1) 

March  1:  NASA announced cancellation of the March 7 Space  Shuttle Chal- 
lenger  flight  due  to  problems associated with  the Tracking  and  Data Relay 
Satellite (TDRS-B).  NASA  officials determined  that,  in  addition to  repairing 
the previously announced problem w i th  one cell of the TDRS’s  24ce l l  flight 
battery,  i t  was  necessary  to  r e m m  the TDRS-B  from  the Challenger cargo 
bay  in order  to  repair a timing problem that became apparent during testing 
of the TDRS-1  then  in  orbit. Under certain operational conditions, the timing 
circuits  could cause errors  in  the  system  switching sequences,  interrupting 
user  support. Tests  run  February 2 7  and 28 at  spacecraft contractor facilities 
confirmed the problem. 
Although  NASA  and  its contractors had developed  procedures to  operate 
the TDRS-1, 
these  procedures were  not acceptable for  multiple spacecraft 

297 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

operations,  requiring modifications for TDRS-B  and  subsequent spacecraft. 
Because the TDRS  spacecraft  had encryption devices to  protect the  system 
from  interfering signals,  NASA  could not provide further technical detail on 
the problem. 
NASA expected a delay of sewral weeks  for modifications, at which time i t  
would  remanifest TDRS-B. 
NASA  would  place the Anik-C  (Telesat-I)  satellite scheduled  for  the  STS 
51-E  mission on  the  Discovery STS  51-D  mission and delay  retrieval of the 
Long  Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) from  the  51-D  mission to  a future 
Space  Shuttle flight.  (NASA Release 85-31) 

March  8: An  accident  at  Kennedy Space  Center  (KSC)  today  damaged  the 
Space Shuttle orbiter Discovery and injured a technician,  forcing delay  in  the 
orbiter's  next flight originally scheduled  for  March 29 ,  the  Washington Post 
reported. The accident occurred about 8 a.m.  when the bucket of a "cherry 
picker"  crane  howr ing  over  Discovery  fell,  hitting  a  Lockheed  technician 
who was on a work platform and then striking Discovery, which was  horizon- 
tal on  the floor of the orbital  processing facility. 
The  2,500-lb.  bucket broke  the  technician's  leg and  injured  his  shoulder, 
then  fell  onto  the  closed  left-hand cargo  bay  door,  which was  so  thin  and 
made  of  such  light-weight material  that  i t  could  not  be  opened  on  earth 
without elaborate supports  to  keep  i t   in  a  fixed  position. The  bucket made 
two holes  about  three  feet  apart  in  the  heat  protection  tiles  insulating the 
door and damaged the door's  structure. 
A NASA spokesman said an  investigating board would determine the cause 
of  the  accident,  extent  of  the  damage,  and  impact  on  the  flight  schedule. 
Officials  speculated that  NASA  would  haw  to  replace  the  2,400-lb.  door, 
which would require shipment of a  new door  from  the manufacturer and as 
many as  three or four days of work  to complete installation. (W  Post,  Mar 9/ 
85,  A2) 

March  73: The  NY  Times  reported  that  NASA  officials  said  the  next  Space 
Shuttle  mission  would  not  occur  until  mid-April  as  a  result  of  the  time 
needed to repair two one-foot-sq. punctures in  one of the cargo bay doors of 
the orbiter Discowry. NASA  officials said  Discowry would definitely  fly  the 
mission,  although  they  had  considered  substituting  Challenger.  Rockwell 
Internatl.  was  fabricating  the  replacement  material  for  the  punctures  and 
would fly  the material to Cape Canaveral  that day  or the next. 
Although NASA could not set a  launch date until  i t  had completed repairs, 
unidentified sources  said  that,  if a l l  went well,  launch would be about April 
19.  ( N f l  March  13/85,  A14) 

March 27:  NASA  announced a  launch date of no earlier than April  12,  1985, 
for  the  51-D  Space  Shuttle mission,  w i th   two windows  for  launch  on  that

date:  from  8:04  a.m.  to  8:18  a.m.  EST  and from  8:45  a.m.  to 9:00  a.m.  EST. 
The orbiter Discovery would  land April  17 at approximately 8:14  a.m.  EST  at 
KSC. 
During the mission, crew would deploy the Canadian Telesat (Anik C1) and 
the Hughes Syncom IV (LEASAT) and operate the McDonnell Douglas contin- 
uous flow electrophoresis system.  (NASA Release 85-43)  

During March:  NASA announced  i t  had scheduled for no earlier than March 
3  from  KSC  the  launch of  Space  Shuttle mission 51-E,  which was  the  15th 
Space Shuttle mission and the orbiter Challenger's  7th flight. The Challenger 
was  scheduled to  land on March 7 at  the 15,000-foot  Space  Shuttle landing 
facility at  KSC.  NASA  previously announced the flight crew [see  Feb.  7J. 
Challenger  would  carry  the  heaviest  cargo  taken  into  space  by  a  Space 
Shuttle;  total weight of the payload bay and cabin payloads would be nearly 
53,400  Ib.,  almost  15,000  Ib. heavier than the previous record set  on Space 
Shuttle mission 5 1 -A. 
After  liftoff and  insertion into orbit,  the crew would prepare to deploy the 
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TORS-B)/inertial  upper stage (IUS). Follow- 
ing  release,  the  crew  would  maneuver  Challenger  to  a  safe  distance  and 
o b s e w  the  IUS perigee kick motor firing,  placing the TDRS  in  geosynchre 
nous transfer orbit. 
Following IUS first-stage burn of about 2 minutes 26 seconds,  which would 
then drop off,  the TDRSAUS  second stage stack would coast for six hours on 
the way  to  geosynchronous orbit  altitude of 22,300  miles. Once there,  the 
I U S  second stage would fire for  1 minute 49 seconds to stabilize the TDRS in  
geosynchronous orbit and the IUS would drop off. 
The  IUS was  an  advanced  solid-propellant, -stage 
booster designed to 
carry  heavyweight payloads  into orbits  higher  than  the Space  Shuttle could 
reach.  NASA first used the  IUS on the STS-6  mission for  launch of TDRS-A. 
Changes to the IUS since then corrected problems that developed during the 
STS-6  mission. The  IUS first stage developed about 46,500  Ib.  of thrust,  the 
second stage about  18,500  Ib. 
O n  the second day,  the crew would use the Challenger's orbital maneuver- 
ing system  (OMS) engines to  raise their orbit to a
h
 180 miles for deploy- 
ment  during the  22nd  orbit  of  the  7,347-lb.  Telesat-1  (Anik  C-1)  and  i t s  
payload assist module (PAM).  (NASA Release 85-24) 

A p r i l  2: NASA  Administrator  James Beggs,  testifying today  before the  U.S. 
House  HUD  and  independent  agencies  appropriations  subcommittee  on 
NASA's  FY  86  budget  request,  said  that  orbiter  processing  constraints  at 
Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC) made  it difficult  for  NASA  to  consider adding 
Space  Shuttle flights to get the year's  planned commercial launches back on 
schedule,  Aerospace Daily reported.

When  asked  by  Chairman  Edward  Boland  (D-Mass.) i f   reports were  true 
that  NASA was  considering  launching three commercial satellites  on  Deltas 
rather  than  the  Space  Shuttle  to  get  the  Space  Shuttle's  manifest  back  on 
schedule,  Beggs  responded that  i t  was  an option the agency "had  to  look at" 
but one that probably would not be exercised. He said NASA talked to several 
Space  Shuttle  customers  about  flying  payloads on  Deltas  and  some  were 
interested. Another option NASA considered was  adding another Space Shut- 
tle flight to the manifest,  but orbiter processing constraints posed problems. 
"We  just  can't  push  the  orbiters  through  the  processing  facility  quickly 
enough:'  he  said,  although  NASA  still  "may  be  able  to  squeeze  another 
launch"  into the year's  manifest. 
He pointed out  the  hardware for  another  flight  was  available  and  NASA 
proposed  building  a  third  orbiter  processing  facility  high  bay  and  Space 
Shuttle tile facility at  KSC w i th   FY 86  funds.  (AID, Apr  3/85,  1 )  

A p r i l  5: NASA  announced a new Space Shuttle manifest for 41 Space Shuttle 
missions  through  December  14,  1987  that  included  nine  flights  for  the  re- 
mainder of  1985,  15  flights in  1986, and  17 flights  in  1987. 
Highlights for  1985  included the first Atlantis flight  in  late September for a 
Department of Defense mission; a Spacelab 3  flight in  late April,  Spacelab 2 
w i th   extensive  European  Space  Agency  participation  in  July,  and  another 
Spacelab flight  in  October dedicated to W.  German scientific  investigations. 
Also during 1985 NASA would deploy communications satellites for Hughes, 
AT&T,  RCA,  Mexico, Australia,  Canada,  and  the Arabsat  consortium. 
In  1986  the  first  launch of  the  Space  Shuttle  from  Vandenberg Air  Force 
Base would occur. The  first  liquid-hydrogen-powered Shuttle Centaur  upper 
stage would be used to deploy Ulysses (formerly the International Solar  Polar 
Mission), and the Galileo mission to Jupiter (also using the Shuttle Centaur) 
and the  Hubble Space Telescope  flight would be  launched. 
NASA  said  launch  dates  of  missions  to  deploy  the  second  Tracking and 
Data Relay  Satellite  (TDRS-B)  and  to  retrieve the  Long  Duration  Exposure 
Facility (LDEF-1)  were  under  review.  Also,  NASA  assigned  Kathryn Sullivan, 
Steven Hawley,  and Bruce McCandless as mission specialists for  the Hubble 
Space Telescope flight on mission 61-J  in  August  1986. (NASA Release 85- 
50) 

A p r i l  24:  NASA announced  i t  selected April  29,  12:OO  noon EDT,  for  launch 
of  STS  mission  51-B, 
the  Spacelab  3  flight,  and  Dryden  Flight  Research 
CentedEdwards Air  Force  Base,  California,  as  the  primary  end-of-mission 
landing site,  w i th   KSC  as  an  alternate.  Landing was  set  for  May  6  at  12:03 
EDT. 
NASA  selected  Dryden  over  KSC  for  the  landing as  a  result of  problems 
encountered  during  the  STS  51-D  mission  when  the  orbiter  Discovery's 
right-hand braking systems  locked causing a tire to blow out.  Landing condi- 
c  4

STS 

tions  had  included a crosswind-the 
first  experience a t  KSC  of  such condi- 
tions-and  a higher-than-usual sink rate. A  landing at  Dryden would provide 
a greater  safety  margin for  Challenger‘s  tires  and  brake  systems  due  to  the 
availability of the unrestricted lakebed and the smoother surface. 
The  decision  to  land  a t   Dryden  for  the  next  flight  only  would  enable 
engineers to  determine what  corrective actions were  appropriate  before re- 
turning to  the KSC  runway  for  nominal end-of-mission landings.  (NASA Re- 
lease 85-63) 

During April: NASA announced it had scheduled for  launch on April  12 from 
KSC  the  remanifested  Space  Shuttle  51-D  mission w i th   landing on  KSC’s 
Space  Shuttle runway after the f i d a y  78-orbit flight. 
NASA  originally scheduled mission 51-D  for  March  1 for  deployment of 
NASA’s  Long Duration Exposure Facility,  but cancelled the 51-E  Challenger 
mission and  revised the 51-D  cargo to  include LEASAT-3  and the Canadian 
communications  satellite  Anik  C-1.  Other  payloads were  the  continuous- 
flow  electrophoresis system  and the American echocardiograph experiment 
[see Apr.  121,  two middeck  student  experiments,  and  two Getaway  Special 
canisters. (NASA Release 85-47)  

July  12:  Space  Shuttle  mission  51-F  was  aborted  today  at  three  seconds 
before liftoff when the orbiter Challenger‘s onboard computer automatically 
shut down the main engines,  Spaceport N e w s  reported. Seconds  after main 
engine  start,  main  engine  No.  2  lost  redundancy  to  operate  the  chamber 
coolant valve.  NAWs  ground  rule restricted launching without an  operating 
backup system  in  that area of the main propulsion system. Although the valve 
did assume  its proper  position after  a command  from  a backup system,  the 
loss of  redundancy resulted in  a major component  failure  flag being sent  to 
the orbiter‘s  computers. 
Challenger  Commander  Gordon  Fullerton  later  thanked  the  Kennedy 
Space Center team on behalf of the crew,  saying the team acted quickly and 
professionally and that at no time did the crew feel apprehensive.  In answer- 
ing  a Washington P o s t   reporter‘s  question  later,  Fullerton said,  “We  a l l  have 
mixed  emotions  here,  but  we’re  thankful  the  system  worked  the  way  i t  
should.  It was  the  longest three seconds  I’ve  ever  experienced.” 
Launch  operations  manager Thomas  Utsman said  that  crews  would strip 
parts  o f   the  malfunctioning  engine  and  that  engineers  had  identified  four 
different parts  that  could have failed when  they  should have been pumping 
fuel  from  the hydrogen tank  into the engine chamber. 
When the liquid-fuel engines ignited, valves that fed fuel into the chambers 
were fully open so  engines could attain speed instantly. Just before liftoff, the 
valves  were  partially closed  to  cool engines  slightly and  p w n t  too  much 
fuel  from  entering the  chamber.  The  valw  on  main  engine  No.  2  failed  to 
close partially, signaling the computer to shut down the system.

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

The  first  Space  Shuttle abort  occurred  June 26,  1984,  when  an  onboard 
computer  shut  down  two of  Discovery’s  three  engines  four  seconds  before 
liftoff. That abort triggered an  investigation that  led to a complete overhaul of 
Discovery‘s main engines. NASA  had to move Discovery back to the Vehicle 
Assembly  Building where  its cargo was  rem& 
and placed aboard another 
orbiter that flew  into space  two months  later. 
“We  don’t  think  the  engine  valve  itself  failed  the  way  a  valve  fa i led   the 
[other] time we  had a launch abort,”  Space  Shuttle program manager Robert 
Lindstrom said.  “ I   really believe there’s  a fair  likelihood we’ll  get off again  in  
another week.” 
The  delay  did  haw  an  impact  on  the  mission’s  objectives.  The  infrared 
telescope in Challenger‘s  cargo bay could be operated successfully only  in a 
completely dark sky.  Had the flight left on schedule,  the sky would have been 
dark  for most of the following seven days  until a new moon. 
NASA  had scheduled the next Space  Shuttle launch using the orbiter  Dis- 
covery  for  August  24.  It was  not  immediately  clear  how  the  Challenger‘s 
abort would affect that mission. (Spaceport News, July 19/85,  1;  W Post,  July 
13/85,  A3) 

July  15:  NASA  announced  it had  rescheduled  for  July 29   launch  of  Space 
Shuttle mission 51-F  w i th  the orbiter Challenger and delayed by  as much as 
two  weeks  the  previously  scheduled  September  19  maiden  voyage  of  the 
orbiter  Atlantis  that  was  to  carry  a  secret  Pentagon  payload  into  orbit,  the 
Washington Post reported. 
The Ju ly  12  Challenger  launch abort forced NASA  to design a new sched- 
ule  that  maintained  a  Discovery  blastoff  for  August  24,  delayed  another 
Challenger mission from October 3 to early November, and kept a November 
2 7  Atlantis flight and a  December 20  Columbia mission. 
three  parts  from 
Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  work  crews  had  rem& 
Challenger‘s  No.  2  engine  that  engineers  suspected  could  have  triggered 
computers  into ordering a l l  three engines to  shut down on  the  launch pad. 
One was  a  valve  that  failed  to  close  when  i t  should  haw,  a second  was  a 
hydraulic actuator that ordered the valve to close,  and the third was  a control- 
ler that sent  commands to the actuator. 
“We  still suspect the actuator,  and  nothing we’ve  found suggests  anything 
else,”  KSC spokesman Hugh Harris said.  “We  are replacing a l l  three parts and 
continue to analyze and test the parts we  remove.” 
NASA would test fresh parts on the pad,  leading to a July 23 flight readiness 
review.  This  included electronics and  leak checks  of  parts  like pumps,  tur- 
bines,  and valves,  not a test-firing of the engines. 
The delay meant a Ju ly  30 flight readiness firing test for Atlantis would take 
place September  12,  which would delay Atlantis‘s  maiden  flight  from  S e p  
tember  19  to  late September at  the earliest.  ( W  Post,  July 16/85,  A4)

STS 

August  14: NASA cleared today  the Space  Shuttle's  main engines for  launch, 
making  possible  an  August  24   launch  of  Discovery,  the  Washington  Pos t  
reported. Laboratory tests and a thorough examination of one of Challenger's 
engines, which prematurely s h h  down shortly after a July 29  launch, showed 
that  it was  not damaged during launch and that a pair of heat sensors, which 
mistakenly  indicated  the  engine  had  overheated,  caused  the  shutdown. 
NASA  had  fitted  Discovery with  new  heat  sensors  that  engineers  believed 
were  vastly  superior  to the ones that failed on Challenger. 
Dominick Sanchini,  executive vice  president of  Rocketdyne,  which  built 
the  hydrogen-fueled engines,  said,  "Our  analysis  has  verified  what  we  felt 
right  along was  the  probable failure  mechanism. We're  convinced  that  the 
sensors  we  haw  now have  resolved the problem we  saw  on the  last  flight." 
( W  Post, Aug  15/85,  A81 

August 2 4  Sudden squalls almost on top of the launch pad early today forced 
postponement for at  least a day  of  Space  Shuttle mission 51-1,  the  Washing- 
ton  Post  reported. A  series  of  unforecasted thunderstorms  blew  in  from  the 
mainland directly across  the  flight path,  and dark  thunderheads surrounded 
the  launch  pad  for  five  miles  in  almost  every  direction.  NASA  aborted  the 
launch five minutes before liftoff. 
NASA officials were concerned not only about  the Space  Shuttle climbing 
through  rain and  lightning but also  about  the  crew's  ability  to  see  the  KSC 
runway  in case  they had to make an  emergency  landing the early minutes of 
the flight. Rain could damage the orbiter's  tiles,  and lightning could harm its 
computers and guidance systems. 
NASA rescheduled Discoven/'s launch for between 7:57 and 8:11 a.m.  EDT 
August  25.  Among  the  factors  necessitating that  launch  window  were  the 
position of the satellite planned for salvage and timing of deployment of three 
communications  satellites.  If  an  August  25  launch  was  impossible,  there 
were  launch opportunities the following three days. 
NASA  had  announced  earlier  that  highlights of  the  eightday  mission  in- 
cluded  an  attempt  to  repair  and  salvage  the  LeasaUSyncom  /V-F3  satellite 
and deploy i t  for normal operation, and deployment of the ASC VPAM-D  for 
the American Satellite Co., the AUSSAT  VPAM-D  satellite for  the Australian 
government,  and  the  Leasat  /V-F4  satellite  for  the  U.S.  Navy.  The  physical 
vapor transport of organic solids (PVTOS) experiment sponsored by 3M Corp. 
would also  fly on  the mission. 
PVTOS was  the second of  some  70  experiments the 3M  Corp.  planned to 
conduct  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  m r  the  next  ten  years.  O n   the  51-1 
mission,  solid  materials would  vaporize  into a  gaseous  state  to  form  thick 
crystalline films on selected substrates of sublimable organics. Researchers at 
3M would study crystals produced by PWOS for their optical properties and 
other  characteristics  that  might  ultimately  have  important  applications  to 
3M's  businesses  in  electronics,  imaging, and health care.

August 25: A computer failure 25 minutes before launch today  forced post- 
ponement for  at  least two days of Space Shuttle mission 51-1, the  NY  Times 
reported.  Launch  crews  planned  to  replace  the  malfunctioning computer, 
inspect the  Space  Shuttle's  fuel  plumbing,  and  try  to  launch  Discovery on 
August 27 a t  7:02 a.m.  EDT. 
At  7:15 the  Space  Shuttle  crew  and  Johnson Space  Center  USC)  flight 
controllers  almost  simultaneously  noted warnings  that  a  backup  guidance 
and control computer was  registering errors.  This  came as  the  backup com- 
puter was  undergoing a final check to see that  its programs agreed with those 
driving the Space  Shuttle's  four main Computers. 
NASA  halted  the  launch  countdown while  engineers  at  Kennedy  Space 
Center and JSC examined data  retrieved from  the malfunctioning computer 
and  compared  it w i th   data  from  one  of  the  regular  computers.  They  con- 
cluded that the trouble was  an apparent failure in  the computer,  which could 
not be remedied  in  time for a  launch. 
That the computer worked perfectly in  tests  before August 25 and worked 
in  tests  after  the failure,  although  i t  showed  signs  of  trouble,  puzzled engi- 
neers.  NASA  was  about  99% sure  that  i t  was  a  hardware  failure,  although 
only an  inspection of  the  computer  by JSC engineers would determine the 
exact nature of the problem. 
I t  was  the second postponement in  two days for the Discovery and  i t s  crew 
of five,  and NASA officials were growing concerned that Discovery might not 
reach  orbit  in   time  for  repair  of  the  crippled  Leasat 3  satellite.  Any  delay 
beyond August 29 would cancel the repair effort,  and the crew would have to 
confine themselves to deploying three communications satellites in  the first 
three days  of  the mission. The  flight would  thus  fall  short  of  the eight days 
then planned. 
Arnold Aldrich,  manager of the  Space  Shuttle program at JSC,  said  NASA 
would  not  reschedule beyond August  29 any  attempt  to  repair  Leasat  3,  as 
that would have too disruptiw an effect on other flights scheduled in  the next 
few  months. 
If it had been only a matter of replacing the computer,  the delay would have 
been a day.  H o w r ,  the need to  inspect insulated ducts that carried liquid- 
hydrogen to the Space Shuttle's  three main engines necessitated the twoday 
postponement. After NASA  had pumped the Supercooled fuel  into the Space 
Shuttle system  two consecutiw mornings and drained  it again,  there was  a 
chance that the contractions and expansions caused by the alternating freez- 
ing cold and Florida heat might have damaged the engines, which in  extreme 
cases could cause them  to explode in  flight.  (NM, Aug 26/85, All)

STS 

Nowmber27: NASA announced that i t  had agreed w i th  the U.S.  Air Force to 
delay  the  first  Space  Shuttle  launch  from  Vandenberg Air  Force  Base  until 
mid-July 1986.  NASA  originally  scheduled  this  mission,  STS  62-A,  for  no 
earlier than March 20,  1986. 
Under Secretary  of  the Air  Force  Edward  “Pete”  Aldridge,  Jr. said,  “There 
are no major problems at the Vandenberg site. We  have  repeatedly stated that 
safety and quality would not be sacrificed for schedule. Our decision reflects 
our continued commitment to this philosophy.” 
Aldridge  added  that,  “We  have  had  to  make  some  facility  modifications 
because of what we  learned from  routine Air  ForcdNASA operational readi- 
ness inspections. We  have also added time to the schedule to allow for better 
preparation  and  evaluation  of  the  operational  systems  tests  and  we  have 
extended the  training  period for  the  launch crew  of  this  historic,  first West 
Coast shuttle mission. 
”This  revised schedule w i l l  permit us  to complete ongoing modifications, 
inspections,  rework  and  operational  testing  with  higher  confidence  than 
could be permitted w i th   the  March 20  schedule,”  he  added.  “It  also  mini- 
mizes the potential for conflict w i th  the NASA  Ulysses and Galileo planetary 
missions scheduled in  May.“ 
NASA  Office  of  Space  Flight  associate  administrator  Jesse Moore  con- 
curred,  adding,  “NASA  agrees  completely with the Air  Force regarding Van- 
denberg. Our first commitment i s  to the safety of the crew and the  reliability 
of the vehicle and launch systems. The development of the Vandenberg site i s  
proceeding very smoothly.  This  readjustment gives  us  a l l  more time to carry 
out our commitment to safety  and  reliability.” 
The decision to delay meant NASA would deliver the orbiter Discovery to 
Vandenberg around March 1,  1986,  and  NASA  and Air  Force officials would 
continue to evaluate the STS  62-A  schedule in  order to establish after January 
1 a firm  launch date.  (NASA Release 85-158) 

December  7 7 :   NASA said today  i t  postponed the December 18  launch of the 
Space Shuttle Columbia on mission 61-C  for 24 hours because tired workers 
had fallen behind in  countdown tasks,  the Washington Post reported. “Essen- 
tially  there were too many tasks  to complete and too  little time to complete 
them,”  NASA  spokesman George Diller said.  “We  felt it was  more prudent to 
delay  than  to  take  a chance on making a mistake.”  D i l ler  added  that  crews 
used up more than eight hours of contingency time bu i l t  into the countdown 
as  they worked through the night December 16  to complete checkout of the 
engine compartment. 
NASA  rescheduled the  launch for  7 a.m.  December 19.  (WPost, Dec 128/ 
85,  A17) 

December  7 9 :   A  hydraulic  pump  in  a  booster  rocket attached to  the  Space 
Shuttle  Columbia  fa i led   today,  halting the  launch  countdown  14  seconds 

305 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

before  liftoff  and  delaying  STS  mission  61-C  until  early  in   1986,  the  N Y  
Times reported. The shutdown came four seconds before ignition of the three 
main  engines.  NASA  had  called  for  a  delay  of  54  minutes  earlier  in   the 
morning when clouds moved over  the Kennedy Space Center  (KSC). 
NASA aborted the countdown when a computer on the ground sensed that 
a pump on one of the Space Shuttle’s  solid-fuel rocket boosters was  spinning 
at 86,000  rpm,  exceeding the turbine’s  “red  line”  limits by almost 7,000  rpm. 
The  device,  described  as  a  hydraulic  power  unit,  provided  power  so  the 
nozzle of the solid-fuel rocket booster could pivot slightly in  flight,  helping to 
control  the  direction  of  the  orbiter‘s  ascent.  NASA  officials  indicated there 
was  a backup  pump on the booster,  but that,  if a single  pump failed before 
liftoff, safety  precautions called for  abort of the countdown. 
That  particular hydraulic  power  unit  had flown  twice before on  the  resu- 
able  solid-fuel  rocket boosters,  NASA  officials said,  and similar devices  had 
flown up to four times before requiring replacement.  I t  was  the first failure in  
the Space  Shuttle program of  that particular part. 
NASA  would  have  to  repair  or  replace  the  failed  pump  and  said  it  had 
rescheduled the launching for January 4,  1986, so  there would be no interfer- 
ence w i th   the  holidays. The  delay  until January would  also  allow  NASA  to 
avoid  paying  the  Air  Force  to  keep  open  i t s   Eastern  Test  Range  a t   Cape 
Canawral  and  paying  launch  pad  workers  tr ip le t ime   pay  for  working be- 
tween Christmas and New Year‘s,  the Washington Post  reported. “The  team  i s  
obviously disappointed,”  said  Robert Sieck,  director of  Space Shuttle opera- 
tions  a t   KSC.  “But  we’re  going to  isolate the  problem and  fix  it and  get  on 
w i th  the  launch process.” 
NASA  said  the delay would  haw  no  impact on  the  16  Space  Shuttle mis- 
sions,  including 61-C,  that i t  had scheduled for  1986. ( N Y  Times,  Dec 20/85, 
B10;  W Post,  Dec 20/85,  A2) 

Main Engines 

February 7:  NASA announced award of a $2,374,800  fixed-price contract to 
Stearns Catalytic Corp.  to modify a test stand at  the National Space Technol- 
ogy  Laboratories (NSTL), Hancock County,  Mississippi, to give  NSTL  a  third 
test position to static-fire individually Space Shuttle main engines. The struc- 
tural,  mechanical,  and  electrical  modifications  would  begin  no  later  than 
March 1985 for  completion  in  a year. 
Space  Shuttle mainengine testing had begun at  NSTL  in  June 1975,  using 
test  stands  A-1  and  A-2 
for  singleengine  testing  of  flight  and  nonflight 
engines. Later NASA used the 8-2  test position to certify the main propulsion 
system  in  a series of threeengine cluster firings. The additional test position 
would support projected increases in  mainengine test  requirements,  includ- 
ing increased turbopump production rates. NASA would initially use the new 

306 

STS 

6-2  position to test  new and m r h a u l e d  engine turbopumps using a testbed 
engine. 
NASA  had originally used the  6-2  test  stand  in  the  1960s to flightcertify 
the Apollo/Saturn V  space vehicle’s  first stage.  (NASA  Release 85-19) 

July 30:  NASA  announced that,  based  on a review of engine data following 
the July 29 Space Shuttle mission 51-F  launch,  Marshall Space Flight Center 
and  Kennedy  Space  Center  engineers  believed  that  failed  sensors-not  an 
engine failure-were  the probable cause of the main engine No.  1 shut down 
[see Space Transportation System/Missions, July 291. 
The  data suggested  the high-pressure fuel turbopump on that engine per- 
formed  normally,  because there were  no  indications the pump was  running 
hot.  If the  pump were  running hot,  Johnson Space  Center  flight  engineers, 
who  monitored engine performance during ascent,  would have expected to 
see changes in  the position of an oxidizer valve indicating an  increased flow 
to supply the pump w i th  more power. Data showed the valve position did not 
change. A  second data indication of normal pump performance was  present 
in  the engine discharge pressures,  which were monitored by ground control- 
lers and the main engine controller. 
Based  on  these  indications,  NASA  engineers  reviewing the  cause  of  the 
engine shutdown tentatively concluded that the main engine controller was 
receiving faulty data from  failed sensors.  Resistance measurements taken  by 
the engine controller provided an  indicator of pump temperatures,  because 
the  resistance increased as  the  temperature  increased.  The  controller  logic 
was  able to distinguish,  w i th in  certain  limits,  a valid  reading from  one  that 
indicated  the  sensor  wire,  a very  thin  wire,  was  broken or  had  otherwise 
failed. 
The controller recognized the bad reading from the Channel B sensor;  the 
reading  from  Channel  A,  howewr,  drifted,  indicating  a  temperature  rise 
above  the  redline  limit.  Because  of  the  failure mode  in  the  second  sensor, 
which  gave  readings  above  the  redline  l im i t   but  below  those  that  would 
cause the controller to disregard them as unreasonable and thus indicative of 
a sensor  failure,  the  engine controller  believed there w a s   a  possible pump 
problem and shut down the engine. 
A  temperature sensor on main engine No.  3 also failed. Because there was 
a  history  of  these  temperature  sensors  failing  on  previous  Space  Shuttle 
flights,  NASA  decided  to  dew lop   a  new  sensor  for  use  on  future  Space 
Shuttle flights beginning w i th  mission 51-1. 
Un t i l  such time as  NASA  confirmed this explanation by an  examination of 
the engine and  i ts  various systems,  NASA would not launch another mission. 
Howaner, the agency did not anticipate that this would result in  a delay in  the 
next mission. 
The call “abort  to orb i t”  used to describe the action ordered for the July 29 
Space  Shuttle flight was  the preferred type of Space Shuttle launch “abort”  in  

307 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

that  i t  gave  the crew,  the orbiter,  and  the ground controllers time  to  review 
options and to ascertain that the crew and orbiter were  in  good condition.  In 
nearly all  cases,  the  abort-toorbit  contingency  would  allow  completion  of 
most of a particular mission's  flight  requirements. 
Once  NASA  determined  that  an  orbiter  was  in   a  safe  orbit  (minimum 
would be about 105 nautical miles circular),  then the crew and ground flight 
controllers could begin to assess the impact on planned mission activities.  In 
the orbit achieved was  106 by  146 nautical miles, 
the case of mission 51-F, 
40 miles short of  the  planned designations;  the orbiter was  at  a velocity of 
25,760  feet-per-second,  which was  110  feet-per-second  less than planned. 
NASA determined a l l  abort modes based on the weight  of  the orbiter,  the 
inclination of  the desired orbit,  and other  characteristics.  Each  mode had a 
specific applicable time and duration during the ascent phase,  and crew and 
ground  controllers  practiced  these  contingency  situations  regularly.  (NASA 
Release 85-114) 

September 4:  NASA announced that  Lewis Research Center (LeRC) and Mar- 
shall Space Flight Center (MSFC) were pursuing a 10-year program scheduled 
for completion  in  1991 to improve Space Shuttle engine performance, reduce 
operational costs,  and develop advanced engine technology for  future space 
travel. 
Although  the  Space  Shuttle  propulsion  system  had  performed  well  for  a 
number of  space  missions,  i t  incorporated state-of-the-art  technology at  the 
time of its development some 15 years before, so  NASA believed the engine's 
operational  life  and  performance  levels  could  be  improved.  According  to 
Stanley Marsik,  LeRC's  Space Shuttle main engine technology program man- 
ager,  "The  current engine represents the first generation of  reusable engines. 
In  a way,  the first  reusable space  engine can be compared w i th  the Model-T 
automobile.  Now  that we  have  experienced numerous flights w i th   this  en- 
gine,  we  have  learned how to improve its  life and performance. We  now are 
working towards advancing the technologies necessary  to support those  im- 
provements." 
In the age of  reusable Space Shuttle engines,  demands would  increase for 
higher performance w i th   lighter weight components,  resulting in  higher o p  
erating pressures and temperatures and increased mechanical vibrations and 
fuel  f low   turbulence.  The  system  also  severely  taxed  engine  components 
such as  turbine  blades,  bearings,  seals,  fuel ducting,  and combustion cham- 
bers. 
Engineers were studying new high-temperature,  high-strength metal alloys 
and other advanced materials such as  new protective coatings and combus- 
tion processes.  Researchers using advanced computer modeling techniques 
studied  loads  on   turbine  blades  and  fuel  flow,  and  examined  the  use  of 
hydrostatic ball bearings where a f i lm  of gas would separate the bearing from 
metal surfaces,  resulting i n  no metal-temetal  contact. 

308 

STS 

Engineers were developing new methods of measuring wear  and deteriora- 
tion,  so  parts would be replaced only when  necessary,  and studying ways  to 
monitor engine health by means of a series of computerconnected diagnos- 
tic sensors on the engine to signal deviations from  normal performance and 
to facilitate more economical on-the-ground maintenance. 
The two centers had formed ten disciplinary groups to work with some 130 
different  technology  elements  of  engine  design.  Rocketdyne  Division  of 
Rockwell  Internatl.,  engine  manufacturer,  and  other  NASA  contractors and 
several  universities were  supporting the program. (NASA Release 85-122) 

September 6 :  Marshall Space  Flight Center  (MSFC) announced i t  had sched- 
uled for September 12 a t  Kennedy Space Center a 20-second on-the-pad test 
firing of the Space  Shuttle orbiter Atlantis’s  three main engines to verify the 
flight readiness of Atlantis-the 
fourth and newest of the Space Shuttle orbiter 
fleet. 
The flight readiness firing  in  a launchday environment would exercise the 
Space  Shuttle’s  main propulsion system  and  computer  programs to demon- 
strate  the proper  integration of  all elements prior to the first Atlantis  launch 
scheduled for October 3 for mission 51-J.  Engineers had previously test fired 
each engine  individually at NASA‘s  National Space Technology Laboratories. 
On  September 9 a firing simulation would kick off preparations for the test. 
The  one-day  test  would check  out  critical  flight and ground computer  sys- 
tems  that  controlled  the  actual  engine  firing  and  give  the  Space  Shuttle 
launch team  a chance to  re-review test procedures. 
Countdown for the flight readiness firing would begin at 4:OO  a.m.  Septem- 
ber  10,  with  the  clock  a t   the T-43  hour mark,  and culminate w i th   the  20 -  
second static  firing. 
Three days of preparations would precede the firing countdown,  including 
purging the external tank w i th  inert gases,  installing special firing instrumen- 
tation,  and mounting a  radiation shield on  the deck  of the mobile launcher 
platform to protect the solid-fuel rocket boosters and external tank structures 
during the test firing. Total  flight readiness firing,  including pre- and post-test 
activities, would span s ix  days and require support from personnel and opera- 
tions from various  NASA  centers  including MSFC and Kennedy and Johnson 
Space Centers. 
Events  leading to the September 12 engine firing would be nearly identical 
to  those  that  preceded  an  actual  Space  Shuttle  launch,  w i th   built-in  holds 
distributed throughout the countdown a t  the same  times they occurred  in  an 
actual  launch countdown. 
An  automated ground  launch sequencer would control the final nine min- 
utes of the countdown. The sequencer performed the final series of events  in 
a specific order,  monitored various measurements of out-of-tolerance condi- 
tions,  and  detected  system  malfunctions  for  which  i t  would  automatically 
stop the countdown. 

309 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Following the test,  technicians would  inspect externally and  internally the 
three main engines to verify their readiness for flight. These post-firing activi- 
ties would take about  11  days.  (MSFC Release 85-44)  

Management 

March  7:  Construction was  proceeding at  Kennedy Space  Center  (KSC)  to- 
ward the October completion of the Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) logis- 
tics facility to  house approximately  190,000  items of  Space  Shuttle program 
stock,  including  orbiter  fuel  cells,  various  electrical  components,  tires, 
brakes,  windows,  nuts,  bolts,  and  washers  then  stored  in  three  KSC  ware- 
houses  and  four  areas  of  Cape  Canaveral  Air  Force  Station,  the  Spaceport 
N e w s  reported. NASA would consolidate seven  Lockheed Logistics Director- 
ate  departments  and  its  own  Launch  Support  Services  Directorate at  the 
facility,  w i th   500 Lockheed and  NASA  employees working in  75,000  sq.  ft. 
(about a quarter of the total) set  aside for office space. 
The  Lockheed-managed  facility  would  be  KSC's  first  automated  logistics 
warehouse for storage of flight hardware and SPC  ground-support equipment. 
An  automated  inventory  system  would  interface w i th   the  Shuttle  Inventory 
Management  System  (SIMS)  and  a  manual  system.  Retrieval  procedures 
would require four  roboticized forklifts to find and fetch  items,  an  automatic 
conveyor, and a manned,  three-story high forklift. 
As  part of the SPC agreement,  Lockheed selected Austin Co.  as  the facility's 
architectural and engineering firm and builder at a basic design and construc- 
tion cost of about $16  million.  (Spaceport N ew s ,   Mar  1/85,  1) 

April  72:  National Space Transportation System  manager Dr.  Glynn Lunney, 
who was  a member of the Space  Task  Group that  inaugurated US. manned 
space flight,  announced he would leave NASA  in  the near future,  the Johnson 
Space Center Space N ew s  Roundup reported. 
Lunney,  whose career almost exactly  spanned the period of  U.S.  efforts in  
space,  began  his  government  service  in   1958  w i th   the  National  Advisory 
Committee  for  Aeronautics,  NA!jA's  predecessor,  at  Lewis  Research Center. 
He  then  moved  to  the  Space  Task  Group and  w i th   i t   to  Houston  when  i t  
became the Manned Spacecraft Center.  Later he became head of the mission 
logic and  computer  hardware section,  chief of  the  flight  dynamics branch, 
flight director for the Gemini program,  and,  in  July 1968, one year  before the 
first manned landing on the moon, chief of the flight director's office. He then 
served  as  special assistant  to  the manager  and  then  manager  of  the  Apollo 
spacecraft program. 
With the advent of the Space  Shuttle program,  he became manager of  the 
Space  Shuttle payload integration and development program responsible for 

310 

STS 

directing  the  planning  and  implementation  for  all  payloads  and  payload 
carriers in that program. 
Since  1981  he  served  as  manager  of  the  National  Space  Transportation 
Systems  Program  w i th   responsibility for  overall  systems  management and 
integration of all elements of the program. 
Among  the awards  received by  Lunney were  the  Lawrence Sperry Award, 
the Arthur  S .   Fleming Award,  the  Louis W.  Hill Space Transportation Award, 
the  Allan  D.  Emil  Memorial Award,  the W.  Randolph  Lovelance  II  Award, 
three  NASA  Group Achievement Awards,  two  NASA  Distinguished Service 
Medals, an Outstanding Leadership Medal, Senior Executive Service designa- 
tions,  and  an  honorary doctorate  of  laws  from  the  University of  Scranton. 
Lunney was  a Fellow of  the American Astronautical Society and the Ameri- 
can Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. USC Space News Roundup,  Apr

A p r i l  29: NASA  and  the  Defense  Department  (DOD) w i th   White  House 
concurrence abandoned any consideration of  transferring the management of 
Space  Shuttle operations  to  a commercial  venture  or  quasi-public corpora- 
tion for the foreseeable future,  Aviation Week  reported. The decision would 
thwart  plans of  commercial  ventures  that  had sought  the  combined  Space 
Shuttle managemendmarketing role.  The Shuttle Operations  Strategic Plan- 
ning Group, a team made up  of officials from NASA,  DOD,  the White House, 
and  private  enterprise,  said  ”.  . . the  suggestion  that  the  space  shuttle 
should  or  could  be  transferred,  sold  or  leased  to  private  enterprise  for  i t s  
operation,  marketing and future development  i s  simply  not a viable alterna- 
tive for the foreseeable future.” 
Although  some  commercial  space  officials  called  the  group’s  study  a 
“whitewash,”  others believed the decision could introduce more Space Shut- 
tle launch and cost stability,  a critical  issue with a large segment of  commer- 
cial  space ventures that  needed Space Shuttle transportation  no matter who 
was  managing it. 
DOD Space  Shuttle military spaceflight  requirements,  including the p 
tential  for  Strategic  Defense  Initiative Space  Shuttle  activity,  were  key  e l e  
ments  i n  the  decision  not  to   take  management of  the  program away  from 
NASA. 
As  a result of the decision,  NASA would have to create a new management 
structure  in   order  to   get  the  Space  Shuttle  out  of  existing development- 
oriented management.  ‘As  the  shuttle evolves  and the  flight  rate increases,” 
the strategic planning group said,  “organizational  realignments within  NASA 
w i l l  become necessary to ensure that NASA’s  R&D and shuttle operations do 
not detract from  one another but are  mutually supportive.”  (AvWk,  Apr  29/

July 26:  In  an  administrative  realignment  reflecting  the  maturation  of  the 
Space  Shuttle  program,  NASA  announced  the  appointment  of  Arnold  A l-  
drich, a 26-year NASA veteran and head of the Space Shuttle projects office a t  
the Johnson Space Center USC),  to manager of the National Space Transporta- 
tion  System  (NSTS).  He  would  f i l l   the  vacancy  left  when  Glynn  Lunney 
retired in  April. 
The  Level  II NSTS  organization at JSC would assimilate the projects office, 
consolidating all  program  elements  under  Aldrich.  With  this  combined  re- 
sponsibility,  Aldrich  would  take  charge  of  integration of  a l l   Space  Shuttle 
program elements  including flight software,  orbiter,  external  tank,  solid-fuel 
rocket boosters, main engines,  payloads, payload carriers,  and Space  Shuttle 
facilities.  His responsibilities would  also  include directing the  planning for 
NSTS  operations and  for  management of  orbiter and  government  furnished 
equipment  projects.  NASA  named  Richard Kohrs,  who was  acting program 
manager,  and  Lt.  Col. Thomas  Redmond,  U.S. Air  Force,  deputy managers. 
In a  related move,  Thomas  Utsman,  head  of  Space  Shuttle management 
and operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), would become deputy direc- 
tor of KSC,  w i th  NASA dividing shuttle management and operations into two 
primary organizations: Shuttle engineering and Shuttle operations. The engi- 
neering directorate,  headed by  Horace Lamberth,  would expand to  include 
skills  necessary  for  sustaining  engineering  of  the  orbiter.  The  operations 
directorate,  headed by Robert Sieck,  would retain all functions necessary  to 
manage day-today Space  Shuttle processing and  its logistical support. 
NASA would  transfer  later  in  the year  from Johnson Space Center to  KSC 
launch support services and orbiter thermal protection system manufacturing 
contracts,  functions  closely  associated w i th   KSC  responsibilities for  Space 
Shuttle maintenance and  launch preparation. At  the beginning of  1986, KSC 
would  take  over  logistics  responsibility  for  spare  parts  refurbishment  and 
procurement  and  would  assume  sustaining engineering  responsibility  for 
orbiter subsystems.  (NASA Release 85-112) 

ju ly29 :  NASA officials said they might alter Space Shuttle launch countdown 
procedures  to  avoid  the  type  of  last-second  problem  that  forced  postpone- 
ment  of  mission  51-F  earlier  in   July  [see  Space  Transportation  System, 
Launch Schedules, Ju ly  121,  the NY  Times reported. 
Jesse Moore,  NASA associate administrator,  said  in  an  interview that  “We 
want  to minimize the chances of a needless shutdown. There may  be a way 
to soften up some of our criteria. “Before you take off on an airplane the p i lo t  
normally  tries  all  his  flaps  and  hydraulics,”  Moore said.  “We  don’t  have  a 
chance to do that on the launch pad right now, and we want to perform those 
kinds of checks.” 
Moore  indicated  new  procedures  being  considered  for  the  countdown 
included increasing the amount of time allowed for the Space Shuttle’s com- 
puters to verify  the correct functioning of the engine valves  and  broadening 

312  

STS 

the  criteria  under  which  they  were  meant  to  operate.  Moore  added  that 
criteria  for  safety  would  not  change.  The  new  procedures would  add  “no 
risk”  to  crew members,  he said. 
The consideration of  new procedures  likely reflected growing confidence 
in   the  Space  Shuttle  as  well  as  concern  about  foreign  competition  for 
launches. NASA officials said Space Shuttle launches must proceed smoothly 
and  regularly  i f  the  program  i s   to  be  a  commercial  success  and  that  the 
current  schedule  called  for  one  launch a month,  eventually  going  to  one 
every two weeks.  (NYT; July 29/85,  A8) 

November 5:  NASA  announced  selection of  Boeing Service  Internatl.,  Inc. 
and United Technologies Corp.  for  negotiations leading to award  cf a single 
contract for  flight equipment  processing at  the Johnson Space Center  (JSC). 
The  contract,  cowr ing   a  basic  period of  three  years  plus  a  single  priced 
option for an additional two years,  would be for services expected to begin in  
January 1986.  Follow-on  awards  could  ultimately  result  i n  a  total  contract 
period of  15  years. 
JSC would manage the work under a cost-plus-incentidaward-fee contract 
arrangement  that  would  include  incentive fee  on  sound cost  management 
and an  award fee  on the basis of performance. 
The  contractor  selected after  final  negotiations would  be  responsible for 
receipt,  launch preparation,  and  postlaunch activities related  to  the  overall 
processing of  crewrelated  flight  equipment  required  to  support  the  Space 
Transportation System program. The contractor would processhesupply indi- 
vidual  equipment  items  in  preparation  for  launch and  would  operate  and 
maintain  assigned  facilities and  support  equipment  required  for  successful 
equipment  processing.  Equipment covered  under the  contract  included  ex- 
travehicular mobility units (spacesuits), food and medical systems,  communi- 
cations equipment,  display and control equipment, and other miscellaneous 
items. 
The competitive procurement consolidated under one contract work previ- 
ously performed by  16  firms  under  19  contracts.  (NASA Release 85-149) 

December 5:  NASA’s  Johnson Space Center  (JSC) announced signing today 
w i th   Rockwell  Shuttle Operations Co.  a  cost-plus-incentidaward-fee  con- 
tract  for  Space  Transportation System  operations  (STSOC) [see  Space  Trans- 
portation SystedManagement, Sept.  121. JSC estimated the first two years of 
the contract,  starting January 1,  1986, to  be valued at  $378,536,000  and the 
follow-on  two-year extension option from January 1,  1988 through December 
31,  1989  at  about  $374 ,320 ,000   for  a  possible  four-year  total  of 
$752,846,000. 
Rockwell’s STSOC tasks  would  include project management; maintenance

December  78:  NASA announced that  it had selected Boeing Aerospace O p  
erations to  receive the Flight Equipment Processing Contract (FEPC) at John- 
son  Space  Center  (JSC). Wornick  Co.  was  a  Boeing  subcontractor.  The 
three-year award w i th  a two-year priced option would begin in January 1986 
at an estimated total cost of  $76.5  million. The contract also included provi- 
sions  for  two  additional  unpriced,  fiveyear  extensions. JSC would  manage 
the work  under a cost-plus  incentidaward-fee contract arrangement, which 
included incentive fee  for sound cost management and an  award  fee  based 
on performance. 
Under the contract,  Boeing would assume responsibility for receipt,  launch 
preparation,  and  postlauch activities relating to  the overall  process  of  crew- 
related flight and flight-type equipment  required to support the Space Trans- 
portation  System  program.  The  contractor  would  process  and  resupply 
individual  flight  equipment  items,  which  supported  the  flight  crew  in   i t s  
daily operation of  the orbiter vehicle,  and would  operate and maintain s u p  
port equipment  required  for  the  successful  processing of  the  flight  e q u i p  
ment,  which  included  extravehicular  mobility  units,  food  and  medical 
systems,  communications equipment,  and other miscellaneous items. 
In addition  to  Boeing,  NASA  conducted final  negotiations with  Hamilton 
Standard Management Services,  Inc. The selection of Boeing for the contract 
represented the consolidation  into one contract of work currently performed 
by  16 firms  under  19 contracts. (NASA  Release 85-174) 

Military Applications 

lanuary  1 8  The expected January 23  flight of the orbiter Discovery would  be 
the  first  of  15  Space  Shuttle  flights  devoted  wholly  to  military  purposes, 
Science reported,  increasing the visibility of  the military role in  the program. 
Discovery  would  carry  a  reconnaissance  satellite  designed  to  intercept  a 
wide variety of electronic communications,  radar signals, and telemetry from 
intercontinental  ballistic missile tests.  After  several orbits,  the Space Shuttle 
would discharge the satellite from its payload bay and a booster rocket would 
push  it to  an  altitude of  about  35,000  km,  where  it would  "park"  over  the 
USSR. 

314  

STS 

NASA estimated about 30% of Space Shuttle flights over the next 10 years 
would be military missions, although NASA's  civilian budget had paid almost 
all  basic  costs  of  the  Space  Shuttle  and  associated  launch  and  servicing 
equipment  (estimated at  more than  $15  billion).  In addition,  military needs 
had dictated that the Space Shuttle have  unusually  large wings,  rugged ther- 
mal  protection,  an  unusually  large  payload  bay,  and  unusually  powerful 
engines;  however,  the  Pentagon had  borne  none of  these  added  costs.  Al- 
though  some  NASA  expenditures were  for  items  serving both  military and 
civilian functions,  such as  improved engines for both the orbiter and a rocket 
booster  and  onboard  experiments  in   flight  aerodynamics,  plasma physics, 
astronomy,  biology, chemistry, and radiation, NASA paid for all these projects 
without any  Department of  Defense assistance. (Science, Jan 18/85,  276) 

january24: NASA  launched today at 2:50  p.m.  EST  the Space Shuttle Discov- 
ery mission 51-C  w i th   i t s  five-man military crew to carry out secret military 
objectives,  the N Y  Times reported.  NASA, which had delayed launch due to 
subfreezing  temperatures  [see  STS/Launch  Schedules,  Jan. 231,  did  not an- 
nounce  liftoff time  until nine minutes before  launch.  One and a half hours 
after  launch,  Houston  Mission  Control  reported  the  Space  Shuttle  had 
reached its  intended orbit,  the altitude and position of which were secret. 
How   long the  astronauts would  remain  in orbit was  unknown;  although 
most Space  Shuttle flights  lasted five to  eight  days,  the  apparent  Discovery 
mission to  launch a single satellite might  l im i t  i t  to three or four days. 
Discovery carried a 32,000-lb.  propulsion,  inertial upper stage  capable of 
boosting  a  large  satellite  to  22,300 miles  above  the  equator  south  of  the 
USSR .   This  was  the  first  test  of  the  rocket  system  since  a  predecessor  had 
misfired on a Space Shuttle mission in  April  1983. 
Many newspapers had already  published reports,  based on information  in 
the aerospace trade  press and other  unclassified documents,  that  the  secret 
payload was an electronic spy satellite. Both the U.S.  and USSR  had engaged 
i n  electronic  eavesdropping from  orbit  for  several  years,  and  the  USSR   had 
obtained many of the plans and engineering information for the earlier U.S. 
electronic  reconnaissance satellite  Rhyolite.  The  Carter  administration  had 
cancelled an advanced version of Rhyolite, the Argus,  but the Reagan admin- 
istration  had  revived  the  project.  Most  reports  described  the  Discovery's 
payload as the most advanced and sensitive form of orbital electronic spying. 
The  Air  Force  began  an  investigation  to  find  the  officials  or  contractor 
employees who  had  provided  information  about the  secret  payload aboard 
Discovery,  the  Washington Post reported.  Inquiries were  not aimed at  news 
organizations, Michael  Burch, a Department of  Defense (DOD) spokesman, 
had said. When questioned about a photo of an  early-warning satellite  p u b  
lished on  the cover of Aviation  Wee&, Burch said the picture should not have 
appeared.  However,  the Pentagon later acknowledged that the Air  Force had 

315  

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

given the photo to the magazine after determining it was  unclassified.  Burch 
refused to  say  what  action  the  government would  take  i f   i t  could  identify 
those who  leaked information on the Space Shuttle mission. 
Brig. Gen.  Richard Abel  had previously warned  reporters not to speculate 
about  the  Space  Shuttle's  cargo.  After  the  Washington Post  had  reported  i t  
was  an  intelligence  satellite  intended  to  eavesdrop on  the  USSR,  Defense 
Secretary  Caspar  Weinberger  had said  the  story  might  have  given  "aid  and 
comfort  to  the  enemy."  Abel  later  had  told  a  Univ.  of  Georgia journalism 
class  that  little  or  nothing  in  the  Post  story  was  not  available  from  public 
sources. 
Aviation Weeks January 21 issue had described the Pentagon's  next genera- 
tion  of  early-warning  surveillance  satellites,  which  would  monitor  m iss i le  
and spacecraft launches from Soviet territory and be protected against Soviet 
laser weapons.  (NYT, Jan 25/85,  A l ;   W  Post, Jan 25/85,  A3) 

lanuary  27:  The  first  military mission of  the  Space  Shuttle ended the  after- 
noon of January 27 when Discovery landed,  in  excellent condition w i th  only 
minor  damage  to   a dozen  heat  protection  tiles,  at  KSC  surrounded  by the 
same  secrecy  in  which  the  mission  had  begun,  the  Washington  Times  re- 
ported. The five-man crew had b lown  bosuns' whistles and rung ships'  bells 
i n  greeting to  flight controllers;  however,  in  keeping w i th  the flight's  secrecy, 
the public did not hear the salute. 
During the flight,  a $50 m i l l ion  rocket booster called IUS, which had failed 
on  its only previous Space Shuttle assignment,  had successfully propelled a 
satellite from  the  Space  Shuttle's  lowsar th  orbit  to  a  listening post  22,300 
miles high. NASA would use the IUS on its next flight,  scheduled for February 
20,  to  boost a communications satellite to a 22,300-mile  high orbit. 
Discovery's  return was  a surprise,  as  observe!s  had believed  i t  would  stay 
up another day,  possibly two.  NASA had ordered the ship home early,  appar- 
ently  because weather conditions  for a KSC  landing had deteriorated. 
Sources  reported  the crew  had  released a s p y   satellite  during the  first  10 
hours of  the  mission.  The Air  Force  said  only  that  the  rocket carrying  the 
Space Shuttle's cargo to higher orbit "successfully met i t s  mission objectives" 
and would  not confirm reports that the cargo was  an  advanced s p y   satellite, 
first of a new generation capable of  intercepting radio,  radietelephone,  and 
digital communications from ground and space,  or the satellite's orbit param- 
eters. 
Four  private  planes  had  violated  the  security  zone  around  KSC  during 
preparations for  Discovery's  landing,  the  Washington  Post  reported  the  Air 
Force as  saying,  the  8th  time  in   15  Space  Shuttle missions that  planes had 
violated  restricted airspace during  launch or  landing.  The  Federal  Aviation 
Administration  had suspended the flying licenses of some violators for up to 
90  days  because  of  dangers  p o s e d   by  intruding  pilots.  The  problem  had 

316 

STS 

grown  so  serious that  the Air  Force  had  improved the  security zone around 
KSC.  ( W  Post,  Jan 28/85,  A l l   A3,  A9;  W Times,  Jan 28/85,  3A,  Jan 29/85,4A) 
February 5:  In  a  speech  today  to  the  Washington  chapter  of  the  National 
Security Industrial Association,  NASA  Administrator James Beggs  addressed 
the  issue  of  NASA's  role  in  assisting the  Department of  Defense  (DOD)  in  
national  defense.  After  touching  on  the  media  attention  given  the  recent 
secret  launch of a military payload,  Beggs  said  the fuss  "stemmed,  I believe, 
from a misapprehension that the nation's  civilian space program was  about to 
be taken  over  by  the military. As  one  news  organization put  i t  sternly:  'The 
line i s  being crossed.' 
"Well,  let me  set  the  record  straight:'  he  continued.  "Nothing  could  be 
further from  the truth.  On  the  last mission we  d id  what we  always try  to do. 
And that  i s  to satisfy our commercial customers,  be they civilian or military." 
Beggs  went  on  to  trace  the  history of  U.S.  military aeronautical develop 
ments and pointed out that many of the early astronauts were former military 
pilots  and  that  almost  100  military  detailees  worked  at  NASA,  mostly  at 
Johnson Space Center USC).  He also referred to other shared assets,  including 
the  KSC  launch facilities,  and  to the aerospace  technology that  the  military 
employed,  practically all of which stemmed from a NASA-developed technol- 
ogy  base. 
Beggs concluded by saying NASA and DOD's  Space Shuttle program c o o p  
erative efforts began in  1969 and that DOD  had priority on the Space Shuttle 
manifest  for  missions of  national  security.  "Our  challenge  i s   to continue to 
work  together to  secure our  future,  on  earth and  in  space."  (NASA  Release 
85-18) 

March 2 9  The Teal  Ruby experimental spacebased aircraft detection system, 
which  had encountered technical problems, would fly on  the Space Shuttle 
around  March  1986,  Defense  Daily  reported.  Defense Advanced  Research 
Projects Agency  (DARPA) Director  Dr.  Robert Cooper  said  DARPA  had  run 
into expected problems w i th  the Teal  Ruby flight sensor  caused by heat leaks 
in  the cryogenic system.  The  leaks  p o s e d  two problems: they  prevented the 
temperature of the instrument from getting low enough to provide necessary 
high  sensitivity  and  threatened  the  one-year  nominal  life  of  the  system. 
Cooper said the DARPA  had found all  leaks except one. 
Teal  Ruby  was  the  first  largescale  demonstration  of  a  two-dimensional, 
staring  mosaic  infrared  detector  array  and  lightweight telescope  optics.  Its 
goal  was  to  establish  the  technology  base  for  future  spacebased  infrared 
surveillance  systems  capable  of  detecting aircraft  and  other  low  threshold 
targets against the earth's  clutter background;  i t  would dew lop  a comprehen- 
s ive   radiometric background database  and space qualify the advanced tech- 
nologies embodied in  i t s  design. Teal  Ruby would be the primary payload of 
the Air  Force space  test  program satellite P80-1.  (D /D ,  Mar 29/85,  167)

lune  27: The  first  test of  a Strategic  Defense  Initiative (SDI) component  on 
June 19 ended in  failure when crew members of the Space Shuttle Discovery 
found themselves 180°  out of position to receive an Air  Force signal beamed 
at  them from Maui,  Hawaii; another beam of laser  light was  sent on June 21 
from  the  same  spot,  and  it successfully  bounced off  a  reflecting mirror  on 
Discovery, which was flying at 17,500 miles per hour and 230 miles high,  the 
Washington Post  reported. 
It was  not clear why  Discovery was  out of  position  for  the  first attempt or 
why  the  crew  had  not  realized  i t   in   time  to  correct  it.  Flight  directors  at 
Johnson Space Center  took  the blame for what  the  newspaper called easily 
one  of  the  worst  navigating  mistakes  in  more  than  20  years  of  American 
manned space flight. 
After  the successful attempt,  the Air  Force noted the test was  not  intended 
to   solve  any  of  the  most  difficult  problems  of  setting  up  an  SDI  defense 
system,  nor was  i t  the first  laser tracking test. Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Meyer, 
manager of the laser test program,  said the experiment was more a test to see 
how the atmosphere distorted the laser beam than a test of the beam’s  ability 
to  track  the  Space  Shuttle,  as  atmospheric distortion could  l im i t  the  useful- 
ness of ground-based lasers against targets  in  space. 
In  the June 21 attempt,  the  laser beam “painted”  a blue-green  light on the 
nose of  Discovery for  at  least  two-and+ne-half  minutes,  three  times  longer 
than  the  minimum  time  set  by  the  Air  Force.  So  tight  and  steady  was  the 
beam that i t  never wavered  from the nose of orbiter, which measured 110 feet 
from nose to tail. “We were able to pulse the beam and change the size of the 
beam from a fine point a quarter of an  inch across to a beam 30 feet across at 
the  point where  i t  tracked  the  shuttle:‘  Meyer said.  “We  d id  everything we 
wanted to  do.” 
Discovery’s  crew  observed from  the  port  windows  the  beam  shining  on 
them, which they could do  without danger to their eyes due to the low power 
output of the four-watt beacon. 
“We  demonstrated today that we can track a fast-moving target w i th  a laser 
on  the ground:‘  Meyer said.  “Our  next step  i s  to perform the same kind of test 
w i th  rockets fired to an altitude of 260 miles to see  i f  ground-based lasers can 
stay w i th  them all the way  to altitude.” 
A  far  more difficult  and  important  goal  than  tracking objects with  lasers 
was  the  Pentagon’s  plan  to  develop  more  powerful  lasers as  weapons.  The 
Defense Department would  test a 2-million-watt  laser  soon  at White Sands 
Missile Range, and i t  was building a 5-million-watt  laser.  ( WPost, June 20/85, 
A3,  June 22185,  A3) 

September 5  NASA and the U.S.  Air  Force announced today that the Space 
Shuttle Atlantis would  take  off  October  3  on  its  maiden  voyage  to  carry  a 
secret  payload  into orbit,  the  Washington Post  reported.  O n  board Atlantis, 
the fourth and final Space Shuttle in  NASAls fleet, would be commander Karol

STS 

Bobko,  pilot  Ronald  Grabe,  mission  specialists  David  Hilmers  and  Robert 
Stewart,  and payload specialist Air  Force Maj. William Pailes. 
Pailes,  who  has  a master's  degree  in computer  science and  i s  an  accorn- 
plished pilot, would be on board to tend the classified cargo. (WPost, Sept 6/ 
85,  A12) 

September 9  Astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis,  scheduled Octo- 
ber 3 for its maiden voyage,  would deploy two defense satellite communica- 
tions system  (DSCS-Ill)  satellites to support all three military services and to 
carry  a  single  channel  transponder  used  to  transmit  emergency  messages 
from the president to nuclear forces,  the Washington Post reported the Feder- 
ation of American Scientists said on September 9. 
The  group  said  the  classified  mission  could  be  determined  by  anyone 
including the Soviets,  who carefully scrutinized public documents,  and that 
i t  was  revealing the  payload  because  keeping  the  mission  secret  "inhibits 
public awareness and discussion of  U .S .  military activities in  space." 
The group  indicated  i t  found  reference to the  satellites  in  various military 
publications,  the most  recent of which was  a December 28,  1984,  issue of 
Defense Daily that  said two  DCSCs would  "be  launched together  next year 
on  a single space  shuttle mission,  apparently on the Atlantis  mission  .  .  ." 
( W  Post,  Sept  10/85,  A5) 

October 4:  The military crew of  the Space  Shuttle Atlantis  on  mission 51-J 
deployed  today  two  communications  satellites for  Department of  Defense, 
the  N Y  Times reported, citing reliable sources.  After  release from the Space 
Shuttle,  the  satellites,  known as  Defense Satellite Communications System 
(DSCS  Ill)  and weighing  a ton each  and measuring 38   feet  long w i th   solar 
panels extended,  rocket engines boosted them to a point 22,300  miles above 
the earth. 
According to General Electric Co.,  which built the satellites but would  not 
confirm  their  presence on  the  Space  Shuttle,  both  satellites  were  strength- 
ened to  withstand  radiation from distant nuclear blasts and  had a device to 
send emergency action messages  from  the  President to  the  nation's  nuclear 
forces. 
The  Department of  Defense (DOD) scheduled Atlantis  to  land at  Edwards 
Air Force Base on a date that was classified;  NASA and DOD said they would 
announce  the  time  of  landing  24  hours  in  advance.  ( N Y  Times, Oc t   5/85, 
A4 6) 

October 6  As  five military officers on the Space Shuttle Atlantis orbited earth 
on the secret 51-J  mission, a debate was growing in  the U .S .  over  how much 
secrecy was  necessary  in  the  civilian-run  space  program and what  the mili- 
tary's  role in  it should be,  the  N Y  Times reported. 

319 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Proponents of  an  expanded  role for  the  Defense Department (DOD) said 
the  U.S. needed to  counter  a  growing Soviet threat  in  space.  They  pointed 
out that the USSR launched four to five times as  many spacecraft a year  as the 
U.S.,  w i th   the majority of  missions devoted  to military objectives,  and  that 
Soviet military officers had logged years  in  space,  while the US. military had 
logged days. 
Critics of an expanded DOD  role said the U.S. already had an advantage  in  
military space technology. They  said  U.S. systems  worked  better and  lasted 
longer,  pointing out the  USSR was  still trying to  perfect a vehicle  similar  to 
the  Space  Shuttle. The  critics also  argued  that  the  U .S .   military’s  assertions 
about the Soviet Union were often veiled excuses to try to edge civilians out 
of  the astronaut corps and  to classify  the most mundane Space  Shuttle pay- 
loads. This  goal  of secrecy,  they  said,  was  not  heightened security  but was 
intended to  protect DOD’s plans and programs from  public scrutiny. 
The debate was  likely to become more vocal,  the Timessaid, as  the military 
expanded  i t s   manned  space  activity  when  secret  military  missions  would 
account for  25  to 30%  of a l l  Space Shuttle flights in  the next decade. 
Carl  Sagan,  professor of  astronomy  and space  sciences at Cornell Univer- 
sity,  said  there was  a “fundamental  tension”  between open  scientific  inquiry 
and  “the  necessarily  closed  world  of  military  activities  . . . As  military 
programs expand,”  he said,  “there’s  a huge deflection of  resources,  financial 
and  intellectual,  from  peaceful uses  into the production of weapons.” 
Daniel Graham,  a  retired Army  lieutenant general  who  formerly  headed 
the  Defense Intelligence Agency,  disagreed,  saying the military had been at 
the forefront of U .S .  space exploration since i t s  earliest days.  “The  myth since 
the  Eisenhower Administration  i s  that  there’s  a  distinction  between military 
and civilian matters in  space,”  he said.  “That‘s  a pretense that a  lot of people 
in   NASA  would  like  to  believe,  that  a l l   their  activities  are  sweetness  and 
light,”  he  insisted. 
However,  even  military proponents saw emerging tensions  in  the manned 
space program,  the  Times reported. William Gregory, editor of Aviation Week 
&  Technology said  in  an  editorial,  “The  original  legislation creating  [NASA] 
specified a civilian space program, separate from the military  .  .  .  That line 
i s  being crossed now not so  much as a formal policy change as out of simple 
economic  necessity.  The  shuttle needs the military as  a  customer  to spread 
the system’s  overhead costs.” 
Some critics feared  that NASA’s  charter  for  free  and open dissemination of 
scientific information was  eroding as  the military’s  role grew.  Scientists inef- 
fectually protested last year  when  NASA  announced that  i t s  Defense Depart- 
ment Affairs Division would review and possibly censor  images from  a  large 
camera and  radar carried on a civilian Space  Shuttle mission. 
“There’s  a  real question of how the decision was  made to move the space 
agency  from  being open  to substantially closed,”  the  Times  quoted  Morton 
Halperin,  director  of  the Washington  office of  the  American  C iv i l   Liberties

Union.  “What‘s  at  stake  i s  the  public’s  right to  participate in  the  process of 
making government policy.”  ( N Y  Times, Oct 6/85,  A l )  

October 7: The Space Shuttle Atlantis  on mission 51-J  landed just after  10 
a.m.  today at Edwards Air  Force Base,  ending a fourday flight operated under 
secrecy rules imposed by the Department of Defense (DOD), the Washington 
Post  reported. “Of  course,  I can’t  say  anything about our mission,”  said flight 
commander  Karol Bobko, an Air  Force colonel and one of five military men 
on  the  mission,  “but  I can  say  Atlantis  performed  superbly  i t s   first  time  in 
space.  I’ve  flown  Challenger,  Atlantis,  and  Discovery  now,  and  I think  that 
NASA  really has  quite a fleet of  orbiters  and  that  we  have  a great  national 
asset  here,”  he added. 
NASA ground operations manager Fritz Widick  said Atlantis was  i n  “excel- 
lent condition”  at  the end of  the  1.7  million-mile flight,  although engineers 
were  inspecting an  underside area  of  the  left wing  to  see  i f   tile-insulation 
damage might  have exposed  i t s  aluminum  mainframe to  reentry  heat.  Such 
heat might have discolored a region along the portside engine pod under the 
Space Shuttle’s  tail. 
Widick  said  Atlantis’s  brakes came  through  the  190 mph  landing on  the 
lake-bed w i th  only  “minor  damage”  to one of  four  brake assemblies on the 
main  landing gear. 
Bobko  appeared  to  apply  minimum  braking  after  landing  into  a  s t i f f  
headwind that brought Atlantis to  a stop on the center  line halfway down the 
15,000-foot  desert runway. 
Fewer than a dozen reporters and about two dozen NASA employees were 
present for the landing, an event that usually drew hundreds of spectators,  the 
NY  Times  reported.  The  military  gave  just  24  hours  notice  of  when  the 
mission would end and had barred members of the public from watching. ( W  
Post, Oct 8/85,  A3;  N M ,  Oct 8/85,  C3) 

October  7 0 :   The  US.  Air  Force  announced  today  the  military  cargo  that 
would fly aboard the first Space Shuttle flight  launched from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base,  citing as  i t s   reason  public  interest  in  the  mission,  the  N Y  Times 
reported. The  move was  considered  a major  step  toward  making available 
more information about the entire flight,  including views of the poles as  seen 
during the Space Shuttle‘s  polar orbit. 
Air  Force Maj.  Ronald  Rand  said  the  Department of  Defense  (DOD) a p  
p r o d  dissemination of  information about the payload because i t  was exper- 
imental and not designed to carry out an operational mission.  He said there 
were two payloads: an assembly of s ix  space physics experiments that would 
remain  in  the Space Shuttle’s open cargo bay and an  experimental airplane- 
detecting experiment. 
“In  light of the mounting Congressional and public interest i n  this historic 
first  manned polar orbit and first west  coast  shuttle mission, we’ve  made an 

32 1 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

exception to our  policy w i th  the understanding that we’ll  continue to protect 
performance  data  and  results of  these  two  experiments,”  Rand  said.  “This 
doesn’t  mean we’ve  changed our policy of classifying DOD payloads.” 
Flying aboard Discovery, which was scheduled for  launch March 20,  1986, 
would be Comdr. Robert Crippen of the Navy;  p i lo t  Guy Gardner; astronauts 
Jerry Ross,  Dale Gardner,  and  Richard Mullane;  Under Secretary  of  the Air 
Force  Edward Aldridge;  Air  Force  Maj. John Brett Watterson;  and  a  DOD 
specialist to  tend the cargo.  ( N M ,  Oct  11/85,  A6) 

Missions 

March 5:  NASA confirmed  successful launch on January 24 from KSC  of the 
Space  Shuttle w i th  a  Department of  Defense  inertial  upper  stage  deployed 
and an aggregation of red blood cells experiment for the University of Sydney 
completed.  Spacecraft orbital  parameters were  classified.  The  mission  had 
lasted three days,  one hour,  and 3 3  minutes, with  landing at  KSC. 
Unusually  cold weather,  causing  icing on  the external  tank,  had delayed 
launch for one day.  (NASA  FOR  M-989-51-C 
[post flight] Mar 5/85) 

April  72 :   NASA  launched today  at  8:59  a.m.  from  KSC  the  Space  Shuttle 
Discovery mission 51-D,  the  16th launch  in  the Space  Shuttle program and 
the fourth  flight  of  Discovery,  the  N Y  Times and  Washington Post  reported. 
Discovery carried a crew of seven,  including Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah), chair- 
man of the Senate  subcommittee responsible for the NASA budget. 
The  launch  followed  a  last  minute  repair  for  a  salt  water  leak  on  the 
McDonnelI Douglas Corp.  experiment,  the continuous flow electrophoresis 
system  to   produce an  unidentified  hormone that couldn’t  be manufactured 
on earth. Also,  launch came 55 minutes later than scheduled and 55 seconds 
short of  postponement because of  clouds between  14,000  and  30,000  feet 
above the  launch pad. Astronaut John Young,  flying a training plane through 
the clouds,  encountered rain. KSC officials then delayed launch because they 
d id  not want to  risk getting the spaceship wet,  which might cause erosion of 
critical  heat-shielding material.  When  skies  lightened  and  dried  at  8:50, 
NASA  resumed the countdown with no further  interruption. 
After  launch,  Discovery reached an elliptical orbit ranging in  altitude from 
185 to 286 miles,  one of the higher courses  achieved by the spacecraft. 
Discovery’s crew besides Sen.  Garn were Air  Force Col. Karol Bobko,  mak- 
ing  his second Space  Shuttle flight,  commander;  Navy Comdr.  Donald W i l-  
liams,  pilot;  Dr.  M.  Rhea  Seddon,  Jeffrey Hoffman,  and  Navy Capt.  David 
Griggs, mission specialists;  and McDonnell Douglas Corp. engineer Charles 
Walker,  payload specialist.

STS 

The astronauts deployed during early evening of  launch day  the Canadian 
Anik  C-7  satellite,  which  then  moved  to  a  higher  equatorial  orbit.  They 
would  deploy  on  April  13  the  Hughes Aircraft  Co.’s  Leasat  3,  which  the 
Department of Defense would  lease and the Navy operate as  part of a mili- 
tary  communications network. The  remainder of  the  mission would  be de- 
voted to medical experiments and a test of how mechanical toys  behaved in  
space. 
Dr.  Seddon began the first of the mission’s  medical tests  by taking echocar- 
diograms of three of the crew members. There were no reports on Sen.  Garn’s 
medical tests.  In an effort to determine the causes and effects of space motion 
sickness,  the Senator wore a waist belt with two stethoscopic microphones to 
record sounds  his stomach and  intestines made during digestion.  His head 
and  chest were wired  to   record electrical signals  from  his brain and  heart; 
other instruments would measure the way his bones grew and shrunk i n  zero 
gravity.  Also,  he  would  perform  exercises  aimed  at  inducing  nausea.  (NY  
Times, Apr  13185,  A l ;   W Post,  Apr  12185, A6,  Apr  13/85,  A l l  

A p r i l   7 7 :   NASA  terminated  today efforts by  the crew of the  Discovery 51-D 
mission  to  revive  the  U.S.  Navy’s  Syncom  IV-3  (Hughes Corp.3  Leasat  3) 
satellite,  the  Washington Post  reported.  Troubles w i th   the  satellite  became 
apparent the morning of April 13 after astronauts M. Rhea Seddon and Jeffrey 
Hoffman  completed  commands  that  deployed  the  satellite  from  the  Space 
Shuttle’s cargo bay. The satellite‘s engine, which would  l i f t  i t  into a permanent 
geostationary orbit  22,300  miles  above earth,  failed  to  fire.  A  fault  i n  the 
satellite’s timing mechanism (which would direct the satellite through a series 
of  steps  to  put  the  satellite  into  permanent  orbit)  apparently  caused  the 
fa i I u re. 
Johnson Space Center flight director John Cox said that NASA‘s  best guess 
was  that the  “postdeploy  sequencer  (timer) never was activated. The  reason 
we think so  i s  that the antenna should have popped out about a minute and 
20 seconds after deployment,  and the satellite should have  been put  into a 
15-rpm spin to stabilize it.  Neither of those things happened.” 
Engineers at Hughes Aircraft Corp.,  satellite manufacturer, tried to simulate 
the  conditions  of  the satellite failure i n  hopes of  duplicating  what  had h a p  
pened.  “One  of  the  astronauts  might  be  able  to  get  close  enough  to  the 
satellite to move the lever to start the timing mechanism, then get out of there 
and  inside in  enough time to  be far  away  from the satellite when the engine 
fires,”  said Marvin Mixon,  Hughes vice president. 
Astronauts  maneuvered  the  Space  Shuttle  about  45  miles  ahead  of  the 
satellite in order to  take pictures of it;  however,  they could not draw too close 
because the satellite’s main engine contained 7,370  Ib. of solid rocket fuel,  i t s  
second-stage engine had 4,092  Ib. of nitrogen tetroxide and dimethyl  hydra- 
zine  fuel.  The  satellite also  carried  352  Ib.  of  hydrazine  for  controlling  its 
position in  orbit. 

323 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  made the decision to extend  the flight from  five to  seven days,  and 
on  April  15  the  Discowry crew cannibalized  plastic covers  from  flight  man- 
uals,  parts of a window  screen,  nylon straps,  and other paraphernalia  in  the 
spacecraft  to  fashion  flyswatters  to  attach  to  Discovery‘s  robot  arm  for  an 
attempt to fire the satellite‘s engine. Seddon sewed the plastic covers together 
to form cones that the astronauts w u l d  attach to the arm in  order to f l ip  the 
arming  lever. 
O n  April  16 astronauts Jeffrey Hoffman and S.  David Griggs went on h i s t o  
ry‘s  first  unrehearsed spacewalk to   r ig  Discovery’s mechanical arm with  the 
flyswatter devices. The two spent more than three hours in  Discovery’s  open 
cargo bay  putting the extension “hands”  on the 50-foot-long arm. 
At  about  8:OO  a.m.  April  17,  commander  Karol  Bobko  and  pilot  David 
Williams manuevered Discovery to within  30 feet of the satellite. Then Sed-  
don  swatted at  the  four-in.-long power  switch.  Although  she  h i t   i t  at  least 
twice-once  so  hard that  part of the plastic broke-the 
lever didn’t  move. 
Following the  unsuccessful attempt,  ground  controllers  order  the  Space 
Shuttle to move away and abandon the  rescue attempt on the off-chance that 
the contact somehow might haw  activated the satellite’s  internal timer, which 
would cause  i t s  rockets to fire. 
Underwriters who had insured the satellite said the failure to  either recover 
the satellite or  boost i t  into an operational orbit would be a serious b low  to 
the  satellite underwriters business,  Defense Daily  reported.  “If  we  have an- 
other major claim,”  James Barrett, president of  International Technology Un- 
derwriters,  said,  “the  market would be very seriously injured by a total loss.” 
Hughes said the satellite was  insured for between $80 and $85 million,  and 
the  space  insurance market had already  suffered  three  losses over  the  past 
year.  ( W  Post,  Apr  15/85,  A l ,   Apr  16/85,  A l l   Apr  17/85,  A7,  Apr  18/85,  A l ;

April  79: The  Space  Shuttle  Discowry’s  crew  on  mission  51-D  landed  the 
orbiter at  8:54  a.m.  EST  April  19 at  KSC,  a return characterized by the worst 
damage  i n   16  Space  Shuttle  missions-a  burn-hole  i n  a  wing,  two  failed 
brakes,  two  b lown   tires,  and at  least  123  broken heat-shield tiles,  the Mar- 
shall  Space  Flight Center‘s  Star  and  the  Washington Post  reported.  NASA 
scheduled the mission to  last five days,  but extended i t  by two days to give the 
crew a chance to correct a malfunction  in  the Hughes Leasat 3 satellite. 
The damage to  D i s c w r y  could set  back  preparation  for  i t s   next mission 
scheduled for June 12. NASA would have to replace protective tiles,  probably 
damaged when  the  Space  Shuttle  lifted off  through  the  rain  [see  Apr.  121. 
“There’s  little question that we suffered more severe damage on this  landing 
than  on any  other  so  faf  Space  Shuttle  launch director  Robert Sieck  said. 
Concerning  the  brakes,  Sieck  said,  “Brake  damage we’ve  seen  on  previous 
flights. Brake failure i s  something we’ve  never seen.“

STS 

NASA had waved  off Discovery for a 7:16 a.m.  landing because of rain over 
Cape  Canaveral.  One  orbit  later,  Discovery  headed  down  to  KSC,  where 
NASA  told  Commander Karol  Bobko  to  land  on  runway  33   instead of  15 
because of sun glare.  Bobko landed with no headwind to slow him, touching 
down at 231 mph,  the fastest any  Space  Shuttle had  landed. 
As  Discovery rolled down the three-mile concrete runway,  it encountered a 
nine-knot crosswind and began veering to the  right. When Bobko corrected 
for  the  wind  by  braking one  side,  the  strain  apparently  caused  one  of  the 
inboard brake assemblies to  lock. Moments later the inboard brake assembly 
on the other side also  locked,  causing rubber to burn. 
A burn-hole the size of a dinner plate nearly penetrated through aluminum 
on the Space Shuttle’s  le f t  wingtip where a landing flap apparently dislodged 
several  protective tiles. 
Regarding the  Leasat  3,  a  Hughes  representative said  initial  belief  that  a 
lever  failed to release was  in  error [see Apr.  181.  Once Discovery had maneu- 
vered  to  w i th in   10  feet  of  the  satellite,  the  crew  reported  the  lever  had 
released. The crew successfully snagged  the lever twice to ensure i t  was  fully 
released,  and  reported the only change  in  the satellite’s  status was  a slowing 
from two to one  revolution per minute. 
The  first  congressional observer  in   space,  Sen.  Jake Garn  (R-Utah),  had 
difficulty  negotiating the  steps  down to  the  runway and  required assistance 
into the van  that  took  the crew  to the dispensary for  medical examinations. 
There had been some controversy over  his presence on the flight,  including a 
NY  Times editorial that said,  “Having  pressured  NASA  to give him his space 
trip,  Mr. Garn  i s  now indebted to the agency. That‘s  a pity for those whom he 
represents in  supervising NASA’s  budget and i t s  request to bu i ld  an $8 b i l l ion  
space  station.”  However,  Garn  commented  that  “I’m  carrying  my  own 
weight.  I knew  I had to prove myself  . . . I’ve dealt w i th  NASA for  10 years. 
I’m working on  the  space  station  right  now,  setting policy.”  (Marshall Star;

April  29:  NASA  launched  at  12:02  p.m.  EDT  today  from  KSC  the  Space 
Shuttle Challenger mission 51-8  carrying seven  astronauts,  Space!ab 3,  24 
rats,  and two squirrel monkeys for the most intensive science mission to date, 
the Washington Post reported. Launched 17 days after Discovery left the same 
launch pad,  the Challenger flight bested the previous “turnaround”  record of 
34 days. 

Challenger carried the oldest crew ever  to fly  in  space.  Marine Col.  Robert 
Overmyer,  commander,  was  49;  Frederick Gregory,  pilot,  and Taylor  Wang, 
payload specialist,  were 44;  Don Lind,  mission specialist, was  54;  Lodewijk 
van den Berg,  payload specialist, was  53;  William Thornton,  mission special- 
ist,  was  55;  and Norman Thagard,  mission specialist, 41.  The crew called the 
flight  one  by  scientists  for  science.  “This  mission  marks  the  first  time  that 

325 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

scientists who  designed  their  own experiments w i l l   be executing those ex- 
periments in  space,”  said Lind, who had been waiting  16 years  for  the flight. 
The  five  scientists would work  in  around-theclock  shifts  on  the  15  experi- 
ments inside the European-built Spacelab. 
Before  liftoff  NASA  decided  not  to  have  the  crew  launch  two  Get-Away 
Special satellites,  one a student experiment and the other a Pentago payload, 
because a n inevo l t  battery had failed on the last Space Shuttle flight. Ground 
tests  showed  that  three  other  batteries from  the  same  batch  failed  after  18 
hours  in  vacuum.  The  satellites  would  return to  the  ground with  the  Space 
Shuttle. 
The  crew  successfully deployed a satellite intended to calibrate air  traffic 
control  radars  on  the  ground,  but  encountered  difficulties  when  trying  to 
deploy  a  U.S.  Navy  satellite that  would  locate drifting weather  buoys.  The 
satellite  would  not  m ow   from  the  cargo  bay  despite  repeated  signals  to 
trigger deployment. 
Later  the crew discovered they  had no fresh water  from  their  galley faucet 
and had to bypass the faucet and  reconnect themselves to their water supply 
using  an  all-purpose  hose  carried  for  such  emergencies.  Other  problems 
ranged from an overheated hydraulic system  power unit to a urine collection 
device that one crew member said  sprayed water  “all  over  the place.” 
The  monkeys  and  rats  appeared  to  be  doing well.  Four  of  the  rats  had 
surgical  implants  in   their  hearts  to  record changes  in  heartbeat and  blood 
flow.  The others were  testing cages  and equipment for  future animal experi- 
ments.  The  monkeys  were  on  a  shakedown  flight  to  determine  how  they 
tolerated  l iv ing  in  orbit.  If they didn‘t get  nervous or frightened in  space,  later 
flights would carry squirrel monkeys w i th  surgical  implants to test  for  space 
sickness and heart changes.  ( W  Post, Apr 28 /85 ,  A la ,  Apr  29/85, A3,  Apr  301

May2 :  The waste products of two monkeys and two dozen rats continued to 
float through the cabin of the Space Shuttle Challenger [see Space Transporta- 
tion System/Missions, Apr.  291,  forcing crew members to rearrange their tight 
schedules and operate in  full  surgical gear  to clean  up,  the  Washington Post 
reported.  “Be  advised  we  now  have feces  in  the  crew  compartment  and  i t  
isn’t  much  fun,  guys:’  commander  Robert  Overmyer  said  to  the  mission 
control center  in  Houston.  “How  many  years  did we  tell  them  these  cages 
would never work?” 
With TV cameras  recording the activity,  Overmyer and mission specialists 
William  Thornton,  Norman  Thagard,  and  payload  specialist  Lodewijk  van 
den  Berg,  wearing  surgical  smocks,  glaves,  and  masks,  floated  about  the 
Spacelab cabin using vacuum  cleaners to suck  the waste out of the cabin air. 
At one pont Thagard said,  “Even  the vacuum cleaners aren’t  enough.” 
The  problems began on  the day  after  liftoff w i th  feeding the animals food 
and water.  One  rat  had  to  be  hand-fed  a  gelatin bar  to  get water  into him; 

326 

STS 

when  physician-astronaut Thornton tried to  press food bars into the cage,  the 
bars would crumble and a cloud of tiny particles would scatter  in  the cabin. 
“I’m  not exaggerating:’  Thornton  told  mission control,  “but  there  are  food 
particles  flooding out of every crack  in  those cages.  I don’t  see  any  way  we 
can  stop this except  if we  had a seal over the entire cage.”  Monkey and  rat 
feces  also  leaked out of the cages. 

The five scientists also could not deploy a French-built camera,  intended to 
survey  for  17  hours  hot  stars  in  distant  galaxies,  because an  airlock  hatch 
failed to open. And physicist Taylor Wang was unable to run an experiment to 
test  behavior  of  drops  of  fluids  in weightlessness  because  circuit  breakers 
continually popped open. Nine of the 15 Spacelab experiments were running 
even better than hoped, and the crew described the monkeys and rats as  “real 
clean and real happy.” 
O n  May 1,  however,  one of the monkeys got spacesick. “We can tell by the 
way  he’s  behaving that one of our monkeys i s  not feeling well:’  said  Dr.  Paul 
Callahan  of  Ames  Research  Center.  “The  other  monkey  was  under  the 
weather  his  first  day  i n  space  but he‘s  adapted very  well  since,  which  i s  an 
almost  identical  reaction  we  get  from  human  astronauts.”  Callahan  noted 
“Monkey  No.  1”  was  not eating and  drinking  normally,  seemed  to  have  a 
headache, and was  generally  lethargic and dispirited. “He’s  just not moving 
around and the other monkey has begun to do somersaults.” 
Eleven  of  the  Spacelab  experiments were  running by  that  time,  although 
mission specialist George Fichtl said “One  i s  a hit-and-miss kind of thing and 
three  look very doubtful.”  He added the astronauts had proposed to  give up 
on  the  French-built w ide f ie ld  camera and that  it was doubtful  NASA would 
extend the mission to  give the crew additional  time to try to  deploy  it. 
O n  May 2 Fichtl explained that the  rats’  and one monkey’s  vigorous move- 
ment,  which  was  “much  more than  expected:’  was  likely  the  main  reason 
their waste  was  escaping the cages.  “We  designed  those cages  w i th   an  air- 
f low  control to keep the waste  in  the cages:’  he explained.  “Our  best guess 
now  i s  that the  animals  are  so  spirited and  are enjoying  weightlessness so 
much that they  induced turbulence in  the cage that’s  too turbulent to contain 
the waste.” 
The problems w i th  the animals cast  some doubt over  future animal flights 
on  Spacelab,  the  Washington Postcontinued. NASA had scheduled for  1986 
a flight  to  carry 48  rats  and  four  squirrel monkeys. However,  Spacelab mis- 
sion manager Joseph Cremin insisted that research on animals was crucial to 
the future of the permanent space station where men and women would have 
to work  in  orbit for months at a time.  (WPost, May 1/85,  A3,  May 2/85,  A l l ,  
May 3/85,  A3) 

May 6:  Commander  Robert Overmyer  landed the  Space  Shuttle Challenger 
today on a lake-bed runway at Edwards Air  Force Base,  after i t  had caused two 

327 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

sonic booms that triggered burglar alarms and calls to police, the Washington 
Post  reported. 
O f  the  15 experiments flown on  Spacelab  3,  12  apparently operated suc- 
cessfully and two at  least partially so. Among the successful experiments was 
photography of the Northern and Southern lights, which sent streaks of bril- 
liant flashes at the extreme latitudes near the north and south polar regions at 
that  time of year.  Challenger’s  crew  photographed  18  auroras.  Another  suc- 
cessful device was  a  laser spectrometer that  for  the first  time measured from 
orbit the ozone  layer that protected the earth from the sun’s  ultraviolet light. 
Crew members were able to restore two experiments that had initially been 
inoperable. One  was  an  experiment  to  study  the  dynamics  of  droplets  of 
fluids  in  weightiessness, the other an  instrument that counted and measured 
cosmic  rays  striking  Challenger  in   orbit.  They  were  unable  to  deploy  the 
w ide f ie ld   camera  intended to study the ultraviolet light of hot stars. 
The  afternoon of  the  landing NASA  personnel  removed the monkeys and 
rats  in  their  cages  for  a  flight  to  Kennedy Space  Center,  where  researchers 
would  k i l l  and  dissect the  rats  to  examine their vital organs  under  a micro- 
scope for changes caused by weightlessness. 
Physician/astronaut William  Thornton  said  they  had  brought  back  two 
monkeys that  were  even  friendlier  than  they  were  before the flight-”Those 
primates are  part of  the  crew  right now,”  he commented.  During the  flight, 
one of the monkeys experienced motion sickness  for  several  days,  requiring 
Thornton  to  feed  i t   by  hand.  O n   May  4  the  Greensboro News  &  Record 
reported  that  Thornton  said,  “Our  feeding  crisis  i s   over.  I  wouldn’t  haw 
believed the effect of a caring human hand.” 
However, on May  14 Overmyer told reporters at Johnson Space Center that, 
“NASA  has a problem that NASA  has to solve i f  we’re  going to fly those cages 
the W Post  reported.  “I never dreamed that a l l  that stuff would come 
again:‘ 
out of those cages  and escape  into our  atmosphere”  [see May  21.  He added 
that  the experience w i th   the animals “never  took away the  luster” of  space 
flight,  a sentiment echoed  by  p i lo t  Frederick Gregory,  an  Air  Force  colonel 
who became the first black astronaut to take the Space Shuttle’s  controls.  (W

lune   77: NASA  launched  today  from  KSC  Space  Shuttle  Discovery mission 
5 1 4  w i th  a crew  of seven,  including Saudi  Prince Sultan Salman  Al-Saud 
and  Patrick Baudry from  France,  for  the  18th Space  Shuttle flight,  the  Wash- 
ington Post  reported. 
Earlier  NASA  had  announced  that  mission  5 1 4  would  carry  the  auto- 
mated directional  solidification  furnace  (ADSF),  Spartan  1,  and  the  French 
echocardiograph  (FEE)  and  posture  (FPE)  experiments. The  objective of  the 
ADSF  was  to  provide  a  technology  demonstration  of  the  capability  of  the 
equipment  to  perform  directional  solidification  of  a  magnetic  composite 

328  

STS 

material and to study the  role of  gravitydriven phenomena  in  such  process- 
ing. The  apparatus used for  the directional solidification experiments was  a 
specially designed furnace that  melted a sample contained in  a quartz  tube 
one  cm  in  diameter  and  35 cm  long.  A  furnace  module  (a  heater w i th   an 
integral quench block) moved along the four  tubes  in  the experiment so  that 
the manganese-bismuth alloy  samples melted and  solidified at  a  controlled 
rate.  Electric  resistance  provided  the  heat;  the  quench  block  was  l iqu id  
cooled.  In that first flight,  a l l  four samples were  the same alloy w i th  only the 
solidification rate changed  to allow a  better understanding of  that aspect  of 
the process. 
Spartan  1 was  the first of a continuing series of  low-cost free flyers designed 
to extend sounding  rocket experiment capabilities. The  Spartan  1 objective 
was  to map the X-ray  emissions from  the Perseus Cluster,  the nuclear region 
o f  the M i lky  Way  galaxy,  and the Scorpius X-2  (SCO-X-2).  NAS4 had flown 
the  Spartan  1  instrument several  times  on  sounding  rockets;  the  resulting 
information  led to  the  need  to  obtain  greater  viewing  time  of  the  selected 
targets,  thus  permitting more detailed  studies w i th   greater  resolutions. The 
crew would deploy the Spartan  1 from the Space Shuttle  and retrieve it using 
the Canadian-built remote manipulator system.  After  deployment,  the  Spar- 
tan 1 would perform scientific observations for up to 40 hours via an onboard 
microcomputer controller that commanded a l l  pointing sequences and satel- 
lite control. There was  no  command  or  telemetry  link;  when  observing se- 
quences were complete,  the satellite "safed"  all systems and placed itself in  a 
stable attitude for  retrieval. 
The  objectives of  the  FEE  and  FPE,  a  part of  a  cooperative program w i th  
France, was  to obtain on-orbit data regarding the response of the cardiovascu- 
lar  and  sensorimotor  systems  to  weightlessness.  French  payload  specialist 
Patrick Baudry would perform the experiments w i th  participation from other 
crew  members  including the  Arabsat  payload  specialist.  The  USSR's  July 
1982 Salyut mission had also flown the  FEE system. 
By  4:30  p.m.  June 17,  Discovery's  crew  had successfully deployed a Mexi- 
can satellite, Morelos-7,  the first of two identical satellites,  which headed for 
a position 22,300  miles above the equator west  of the Galapagos  Islands.  It 
would  beam  TV  programs  to  the  most  remote  regions  of  Mexico.  (NASA

Dur ing lune:  NASA  announced that the Space  Shuttle mission 5 1 4  would 
carry  three  communications  satellites,  a  deployablehetriwable  Spartan  1 
spacecraft,  and s ix  Get Away  Special canisters.  The  orbiter Discovery would 
fly  several  m iddeck   experiments  including one  for  the  Strategic  Defense 
Initiative (SDI) organization and a materials processing furnace. 

329  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

The Mexican spacecraft, Morelos-A,  was  a version of the Hughes HS  376 
satellite,  a  number  of  which  had  already  been  deployed  from  the  Space 
Shuttle.  Morelos-A  was  the  first  of  two  domestic  communications satellites 
that would  provide advanced telecommunications to the more remote parts 
of Mexico. 
Arabsat-A,  owned  by  the  Arab  Satellite  Communications  Organization 
and bu i l t  by Aerospatiale,  would provide telecommunications  links between 
the member nations. 
A  U.S.  domestic communications satellite owned by American Telephone 
and Telegraph (AT&T),  Telesfar 3 - 0  would provide telecommunications serv- 
ices to the continental  U.S.,  Alaska,  Hawaii,  and Puerto Rico. 
A l l   three  spacecraft  would  first  springeject  from  the  orbiter's  cargo  bay, 
then on  each a small attached payload assist  module would  ignite about 45 
minutes after deployment to propel the satellites to transfer orbits out as  far as 
22,300  miles above earth.  A  second small  rocket motor would  then  fire on 
each spacecraft to  circularize the orbits,  placing the spacecraft in  geosynch- 
ronous orbits. 
Three of  the  six  Get Away  Special canisters contained West  German pay- 
loads for  study of  materials  processing in  space  and behavior of  liquid pro- 
pellants.  A  fourth  canister  contained a  U.S.  Air  F0rcdU.S.  Naval  Research 
Laboratory  investigation of the ultraviolet radiation environment i n  space.  A 
fifth  canister  had  a  package of  nine  student  experiments  i n  biological  and 
physical sciences.  A Goddard Space  Flight Center  (GSFC)  investigation of  a 
developmental  heat  transfer  system  was  in  the  sixth  canister.  A  capillary 
pumped  loop  (CPL)  experiment,  i t  was  the  first  flight  of  a  CPL  two-phase 
thermal  control  system.  The advanced development and  flight  experiments 
section of the thermal engineering branch at GSFC developed the CPL (NASA 
Release 85-83) 

ju ly   29: NASA  launched from  KSC  at  5:OO  p.m.  EDT  today  Space  Shuttle 
mission 51-F  w i th  the orbiter Challenger carrying Spacelab-2.  The flight was 
the  eighth  for  Challenger  and  the  19th  Space  Shuttle  mission.  The  flight 
commander was  Col.  C. Gordon Fullerton, who served as  pilot on the third 
Space  Shuttle  mission.  Air  Force  Col.  Roy  Bridges,  Jr. was  pilot;  mission 
specialists were Dr. Anthony England,  a geophysicist;  Dr. F.  Story Musgrave,  a 
physician;  and Dr.  Karl Henize,  an  astronomer who  at the age of  58 was  the 
oldest American to  travel  in  space.  Payload specialists were Dr.  Loren Acton, 
a solar physicist at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory,  and Dr. John 
David Bartoe,  an  astrophysicist at  the Naval Research  Laboratory. 
Approximately 5 minutes and 45 seconds after  launch onboard computers 
shut down Challenger's  center engine (SSME  1) due to  failure of the orbiter's 
two  high-pressure,  fuel  tu rbo-pu m p  discharge  tern peratu re  sensors.  Chal- 
lenger was  70 miles above earth at  the time,  about 50 miles below the orbit 
considered safe for a manned spacecraft. 

330  

STS 

The two remaining main engines ran smoothly and burned about a minute 
and 10 seconds longer than originally planned, putting the Space Shuttle into 
a  lower-than-scheduled orbit. 
The crew then used two auxiliary engines to raise the orbit in  steps from an 
initial 122 miles to 194 miles at  10:30 p.m.  the night of launch. The crew also 
dumped as  much as 4,400  Ib. of fuel to achieve the higher orbit. 
In explaining the problem w i th  SSME  1,  NASA associate administrator Jesse 
Moore said  the onboard  sensors  first  indicated that  the center engine might 
be  overheating  four  minutes  after  liftoff,  the  Washington  Post  reported. 
"Computers  then ordered the center engine fuel  pump to  bypass  one valve 
and  use  another  to  feed  fuel  into  the  combustion  chamber,"  he  said.  Two 
minutes  later  computers  again  sensed  that  the  fuel  pump was  overheating 
and automatically shut down the center engine.The mission control center in  
Houston also received indications of dangerously high temperature readings 
on a second engine and instructed the crew to disconnect a backup sensor to 
prevent the second engine from shutting down before the spacecraft reached 
orbit. 
The crew encountered the next problem when attempting to operate a $60 
m i l l ion  telescopepointing  device. The  instrument  pointing subsystem  (IPS) 
and  i t s   four  solor  telescopes  were  one  of  13  experiments  carried  on  the 
European-built Spacelab-2.  Mission  specialist Henize told  mission  control 
that the pointing attempts were  "rather  dismal,"  the  N Y  Times  reported. 
Lee  Briscoe,  flight director,  elaborated to  reporters. "It  appears that we  are 
able to find the sun,  find the stars,  get  into what we call a rough track mode," 
he said.  "But  we  never  appear to get  into a fine track and actually finish the 
total tracking." 
Since  the  problem  appeared  to  be with  the  computer  programming that 
drove the  unit,  NASA  radioed up a  new wrsion of the programming. How-  
ever,  it initially  failed to correct the problem, and  NASA  told the crew to try 
harder.  Eventually  the  IPS  operated  successfully  after  the  crew  inserted  a 
series of software patches developed  at  Marshall Space  Flight Center.  NASA 
extended the mission duration by  one  day  to  allow additional collection of 
engineering and scientific data. 
The  Spacelab-2  aboard Challenger was  the  second of  its two verification 
test  flights  and  consisted  of  an  igloo  attached  to  a  lead  pallet,  the  IPS 
mounted  on  it and  a  two pallet  train  behind,  w i th   an  experiment  special 
support  structure.  Experiments  conducted  during the  Spacelab-2  mission 
were  in  the  fields of  life sciences,  plasma physics,  infrared astronomy,  high- 
energy  physics,  solar  physics,  atmospheric physics,  and  technology.  Experi- 
ments  were  located  on  the  IPS,  the  three  pallets,  the  special  support 
structure,  the orbiter middeck, and one on the ground (NASA FOR M-989-

August  6: The orbiter  Challenger on Space  Shuttle mission  51-F  landed at 
12:46 p.m.  PDT today  on Edwards Air  Force Base‘s  Mojave Desert  lake-bed 
runway,  the  Washington Post  reported. During the flight,  Challenger  circled 
the earth  127 times,  a distance of a little over three m i l l ion  miles. 
Technicians stood by at the runway to remove immediately the heat sensors 
from  Challenger‘s  main  engines  to  check  a  NASA  theory  that  the  sensors 
caused the  premature shutdown of  the center  rocket engine during the July 
29   launch.  NASA was  confident  enough that the sensors would  be found at 
fault that it had equipped Discovery’s engines with redesigned sensors before 
moving i t  August 5 to the  launch pad. 
During the mission, Challenger became an orbiting astronomical observa- 
tory with more than $72 m i l l ion  of telescopes and other instruments to study 
the  sun,  stars,  and distant galaxies.  The  NY  Times reported that  Dr.  Burton 
Edelson,  NASA associate administrator,  said,  “We  met more than 80  percent 
of all science objectives of this mission. We‘re  absolutely delighted.” 
Dr.  Eugene Urban,  chief mission scientist, added,  “Ewryone  has collected 
tantalizing new data.  It‘s  going to take a long time before this data i s  analyzed 
and really fully appreciated. We’w  made some interesting new observations, 
and some have been w r y  spectacular.” 
Jesse Moore,  NASA  associate administrator,  commented  that  the  orbiter 
appeared to  be in  good shape after the landing, the eighth for the Challenger. 
“It was a beautiful  landing:’  he said.  “The  tiles looked very good. The brakes 
look excellent. The orbiters continue to be magnificent flying machines.”  ( W  
Post,  Aug 7/85,  A3;  NYJ  Aug  7/85,  A l l  

August 27:  NASA  launched Discovery on Space Shuttle mission  51-1  today 
through  the  worst  weather  of  the  Space  Shuttle  program,  the  NY  limes 
reported. After two postponements in  three days because of bad weather and 
a computer failure,  Discovery barely got off the ground before the darkening 
clouds moved over the  launch pad and the rain descended in  torrents. 
“We  could  see  large  holes  in   the  system  50   or  100  miles  across  so  we 
prayed  for  the  breaks  that  would  let  us  thread  the  needle  when  the  time 
came:’ 
launch director  Robert Sieck  said  later.  “We  had  two  things  in  our 
favor:  There was  no  lightning i n  the  cloud cover,  and  most of  the  rain was 
south of the  launch pad,  not right over  it.” 
Launch directors gambled that rain would not be falling on the pad at liftoff 
time,  which was delayed three minutes to make sure the gamble was the right 
one.  As  heavy  rain fell  on  the  press  site  three  miles  to  the west,  Discovery 
roared away  from the pad through a hole i n  the clouds and sped  into the air 
10 minutes before the pad was  pelted w i th  rain. 
Commanding the flight was Air Force Col. Joe Engle, who commanded the 
second  Space  Shuttle  test  flight  i n   1981  and  on August  26  turned  53.  Air 
Force Lt. Col. Richard Covey was pilot; mission specialists were John Lounge, 
Dr. James van  Hoften, and Dr. William Fisher.

A malfunction encountered two  hours into the flight forced the astronauts 
to  deploy  a day  early  one  of  the  three  satellites  in  the  orbiter‘s  cargo  bay. 
During a cargo  inspection by  remotely controlled cameras,  a shield that was 
to  protect Australia’s  AUSSAT  1 from  direct exposure to  sunlight  stuck  in  a 
partly open position. An  astronaut then used the Space Shuttle’s  mechanical 
arm to nudge the sunshade completely open so they could release the spring- 
loaded  satellite.  Any  delay  of  more  than  s ix   hours  could  have  resulted  in  
radiation damage to the exposed satellite’s  electronics. 
Less  than  five  hours  after  deploying  the  Australian  satellite,  Discovery’s 
crew deployed ASC  7  for the American Satellite Co. The second deployment 
marked the first time a Space Shuttle crew deployed two satellites in  one day. 
(N Y 7 ;  Aug 28/85,  D18) 

August  28: Already  far  ahead  of  their  work  schedule,  astronauts  aboard 
Discovery on  Space  Shuttle mission 51-1  began  preparing tools they would 
use  in  an  attempt to  revive the  US. Navy  Leasat  3 satellite,  the  Washington 
Post reported. 
Mission planners had hoped the satellite repairs could be made during an 
August  30 spacewalk,  but they  added another  spacewalk  for  August  3 1   be- 
cause ground  tests  showed  that  the Space  Shuttle crippled  robot arm  could 
not work  fast enough  to complete the  repair job  in  one day. 
“It  appears  we  are  faced  with  a  two-EVA  (extravehicular activity)  plan:’ 
flight  director  B i l l   Reeves  said.  He  blamed  a  failed  circuit  that  prevented 
Discovery‘s  robot arm  from  operating in  an  automatic  mode.  Reeves  noted 
that ground  tests showed that the robot arm,  when operated manually, would 
need about  75% more time  to  maneuver  the  Syncorn  3  satellite and  that  it 
would take two 6-and-a-half hour spacewalks  to complete the  repair. 
Mission  specialists  Dr.  James van  Hoften  and  Dr.  William  Fisher  spent 
about  four  hours August  28  checking out electronic gear  they would use  to 
repair the satellite. 
Mission specialist john  Lounge would work  the  robot arm from  inside the 
cockpit,  while  van  Hoften and  Fisher worked  outside  on  the  satellite.  The 
robot arm  would  play  a  crucial  role,  holding van  Hoften  in  place while  he 
worked on the satellite 35  feet  above the cargo bay. 
Lounge would also  use  the robot arm to  help van  Hoften turn the satellite 
so  Fisher, standing in  foot restraints inside the bay,  could remove a panel and 
disengage a timing lever,  then  plug two electrical cables  into the panel and, 
in  effect,  jump start  the satellite.  ( W  Post,  Aug 29/85,  A3) 

Augus t29   Astronauts aboard the  Space  Shuttle Discovery on  mission  51-1 
took  time  August  29  to  observe  Hurricane  Elena,  the  Washington Post  re- 
ported.  Commander Joe  Engle  took  photos  of  the  storm,  a  dense  white 
circular  mass  that  stretched  across  almost  half  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and 
noted a second storm  in  the western part of Gulf. 

333  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Among  the  contingencies  NASA  faced  was  the  possibility that  the  storm 
could strike the Houston area and knock out communications with the John- 
son Space Center.  A  NASA  spokesman said they could quickly  switch opera- 
tion to the Goddard Space Flight Center. 
The  crew  also  that  day  launched  the  Syncom  IV-4 satellite,  which  was 
almost identical to the satellite the crew would attempt August 30 to salvage.

September3: Discovery and its five-man crew on Space Shuttle mission 51-1 
landed at 9:16 EDT today a t  Edwards Air  Force Base after a sevenday mission 
[see Aug.  271,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  During the  mission,  the  crew 
deployed AUSSAT-  1  for the Australian government, ASC-1  for the American 
Satellite Corp.,  and  Leasat  4 for  Hughes Communications  (reports indicated 
Leasat  4 had  lost  its  UHF communications link). In addition,  the  crew  suc- 
cessfully  retrieved and  repaired the  Leasat  3 originally deployed on STS  51- 
D. 
Later Hughes issued a statement  saying “Leasat 3 i s  under full  control  by 
Hughes’  ground  command,  and  telemetry  data  continued  to  confirm  the 
good health of the satellite. The  liquid propulsion systems are  intact and the 
solid propellant  perigee kick motor temperatures appear  to be rising gradu- 
ally toward acceptable levels,”  the JSC Roundup reported. 
Jesse Moore,  NASA  associate administrator  for  space  flight,  said after  the 
mission that  “ I   would have to characterize this mission as  near to perfect as 
you can get.  It was  a perfect mission from  the outset,  one that  shows Ameri- 
ca’s  space  program at work.” 
Moore added that  he hoped there would  be only  two more Space  Shuttle 
landings  in  California  before pilots could resume  landing  in  Florida.  NASA 
switched  to   Edwards Air  Force  Base  landings  after  brakes  failed  and  a  tire 
blew out in  an April landing on Kennedy Space Center’s concrete runway.  ( W  
Post,  Sept 4/85,  A7;  JSC Roundup, Sept  13/85,  1) 

October 3  NASA  launched at  11:15  a.m.  today  from  KSC  the Space  Shuttle 
Atlantis,  the maiden voyage of the orbiter and the 21  st  mission in the Space 
Shuttle program,  on mission 514,  a secret flight  for  the  Department of  De- 
fense  (DOD), the N Y  Times reported. The  secrecy  was  part of  DOD‘s  efforts 
to make i t  difficult for the Soviet military to monitor the Space Shuttle takeoff 
and find out the  identity and mission of  the  payload.  Despite these  precau- 
tions,  i t  was widely  reported that a primary goal of the flight was  to launch a 
pair  of  $100-million  military  communication  satellites.  DOD  apparently 
planned  to  station  the  satellites,  designated  DSCS  Ill for  Defense  Satellite 
Communications System,  22,300  miles above earth, where they would relay 
messages to  U.S.  military forces around the world. 

334 

STS 

The commander of Atlantis was Air  Force Col. Karol Bobko,  flying his third 
Space Shuttle mission;  the p i lo t  was  Air  Force  Lt.  Col.  Ronald Grabe. Other 
crew members were Maj. David Hilmers of  the Marine Corps,  Army  Lt.  Col. 
Robert Stewart,  and Air  Force Maj. William  Pailes.  The first  four  were  mem- 
bers of  NASA's astronaut corps;  Pailes was  an Air  Force pilot assigned  to the 
mission to assist  in  deploying  its secret payload. 
In accordance with  security  rules,  NASA  gave  out  little  information  about 
the  flight.  There were  no space-to-ground communications released  to  the 
public  and  no  postlaunch  news  conference.  Nearly  five  hours  after  the 
launch,  mission control  in  Houston said,  "On the maiden voyage of Atlantis, 
the  crew  i s  doing well  and  all  systems on  board the orbiter are  performing 
satisfactorily."  NASA officials said  i t  would  issue no other status  reports dur- 
ing  the mission, which might  last a week or more. 
Atlantis  was  the  lightest  and  most  advanced  of  the  four  orbiters.  In  its 
planning and construction,  engineers removed minor design flaws  found  in 
earlier  versions  and  incorporated  the  latest  in  electronic  technology  and 
light-weight,  high-strength structural  materials.  NASA  strengthened Atlantis 
mainly so  it could withstand more vigorous  launchings from  the Air  Force's 
facility at Vandenberg Air  Force Base.  These  launches, which would  take the 
Space Shuttle into orbits around the earth's  poles,  required greater thrust from 
the Space Shuttle's  engines. 
Although  the mission was devoted to the military,  NASA officials said there 
was  a civilian  experiment  on  board to  study  exposure of  the orbiter and  its 
crew to  cosmic rays,  which were extremely high-energy particles from space 
that bombarded the earth and the orbiting Space Shuttles. (NY  Times, Oct 31 
85,  A18,  Oct 4/85,  85) 

October  30:  NASA  launched  at  noon  today  from  KSC  the  Space  Shuttle 
Challenger on mission  61-A,  a  planned sevenday  flight  carrying Spacelab 
D-1  (for Deutschland) and the  largest Space Shuttle crew ever,  the NY  Times 
reported. The West  German Aerospace  Research  Establishment paid  NASA 
$65  m i l l ion   to   have  the  22nd  Space  Shuttle  and  ninth  Challenger  flight 
devoted fully to the Spacelab experiments. 
Americans  on  board were  commander Henry  Hartsfield,  jr.;  Air  Force  Lt. 
Col. Steven Nagel, pilot; and mission specialists Dr.  Bonnie Dunbar, a biome- 
dical  engineer,  Marine Corps Col.  James Buchli,  and Air  Force Col.  Guion 
Bluford,  jr.,  who  had  a doctorate  in  aerospace  engineering.  The  two West 
Germans in  the crew were  Dr.  Ernst Messerschmid and Mr.  Reinhard Furrer, 
both  physicists.  The  eighth  crew  member,  Dr.  Wubbo  Ockels,  a  physicist 
from the Netherlands,  represented the European Space Agency  (ESA), which 
provided  several  scientific  instruments in  the  Spacelab.  The  Europeans  had 
prime  responsibility for  conducting  the  experiments;  Bluford  and  Dunbar 
would assist  them. 

335 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Spacelab D-1,  designed,  built,  and checked  out  in  Europe,  was  flown  to 
KSC for installation in  Challenger's  cargo bay. The West German space agen- 
cy 's  center  in  Oberphaffenhofen,  near  Munich,  controlled  scientific opera- 
tions  during  the  flight;  ground  control  for  flying  the  Space  Shuttle  was  in  
Houston,  as  usual. Spacelab D-1  carried  76 experiments on  racks that  lined 
its walls.  German researchers designed most of the experiments, which were 
for German and other foreign universities,  research institutes,  and  industrial 
enterprises as  well  as  E S A   and NASA;  other experiments were  from  France, 
Spain,  Italy,  Britain,  the Netherlands,  Belgium,  Switzerland, and the U.S.  A l l  
experiments were  intended to take advantage of the weightlessness of space 
to  study various processes that were  normally affected by gravity. The  Wash- 
ington  Post  reported  that West  German officials said  Spacelab  was  a major 
step toward what they  hoped would be a larger laboratory module attached 
to  the  permanently  manned  space  station  that  NASA  envisioned  for  the 
1990s. 
Most  experiments  were  in  materials  processing. Along  two  sides  of  the 
Spacelab,  the experiments were  in  racks containing small furnaces  for heat- 
ing  metals and  making alloys  that  were  lighter and  stronger  than  anything 
produced  in   full  gravity  of  earth.  Other  materials  processing  experiments 
would study the flow of  liquids in  weightlessness; yet others would grow very 
pure and  large crystals that  could  lead to  improvements  in  electronic  semi- 
conductors. 
In a variety of  life sciences experiments,  the crew would study the growth 
of plants (corn and lentils) under microgravity conditions. Other studies were 
on   how  embryos  of  frogs  and  insects  developed  in  weightlessness.  Crew 
would use tadpoles for tests on how weightlessness might affect the develop 
ment of vestibular,  or balance,  organs in  vertebrates. 
EWs  vestibular  s l e d   ran  down  a  pair of  rails  in   Spacelab's  center  aisle. 
Experimenters would  accelerate and  t i l t   crew  members riding in  the  chair- 
like device to test how the human balance system  in  the inner ear  responded 
to  weightlessness and a moderate gravity  force,  because i t  was  thought  the 
inner ear,  which relied on gravity to function  normally, might be the source of 
astronauts'  motion sickness. 
Crew  would  use  instruments  in   the  cargo  bay  outside  the  Spacelab  for 
navigation tests,  such as  synchronization of atomic clocks in space with those 
on the ground, checking for any discrepancies caused by weightlessness,  and 
precise distance measurements by  radio signals  between the  Space  Shuttle 
and the ground. 
To  accommodate the crew of eight,  NASA  installed an extra sleep station, 
bringing  the  total  to  four.  Crew  would  conduct  laboratory  work  in   shifts 
around the clock. 
Despite early  concern  over  the  condition  of  the  Space  Shuttle's  steering 
jets,  mission control  gave the Challenger the go-ahead for orbital operations. 
Later  the  mission  control  flight  director  said  a  valve  malfunction  prevented 

336  

STS 

the  flow  of  fuel  through  one  line  to  Challenger’s  steering  jets,  but  NASA 
considered  an  alternate  line  sufficient  for  regular  operation  to  maneuver 
Challenger. 
Flight controllers also reported erratic temperature readings on one of the 
three  fuel  cells that  generated electricity,  but with  crew  supervision  the af- 
fected  unit  was  operating  at  fu l l   strength.  (NASA  Release  85-145;  NASA

November 2  At  the  halfway point  in  Space  Shuttle mission 61-A  in  which 
the orbiter Challenger carried Spacelab  D-1  [see  Space  Transportation Sys- 
tem/Missions,  Oct.  301,  a slow  air  leak  i n  one of  Spacelab’s  vacuum cham- 
bers developed,  but flight controllers i n  Houston d id  n o t  consider  i t  serious, 
the NY  Times reported. Terry White,  a public affairs officer at  Mission Con- 
trol,  said the oxygen leak was so  slight that,  “provided  there are no additional 
fluctuations,  we  have enough gases  to go  to the end of the mission.” 
After  encountering  some  Spacelab  equipment  malfunctions  during  the 
mission’s  first  two days,  Challenger’s  crew  indicated they  had achieved en- 
couraging success with nearly all of the Spacelab‘s  76 scientific experiments 
on   the  effects  of  microgravity  on  metals,  biological  growth,  and  human 
physiology.  Mission planners in  Houston and scientists at the West  German 
science control center near Munich were studying the possibility of extend- 
ing  the flight by  a day  to permit more time for experimentation. 
The crew reported preliminary  results showing that,  as  expected,  seedlings 
growing in the virtual absence of gravity developed roots that curved  in  odd  
directions. “The  roots,  lacking gravity,  do  not seem  to  know which way  to 
go,”  a crew member commented. In another experiment, the Bacillus subtilis 
bacteria  showed  a  higher  rate of  growth  than  anticipated.  Mission  control 
scientists  said  this  “may  be  taken  as  an  indication  that  bacteria  do   react 
differently  i n   space.”  Most  of  the  studies  i n   processing  metal  alloys  and 
growing crystals for  electronics were  still  underway,  so  results were  unavail- 
able until completion  of the mission. 
Earlier  in the mission,  crew member Dr.  Ernst Messerschmid,  a West Ger- 
man physicist,  reported being “disoriented”  when  he awoke,  a symptom of 
the space  motion sickness that  had plagued nearly half of  a l l  Space  Shuttle 
astronauts.  (NYT, Nov 3/85,  A27) 

November 6  The Space Shuttle Challenger on mission 61-A  landed at  9:44 
a.m.  today  at  Edwards  Air  Force  Base,  the  NY  Times  reported,  before  an 
estimated audience of  9,000.  “The  bird fspace  flight,  said  at  a post-landing 
news  conference. 
“The  brakes  look  like  it‘s 
Jesse 
in   good  shape,” 
Moore, NASA’s associate administrator good coming in  and we are very,  very 
pleased with the  results of  the  nosewheel steering test.” 

337 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

During the  landing, Challenger commander Henry Hartsfield tested a new 
steering mechanism bu i l t  to reduce tire and brake damage that had occurred 
during several Space Shuttle landings. An orbiter had not  landed at  Kennedy 
Space Center  (KSC) since the previous April,  when both main landing gears 
collapsed and one tire blew out. The test  called for  Hartsfield to engage the 
new steering mechanism seconds after  the nosewheel touched down on the 
runway so he could steer Challenger 20 feet off course and then bring i t  back 
to  the  centerline. One  more  successful  test  later  in  the  year  would  clear 
orbiters to  resume landing  in December at  KSC. 
Officials  in  West  Germany,  which  paid NASA  $64 m i l l ion  to fly  Spacelab 
D-1  on Challenger, called the mission “highly successful” and predicted that 
90 to  95%  of  all  the  science  studies would  be  completed.  Earlier,  a West 
German  official  a t   the  science  control  center  near  Munich  said  only  one 
study,  a heat diffusion  test  on a sample of  salt,  would  be unfinished by the 
time Challenger  returned to earth. 
Crew members Dr.  Bonnie Dunbar,  Col.  Guion Bluford Jr.,  Dr.  Ernst Mes- 
serschmid,  Dr.  Reinhard  Furrer,  and  Dr.  Wubbo  Ockels  did  not  attend  a 
postflight  press  conference,  the  Washington Post  reported,  but  traveled  to 
Dryden Flight Research Center where researchers would  run tests on them to 
determine how well they  readapted to gravity after a week  in  weightlessness. 
Later the five would go  to Kennedy Space Center for  more elaborate tests. 
The  European Space Agency  (ESA)  announced after  the  flight  that  i t  was 
particularly satisfied with results from Spacelab  D-1,  on which ESA  had 38% 
of the payload in  terms of critical resources (mass, energy,  and crew time). A l l  
ESA  facilities on Spacelab D-1-the  Space Sled,  for studies of man’s  behavior 
under microgravity conditions;  the  Biorack,  a multi-purpose facility  for  bio- 
logical  investigations  of  microgravity  and  cosmic  radiation effects  on  life 
forms;  and the Fluid Physics Module,  for studies of basic fluid phenomena in  
space-performed  perfectly with no operational or technical failures.  (NASA

November 26:  NASA  launched at  7:29  p.m.  today  from KSC  the Space Shut- 
tle Atlantis on mission 61-8  to practice methods for building a space station 
and  to  launch  three  satellites,  the  Washington Post  reported.  People more 
than  400  miles  away  in  South  Carolina  and  Key  West,  Florida,  saw  the 
launch. There had been only two other previous U.S.  night launches:  in 1972 
when  the Apollo  17 crew  left for the moon  in the middle of the night and  in  
1983 when  the Space  Shuttle Challenger departed  in  early morning. 
Nine  minutes  after  launch,  mission  control  reported  Atlantis  was  in   a 
secure orbit  about  200 miles high,  and  launch director  Gene Thomas  said 
the countdown  was  the smoothest yet  in the Space Shuttle program. 
Crew onboard Atlantis  were  Lt.  Col.  Brewster Shaw,  commander;  Lt.  Col. 
Bryan O’Connor,  pilot; mission specialists Dr. Mary Cleave,  Maj. Jerry Ross, 

338 

STS 

and  Lt.  Col.  Sherwood  Spring;  and  payload  specialists  Rudolfo  Neri  Vela 
(Mexico‘s first  astronaut) and McDonnell Douglas engineer Charles Walker. 
During the  mission  the  crew would  launch Mexico’s  Morelos B satellite, 
Australia’s  AUSSAT  2,  and  RCAs  Satcorn  KU-2.  Jerry Ross  and  Sherwood 
Spring would also take two long spacewalks to assemble 93 aluminum struts 
into a &-foot  beam and six  12-foot beams  into a 64-lb.  inverted pyramid to 
test  techniques  that  might  be  used  to  build  the  proposed  permanently 
manned  space  station.  Following  each  spacewalk,  the  mission  specialists 
would disassemble and stow  the beams.  Cameras would  record every move 
so  that  later  a  computer  could  reduce  the  photos  to   a  motion  study  that 
engineers  would  use  to  determine  how  construction work  could  best  be 
performed  i n  the zero gravity of outer space.  (NASA Release 85-153;  W Post, 
Nov 27/85,  A3) 

November 27: Astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis on  mission 61-8 
today  launched  satellites  for  Mexico  and  Australia,  the  Washington Post 
reported. 
The  crew  launched Mexico’s  Morelos  B  in  the  morning,  just  hours after 
liftoff. Morelos B was a Hughes 376 satellite, a standard design used by many 
foreign  national and  private companies,  Kennedy Space Center‘s  Spaceport 
News  said.  It would  provide  telephone,  TV,  and  wire  services  to  Mexico 
through  a  total  of  22  transponders. A  PAM-D  payload assist  module  then 
boosted the satellite to geosynchronous orbit 22,300  miles above earth. The 
satellite would  drift,  unused,  until  it  reached  it final  stationary position  in 
1989. Mexican officials chose to store Morelos B in  orbit because launch cost 
for the satellite could  increase to four  times the amount that Mexico  paid to 
NASA  for today’s  deployment.  Payload specialist Rudolfo Neri Vela,  the first 
Mexican  astronaut,  was  onboard  to   observe  satellite deployment.  In June 
1985 crew  in  the orbiter Discovery deployed the first Morelos satellite. 
At  8:20  p.m.  the  Australian  satellite  AUSSAT  2 spun  out of  the  Atlantis’s 
cargo bay.  “We  got a good deploy,”.said  mission specialist Sherwood Spring, 
who   supervised  the  satellite’s  spring ejection.  “It  looked  like  i t  might  have 
gone a second early,”  he added. AUSSAT  2,  also a Hughes 376 satellite,  was 
the  second of  three  operations  satellites  for  the  government-owned Austra- 
lian National Satellite System.  It had eleven 12-watt transponders and four 30- 
watt  transponders  to   provide  domestic  communications  to  Australia’s 
15-million population. Australia would also use the satellite to improve mari- 
time  and  air  traffic control  communications,  relay  digital  data  for  business 
purposes,  provide standard  telephone communications,  and direct satellite 
to  home TV  broadcasts. A  PAM-D  would also boost the satellite to geosyn- 
chronous orbit.  In August  1985 the  Discovery crew deployed  the  first AUS- 
SAT. 
Mission commander  Brewster Shaw  had tested a l l  systems aboard Atlantis 
and  reported that one of four videotape  recorders was  not working.  Mission 

339  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

control gave  him permission to take apart an electronic cabinet to  look for a 
wiring  flaw,  but  Shaw  said  he  could  not  see  anything  that  was  obviously 
wrong.  Later,  following  directions from  the  ground,  Shaw  cycled  a  circuit 
breaker  and  reported,  “Bingo.  That  seems  to  get  power to VTR1.”  ( W  Post,

November  28: Crew  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  Atlantis  on  mission  61-B 
celebrated Thanksgiving in  space today,  saying i t  was  one of the best Thanks- 
givings they ever  had,  the  Washington  Times reported.  It was  the first  U.S. 
manned spaceflight during that holiday since the third Skylab flight  in  1973. 
The crew’s  main job  for the day was  deployment of the 4,144-lb.  SATCOM 
KU-2  satellite  owned  and  operated  by  RCA  American  Communications 
(RCA Americom).  The  uninsured $50  million  satellite was  the  last  of  three 
KU-brand domestic communications satellites that operated in  the  12  to  14 
gigahertz  range.  It  had  16  operational  transponders  and  s ix   spares,  each 
transmitting 45 watts of power,  more than the 12  to 30 watts used for C-Band 
transponders. 
The  payload assist  module  (PAM) on  the  satellite was  instrumented with 
radio  frequency  telemetry  that  would  downlink  data  to  ARIA  (advanced 
range  instrumentation aircraft) during burn of  the solid-fuel rocket motor,  a 
mission  requirement  for  this  first  flight  of  a  PAM-D2,  the  Kennedy  Space 
Center Spaceport News explained. The uprated upper stage was  identical to 
the  PAM-D,  except  for  size  and  weight.  The  spinup would  be  noticeably 
slower due to the larger mass and  inertial components of the payload. NASA 
designed PAM-D2  to  place up  to 4,200  Ib.  in  geosynchronous orbit,  com- 
pared to the 2,800-lb.  PAM-D  version. 
The  crew’s  dinner  menu -ch icken  consomme,  smoked  turkey,  cranberry 
sauce,  green  beans,  corn,  pasta,  butter  cookies,  and  lemonade-sounded 
traditional,  but the turkey was  preserved before launch by irradiation, sealed 
i n  foil,  and had to be heated in  a device similar to a toaster oven. Crew added 
warm water  to  the consomme,  vegetables,  and  pasta  to  make  them  edible.

November  29 Astronauts  Jerry Ross,  an  Air  Force  Major,  and  Sherwood 
Spring,  an  Army  Lieutenant Colonel,  aboard the  Space  Shuttle Atlantis  on 
mission 61-B  took  40 minutes to erect a 45-foot-high tower with 93  alumi- 
num struts and 33 joints,  the Washington Post  reported. After breaking down 
the tower and stowing the parts,  they assembled  a 400-lb.  inverted pyramid 
out  of  six  12-foot-long aluminum  beams.  They  built  and  broke down  the 
pyramid eight times  in  less time than they were  given for  six.  By  the end of 
their task,  they were assembling the pyramid in  nine minutes and breaking it 
down  in  less than s ix  minutes-three  minutes faster  than their first assembly 
and disassembly. By 9:30  p.m.  they had done in  four  hours a job given them 
to complete in  five.

tures  in  extravehicular activity). Together  they were the first flight demonstra- 
tion  of  construction  of  large  space  structures,  so  called  because they  were 
distinguished  by  different  assembly  methods  and  physical  characteristics. 
The  astronauts  used  no  tools  in the  construction,  rather  they  snapped  to- 
gether  prefabricated components to form the EASVACCESS  structures. 
EASVACCESS  should  provide  NASA  with  valuable  on-orbit  construction 
experience as well as a comparison of assembly rates and techniques used in  
space  to those  used during simulations on  the ground  and  in  neutral buoy- 
ancy water tank tests.  The activity should also  help evaluate potential assem- 
b ly  and maintenance concepts and techniques for the proposed space station 
and  identify  ways  to  improve  erectable  structures  to  ensure  productivity, 
reliability, and safety. 
Tv  views  at  NASA  Headquarters  showed  the  astronauts  trading  places 
twice during their work  and appearing in almost complete control of  a job 
that  had  never  been  done  before  in   space.  Ross  had  the  only  complaint, 
saying  his  gloved  hands  were  sweating  and  that  he  was  using  too  much 
oxygen. 
When  the  two  had  finished  assembling the  six  required pyramids,  astro- 
naut  David  Leetsma  at  mission  control  told  them  to  take  a  break.  “I’d  be 
w i l l ing  to do at  least one more:’  Ross replied. “It feels good to do some good 
hard work.”  The two then proceeded to begin work  again. 
Spring once h i t  his feet against the tower, and Ross by mistake h i t  a switch 
w i th   his  hand  that  turned  on  an  outside  light,  the  only  “accidents”  that 
occurred during the exercise,  although they  triggered a warning from Atlan- 
tis’s  commander Brewster Shaw,  Jr. “You  guys are going great but just remem- 
ber to be careful. The way  that thing shakes up there,  it‘s  not going to be easy 
to chase anything down if i t  breaks loose:’  he cautioned. ( WpOsf, Nov 30185,

December  7:  Astronauts Maj. Jerry Ross  of  the Air  Force and  Lt.  Col.  Sher- 
wood Spring of the Army today stepped outside the Space Shuttle Atlantis on 
mission 61-B  for  the  second  construction exercise  in  the weightlessness of 
space  [see  Space  Transportation  SystedMissions,  Nov.  301, the  NY  Times 
reported. To  TV viewers on earth,  the two appeared to manipulate w i th  ease 
the  heavy  structures  they  were  building,  although both were  sweating and 
breathing  heavily  after  the  first  20 minutes  of  work.  Two  hours  into  the 
spacewalk, they  reported that though their hands,  feet,  and backs were moist 
w i th  sweat,  they were working comfortably. 
The  purpose of  today’s  spacewalk was  the  same  as  previously,  to  test  the 
efficiency o f   techniques to  bu i ld  a  45-foot-high  aluminum tower.  However, 

341 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

the astronauts changed the way  they worked and had the assistance of astro- 
naut Dr. Mary Cleave,  who was operating the Space Shuttle’s  50-foot mechan- 
ical arm.  She  moved the men from  place to  place as their work  required. 
Later  in  the exercise,  the  Washington Post  reported,  Ross and  Spring took 
turns stringing cable along the  four-story metal  frame  they  had constructed, 
just  as  future crews  might  lay cable  for  a  space  station.  They  also  removed 
parts  of  the  tower  and  replaced them  with  other  parts,  simulating a  space 
repair. 
NASA  officials commented after  the first spacewalk on  November  30 that 
the work  had proved more taxing than expected,  perhaps because the astro- 
nauts’ gloves,  unlike the rest of their spacesuits,  were not air-conditioned and 
could  not  carry  away  excess  heat.  Most of  the  work  had  entailed  repeated 
squeezing and  twisting with  the  hands.  Ross and Spring said  after  the exer- 
cise  that  they  would  not want  to  repeat  it before having a day  of  rest.  They 
indicated that the activity had left their hands so  numb and fatigued that they 
had trouble fastening the airlock of the Space  Shuttle as  they  reentered it. 
NASA  officials did  note  they  were  favorably  surprised  by  the  astronauts’ 
rapid  improvement  in  performance as  they  learned  from  successive  repeti- 
tions of the exercise.  ( N U ,  Dec 2/85,  86;  W  Post,  Dec 2/85,  A3) 

December  2  In  their  last  full  day  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  Atlantis  on 
mission 51-8,  the crew concluded an  array of experiments and prepared for 
their  scheduled  landing at  Edwards Air  Force  Base,  the  N Y  Times  reported. 
Answering questions radioed from  reporters at Johnson Space  Flight Center, 
the astronauts  reported progress  not only  in  working out space  station con- 
struction  techniques,  but  also  in  developing  a  gravity-free  pharmaceutical 
factory  to be based on the proposed space  station. 

Payload specialist Charles Walker of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. was  in  
charge of the experiment for development of a space-based factory for  purifi- 
cation  of  a  human  hormone produced  by  genetically engineered bacteria. 
Astronauts  on  previous  flights  had  tested  the  basic  purification  technique, 
called continuous-flow electrophoresis in  a gravityfree environment;  the cur- 
rent experiment simulated an  actual production run of the hormone,  which 
might prove useful in  treating certain forms of anemia. 
During the questioning, astronauts Lt. Col. Sherwood Spring and Maj. Jerry 
Ross  acknowledged  that  they  were  extremely  fatigued  after  each  of  their 
spacewalks and that their hands were  s t i f f  and numb after the practice assem- 
bly,  manipulation,  and disassembly  of  a  45-foot-long truss  and  a  pyramidal 
module.  Nevertheless,  the  two  deemed  the  exercise  a  success.  “We  don’t 
know yet what this w i l l  mean for a future space station:’  Spring commented, 
“hut  it‘s  a start.  Personally,  i t  was  really exhilarating for  me out there,  face  to 
face w i th  the universe.”  (NM, Dec 3/85,  C3)

landed  at  1 :33  
December 3  The  Space  Shuttle Atlantis  on  mission  61 -B 
p.m.  Pacific time  today  on  the  concrete  runway  at  Edwards Air  Force  Base 
before 6,700  spectators, the N Y  Times reported. NASA selected the concrete 
runway because a week of  rain had  left scattered puddles on the usually dry 
lake bed runways. 
’Atlantis  looks beautiful,”  Jesse Moore,  NASPls  associate administrator  for 
space flight,  said after the landing. Apart from “a  few dings” around the ship’s 
nose and  landing  gear,  he added,  there  appeared to  be  “no  unusual dam- 
age. ” 
It was the second mission for the Atlantis,  the newest  in  NASPls fleet of four 
orbiters.  The  crew  described  all  aspects  of  the  flight  as  highly  successful.

lanuary  15:  During NASPls general management status  review,  the office of 
space  flight  reported  on  the  agency  objective  to  undertake a  pricing  and 
marketing strategy that would capture for  the STS  a dominant  percentage of 
the  planned  free-world,  commercially  launched  payloads,  as  measured 
yearly by payments for  launch reservations,  through  the end of CY  88. 
R .  Wisniewski,  assistant associate administrator, noted that a NASA recom- 
mendation  for  fu l lcos t   recovery  sent  to   the White  House would  likely un- 
dergo close scrutiny.  He  anticipated strong competition  as  NASA  marketed 
the Space Shuttle capability, with 28 to 36  STS  launches of the approximately 
58 planned payloads through 1988;  Ariane would capture a sizeable portion 
of the remaining launches. Wisniewski  reported $140 m i l l ion  in  Space Shut- 
tle receipts i n  FY 84 and predicted $188 m i l l ion  in  Space Shuttle revenue in 
FY 85.  (GMSR Report,  Jan 15/85,  35) 

February  7: NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  told  the  US.  House Science 
and Technology  Committee that  the  agency’s  launch service’s  market posi- 
tion had eroded “very  severely” and that he had to be “a  little bit pessimistic” 
about  NASA’s  ability  to  hold a  lion’s  share  in  the  future,  Aerospace  Daily 
reported. Beggs made the comment in  response to a question about the need 
for a 5th Space Shuttle orbiter. 
During the  previous  14  months,  NASA  had  won  five  new  commercial 
launches;  The  European Space  Agency‘s  (ESA)  Ariane,  five.  Beggs  said  the 
Europeans were “coming along very aggressively”  in  using the Ariane 4 and 5 
vehicles to  improve  launch capabilities and that agreement by  ministers at- 
tending  the  ESA  council  meeting  [see  European Space  Agency,  Feb.  41  to 
further Ariane 5 development  “was  significant.”  ( A D ,  Feb 7/85,  1)

kb rua ry  25: NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  criticized the Air  Force  and 
NOAA  for  plans  to  launch  some  satellites aboard  surplus  Titan  I I   missiles 
rather than using the Space Shuttle,  saying i t  would cost NASA  $500  million, 
the  Mshingron  Post reported. “You  know the o ld  syndrome:’  he said,  ”if  it 
wasn’t  invented here [at  the Air  Force]  it can’t  be a l l   that  good  . . . I don’t 
like it.  I t  i s  not good for  our  short-term future and makes  it that much more 
difficult  for  us  to get on an  ew n  footing in  the next five years.” 
The  controversy  had  begun  w i th   an  Air  Force  decision  to  refurbish  and 
r e d e d o p  obsolete Titan II intercontinental ballistic missiles to  launch up to 
12 Air  Force satellites that NASA  had assumed would be flying on the Space 
Shuttle. 
When  N O M  heard  of  the  Air  Force  decision,  i ts   acting  administrator, 
Anthony  Calio  (a  former  NASA  official),  had contacted the Air  Force  about 
launching Over  the next seven years three advanced weather satellites,  called 
Metsats,  into  polar  orbit.  When  questioned,  Calio  had  said  the  Air  Force 
offered a deal that would save NOAA $90 million-it  would  cost $100  mil- 
l ion  to  redesign the Metsats to fly on  the Space Shuttle and  $105  m i l l ion  in  
launch fees  versus  an  Air  Force  charge of  $115  m i l l ion  for  the  three Titan  II 
launches,  resulting in  a net saving of $90 million.  “This  agency has a budget 
of $1 b i l l ion  a year  so  we’re  talking about  10% of our annual  budget. This  i s  
strictly a business deal,”  Calio concluded. 
Beggs  responded that he always assumed  the Air  Force and  NOAA would 
use the Space Shuttle, although they had not signed a formal  agreement. He 
said he d id  not believe NOAA would save that much and that  the Air  Force 
would  bear  the  refurbishment  cost  to  redevelop  the  Titan  II, estimated by 
Beggs at  $100 million. 
“I believe what we’re  talking here i s  a savings to NOAA and a net loss  to the 
U.S.  Treasury,”  Beggs  said.  ‘7  think  this whole scheme  should  be  looked at 
vvry carefully by the administration and by Congress.”  And he mentioned his 
concern that  the Air  Force  plan could set  a  dangerous  precedent.  (W  Post,

May 27:  A fare war  had broken out in  space,  fortune  reported, and Arianes- 
pace,  a  consortium  of  European gmrnmen ts   and  private  companies  that 
operated  the  European-built Ariane  rocket,  was  grabbing  communications 
satellite launches away from the U.S.  Space Shuttle by aggressively underpric- 
ing   it.  Although  NASA  had  launched  30  satellites,  nine  aboard  the  Space 
Shuttle, over  the previous four years and the Ariane  less than  12,  the Europe- 
ans would become major competitors,  Fortune predicted. 
A  Space  Shuttle  launch  cost  $25  million;  Arianespace charged  $24   mil- 
lion. And Arianespace had cut  that  price by  as  much as  $ 3   m i l l ion  to  lure 
some  U.S.  customers.  Arianespace officials said  i t s   throwaway  rockets were 
more efficient at  the single task  of  launching satellites than was  the complex 
Space Shuttle,  which NASA  had designed to perform a range of scientific and 

344 

STS 

military missions. “Using  the shuttle for  launching satellites:’  Charles Bigot, 
director of  Arianespace,  said,  ” i s   like flying a  supersonic Mirage jet  fighter 
when a l l  you  need  i s  a puddle jumper.” 
American  entrepreneurs  who  wanted  to  get  into  the  satellitelaunching 
business  complained  that  prices  charged  by  both  Arianespace  and  NASA 
were  ridiculously low  as a result of government subsidies.  Transpace Carriers 
Inc.,  for  example,  held the  rights to  buy  the  Delta rocket from  its manufac- 
turer McDonnell Douglas Corp.,  but couldn‘t  launch a satellite for  less than 
$45 million. 
The U.S.  Department of Transportation, which wanted to encourage private 
Companies  like Transpace Carriers,  was  encouraging President Reagan  to set 
Space  Shuttle  launch  rates  high enough  to  make  the  commercial  launches 
profitable. So  the future of the launch business,  Fortune said,  would rest with 
President Reagan’s  decision on Space  Shuttle pricing-and  on Arianespace’s 
reaction.  If Reagan boosted Space  Shuttle launch fees,  it would please en tre  
preneurs anxious to get  into the space business. But that would also give the 
Europeans a bigger opening into the space  business than they’ve  had so  far. 
(Fortune, May 27/85,  138) 

August  I :   The  White  House  announced  that  i t   had  sent  Congress  a  new 
Space  Shuttle pricing policy that entailed,  starting October  1,  1988, auction- 
ing the Space  Shuttle’s  cargo  bay  to commercial  and  foreign  customers at  a 
minimum rate of  $74 m i l l ion  for  a full  bay,  the  Washington  Times reported. 
This  meant  that  owners  of  three  satellites  could  share  a  mission  and  pay 
NASA a little less than $25 m i l l ion  apiece or about $1 m i l l ion  more than they 
presently  paid  for  Space  Shuttle  launches.  However,  i f  demand  for  shuttle 
space  exceeded  its  availability,  the  auction  system  would  drive  prices  u p  
ward.  Europe’s  Arianespace SA  charged $25  m i l l ion  for  a  launch. 
President Reagan, who earlier had suggested that space should be open to 
private enterprise and that the Space Shuttle might be turned over  to industry, 
directed  NASA  under  the  new  policy  to  establish  auction  procedures  “to 
ensure  maximum  return to  the  government and  equitable  treatment for  a l l  
potential launch customers.”  The  President also  told  NASA  to  review annu- 
ally Space Shuttle costs and the effectiveness of  its pricing policies and report 
i t s  findings and recommendations to the president‘s  national security adviser 
and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
The new policy represented a victory for NASA  and defeat for the Transpor- 
tation  Department and  Secretary  Elizabeth Hanford Dole,  who  had  argued 
for  a full-bay price no  lower than $129 m i l l ion  in  order to encourage private 
industry to get  into the  launch vehicle business on  its own,  the  Washington 
Post  reported. 
Two  companies wanted to compete with NASA  and Arianespace.  General 
Dynamics signed a letter of intent with NASA  to use the Atlas-Centaur rocket, 
and Transpace  Carriers  Inc. signed a similar  letter to  use  the  Delta rocket to 

345 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

launch satellites. Both companies said they could not compete with a Space 
Shuttle price of  less than $40 m i l l ion  to send  up a single satellite. 
The  Transportation  Department argued  for  a  higher Space  Shuttle launch 
price to improve private industry’s bargaining power. But NASA  said a higher 
charge would send customers to Arianespace, which had booked more than 
a third  of  the  world’s  future  commercial  satellite  launch  traffic.  ( W  Ernes, 
Aug 2/85,  1OC;  W  Post,  Aug  7/85,  A3) 

September 77:  Hughes Communications Inc. said today i t  would negotiate an 
approximately $180 commitment with NASA  for  launch by the Space Shuttle 
of six communications satellites,  including two  for  a new Japanese network, 
after receiving proposals from NASA and from Arianespace for  i t s  expendable 
Ariane  launch vehicle,  Aerospace  Daily  reported.  Hughes  indicated selec- 
tion of the Space Shuttle was  based  solely on cost and was  not related to the 
recent Ariane  3  failure [see  European Space Agency,  Sept.  121. 
Space  Shuttle flights scheduled for  December  1987 and May  1988 would 
launch  HS-393  Ku-band satellites that  Hughes was  building for  the Japan 
Communications  Satellite Co.  UCSat).  Hughes  reserved  between  1988  and 
1990 four  slots for  placement of HS-393s over the U.S. 
Hughes Communications owned 30% of JCSat, a jo in t  venture licensed the 
previous June by  Japan’s  Ministry  of  Pos t   and  Telecommunications to  con- 
struct and operate a two-satellite system to serve Japan. The Japanese trading 
companies C.  ltoh  and  Co.  Ltd.  and  Mitsui  and  Co.  Ltd.  owned 40% and 
30%,  respectively, of the joint venture.  ( A D ,  Sept  18/85,  1) 

October  18:  A  controversy between the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration  (NOAA) and  NASA  [see  Space  Transportation  System/Reve- 
nues,  Feb.  251 appeared over  when  NOAA agreed  to  launch meteorological 
satellites (Metsats)  into orbit  in  return for which NASA  would give NOAA a 
discount  for  carrying  the  satellites  into orbit  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle,  the 
Washington Post reported. 
A deal between NOAA and the Air Force that would have saved NOAA $90 
m i l l ion   in  launch costs  never went through,  in  large  part because NASA  and 
NOAA began working behind the  scenes  to  bury the hatchet,  the  Post said. 
The  previous  week  NASA  Administrator  James Beggs  sent  Anthony  Calio, 
NOAA  administrator,  a  letter  outlining  a  deal  governing  three  Metsat 
launches starting in  1989. 
NASA  agreed to  share  with  NOAA  the  $80 m i l l ion  cost of modifying the 
Metsat for  a Space  Shuttle launch,  to put a Metsat on a Space  Shuttle within 
three months after NOAA asked for  it, and to shave $6.5  m i l l ion  off the $105 
m i l l ion  in  feed NASA  ordinarily would charge NOAA for the three launches. 
“We  gave  them  a  good  price,”  Beggs  said.  “They’re  on  the  shuttle  at  what 
essentially  i s  our cost for  launching them.’’  (WPost, Oct  18/85,  A21)

October 29: The U.S.  House Appropriations Committee deleted $7.2 m i l l ion  
in  FY 8 6  funds  requested by  the Air  Force to  initiate a $350  m i l l ion  program 
to refurbish Titan I1  ICBMs for use as space boosters,  Defense Daily reported. 
The  committee  warned  that  the  Titan  I1  launchers  could  “only  have  a 
further  impact  on  the  Shuttle  and  result  in   a  less  efficient  use  of  Shuttle 
facilities”  and  pointed out that  the Air  Force  had  “not  been able  to demon- 
strate  why  the  expensive  Titan  II  refurbishment  program  i s   critical  to  the 
defense of the nation.” 
The  Committee  also  noted  that  the  National Oceanic  and  Atmospheric 
Administration dropped  i t s  plans to  launch some  payloads on the Titan  II  in  
favor  of  launching them on the Space  Shuttle [see  Space Transportation Sys- 
tedRewnues  Feb.  25 and Oa. 181,  “bringing  into question whether Titan II 
i s   costeffective  on  a  per  launch  basis:’  the  committee  said.  It  also  cited 
classified reasons for  i t s  action.  (D /D ,  Oct 29/85,  305) 

N w m b e r   12: Frederic J.P.  d’Allest,  chairman of Arianespace,  told  the  US. 
Senate science,  technology,  and space subcommittee the previous week  that 
his firm  offered satellite insurance at  lower than market  rates to those  using 
the Ariane  rocket to  launch their  satellites,  the  Washington Times  reported. 
The  insurance covered only the booster phase of a satellite launch. 
Arianespace charged between  11  and  13%  of  the total value of the  launch 
for  insuring an Ariane  launch from  lift off to geostationary orbit, that portion 
of  the  flight  under  Arianespace’s  control.  Satellite operators  had  to  go  to 
commercial  insurance markets to obtain  coverage  for  the  rest  of a satellite’s 
operation. 
More than  $600  m i l l ion   in   losses  from  the  failure  of  sewn  satellites  in 
almost  two years  had  resulted  in   a  tightened  insurance  market  that  was 
seriously  threatening  commercial  space  projects.  Satellite  insurance  firms 
had cut  back  on  the amount they would commit to  insure  launches,  while 
boosting  premiums  to  more  than  20%   of  the  total  insured  value  of  the 
launch. The subcommittee before which d’Allest  testified was  investigating a 
possible federal  role in  easing the  insurance problem.  However, commercial 
underwriters warned  the  subcommittee  that  the  federal  government should 
stay out of the  insurance business. 
“In  my  viewy  James Barrett,  president of  International Technology Under- 
writers,  said,  “there  i s   no  role  for  government  to  play  in   this  commercial 
market.  Intervention can  only disturb normal market processes.”  He noted 
the solution to the problem was  impraved reliability of  satellite manufactur- 
ers and launch agencies. “Insurance  . . . cannot compensate for unaccept- 
able leve ls  of  reliability:’  he commented.  ( W  Times,  Nov  12/85,  7C) 

December  12: NASA  announced it reached agreement w i th  the Department 
of  Defense (DOD) on  a  pricing and  reimbursement  policy for  DOD  use  of 

347 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

the Space Transportation System during the period FY 89 through FY 91. The 
agreement established an  average  price of  $60 m i l l ion  (in 1982 dollars) for 
each DOD  launch,  an  average which was  based on the estimated cost to fly 
and  an  exchange of  launch and  range  support  services  between  DOD  and 
NASA. 
The  price  reflected  a  fixed-base  component  of  $30  m i l l ion   for  each 
planned flight and an  incremental component of  $30  m i l l ion  for each actual 
flight. The  annual fixed-based component  total-$270  m i l l ion  a year,  based 
on  DOD  projections of nine equivalent flights-would  be paid regardless of 
the number of actual flights,  while the  $30 m i l l ion   incremental component 
would be paid for each actual flight. 
By combining a fixed annual charge w i th  a low variable cost per flight,  the 
agreement insured that  NASA  would be able to cover  its funding needs and 
DOD would continue to  rely on the Space  Shuttle as  DOD’s  primary space 
launch vehicle.  (NASA Release 85-169) 

Scient if ic  Research 

january  14:  NASA announced that Space  Shuttle flight 51-C  would carry the 
first  of  two experiments  to  investigate  effects  of  different  diseases  on  red 
blood cell  aggregation  and  blood viscosity.  The  experiment  was  originally 
scheduled for mission 51-A  in  November 1984 but withdrawn due to orbiter 
weight  and  center-of-gravity  considerations.  The  Department  of  Defense 
(DOD)  had agreed  to  add  the experiment  to  51-C,  a dedicated  DOD  mis- 
sion. 
Ca l led  aggregation of  red  blood cells  (ARC),  the experiment would deter- 
mine  rate  of  formation  (kinetics) and  internal  structure  and  organization 
(morphology) of  red  cells  and  the  thickness  (viscosity) of  whole  blood at 
high- and  low-flow rates.  Healthy donors and  donors with  various  medical 
conditions such  as  heart disease,  hypertension,  diabetes,  and cancer would 
provide blood samples.  Researchers would compare  results obtained  in  mi- 
crogravity  w i th   results from  a  simultaneous and  identical ground-based  ex- 
periment  to  determine  what  effects  gravity  had  on  the  kinetics  and 
morphology of  the  blood  and,  therefore,  whether  researchers  could  use 
information  obtained  in  microgravity  to  formulate  new  diagnostic  tests  or 
improve existing tests  for  the  benefit of  clinical  research  and  medical  prac- 
tice. 
Flight  hardware,  weighing about  165  Ib.  and  installed  in  three  m iddeck  
lockers  in   the  crew  cabin,  would  consist  of  a  container  housing  a  blood 
pumphtorage subsystem,  parallel plate slit capillary viscometer,  photo/opti- 
cal subsystem,  thermal  control system,  pressure transducer,  and an  electron- 
ics equipment package to provide automated control and data acquisition. A 

348 

STS 

crew member would activate the experiment;  the electronics package would 
automatically  operate  a l l   other  procedures. Running time  would  be  about 
eight hours. 
Dr.  Leopold Dintenfass of the Kanematsu Institute (Department of Medical 
Research),  Sydney,  Australia,  had developed the experiment and experiment 
hardware. Marshall Space Flight Center had responsibility for the flight exper- 
iment. 
After  landing,  data from the flight experiments would be delivered to  Din- 
tenfass  for  analysis  and  comparison  with  ground-based  experiment  data.

experiments.  NASA  had  scheduled  both  for  previous  missions,  but  with- 
drawn them due to orbiter-weight and center-of-gravity considerations. 
The SFMD,  a jo in t  NASAMartin Marietta Aerospace/U.S.  Air  Force experi- 
ment,  would  test  how weightless  fluids behaved  in  transit  from  one  tank  to 
another to demonstrate the transfer  of fluids planned for servicing and main- 
taining spacecraft  in  orbit.  Space  Shuttle crew  would manually operate  the 
experiment,  consisting of  13-in.diameter clear acrylic  supply  and  receiving 
tanks,  w i th  a series of valves  in  which pressurized air would force f lu id  to and 
from  transparent tanks,  a video  tape  recorder and 35mm s t i l l  camera photo- 
graphing the operation and an  accelerometer measuring any  motion caused 
by the orbiter that affected the experiment.  (NASA Release 85-10) 

February  74: NASA  indicated i t  might remove squirrel monkeys from an April 
30 Space  Shuttle flight because the species  carried a herpes virus known to 
cause cancer  in  some  subhuman primates,  the  N Y  Times reported. 
Research  had  shown  the  virus  could  not  survive  in   high-order  primates, 
including humans,  and  NASA  officials  emphasized  i t  was  not  one  of  the 
forms known to cause a variety of ailments in  humans. The agency  had spent 
more than a year trying to assess the risk possibilities to astronauts.  ( N M ,  Feb

March 22:  Adm.  James Watkins,  speaking to  reporters after a ceremony dur- 
ing which  astronaut  Thomas  Mattingly  was  promoted  to  commodore and 
named to head the Navy Space Program Office, said that a Navy oceanogra- 
pher who had traveled on a Space Shuttle flight the previous fall had brought 
back "some  fantastically  important" information that would make i t  easier for 
U.S.  submarines to hide in  the world's  oceans,  the Washington Postreported.

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Watkins said the oceanographer, whom he would not name but was  known 
to  be  Paul  Scully-Power,  a  civilian  who  worked  at  the  Naval  Underwater 
Systems Center,  New  London, Connecticut,  said the  information was  vital  in  
trying  to  understand  the  ocean  depths. When  asked  i f  satellite technology 
might  not  be  hastening the  day  when  submarines  could  be  tracked  from 
space,  Watkins acknowledged  that  technology was  opening some doors on 
submarine tracking.  However,  he pointed out that the question was  whether 
doors opened on detecting submarines faster  than doors opened on  learning 
about the oceans depths.  He added that  “we’re  s t i l l  ahead of the game  in  the 
latter category. 
“So the ability to track  submarines-we  don’t  s e e  that as  being a threat  to 
our  forces  until  the  turn  of  the century or  later,  depending on what  kind of 
breakthroughs we  might  find  at  the  end  of  this  decade  or  into  the  next:’ 
Watkins concluded.  ( W  Post,  Mar 22/85,  A101 

March 27: NASA  had scratched four  squirrel monkeys scheduled to  be car- 
ried into orbit by the Space Shuttle Challenger in  April  because NASA  found 
they had a form of herpes that could be transmitted to the astronaut crew,  the 
Washington Post reported. 
The monkeys’ herpes,  called Herpes Samirii, was  not the virus transmitted 
sexually by  humans,  but was  unique to  New World  primates whose  natural 
habitat was  the rain forests of South America.  Researchers suspected the virus 
of causing cancer in  lower mammals such as  rats and therefore classified it as 
potentially  cancerous  in  humans.  NASA  replaced the  monkeys  with  those 
from colonies bred to be virus-free. 
Four  monkeys  recruited  from  the  National  Institutes of  Health  and  one 
from Harvard Uniwrsity had been in  training since January for their flight on 
the  second  mission  of  Spacelab,  scheduled  for  April  29  a t   the earliest.  Dr. 
Arnauld  Nicogossian,  NAWs chief of space  medicine,  said  they were  look- 
ing for  a sixth monkey even  though only three might be flown.  “One  of  the 
monkeys  in  training i s  too small  and w i l l  haw? to be replaced,  and  it w i l l  be 
nice to  haw a backup when  the  time comes  for  them  to  go  into orbit:’  he 
said. 
In space the monkeys‘  cages  would haw their  own oxygen and  food and 
water supplies in  the Spacelab portion of the Space Shuttle’s  cargo bay,  which 
w a s  shut off from Challenger‘s cabin by an airlock. The upcoming flight was  a 
shakedown  cruise  for  the  monkeys  to  ascertain that  their  cages  functioned 
properly  and  to  make  sure  the  monkeys wouldn’t  get  frightened or  injured 
during launch or  return to earth.  (Washington Post, Mar 27/85,  A20) 

April  12:  NASA  announced that the American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), 
sponsored by the  life sciences division of N M s  space science and applica- 
tion office (OSSA) and developed by the medical sciences division at Johnson 

350 

STS 

Space Center,  would fly on  STS  51-D,  the first of three planned flights of the 
equipment w i th  follow-on  activity determined by data  results. 
The objective of AFE was to obtain data on in-flight cardiovascular changes 
during space  flight.  Most changes seemed  to  result  from  the  shift of  body 
fluids out of the legs and into the chest and head in  weightlessness. The brain 
apparently  detected  this  shift  and  interpreted  i t   as  an  increase  in   blood 
volume.  Normal  responses  to  this  “overload”  were  an  increase  in  urination 
and a decrease  in  thirst,  reducing blood volume from an  acceptable  level. 
Other effects of weightlessness included changes  in  heart size,  an  increase 
i n  the amount of blood pumped by the heart, and a decrease  in  the resistance 
to the  flow of  blood through the arteries. Most of  these  latter changes were 
normal  responses  to weightlessness;  however,  when  combined w i th   the  re- 
duced  blood  volume,  they  made  effective  functioning  on  return  to  earth 
difficult. 
Determining the important cardiac and vascular changes during adaptation 
to  weightlessness and during the  readaptation to gravity  after  a flight would 
reveal  how  the  cardiovascular  system  responded  to  unusual  stresses.  This 
would be valuable  in  the development of more effective countermeasures to 
the detrimental effects of spaceflight and  in understanding the functioning of 
the circulation  in  general. 
The AFE  equipment  used very  high  frequency  sound waves  (echocardio- 
graphy)  to  obtain  in  vivo  cardiodynamic  structural  and  functional  data.  A 
probe  held  next  to  the  skin  sent  high-frequency sound  waves  (ultrasound) 
through  the  skin  and  into  the  body.  It  then  detected  their  reflections,  or 
echos,  from organ surfaces. The electronic circuitry  of  the echocardiograph 
calculated  the  distance  travelled  by  the  ultrasound  pulse  from  the  delay 
between the transmission of the pulse and the detection of  its echo. 
Dr. M. Rhea Seddon,  a co-investigator on the project, had trained to use the 
AFE  to  image her own  heart from several different angles. Every day  in  flight 
she would  record her own  echocardiogram and  those of  up to  three  other 
crew members as  time and circumstances permitted.  Dr. Seddon would o b  
tain  the  first  echocardiogram as  soon  as  possible after  orbital  insertion and 
midway through and prior to sleep on the first flight day. 
During the three flights on AFE,  NASA planned to acquire data on about 10 
crew members,  along with pre- and postflight data.  (NASA MOR E-420-51-

A p r i l   72:  NASA  announced  that  the  Phase  Partitioning Experiment  (PPE), 
sponsored by the microgravity science and applications division  of the office 
of  space  science  and  applications  (OSSA) and  developed and  managed  by 
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), would fly on STS  51-D  in  a locker used 
by  payload specialist Sen.  Jake Garn,  who would  take sole responsibility for 
the operation of the PPE. 

351 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Phase partitioning was  a selective yet gentle and  inexpensive technique for 
the  separation  of  cells  and  proteins.  It  required  establishing  a  two-phase 
system  by  adding various  polymers  to  an  aqueous  solution  containing  the 
materials to be separated (two-phase systems  were  similar to the  immiscible 
liquids o i l   and  water).  After  establishment of  such  two-phase polymer  sys- 
tems,  the  biological  materials they  contained  tended  to  partition  into  the 
different phases. 
Theoretically,  phase  partitioning  should  separate  cells  with  significantly 
higher resolution than was  obtained in  the  laboratory. Performing the experi- 
ments in  orbit should provide a long-term weightless environment that would 
help control  the separation of  the  phases  and obtain  better fractionation of 
biological cells.  Although  the  interaction of  the  ce l ls  and  phases  could  be 
done  in  a  slower  and  more controlled  manner  in  weightlessness,  there  re- 
mained  the  problem of  combining the  phase  emulsion  back  into  the  two 
separated phases without the effects of gravity.  The  PPE would examine this 
problem through two methods: natural coalescence and preferential wetting 
to  localize the separate phases. 
The  PPE equipment was  a small hand-held unit weighing 427 g (one Ib.). 
MSFC  researchers fabricated the unit from  plastic materials with  transparent 
sides  so  that  there  were  15  separate  small  chambers,  each  with  i t s   own 
stainless  steel  mixer  ball,  allowing for  simultaneous study  of  a  number  of 
experimental variables. After shaking the unit to achieve an emulsification of 
the  phases  in  the  chambers,  photographs over  the  next  45  minutes would 
record the progress of the separations. The PPE operator would note transient 
phenomena not recorded by  the camera.  Researchers  hoped  the  procedure 
could be repeated three times during the flight.  (NASA MOR E-420-51-D- 
13  [prelaunch] Apr  12/85) 

A p r i l  12  NASA  announced  that a protein crystal growth  (PCG) experiment, 
sponsored by the microgravity science and application division of the office 
of space science and applications (OSSA), would be flown on STS  51-D  in  a 
middeck locker used for the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Corp.’s  contin- 
uous  flow  electrophoresis  system  (CFES).  CFES  payload  specialist  Charles 
Walker would operate the PCG  experiment. 
Detailed knowledge of their composition and structure was  extremely im- 
portant to understanding the nature and chemistry of  proteins and Douglas’s 
ability  to  manufacture and/or  modify them  for  medical  uses.  However,  for 
most  complex  proteins,  it  was  not  possible  to  grow  on  earth  crystals  of 
sufficient  size and  quality  to  allow  analyses  by  X-ray  or  neutron diffraction 
techniques.  Researchers believed growth of  such crystals would be possible 
in  the weightlessness of  orbital  spaceflight where  gravitydriven convection 
currents were minimized and where the crystals  remained suspended during 
their growth cycle. The  PCG  experiment  hardware would accomplish this. 

352  

STS 

After  reaching orbit, Walker would manipulate the small  PCG  unit to mix 
about 3 0  pairs of solutions.  Near the end of the flight,  he would prepare the 
unit  for  reentry and  stow  it  in  the  equipment  locker.  Upon return to  earth, 
NASA would send the unit to MSFC for analyses  by the principal investigator. 
Results  of  the  analyses  would  determine  the  schedule  for  further  flights.

May 29: Dr.  Paul Scully-Power,  the first oceanographer to orbit the earth,  said 
today  at  a  Baltimore meeting of  the American  Geophysical  Union,  that  he 
had  observed  previously  undetected  spiral  currents  in   many  parts  of  the 
world’s  oceans  while  he was  aboard  the  Space  Shuttle Challenger,  the  NY 
Times reported. Oceanographers at the meeting said these eddies introduced 
an  entirely new dimension to studies  of ocean dynamics. 
Scully-Power had seen  the eddies,  for example,  throughout the Mediterra- 
nean and between the east coast of the US. and the Gulf Stream;  they were 
typically about 25  miles wide,  far  smaller than  large eddies observed in  the 
Gulf Stream.  I t  was  the great prevalence of these swirls,  whose origin was  yet 
unexplained,  that astounded scientists. 

ScullyPower  said  he  did  not  know  how  long  each  eddy  survived,  but 
guessed  it might be days  or  weeks.  Nor did  he  know how deeply  into the 
ocean  they  extended. 
At the meeting,  Scully-Power displayed one photograph of five such spirals 
in  the eastern Mediterranean, a l l  aligned in  a  single row.  (NY7; May  31/85,

lune   19:  NASA announced  that  i t  signed today  with  Instrument Technology 
Associates  (ITA) an  agreement for  ITA to develop for use on the Space  Shuttle 
flight  hardware consisting of a standardized experiment module (ISEM) pay- 
load carrier,  a turn  key  module for  use  by any  commercial firm,  government 
agency,  research organization,  or educational  institution wishing to conduct 
experiments in  a microgravity environment. An organization could purchase 
or  lease a l l  or part of the  ISEM. 
Under  the  agreement,  NASA  would  provide  ITA  w i th   two  Space  Shuttle 
flights to obtain data and validate the  ISEM design. NASA  had scheduled for 
late 1987 the first  ISEM test that would carry a payload for  the Bioprocessing 
and Pharmaceutical Center of the Philadelphia University City Science Cen- 
ter. 
ITA  would  design  the  ISEM  to  be  compatible  w i th   the  proposed  space 
station with the  idea that  initial users of the module would progress to  larger 
and  more  sophisticated  payloads  to  fly  in   the  future  aboard  the  station.

August  1 :  Astronauts aboard the orbiter Challenger on Space Shuttle mission 
51-F  released  today  a  six-and-a-half-foot-long drum-shaped  satellite,  the 
Plasma  Diagnostics  Package,  from  the  orbiter's  payload bay,  shot  i t  with  a 
looping  beam  from  an  electron  gun,  and  then  retrieved  i t  with  the  Space 
Shuttle's  50-foot mechanical arm,  the NY  Times reported. 
One  purpose of  the  demonstration was  to  study  the  electrical effects  the 
Space  Shuttle had as  it moved through  the electrically charged gases  of the 
ionosphere,  effects which  occasionally  caused  the  Space  Shuttle to  emit a 
soft golden glow. Researchers considered solving that riddle important to the 
success of  future mission,  which would  carry  sensitive  instruments that  the 
aura might disturb. 
Another goal was to achieve a better understanding of the aurora, known i n  
the northern hemisphere as  the  northern lights,  which was  a disturbance i n  
the atmosphere that created bright  lights  in  the night sky  over  polar regions. 
The astronauts reported seeing flashes of light as  the beam followed natural 
magnetic lines to the satellite,  the  Washington Post  reported;  the newspaper 
said scientists on the ground called the demonstration "a  fabulous success." 
(NYT Aug 2/85,  D14;  W Post,  Aug 2/85,  A4) 

Oc tobe r   14:  Wesley  Hymer,  a  biochemist  at  Pennsylvania State  University 
and one of  2 0  researchers who analyzed tissue  samples from  2 4  rats  flown 
aboard  the  Space  Shuttle  Challenger  in  April,  said  today  the  rats  suffered 
significant  reductions  in   the  release  of  growth  hormones,  the  NY  Times 
reported. The findings  could signal a problem for  astronauts,  in  that weight- 
lessness  could  affect  the  ability  of  special  cells  in  their  pituitary  glands  to 
produce  growth  hormones  that  govern  development  and  maintenance  of 
muscle and bone tissue. 
Richard Grindeland, a researcher at NASA's  Ames Reseach Center,  reported 
the previous month that the same rats lost bone and muscle strength. Grinde- 
land  said  that  they  "were  limp,  like dishrags,"  and  that  dissection  revealed 
"very  drastic  changes"  in  bone and  muscle strength.  However,  researchers 
would need more test results before they could link growth  hormone reduc- 
tion to muscle and bone atrophy,  Hymer said.  But he added,  "I think there's 
probably a good chance that there  i s  a relationship." 
After  a  battery  of  tests  that  included  implanting  normal  rats  with  growth 
hormone cells from the space rats,  Hymer noted a reduction of up to 50%  in  
release of  the  hormone.  "Something  i s   radically changed  i n  those pituitary 
glands as  a result of the space flight:'  Hymer said. And he added,  "I think  the 
surprising thing was  these changes occurred  so  quickly. They  happened in  
seven days  i n  flight." 
However,  Hymer  said  researchers did  not  know  i f  astronauts suffered the 
same  k ind  of changes.  "I can  tell you  that  there are data  that  show  that  the 
blood levels of growth hormones in  the astronauts from Skylab were reduced 
by a significant amount:'  Hymer said.

Hymer  planned  to  send  growth  hormone  cells,  some  of  which  would 
contain  inhibitory  and  stimulatory chemicals,  on a Space  Shuttle flight  the 
following  September.  He said  he also would  like to see  similar experiments 
on  primates. (NYT Oct 15/85,  C8) 

December  70 :   Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  announced  that  NASA’s  first 
experiments to construct large structures  in space were a success  [see Space 
Transportation System/Mission,  Nov.  3 0  and  Dec.  21.  EASE  (Experimental 
Assembly  of  Structures  in   Extravehicular  Activity)  and  ACCESS  (Assembly 
Concept for Construction of Erectable Space  Structures) carried out by astro- 
nauts Jerry Ross and Sherwood Spring “went exactly as we had planned,  and 
all experiment and Space Transportation System objectives were met:’  said Ed 
Valentine,  mission manager  for  the  EAWACCESS  payload flown  on  Space 
Shuttle mission 61-8.  Those objectives included gathering data to compare 
assembly  rates and techniques i n  space to those used during simulations on 
the ground and  in  neutral buoyancy  water  tests,  evaluating potential space 
station assembly and maintenance concepts and techniques, and identifying 
ways  to  improve erectable structures  to  ensure  productivity,  reliability,  and 
safety. 
“Preliminary data obtained from live downlink TV  looks very good:’  Valen- 
tine explained. “But  we won’t  be able to make a complete analyses until we 
see  the  rest  of the data:’  which  was  i n  the  form  of  videotape and film  shot 
while  Ross  and Spring performed the construction tasks. 
Once the data were  analyzed and  reported,  Valentine said,  i t  would  give 
large  space  structure  designers  baseline data  on  the  two  construction a p  
proaches studied. “They  can  then determine which  approach would  be a p  
propriate for a particular task,”  he explained. 
O n  December 11  Valentine said  he would  meet for  a debriefing with  the 
Space Shuttle crew and principal investigators. Then i n  about three weeks the 
principal  investigators would  receive the videotape and film shot during the 
experiments,  and  Valentine  would  publish  a  final  report  i n   about  three 
months. (NASA Release 85-66) 

December  1 8  Marshall Space Flight Center’s  (MSFC) Materials Science Labe 
ratory would make  i t s  first spaceflight on Space  Shuttle 61-C,  scheduled for 
launch on December 18,  the Marshall Star reported. Using a mission peculiar 
equipment support structure (MPESS)  in  the payload bay,  the Materials Sci- 
ence Laboratory-2 (MSL-2)  would provide accommodations for three experi- 
ments  i n   materials  processing-the  MSFC-managed  Electromagnetic 
Levitator  (EML)  and  Automated  Directional  Solidification  Furnace  (ADSF) 
and  the  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory-Managed  Three-Axis  Acoustic  Levitator 
(3AAL). 
The  electromagnetic levitator experiment would  allow  scientists  to  study 
the effects of materials flow during solidification of a melted material in  the 

355 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

microgravity environment.  Six  samples  would  be suspended  in  the e lec tre  
magnetic  field  of  a  co i l   and  melted  by  induction  heating  from  the  coil's 
electromagnetic  field. 
The  ADSF  consisted  of  four  furnace,  or  sample,  units.  The  experiment 
would  investigate  the  melting  and  solidification  process  of  four  different 
materials for later comparison to s-.rnples  of the same materials processed on 
earth. 
In  the 3AAL experiment,  12  liquid sampies would be suspended in  sound 
pressure  waves  and  rotated  and  oscillated  in  a  low-gravity  nitrogen atmo- 
sphere.  Investigators would  study  the  degree  of  sphericity  attainable  and 
small bubble migration similar to that having to do  with the  refining of glass. 
The  standard  switch  panel  i n   the  orbiter  aft  flight  deck  would  provide 
activation, deactivation, and status monitoring capability.  (Marsha l l  Star, Dec 
18/85,  2 )  

During December: NASA  scheduled for  launch on December 18  the Space 
Shuttle Columbia, making its first journey  into space in  two years,  on mission 
61-C,  the 24th flight of the U.S.  Space Transportation System. Robert Gibson 
would command the flight,  his second trip into space. Charles Bolden, on his 
first  spaceflight,  would  pilot;  mission  specialists would  be  Franklin Chang- 
Diaz, a physicist born in  Costa Rica and the first American of Hispanic origin 
to  fly  in  space,  and  Steven  Hawley and George  Nelson,  both making their 
second spaceflight;  and payload specialists would be Robert Cenker of  RCA 
and  U.S.  Rep.  B i l l  Nelson of  Florida,  chairman of  the  House subcommittee 
on space science and applications and the second congressional observer to 
fly  in  space. 
During the mission,  the crew would deploy RCA's  Satcom KU-2communi- 
cations satellite,  the second in  a series of three, w i th  its payload assist module 
D-2  (PAM  D-2)  upper stage.  The  crew  on mission  61-C  in  November de- 
ployed Satcom  KU-  l .

canisters mounted to a GAS  beam attached to the payload bay. 
Hitchhiker G-1,  a  more sophisticated version  of  the  GAS  concept,  con- 
sisted  of  a  baseplate  on  which  small  pzyloads  were  mounted  directly  or 
enclosed  in  canisters.  The carrier  for  the  first  time  provided small payloads 
w i th  access to  the orbiter's  1400-watt power supply and to ground communi- 
cations. 
Hitchhiker G-1  experiments would study experimental capillary pumped

ronment on coated mirrors (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). 
The  GAS  Bridge  was  a  beam  supporting  12  G.4S  canisters  that  were 
mounted across the orbiter’s  cargo bay.  The beam consolidated the canisters 
into a  single easy-to-load and unlead unit.  Experiments i n  the GAS canisters

kbruary 4:  NASA Administrator James Beggs,  during a press briefing,  noted 
that  the  fourth  Space  Shuttle  orbiter,  Atlantis,  would  jo in   the  fleet  in   the 
spring  to  fly  its  first  mission  in   1985 and  that,  despite  being well  into  the 
Space  Shuttle's  operational  phase,  NASA  would  continue  to  improve  per- 
formance,  procure space  parts,  and enhance reliability. 
In support of Presidential efforts to cut government spending,  NASA would 
slow  space  station definition and d w l o pm e n t  efforts,  cancel  the advanced 
composite structures  program  in  aeronautics,  and  not  initiate any  new  pro- 
jects  in  the space  science and  applications program.  (NASA  release  Feb.  41

kb rua ry   11:  After  16 Space  Shuttle flights,  NASA  believed  it had solved the 
spacecraft's  commode problems, as  reports of the last two missions indicated

STS 

the  improved  waste-disposal  system  performed  perfectly,  the  Washington 
Post  reported. 
A  $12  million-GE  design  had  transformed  the  commode  from  a  multi- 
pronged, motordrive blender, which had fogged the Space Shuttle's air with 
particles of noxious dust or  frozen liquid,  to a device using a blast of air from 
a fan  to  carry waste  into the toilet bowl;  by  pressing a lever,  the user  closed 
the commode top and opened a valve in  the side of the Space Shuttle, where 
the  waste  was  frozen  and  dried  by  the  cold and  vacuum  of  space.  A  tube 
collected urine and directed i t  to a holding tank  for  later overboard disposal.

February  2 2  Members  of  the  U.S.  House  Science  and  Technology  space 
science and applications subcommittee questioned Jesse Moore, NASA asso- 
ciate  administrator,  office  of  space  flight,  on  the  agency's  decision  not  to 
request funding  for  a  5th  orbiter  in   i t s   FY  86   budget,  Aerospace  D a i l y  re- 
ported.  Moore  restated  the  agency's  position  that  a  four-orbiter fleet  was 
adequate to meet traffic demand for  the next five years or so, pointing out a 
recent decline  i n  commercial and military traffic. 
NASA had requested $2.1  b i l l ion  for 14  FY 86  Space Shuttle flights;  Moore 
said NASA planned 17 missions in  FY 87,  19  in  FY 88,  and projected 24  per 
year  after that. 
Subcommittee  chairman  B i l l   Nelson  (D-Fla.),  who  had  indicated  strong 
support for  a fifth orbiter,  questioned Moore on the  likelihood of  increased 
launch  traffic demand,  potential schedule  impacts of  an  accident,  and  the 
possibility of stretching out orbiter fabrication over  a seven-to-eight-year per- 
iod. 
Moore  responded  that  NASA's  program  included  adequate  funding  for 
structural spares procurement and maintenance of a viable base for  initiating 
orbiter  production over the next several  years,  pointing out that any funds for 
orbiter  construction over a seven-toeight-year period would  be an add-on to 
NASA's  runout budget and could be in  competition w i th  other items. He had 
also remarked on increasingly pessimistic market projections, even consider- 
ing  upcoming yearly  launches of  18  to 20  communications satellites. 
Earlier,  NASA  Administrator  James  Beggs,  in   response  to  questions  on 
NASA's exploring possibilities of privatesector purchase of a 5th orbiter,  had 
said that no Space Shuttle privitization proposals submitted to NASA would 
result in  a cost savings  to  the government.  ( N D ,  Feb  22/85,  1 )  

March 6: The Space  Shuttle orbiter  Challenger made a three-mile,  s ix   hour 
journey  from the  launch pad back to a hanger as  a result of mission cancel- 
lation due to problems w i th  the  intended payload,  a tracking and data  relay 
satellite,  the  N Y  Times  reported.  NASA  would  replace  Challenger  on  the 
launch pad w i th  the orbiter  Discovery on  about March  15  and would  com- 
bine elements  of  the  scrubbed  mission w i th   some  from  Discovery's  flight

originally scheduled for  March 22.  Officials had selected Discovery for  the 
mission because they decided i t  could be modified  more easily and quickly 
than Challenger.  ( N U ,  Mar 6/85,  B10) 

Ap r i l   9: NASA  announced  that  the  Space  Shuttle  Carrier  Aircraft’s  (SCA) 
functional check flight w a s  successfully flown today following engine repairs 
made  in   accordance  w i th   specificatioas.  The  SCA  would  fly  the  Atlantis 
orbiter to Kennedy Space Center on April  12,  w i th  one refueling stop.  (NASA 
Daily Activities Report, Apr  11/85) 

Ap r i l   7 4  NASAls  newest  Space  Shuttle  orbiter,  Atlantis,  arrived about  5:OO 
p.m.  April  14  at  KSC  after a t m d a y  flight from California,  the Marsha l l  Star 
reported.  KSC  workers  r e m 4  the  Atlantis  from  the  747  Shuttle  Carrier 
Aircraft  (SCA)  and  towed  i t  to  the  processing hangar,  where  others  would 
reconfigure i t  for  its maiden  flight,  mission  51-1,  scheduled  for  September. 
The  SCA  made  a  brief  stop  at  Ellington Air  Force  Base,  Texas,  during the 
journey  to KSC.  (Marshall Star,  Apr  17/85,  2) 

Ap r i l  2 2  NASA  officials said damage sustained by  Discovery during mission 
51-D  [see Apr.  191 could endanger its next mission and the upcoming week’s 
flight of Challenger,  the  Washington  Times reported. “We  may  have  to do a 
fair  amount of tile work  on  this one:’  Space  Shuttle chief Jesse Moore said. 
“Fifty  tiles  has  been our  standard up until this  last one.” 
Howewr, NASA engineers were more concerned about a hole on a control 
flap,  called an elevon, on the ship’s  left wing.  Such damage had not occurred 
previously.  The  chief  Space  Shuttle mechanic  said  the  hole  “most  likely” 
developed after  a heat-shield tile,  jarred  loose during Discovery’s  liftoff,  al- 
lowed temperatures of more than  1,200°  F to penetrate the wing flap during 
reentry. 
Also,  NASA  said  i t  would  not a p p r m  the Challenger mission or  D i s c w  
ery’s  next  flight,  scheduled  for  June 12,  until  technicians  completed  their 
examination  of  damage and determined why  the  brakes  locked.  ( W  Times, 
Apr  22/85,  2A) 

May  2 4  In  reporting on  NASA’s  concerns m r  the effects of vibrations and 
noise  on  the  Space  Shuttle’s  passengers  and  cargo,  the  Washington  Post 
quoted astronaut Air Force Col.  Frederick Gregory saying that after his return 
from a Space Shuttle mission that  “Nothing prepared me for the sensation of 
those main engines starting and those solids lighting up underneath us. That 
son-of-a-gun really rattles and  rolis when  it takes  off.” 
Although NASA  maintained that  the Space  Shuttle was  no  rougher  a  ride 
than the Titan  launch vehicle,  doubts were  creeping into the minds of some 
people planning the Space Shuttle program,  the Post said. 

360 

STS 

Troubles arose on Gregory’s flight when astronauts discovered the latch that 
released  the  airlock  holding  the  Spacelab  wide-field  camera  was  badly 
bent-possibly  because of  the  rough  ride.  In another Spacelab  incident,  a l l  
pressure was  lost after  four  days  in  the  laser spectrometer at  the heart of  an 
experiment to  measure  molecules  of  synthetic chemicals  that  could  be at- 
tacking the earth’s  protective ozone  layer. 
Space  Shuttle  managers  were  quick  to  defend  the  spacecraft,  the  Post 
reported. Columbia,  Challenger, and  Discovery had  flown  17 times  in  four 
years without a serious incident. At  least two of the three satellites that failed 
i n  space did SO because of onboard  rocket engine difficulties,  not because 
the Space  Shuttle was  too  rough. 
Johnson Space Center Director Gerald Griffin said in  an  interview w i th  the 
Post that  “occasional”  mistakes had  led to mishaps,  but he  insisted that  “we 
are not repeating our mistakes.”  He used as an example the Syncom (Leasat- 
3) satellite deployed  in  April  w i th  no  power to  raise  i t  to a  higher orbit.  He 
said  that  NASA would not have  deployed the  Syncom without any  power  if 
NASA  had  insisted that  Hughes Communications Corp  install a device  that 
flashed  a  warning  to  the  Space  Shuttle’s  cockpit  that  the  satellite  had  no 
power. 
“We’ve  always  insisted  our  customers  adhere  to  our  safety  standards  to 
protect the crew and  the  shuttle,  but we’ve  never  insisted they  do anything 
else,”  Griffin said.  “We  don’t  want to be ‘Big Brother‘ but we’re  beginning to 
think that some of the [the customers] design features are not good for us.  I’d 
like to see more data for  the crew  in the cockpit.”  ( W  Post, May 24/85,  A l )  

May 30: NASA would probably use the desert runways of Edwards Air  Force 
Base for  landings of the remaining seven Space shuttle missions in  1985 due 
to brake damage caused by the grooved tarmac at Kennedy Space Center,  the 
Washington Post  reported. 
“Let’s  face  it,  these  brakes are  right a t  the edge  in  a vehicle that  lands as 
heavy  and  as  fast  as  the  shuttle does,”  said  astronaut  Daniel Brandenstein, 
commander of the next Space  Shuttle mission. “My  guess  i s  we’ll  be landing 
for awhile out in  the Mojave, where there’s  no end to the runways and there’s 
almost nothing on either side of the  runways to worry  about either.” 
Also,  studies  suggested  that  the  Space  Shuttle  nose  gear  might  require 
rebuilding to  provide better steering during  landing in  a  crosswind,  a  situa- 
t ion  more  likely  to  occur  at  KSC  than  a t   Edwards.  Cost  of  such  rebuilding 
could run as  high as  $3 m i l l ion  for each orbiter.  (W  Post, May  30/85, A191 

l u n e   7 4  NASA  expected the Space  Shuttle’s  nose wheel  steering capability, 
previously  used only on  an  experimental  basis,  would  achieve  operational 
status  by  the fall,  the Space News Roundup reported. 

361 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

NASA  had attributed brake damage to the orbiter Discovery following the 
STS  51-D  mission in  part to crosswinds at  KSC,  which  required the orbiter's 
commander  to  use  the  main  gear  braking  system  for  differential steering. 
Nose  wheel  steering  would  allow  Space  Shuttle  commanders  to  use  the 
brake system  for  stopping orbiters  rather than  for  braking and steering com- 
bined. 
A nose wheel steering capability was  in  the Space Shuttle design, but used 
only on an experimental basis.  NASA  had spent  the  las t  year  upgrading the 
system  to operational status.  In addition,  NASA  instrumented the Challenger 
to  provide better landing condition data and planned to add  instrumentation 
to the  landing gear  system  of the Discovery. 
In  the  17  Space  Shuttle missions  to  date,  NASA  had  used  68  individual 
brake systems w i th  2 7  receiving no damage,  2 7  receiving slight damage,  and 
14 receiving significant damage i n  which either one or more stators or  rotors 
overheated or suffered other problems. 
Un t i l   the  nose wheel  steering capability  became operational,  NASA  in- 
tended  to choose on a flight by  flight basis between Kennedy Space Center 
and Edwards Air  Force Base as  the primary end of mission  landing site.  (ISC 
Space News Roundup, June 14/85,  2 )  

l u l y   79:  After  spending  18  months  at  the  factory  in   Palmsdale,  California, 
Columbia,  the  flagship  of  the  Space  Shuttle  fleet,  returned  for  operational 
duty to  Kennedy Space Center (KSC),  the JSC Roundup reported. Columbia 
had  undergone  hundreds  of  modifications  to  reconfigure  the  ship  from  a 
developmental flight vehicle to a fully operational orbiter. 
Columbia flew the first five Space Shuttle missions, and NASA modified the 
spacecraft at KSC for the October  1983 STS-9  Spacelab 1 flight.  Following i t s  
return to KSC  and  removal of the Spacelab  1 payload,  NASA  in  late January 
1984 ferried Columbia to California atop the  747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. 
Rockwell  International  performed  five major modifications  to  the  orbiter 
during i t s  stay  at the orbiter production plant. Structural modifications to the 
wings  and  midfuselage  included  strengthening of  lower w ing  surfaces  and 
installation of  heavier straps  across  the orbiter's belly. 
Rockwell added a heads-up display to the forward flight deck  to allow the 
Space  Shuttle commander  and  pilot to view  critical  flight  information on a 
see-through panel while they  looked through the forward cockpit windows. 
Production  workers  removed  the  commander  and  pilot  ejection  seats, 
which were  installed on Columbia for the  initial development Space Shuttle 
flights,  and  replaced  them  with  standard  seats.  Overhead  blowout  panels 
were also removed. 
Rockwell modified  two  orbital  maneuvering system  pods  to  make  them 
compatible  with  the  other  orbiters  in   the  fleet  and  replaced  the  thermal 
protection  tiles on  the  pods w i th   the  advanced  reusable surface  insulation 

362 

STS 

blankets.  Production personnel also  installed supplemental  instrumentation 
to gather developmental engineering data. 
In  addition, workers  removed and replaced approximately  5000 high-tem- 
perature tiles from the orbiter's  underside, because engineering analysis indi- 
cated several areas where greater heat protection was  needed. About  half of 
the  w ing   leading  edge  panel  assemblies  was  removed  and  modified  to 
strengthen  the  supporting structure of  the  reinforced carbon-carbon panels, 
an infrared imaging device was  installed on the vertical stabilizer to provide a 
temperature profile of the upper w ing  surfaces during reentry, and instrumen- 
tation was  added to the nose cap to provide improved entry air data. 
During the trip from California to KSC  atop the  747 shuttle transport,  rain 
damaged more  than  1,000  of  i t s  head  shield  tiles,  the  Washington Post re- 
ported.  NASA  said  that  between 200 and  300 of  the  tiles  required  replace- 
ment.  Damaged areas were around the windows  and on the  forward  facing 
tiles.  According to  NASA  policy,  Space  Shuttle transports were  forbidden  to 
fly through visible rain. However,  the shower did not appear on ground radar 
or on  the 747's  onboard radar system. 
NASA had scheduled Columbia to fly next in  December on mission 61-C.

l u l y  2 5  At the third  i n  a series of hearings on assured access to  space NASA 
and  Defense Department officials said  today  before the House Science and 
Technology space science and applications and Armed Services research and 
development subcommittees that available data d id  not support the need for 
a  fifth  Space  Shuttle orbiter  in   the  early  1990s.  But  the  officials acknowl- 
edged  that  there  could  be  a  period  around  1992  and  beyond  in   which 
unforeseen  launch  demands  would  strain  capability,  Aerospace  Daily  re- 
ported. 
Rep.  B i l l  Nelson (D-Fla.)  pointed  out that earlier testimony had revealed a 
launch demand for  26  to 3 3  Space Shuttle equivalent flights per year  in  the 
post-1992  timeframe,  and  Jesse Moore,  NASA  associate  administrator  for 
spaceflight,  acknowledged that  a flight  capability  of  3 0  per  year  would  re- 
quire a fifth orbiter.  He  said that NASA projected the annual  launch capabil- 
ity  of  a  four-orbiter  fleet  in  the  1990s  timeframe  to  be  24  flights,  20  from 
Kennedy Space  Center  and  four  from  Vandenberg AFB,  w i th   the  ability  to 
surge temporarily  to 28 flights per year. 
When  asked  to   factor  i n   potential  extended  downtime  of  one  orbiter, 
Moore replied that  NASA had not made a projection of  lost flights because i t  
would  be  directly  related  to  the  length  of  the  downtime  and  when  it oc- 
curred.  He  added  that  NASA  could  probably  fly  20  to   24  flights with  the 
three remaining orbiters  i f  one were out of service for periods up to one year; 
a sustained launch capacity for  three orbiters would  be in  the range of  15  to 
20 flights  per year,  he said. 

363 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Edward Aldridge,  undersecretary of  the Air  Force,  said  that,  although the 
Department of Defense (DOD) was committed to at least eight Space Shuttle 
missions  per  year,  i t s   current  known  requirements through  the  mid-1990s 
averaged  10 launches per year.  Including the o n e t e f i v e  Space Shuttle-equiv- 
alent  launches  per  year  projected  through  1995  for  the  Strategic  Defense 
Initiative (SDI) research,  he said the total DOD requirement became roughly 
11  to  15 Space Shuttle-equivalent launches per year. Those numbers excluded 
any  mission  supporting  potential  deployment  of  SDI-related  systems,  he 
added. 
At the same hearing, Gen. Robert Herres,  commander of the North Ameri- 
can Air Defense Command (NORAD), said he thought the “time  had passed” 
during which  the  U.S.  might  have  built a fifth  orbiter.  He pointed  out  that 
resources  needed  for  it  might  better  be  devoted  to  new  technology  and 
options,  “which  afford  us  more flexibility  and versatility.” 
Offering an  opposing  view,  Hans Mark,  chancellor  of  the  University of 
Texas  System and former  NASA deputy administrator,  said that the argument 
for a fifth orbiter could not be based either on currently projected flight rates 
or on backup requirements. He  said only the proposed space station and SDI 
requirements  could  increase  space  operations  to  the  point  where  a  fifth 
orbiter  was  necessary.  (ND ,  July 26/85,  137) 

September  72 :   NASA announced that Rockwell Internatl. Corp.  made signifi- 
cant additions to  the Space Shuttle orbiter Columbia to  accommodate three 
research experiments that would measure orbite:  aerodynamic and thermo- 
dynamic  characteristics  as  it  reentered  earth’s  atmosphere.  Researchers 
would  use  the flight  data  to develop  future  generation space  transportation 
systems. 
The most obvious change was a cylindrical housing that replaced the fintip 
atop the vertical tail. The new experiment pod,  containing equipment for the 
shuttle infrared leeside temperature sensing (SILTS) experiment, was approxi- 
mately 20  in.  in  diameter and was  capped at the  leading edge by a spherical 
dome.  SILTS  would  obtain  high-resolution  infrared  images  of  the  upper 
(leeside) surfaces of Columbia’s  port w ing  and fuselage  as  the orbiter  reen- 
tered the atmosphere,  providing detailed temperature maps at  the surface of 
the  leeside thermal  protection materials and  indicating  the amount of aero- 
dynamic heating of surfaces  in  flight. Tape  recorders would store experiment 
data. 
Infrared cameras  mounted  inside  the  dome  would  view  Columbia’s  left 
w ing  and  fuselage  through two windows  protected during launch from de- 
bris  by  plugs  that  filled  the  window  cavities  and  that  fell  away  when  the 
experiment  began  about  400,000  feet  above  earth  at  reentry.  Injection  of 
gaseous nitrogen into the cavities would cool the cameras during that period. 
For  the  shuttle entry air data  system  (SEADS) experiment,  a new  nosecap 
had 14 penetration assemblies distributed about  its surface,  each containing 

364 

STS 

a small hole through which  local surface air  pressure was  measured from an 
altitude of  about  56 miles  through  landing. This  would allow  precise post- 
flight  determination  of  the  orbiter‘s  attitude  relative  to  the  oncoming air- 
stream  and  the  density  of  the  atmosphere through which  the  vehicle  was 
flying. 
The  shuttle upper atmosphere mass  spectrometer (SUMS) would comple- 
ment the SEADS experiment by providing atmospheric density information at 
altitudes  above  50   miles.  SUMS  would  sample  air  at  Columbia’s  surface 
through a small hole,  located just aft of the nosecap,  to measure the number 
of molecules of various  gas  species  in  order  to  determine the atmospheric 
density that,  w i th  vehicle motion information, would allow determination of 
orbiter  aerodynamic  characteristics a t  altitudes  where  the  atmosphere was 
extremely thin.  NASA originally developed the SUMS mass  spectrometer for 
the Viking spacecraft that landed in 1976 on Mars and modified i t  to operate 
in  the orbiter’s  reentry flight environment. 
NASA‘  Langley Research  Center developed  the experiments as  part of  the 
orbiter  experiments program  managed  by  NASA’s  office of  aeronautics and 
space technology. (NASA Release 85-127) 

September 30:  NASA announced that,  since adverse weather conditions such 
as  rain,  mist,  or  ice could damage Space Shuttle tiles,  its Ames-Dryden  Flight 
Research  Facility,  using  an  F-104  aircraft  as  a  testbed,  would  test  Space 
Shuttle thermal  protection system  tiles  for  moisture  impact damage  and  to 
verify  techniques  to  record and  measure  atmospheric  moisture.  NASA  r e  
searchers  would  then  correlate this  information w i th  existing Space  Shuttle 
launch criteria and determine the need for further  tests. 
Researchers would install actual Space Shuttle tiles on the  leading edge of 
a  flight  test  fixture  mounted below  the  F-104’s  fuselage.  Some  tiles  were 
unused;  others had flown  in  space on the orbiter Columbia. 
During initial flights in  the 1 6 4 ~ 1 8  flight test program,  the F-104  would fly 
at  subsonic  s p e e d s   behind a  KC-135  tanker  aircraft,  which  would  emit  a 
water  spray  to create artificial rain. Tanker  personnel could control the  flow 
rate,  nozzle pressures,  and size of the artificial  raindrops. 
Pilots would fly additional flights at subsonic speeds  near Vandenberg Air 
Force  Base,  a future Space  Shuttle  launch site,  to  observe and  measure  the 
effects of mist and  low  stratus clouds.  Pilots later would fly  at  transonic and 
supersonic speeds  flights at  high altitude through  ice particles in  clouds. 
A  particle-measurement probe  located on  the  F-104’s  wing  pylon would 
record moisture particle size,  while high-frequency load sensors would mea- 
sure  impact forces. A  noseboom on the flight test fixture would record veloc- 
ity,  and  test  fixture  pressure orifices  would  measure  pressure  distribution. 
Video cameras,  one pylon-mounted and one mounted on the  F-104’s  lower 
fuselage looking back at the flight test fixture, would also record data.  (NASA

December  1 3  Langley  Research  Center  announced  that  the  Space  Shuttle 
Columbia would carry three experiments on mission 61-C  developed at the 
center to measure the spacecraft’s  aerodynamic and thermodynamic charac- 
teristics. 
Columbia,  the first  Space Shuttle orbiter to go  into space,  was  making i t s  
first  flight  in  two years  after  it was  pulled  from  flight  service  in  December 
1983  for  extensive  overhaul,  including modification  to  accommodate  the 
LaRC  experiments,  which were  the  Shuttle  Entry Air  Data System  (SEADS), 
Shuttle Infrared Leeside Temperature Sensing (SILTS) experiment,  and Shuttle 
Upper Atmosphere Mass Spectrometer (SUMS). 
SEADS would measure the distribution of air pressure around the orbiter‘s 
nosecap during entry  to  provide precise determination  of  the  orbiter‘s  atti- 
tude  relative to  the  oncoming  airstream and  the density  of  the  atmosphere 
through which it had flown.  Lack of this air data had hindered engineers from 
determining aerodynamic flight characteristics of the orbiters. 
The SUMS experiment complemented the SEADS experiment by gathering 
atmospheric density information at altitudes above 90 km (56 statute miles). 
SUMS  would  sample  the  gas  at  Columbia’s  surface  through  a  small  hole 
located just aft of the nosecap and forward of the nosewheel,  with  i t s   instru- 
ment  identifying and  measuring the  quantities  of  the  various  gas  species 
present.  Data analysis after the mission would  allow determination of a tm e  
spheric density. 
The SILTS  experiment would obtain high-spatial-resolution infrared images 
of the upper  (leeside) surfaces of the orbiter‘s  port w ing  and fuselage during 
entry through the atmosphere. These  infrared images would provide detailed 
“maps”  of  the  surface temperatures of  leeside thermal  protection materials, 
indicating the  amount  of  aerodynamic  heating on  the  leeside  surfaces  in  
flight.  (LaRC Release 85-99) 

December  2 2  NASA  today  rolled the  Space  Shuttle orbiter  Challenger  to 
launch complex  398 two miles from where  NASA  had  installed the orbiter 
Columbia  for mission 61-C,  the first time a pair of orbiters had been on the 
launch pads at the same time, the Washington Times reported. Columbia was 
on  Pad  39A  until repair of a faulty  power unit that aborted a launch attempt

Solid-fuel  Rocket Boosters 

January 30: NASA  and  United Technologies’s  United Space  Boosters Inc.’s 
Booster Production Co.  officials would break ground January 30 for Marshall 

366 

STS 

Space  Flight Center‘s  (MSFC)  solid-fuel  rocket  booster  (SRB)  assembly  and 
refurbishment facility  at  KSC,  the  Marshall  Star reported. The company  had 
designed and would bu i ld  the 238,00@sq.-ft.  facility,  scheduled for comple- 
tion  in   1986,  that would  employ about  700  people to  perform most of  the 
Space  Shuttle’s  SRB  refurbishment previously done by  the  company at  vari- 
ous  locations at the center and adjacent Cape Canaveral Air  Force Station. 
Refurbishment,  performed  under  an  MSFC  contract,  would  include  re- 
placement of  insulation on booster components,  addition  of  electronic  and 
guidance systems,  and  reinstallation of  parachutes and ordnance. The  refur- 
bished  booster  components,  including  forward  and  aft  skirts  and  frustum, 
would then undergo computerized checkout in  the facility before delivery to 
NASA for booster stacking. 
The  new  facility  would  process  up  to  24  flight  sets  of  solid-fuel  rocket 
boosters yearly  and would  offer  maximum efficiency w i th  extensive use  of 
robotics  and  computercontrolled  production  techniques  developed  in 
MSFC’s  Productivity Enhancement Center.  (Marshall Star, Jan 30/85,  1 ) 

March 20: NASA  had completed a series of  tests  to  validate  parachute sys- 
tems  to   be  used w i th   advanced  lightweight,  solid-fuel rocket  boosters  that 
would  replace the boosters then  in  use on the Space Shuttle,  Ames Research 
Center  (ARC)  announced.  The  new  boosters would  be  first  used  during a 
Space Shuttle launch from Vandenberg AFB  no earlier than January 29,1986. 
For  the  tests,  researchers  used  a  vehicle  a  third  the  size  of  a  solid-fuel 
booster with one main parachute and,  to simulate a splashdown, drop tested 
i t  from  the  Ames-Dryden  Flight Research  Facility’s  (DFRC)  8-52 over  the 
China Lake Naval Weapons Center at Ridgecrest. Most drops were made at an 
altitude of about 40,000  feet w i th  an  airspeed of about 230 knots. ARC  and 
DFRC  conducted  the  drop  tests  in  cooperation  with  Marshall Space  Flight 
Center,  which was  responsible for the parachute system.  (ARC Release 85-1) 

May   9:  Marshall  Space  Flight Center’s  (MSFC)  prime  contractor  for  Space 
Shuttle solid-fuel rocket booster motors, Morton Thiokol’s Wasatch  Division, 
successfully  static  fired today  a new  lightweight version  of  that  motor  at  i t s  
facility  in  northern Utah,  the Marshall  Star reported. 
The firing was  the second and final test of the development version of that 
motor, which contained major sections made from graphite epoxy materials 
manufactured by Thiokol’s  subcontractor, Hercules,  Inc. Thiokol would  per- 
form  a final  qualification static test of the  flight version of  the new filament- 
wound motor  in  September. 
NASA  had scheduled the first  use of  the filament-wound motor  segments 
for  early  1986 during  the  first  Space  Shuttle  launch  from  Vandenberg  Air 
Force Base,  California. 

367 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Lawrence Mullay, manager of MSFC’s  solid-fuel rocket booster project, said 
each of the filament-wound boosters would weigh about 28,000  Ib.  less than 
the  current  steel  boosters,  making  possible  an  increase  in  Space  Shuttle 
payload carrying capacity of about 4,600  Ibs.  (Marshall Star, May  15/85,  2) 

lune  3: A  fire of  unknown cause  today  destroyed one of the  four  buildings 
used to mix rocket solid fuels for the Space Shuttle at Morton Thiokol’s rocket 
motor  assembly  plant outside  Brigham City,  Utah,  the  Washington Post re- 
ported.  No   one  was   injured  in   the  fire  that  leveled  a  400-sq.-ft.  building 
operated  largely by robots at a  remote part of the Thiokol  plant. 
Because three of  the four  fuel mixing plants at Thiokol were  needed at  a l l  
times to maintain solid-fuel rocket motor production schedules, NASA said  i t  
was concerned enough to send an accident review board team from Marshall 
Space  flight Center to  investigate. ( W  Post,  June 5/85,  A5) 
lune   6 :  NASA  was  still  evaluating data  submitted  by four  companies  in   re- 
sponse  to  i t s   request for  responses  on  the  possibility of opening a  second 
source  for  Space  Shuttle  solid-fuel  rocket  motors  (SRM),  Aerospace  Daily 
reported.  Those  responding  were  Hercules,  Aerojet  Strategic  Propulsion, 
United  Technologies’  Chemical  Systems  Division,  and  Atlantic  Research 
Corp.  NASA  also  had  a  proposal  from  Morton  Thiokol,  the  current  sole- 
source  producer,  and  would  not  make  a  final  decision  until  later  in   the 
month. 
In April Jesse Moore,  NASA associate administrator for spaceflight, told the 
House appropriations HUD  and independent agencies subcommittee that he 
expected  to  “haw  a review of  the assessment  sometime  in  the early  part of 
May” and that in  the interim NASA would proceed w i th  the next buy of SRMs 
from  Morton Thiokol.  Agency  officials  expected  i t  would  take  about  four 
years  to qualify a second source and “get  them  up to speed.” 
NASA  Administrator  James  Beggs  would  make  the  final  decision  on 
whether to open a second source for  SRMs.  A  NASA  official said he thought 
there was  “a  good possibility” that Beggs would haw the needed information 
to make “a  decision  by the end of this month.”  ( N O ,  June 6/85,  1 )  

December 26: NASA  today  released a  statement on  the proposed action to 
develop  a  second  source  for  the  Space  Shuttle’s  solid-fuel  rocket  motor 
(SRM).  Since Nowmber  1984,  NASA  had assessed  the desirability of  a sec- 
ond  source,  and  four  firms-Aerojet  Strategic  Propulsion Co.,  Atlantic  Re- 
search  Corp.,  Hercules,  Inc.,  and  Chemical  Systems  Div.  of  United 
Technologies  Corp.-had  expressed  interest  in   becoming  the  SRM   second 
source.  As  a  result,  NASA  believed  the  development  of  an  SRM  second 
source would serve  the national  interest. 
The statement read  in  part: “.  . . Because of the continued strong interest 
of  the four  contractors and our  belief that a second  source would be  in  the 

368 

STS 

national interest, i t  i s  our  intent to provide the contractors the opportunity to 
respond through a formal  request for  proposal (RFP). 
“Industry  must,  however,  be  w i l l ing   to  respond w i th   the  full  knowledge 
that  NASA  w i l l   provide  no  firm  guarantee of  recovery of  their  qualification 
costs.  If industry i s  so willing,  and where competition  remains available with 
the  incumbent excluded,  NASA  intends to proceed w i th  establishing a sec- 
ond  source. 
“Should  the  winner  of  a  second  source  competition  for  SRMs  become 
qualified to produce f l igh tqua l i ty  motors in  time to support our next produc- 
tion buy,  NASA would plan to buy contingent on overall cost considerations, 
20  flight  sets  of  motors at  the  rate of  not  less  than  four  flight sets  a  year.  In 
addition,  NASA would compete the balance of the buy and subsequent buys 
to  determine the split  in  production between the  incumbent and  the quali- 
fied  second  source.  A  decision  to  dual  source  any  quantity  beyond  the 
planned minimum buy of 2 0  flight sets  would  be based on  the  cost of  the 
dual  source  in  comparison  to  the  cost  of  contracting the  balance with  the 
incumbent (Morton Thiokol,  Inc.) only. 
NASA  intends to notify  the  four  interested firms  by 
“Based  on the ab-, 
letter in  early January 1986 of our willingness to proceed w i th  an RFP and the 
specific conditions that would apply.  Their  comments and views  would  be 
requested. A  p o s i t i v e  response would provide the basis for NASA  to issue an 
RFP.  Should  industry  not  support  the  RFP  under  these  conditions,  NASA 
vlould cancel any  initiative of establishing a dual source for the SRM.”  (NASA 
Release 85-178) 

Student Involvement Program 

March  78:  Some  high school  student semifinalists  in  the Space  Shuttle Stu- 
dent  Involvement Program,  sponsored by  NASA  and  the  National Science 
Teachers Association, would meet at Lewis Research Center (LeRC) March 25 
and  26   to  present  before  a  panel  of  LeRC  scientists  and  engineers  their 
proposals for  candidate experiments to fly aboard future Space  Shuttle mis- 
sions,  the  center  announced.  LeRC  personnel  would  evaluate  and  suggest 
improvements to the experiments. The  program was  a nationwide competi- 
tion to stimulate the study of science and technology by engaging students in  
projects to develop actual  payload experiments for  upcoming Space  Shuttle 
flights. 
The  3 7   students  from  Ohio,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  Iowa,  Missouri,  and 
Wisconsin would hear a presentation by NASA astronaut Robert Springer (Lt. 
Col.  USMC),  slated to fly aboard Space  Shuttle mission 51-H scheduled for 
launch in  late 1985, and a discussion by Brian Vlcek,  a previous year‘s  finalist 
from  Parma,  Ohio,  on  his  winning  experiment  entitled  “inducing  a  geo- 
tropic-type  reaction  in   radish  roots  w i th   chemical  stimuli.”  The  meeting 

369 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

would close w i th  a tour of LeRC where the students would  see  such facilities 
as the 500-foot deep,  zero-gravity facility and a propulsion systems  laboratory 
where  researchers  tested full-scale aircraft engines under actual flight condi- 
tions. 
Initially  students  from  10  geographical  regions  around  the  country  had 
proposed over  2,000  biology,  chemistry,  and  astronomy experiments.  Inter- 
disciplinary  teams  of  teachers,  scientists,  and  engineers  had  evaluated  the 
proposals to select each  region's  semifinalists.  As  of the Space Shuttle 51-C 
mission in  January 1985,  NASA had flown  10 student experiments in  space. 
(LeRC Release 85-17) 

A p r i l   5: NASA  announced  that  through  a  cooperative  effort with  Satellite 
Communications for Learning Worldwide (SCOLA),  i t  would televise  live via 
satellite to  hundreds of  high  schools,  colleges,  and  universities across  the 
U.S.  all  the  science  events  on  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery  following  i t s  
launch  no earlier than April  12  from  KSC.  Two  days  prior  to  launch,  NASA 
scientists and engineers would conduct a permission videoconference with 
the schools to acquaint students and teachers w i th  the planned mission and 
science experiments. Students from selected schools would ask  questions of 
the NASA briefers.  NASA's  educational affairs office was  providing Discovery 
mission and educational materials to the participating schools. 
SCOLA,  an  association  of  schools,  colleges,  and  universities  based  at 
Creighton  University,  Omaha,  Nebraska,  was  one  of  the  largest  voluntary 
associations of  institutional satellite  antenna owners  in  the  U.S.  (NASA  Re- 
lease 85-51) 

May  7: NASA  and  the  National  Science  Teachers  Association  announced 
continuation  for  the  sixth  year  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Student  Involvement 
Program,  which  provided  an  opportunity  for  secondary  school  students 
(grades  9-12)  to  write  proposals for  space  science experiments that  would 
develop their awareness  of space  and stimulate  interest  in  science and tech- 
nology. 
During the next year's  competition,  the association would select up to five 
students from each of eight geographic  regions who,  along with their teach- 
ers,  would  receive allexpensepaid  trips  to a Space Shuttle symposium at a 
NASA center. Later, one semifinalist selected from each region would attend a 
national  Space  Shuttle symposium at  Kennedy Space Center,  during which 
the association would award scholarships to the three students submitting the 
most outstanding proposals. (NASA Release 85-70) 

May  30: NASA announced that interdisciplinary teams of teachers,  scientists, 
and  engineers  selected  seven  finalists  in   the  fifth  national  Space  Shuttle 

3 70 

STS 

Student  Involvement  Program  (SSIP),  a  joint  venture  of  NASA  and  the  Na- 
tional  Science Teachers  Association. Judges based selection  of  finalists’  en- 
tries upon individual scientific or engineering merit for possible flight aboard 
the Space Shuttle. 
The  national winners and their teacher-advisors would attend  in  August  a 
special  Space  Shuttle  conference  a t   Kennedy  Space  Center  and  view  the 
launch of  the  Discovery Space  Shuttle mission 51-L.  NASA  would  present 
the finalists and their teacher-advisors with orbiter models,  and their schools 
would receive orbiter models for  trophy case display. 
The sixth year of SSIP competition would open  in  September  1985. (NASA 
Release 85-79) 

During August:  NASA  announced  that  the  newest solid-fuel  rocket booster 
retrieval ship,  the  US. Air  Force’s  Independence, arrived at  Kennedy  Space 
Center  for  outfitting w i th   retrieval gear.  The  Air  Force specifically designed 
the ship for  retrieval of expended boosters after Space Shuttle launches from 
Vandenberg Air  Force Base. 
Independence would be the mother ship for west  coast booster  retrievals, 
towing one of the boosters and providing room for  the majority of the crew 
and  the  six  main  parachutes and  the  bottoms for  both  boosters.  The  ship’s 
first  booster  retrieval would be mission  51-F  set  for  launch  no  earlier than 
Ju ly  15.  The  Air  Force  would  lease  another  smaller  ship  to  tow  the  other 
booster and carry the  remainder of the 42-member  retrieval crew. 
Independence, a t  199 feet  long and w i th  a beam of 40 feet,  was  larger than 
i t s  sister retrieval ships,  the Liberty Star and the Freedom Star. Those two ships 
were  176  feet  long and  had  beams of  3 7  feet.  The  Independence has  both 
fore and aft water jet thrusters,  making it highly maneuverable. The other two 
ships had only stern thrusters. Halter Marine in  Moss Point,  Mississippi, bu i l t

SPACELAB 

February 25: The  European  Space  Agency  ( E M )   issued  a  review  of  some 
material  and  life  sciences  experiments  aboard  the  first  Spacelab  mission 
November 28 to  December 8, 1983. 
Of the 33 materials sciences experiments,  two were not performed due to 
hardware malfunctioning,  and several experiments did not obtain the full set 
of experimental  rundoperations. The advantage of the microgravity environ- 
ment for  materials processing and fluid  physics was  the practical absence of 
thermal  (gravitydriven) convention,  sedimentation,  and hydrostatic pressure. 
In the microgravity environment,  secondarydisturbing factors such as surface 
tension,  capillary forces,  and  intermolecular forces became dominant. 
Some  materials sciences  experiments  focused  on  protein crystallization, 
including growth  of  insoluble crystals  by  precipitation  reaction,  nucleation 
and growth experiments in  vapor crystal growth,  thermomigration (soret dif- 
fusion) of cobalt in  l iqu id  tin,  floating-zone growth of silicon,  investigation of 
free convection and capillary surfaces  in  low gravity,  and eutectic solidifica- 
tion and formation of fault  structures in  fibrous and  lamellar eutectics. 
The  Spacelab  mission  carried  nine  European  l i fe   sciences  experiments. 
One investigated functioning  in  zero gravity of the human vestibular system, 
an  acceleration-sensing system  in  the inner ear.  Others were a massdiscrimi- 
nation experiment aimed at comparing perception of mass  under micrograv- 
ity conditions and of weight on earth,  an experiment aimed at understanding 
fluid-regulation mechanisms  in  the  low-pressure system  of  the  human body, 
and observations of  the proliferation of  lymphocytes during weightlessness. 
(ESA  release Feb 25/85) 

A p r i l   77: NASA  announced  it  had  scheduled  the  Spacelab  3 mission,  a 
Europeandeveloped and NASA-operated space laboratory, for  launch on STS 
51-8 no earlier than April  29, 1985. Spacelab 3 was  a microgravity mission 
w i th   15  investigations  in   fiw  scientific  disciplines:  materials  science,  l i fe  
sciences,  fluid  mechanics, atmospheric science,  and  astronomy. Two  of  the 
investigations-one  in   materials  science,  mercury  iodide  crystal  growth 
[France],  and one in astronomy,  very wide field camera  [Francel-had 
flown 
aboard Spacelab  1.  Scientists in  the U.S.  sponsored  12 of the  investigations, 
and an  ionization measurements investigation was  from  India. 
Important  new  hardware  developments  in   materials  science,  fluid  dy- 
namics,  and  l i fe  sciences would  be  on  the  flight,  and  researchers  had  de- 
signed the experimental hardware for multiple flight use.  NASA  had selected 
two payload specialists w i th  expertise in  crystal growth and fluid  mechanics 
for  the flight. 
The  Spacelab 3 configuration consisted of  a  long tunnel,  a  long module, 
and  a mission  peculiar equipment  support  structure (MPESS).  The  module 

PRECEDING  PAGE  BLANK  NOT  FILMED 

373 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

and  tunnel  would  provide  a  pressurized  shirtsleeve  environment  within 
which the crew  could operate. The MPESS also supported experiments that 
d id   not  require a  habitable  crew  environment.  Common  payload  support 
equipment  used on  Spacelab  3  was  the  scientific  airlock  that  could extend 
from the module into space for experiments requiring exposure to the space 
environment and flight crew  hands-on activities. 
There were  three  experiments on  materials science:  the  fluid  experiment 
system  (FES),  the vapor crystal growth system  (VCGS), and the French materi- 
als science experiment. 
In fluid  mechanics,  the  crew  would  perform  fundamental experiments  in  
the  drop  dynamics  module  (DDM)  to  test  theoretical  predictions of  drop 
behavor  in  a  near-zero gravity  environment.  The  geophysical fluid  flow  cell 
(GFFC) experiment would study fluid motion in  a microgravity environment. 
The  s ix   investigations in  life sciences included  four  in  the Ames  Research 
Center‘s  (ARC)  life sciences payload system  to verify a new  facility for  hous- 
ing and studying animals  in  the space  environment,  observing the animals’ 
reactions  to  that  environment,  and  evaluating  operations  and  procedures 
relative to in-flight animal care;  the urine monitoring investigation to monitor 
crew  water  intake and  to  prepare urine samples  for  postflight analysis;  and 
the  autogenic  feedback  training experiment  to  test  a  technique  to  control 
space adaptation syndrome. 
The  four  investigations  in  atmospheric science  and  astronomy  were  the 
ionization states of solar and galactic cosmic ray heavy nuclei that would use 
a new  detector  system  to  determine  the  composition  and  intensity of  ions 
emitted toward the earth from the sun and other galactic sources;  the French 
astronomy  investigation to make an  ultraviolet survey  of the celestial sphere 
in  a study  of  large-scale phenomena  such  as  clouds within  our  galaxy;  the 
auroral observations experiment to observe and record the visual characteris- 
tics  of  pulsating  and  flickering  auroras;  and  atmospheric  trace  molecules 
spectroscopy to examine on a global scale the composition and variability of 
the upper atmosphere. 
In addition to the Spacelab 3  experiments,  NASA  had scheduled two Get- 
Away  Specials  for  the  flight-a  Northern  Utah  University satellite  (NUSAT) 
and  a  global  low-orbit  message  relay  satellite  (GLOMR). NASA  would  en- 
close each  in a canister mounted in  the orbiter payload bay for  deployment 
near  the  end  of  the  mission  following completion of  Spacelab  operations. 
(NASA MOR  E-977-51-8-02 
[prelaunch] April  17/85) 

April  77:  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  (MSFC)  announced  its  researchers 
completed at KSC a series of three intensive tests that verified the compatibil- 
ity of Spacelab  2  experiments in  space.  Known  collectively as  the  “mission 
sequence test,”  the tests  determined for the first time that actual experiment 
flight  hardware for  the mission operated  in  tandem w i th  the Spacelab flight 
systems.  MSFC’s  Spacelab 2  mission manager  Roy  Lester  said  they  learned 

374 

Spacelab 

they  “could  operate this complex system with high efficiency within accept- 
able Space1 ab  resource a I locat ions.’’ 
MSFC had responsibility for managing the first three Spacelab missions in  a 
series of  Spacelab flights that  extended over  several  years.  The  first  mission 
flew  in  1983;  the next would fly  later in  April.  “This  third and last test was  a 
simulated six-hour slice of the actual on-orbit timeline,”  Lester said.  “It simu- 
lated the commanding of experiments as  i f  they were being done both from 
the payload operations control center (at Johnson Space Center) and from the 
flight deck of the orbiter.” 
The  period chosen was  one that would  put maximum stress  on the  com- 
puter,  “a  worst-case scenario,”  Lester explained. “Without a situation like that, 
we wouldn’t  have gotten the confidence we have now that we’re  ready to go.” 
The  13  Spacelab  2  experiments,  covering  seven  scientific  disciplines, 
would  rest on three  pallets and a special support structure.  Unlike the other 
two Spacelab missions managed by MSFC,  there was no habitable laboratory. 
Spacelab  2  crew  would  operate  the  experiments from  the  aft  deck  of  the 
orbiter  interior.  (MSFC Release 85-19) 

During April:  NASA announced that Space Shuttle flight 51-B/Spacelab  3,  an 
ESAdeveloped Spacelab carrying 15 experiments [see Spacelab, Apr.  17, was 
scheduled for launch April 29 from KSC. The mission’s  main objective was to 
provide a high-quality microgravity environment for materials processing and 
f lu  id experiments. 
For  the second time  in  US. space  history,  crew  members would  perform 
scientific  investigations continuously.  Two  scientists who developed Space- 
lab 3 experiments, payload specialists Dr. Lodewijk van den Berg,  a materials 
scientist from EG&G Energy Management Corp.,  and Dr. Taylor Wang,  a fluid 
physicist from JPL, would conduct onboard  research during the mission. 
Mission  specialist  Dr.  Don  Lind,  a  high-energy  astrophysicist,  and  Drs. 
Norman Thagard and William Thornton (both medical doctors making their 
second Space Shuttle flight) would also do  scientific research. 
The  payload operations  control  center  (POCC) at  Johnson Space  Center 
would  manage all  Spacelab  3  operations.  Members  of  the  Marshall  Space 
Flight  Center  mission  management  team  and  the  investigator  teams  that 
developed Spacelab 3 experiments would monitor, direct, and control experi- 
ment operations from the ground control  center. The mission control  center 
i n  the same building as  POCC would control  the orbiter and basic Spacelab 
systems.  (NASA Release 85-60) 

May 7:  A C-5A  aircraft carrying the German Spacelab D-1,  the first payload 
in   the  history  of  U.S.  manned  spaceflight  to  be  controlled  from  another 
country,  landed  May  1  at  the  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC)  Space  Shuttle 
runway,  Spaceport News reported. The Federal German Aerospace Research 

375 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Establishment‘s  (DFVLR)  German  Space  Operations  Center  in  Oberpfaf- 
fenhofen near Munich would haw responsibility for the 80 Spacelab  D-1  (D  
for  Deutschland) experiments.  During the  welcoming  ceremony,  (KSC)  D i-  
rector  Dick  Smith  said,  “W  are  looking  forward  to  giving  your  payload 
‘tender  laving care’  and seeing  it launched aboard  the shuttle and getting i t  
safely  returned to you  after the mission.” 
Germany’s  Parliamentary State Secretary Albert Probst responded, “We  are 
pleased to take part in  this m n t  and consider the jo in t  ventures between the 
Federal Republic of Germany, Europe,  and the U.S.  in  manned space flight to 
be a good example of  internationai cooperation.” 
Spacelab  D-1,  scheduled  to  fly  on  the  sevenday  Space  Shuttle  orbiter 
Columbia mission  61-A  no  earlier  than  October  16,  consisted  of  a  long 
Spacelab module containing the space  s l e d  and  a unique support structure. 
Half  of  the  D-1  experiments were  from  Germany,  the  remainder from  the 
U.S.  and  European countries.  Investigations  included  the  vestibular  sled,  a 
device driven by an  electromotor and traction rope,  positioned in  the center 
aisle of the  Spacelab module,  in  which  astronauts would  serve  as  test  s u b  
jects to  collect  information on  human  reactions to  the  equilibrium sensing 
system;  the Biorack for botanical and medical/physiologicaI experiments; the 
navigation  experiment  (NAVEX)  to  test  systems  performance of  clock  syn- 
chronization and one-way distance measurement;  the materials experiment 
assembly  (MEA) that would  use  Marshall Space  Flight Center  furnaces  and 
alloy,  f lu id  physics,  and crystal growth  investigations. 
The  DFVLR,  the  result of  a merger of  three organizations and  employing 
about  3,500  people  in  five  research  centers,  would  also  participate  in   the 
European Retrieval Carrier (EURECA),  a free-flying apparatus of experiments, 
and  project  “Columbus,”  internationally  manned  space  station  modules. 
(Spaceport News, May  10/85,  5 )  

May 2 7 :   Marshall Space  Flight Center announced that experiment teams for 
the  Spacelab  3  mission  had  begun  analysis  of  the  250  b i l l ion   bits  of  data 
obtained during the mission,  and preliminary results were excellent. 
In  the  area  of  materials science,  two of  the  three  experiment  teams  had 
begun  to  examine  crystals  grown  during Spacelab  3.  In one  experiment,  a 
mercury iodide crystal the size of a sugar cube grew from a seed crystal in  the 
vapor  crystal  growth  system;  via  the  vapor  transport  technique,  the  crystal 
grew at a carefully controlled rate over  a  104-hour period. Researchers would 
remove  the  crystal  from  the  glass  ampoule  within  the  next  few  weeks  for 
analysis  to  determine  i t s  quality  and  properties as  an  X-ray  and  gamma-ray 
detector for  applications in  scientific research,  medicine,  and  industry. 
Two  fluid mechanics experiments ended successfully; the geophysical fluid 
flow  cell  experiment  completed  more  than  102  hours  of  experiments de- 
signed  to  provide  information for  the  first  time  on  convention  in  spherical 
rotating shells w i th  a  radial gravity field. Coinvestigator Dr.  Fred  Leslie said

of  the  experiment,  “The  films  of  one  of  the  Jovian (Jupiter) scenarios  indi- 
cated the formation of a ’Red   Spot‘  similar to that present on Jupiter. This data 
should be useful to  meteorologists and astrophysicists in  modelling the large 
scale circulations of  fluids under the  influence of  rotation,  gravity,  and con- 
vection.” 
Three atmospheric and astronomical observations were completed during 
the Spacelab 3  flight. The atmospheric trace molecules spectroscopy experi- 
ment operated for  50  hours providing  19  sequences  of more than  150  inde- 
pendent atmospheric spectrally  resolved measurements. Researchers would 
use  these  to  analyze  the  earth‘s  atmospheric  composition  chemically  and 
physically for the stratosphere and mesosphere between 10  and  150 km. The 
information  also  would  provide  extremely  detailed  measurements  of  the 
minor and trace components of the atmosphere, which was crucial to under- 
standing  the  evolution  of  earth‘s  climate,  and  would  aid  in  the  analysis  of 
pollution  caiises  and  effects.  The  experiment  also  provided  the  first  high- 
resolution  infrared  spectrum  of  the  sun,  which  indicated  some  surprising 
evidence about  its molecular constituents. 
Four of the s i x   life sciences experiments completed successfully were part 
of  the  Ames  Research  Center’s  life  sciences  payload.  The  research  animal 
holding facilities proved a suitable animal  habitat  in  which  the two squirrel 
monkeys and 24  rats adjusted to  spaceflight and demonstrated their suitabil- 
ity  for  research  in   orbit.  One  primate  apparently  developed  symptoms  of 
space adaptation syndrome but recovered in  a manner analogous to  human 
experience. 
“In  addition  to the successful results from each of these experiments,”  said 
Dr.  George  Fichtl,  Spacelab  3  mission  scientist  at  Marshall  Space  Flight 
Center,  “the  overall success of the mission has proven the  importance of the 
Spacelab concept.  During this mission,  we  have  proven that  a microgravity 
environment  i s   an  important  environment  for  the  growth  of  crystals,  the 
study  of  fluid  mechanics,  and  measurement of  the  effect man  i s  having on 
this environment. We  have also proven the  need  for  man’s  presence in  per- 
forming these tasks.”  (MSFC Release 85-28) 

May   24: Spacelab 2  mission  manager  Roy  Lester  of  Marshall Space  Flight 
Center’s  (MSFC) Spacelab Payload Project Office said today that the Spacelab 
2  payload was  declared  “ready  for  installation” into the orbiter Challenger, 
the Marshall Star reported. Spacelab 2 would  be the second of two Spacelab 
missions  designed  to  demonstrate  the  performance  of  hardware  received 
from  the European Space Agency (EM). 
The Spacelab 1  mission verified the majority of Spacelab systems including 
the  habitable module,  tunnel,  scientific airlock,  and pallets.  For  the  second 
verification mission,  Spacelab would not use a  habitable module but only a 
pallet configuration. The crew would operate experiments from Challenger‘s 
aft flight deck.

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

Spacelab 2 consisted of a pressurized igloo approximately the size of a five- 
gallon  o i l   drum  and  three  pallets,  two  of  which  joined  to  form  the  train 
needed  to  support  several  experiments.  Also  new  on  the  mission was  the 
instrument  pointing  system  for  pointing  four  of  the  onboard  solar  experi- 
ments.  Spacelab would carry  13  experiments in  7 scientific disciplines.  Pri- 
mary  objective  of  the  mission was  to  demonstrate  the  performance of  the 
igloo,  the two-pallet train,  and the  instrument pointing system. 
john Thomas,  manager of the MSFC Spacelab  Program Office,  said NASA 
had  removed  Spacelab  3  hardware  from  Challenger’s  cargo  bay  and  was 
reconfiguring the bay for Spacelab 2.  “We  expect to begin installation of the 
Spacelab 2  payload on June 3,” he noted. 
The last major test for the  hardware before July 12 scheduled launch would 
be  an  e n d - tw n d  test  planned  for  June 10,  in  which  NASA  would  test  all 
systems connecting Challenger, Spacelab 2,  and the MSFC-operated payload 
operations control  center  (POCC) at Johnson Space Center.  Thomas said the 
other primary effort was  to complete training of the payload team.  (Marsha l l  
Star,  May 29/85,  1) 

Augus t6  When the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission 51-F  landed today, 
i t  successfully concluded the third mission of the Europeandeveloped space 
laboratory,  Spacelab 2,  which NASA  used  for  the  first  time  in  its pallet-only 
configuration,  NASA  reported.  A l l   Spacelab  subsystems  but  one  provided 
excellent data,  and  NASA  verified for  the  first  time  two  new  Spacelab sys- 
tems,  the  ”Igloo” and the  instrument pointing system. 
NASA would fly many of the Spacelab 2  instruments on future missions, so 
the  51-F  mission  provided opportunities  not only  for  scientific data collec- 
tion  but also for engineering checkouts of the  new equipment. Since  instru- 
ments  are  brought  home,  engineers could  evaluate and  refurbish  them  to 
improve their performance or modify them to meet different scientific objec- 
tives  in  response to  results from prior flights. 
Through  Spacelab  2‘s  four  ultraviolet  and  visible  light  instruments,  re- 
searchers  observed a sun  that,  although  i t  was  in  a fairly  quiet  phase  of  its 
activity  cycle,  displayed sunspots,  filaments,  granules,  spicules,  and  promi- 
nences.  These  solar  features  changed  over  periods  as  brief  as  five  to  ten 
minutes and from orbit to orbit,  day  to day. 
The solar  ultraviolet universal polarimeter (SOUP) started  its program  late 
in  the  mission  after  an  unexplained shutdown  and  startup.  Thereafter,  the 
instrument performed almost perfectly, observing the strength, structure,  and 
evolution  of  magnetic fields  in  the  solar  atmosphere. Scientists were  confi- 
dent  that despite abbreviated operations SOUP  data would  be the  best  and 
longest run of solar  granulation data ever  collected. 
Although  loss  of altitude and propellant during initial Space Shuttle ascent 
jeopardized  part of  the  plasma depletion  experiment,  planners managed to

Spacelab 

schedule four of the eight anticipated burns,  two over  Millstone Hill, Massa- 
chusetts,  and  one  each  over  Arecibo,  Puerto  Rico,  and  Hobart,  Australia. 
Preliminary data  indicated that  the burns did produce "holes"  or  troughs of 
depleted plasma that persisted in  the  ionosphere for more than an  hour. The 
crew  observed  resultant  airglow  after  the  nighttime  burns,  and  there  were 
reports of visual observations from the ground. The Hobart site reported the 
reception of  low-frequency cosmic  radio emissions through the window the 
burn temporarily opened. 
In the properties of superfluid helium  in  zero-gravity experiment, the cryos- 
tat  performed up  to expectation,  maintaining a temperature  low enough to 
keep the helium in  the superfluid state.  Temperature  was  readily controlled, 
and  the cryostat  recovered well  from  temperature  increases.  These  findings 
were  important  to  the  use of  superfluid helium as  a cryogen on future mis- 
sions. 
During the gravity  influenced lignification in  plants experiment, pine seed- 
lings,  oats,  and  bean  sprouts grew  in  self-contained  growth  chambers.  The 
crew  daily  monitored  chamber  temperatures  and  photographed the  cham- 
bers  early  and  late  i n  the  mission.  The  oat  and  bean  seeds  germinated  in 
orbit,  and sprouts grew to a height of five to s ix   inches as  expected. The pine 
seedlings also showed normal growth. Researchers would analyze the plant 
tissues to determine whether there was  any difference i n  the production  rate 
of  lignin between plants grown  in  space and  in  a control  group grown  in  a 
ground  laboratory.  (NASA  Prelim Spacelab  Mission Science Report,  Aug  6 /  
85;  €SA  release Aug 7/85) 

September 30 .  NASA announced  that  Spacelab  2,  which  flew  onboard  the 
Space Shuttle Challenger that was  launched on July 29 from KSC on mission 
51-F,  completed the  second of  two  planned Design Verification Flights  re- 
quired  by the Spacelab verification  Flight Test  (VFT) program. Monitoring of 
mission activities and quick-look  analysis of data confirmed that the mission 
achieved the 13  specific VFT  requirements and performed the planned multi- 
discipline science.  Based on these results,  NASA judged the Spacelab-2 mis- 
sion objectives accomplished. 
NASA  researchers  were continuing detailed analysis of  all data,  and Mar- 
shall Space Flight Center (MSFC) would produce additional documents when 
results were  finalized  for  the  Spacelab  system,  payload  integration,  and the 
Spacelab2  experiments  managed  by  MSFC.  Principal  investigators  would 
produce  separate  documentation  for  their  experiments.  (NASA  MOR  M-

October  30:  NASA's  Marshall  Space  Flight  Center  (MSFC)  announced  i t  
awarded  to   McDonne l l   Douglas  Technical  Services  Co .   a  33-month 
$98,105,079  contract  extension  for  continuing  Spacelab  integration  work, 
bringing the  total value of  the Spacelab contract through June 30,  1988,  to

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

$341,496,165.  Under the contract,  the company would provide system  i n t e  
gration,  selected flight  hardware,  software,  ground support equipment,  and 
mission  integration support for manifested Spacelab missions. 
Spacelab,  developed by  NASA  under an  international agreement with  the 
European Space Agency,  when carried  in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle 
orbiter  converted  i t   into  an  orbiting  scientific  research  center.  MSFC  was 
responsible for  monitoring Spacelab design and development activities a.nd 
for  management  of  U.S.  development  of  selected  Spacelab  components.

Nowrnber  7 8  Many of the experiments carried  in  Spacelab  D-1  aboard the 
Space Shuttle Challenger on Mission 61-A  [see Space Transportation System/ 
Missions, Oct.  301  achieved more than  100% of mission goals,  due in part to 
the  continuous  cooperation  between  experiment  teams  who  coped  with 
hardware problems and changing conditions on board the space  laboratory, 
Aviation  Week  reported.  Peter  Sahm,  Spacelab  D-1  mission  scientist,  said 
this coordination  allowed  a  rescheduling of  experiment  activity  during the 
final mission days,  maximizing the overall scientific return  in  spite of delays 
caused by  hardware problems. 
In one of the  repairs, Spacelab D-1  crew members used a saw  to cut off a 
plastic cap on a valve that  fed  liquid  into the  fluid  physics module’s  experi- 
ment zones.  “The  valve  had an  incorrect setting,  which  perhaps was  made 
before  launch,”  said  Berndt Feuerbacher of West  Germany‘s  Deutsche  Fors- 
chungs  und  Versuchsanstalt  fur  Luft  und  Raumfahrt’s  (DFVLR)  Institute for 
Space Simulation. The DFVLR executed and controlled the mission on behaif 
of West Germany’s  BMFT ministry of research and technology.  ”They  tried to 
reset the  valve  with  a wrench,  but they  couldn’t  put the  wrench  to  the  nlut 
because  there  was  a  plastic  cap  over  it.  So  they  asked  for,  and  received 
authorization, to cut away the plastic cap,  then were able to use the wrench.” 
Feuerbacher said  other  repair/troubleshooting work  by  the  Spacelab  D--1 
crew  members  included  West  German  payload  specialist  Dr.  Ernst  Mes- 
serschmid using a vacuum cleaner to collect debris from a heating facility  in  
the Werkstofflabor material science double  rack and writing a software patch 
on  the Werkstofflabor to work around a malfunctioning  vacuum sensor  thlat 
incorrectly  indicated a  lack of vacuum.  NASA  mission specialist  Dr.  Bonnie 
Dunbar  also  used  the  vacuum  to  clean  up  metallic  dust  particles  from  a 
sample  that  broke  in   the  Spacelab  D-1  Medea’s  gradient  furnace  with 
quenching device. 
These corrective actions demonstrated the need for trained crew members 
in  complex spaceflight operations and for  positive control  from  the ground, 
Wolfgang Finke,  head of space  program activities at the West German BMFT 
ministry  of  research and technology,  indicated.  “I think  i t  also  underscored

Spacelab 

the good working  relationship between the German Space Operations Cen- 
ter here and NASA i n  the U.S.  to  overcome problems as  they occurred:’  Finke 
said.  (AvWk, Nov  18/85,  55 and 65) 

November 20: At  the preliminary  science review held the  previous week  at 
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC),  Dr. Eugene Urban, Spacelab 2 mission 
scientist,  called  “a  complete success”  the Spacelab  2  mission flown aboard 
the  Space  Shuttle  Challenger  on  mission  51-F  [see  Space  Transportation 
System/Missions, July 291,  the Marshall Star  reported.  “We  saw  that the ma- 
jority  of  the experiments collected  a  large amount of  new  information  that 
should be tremendously  beneficial to the world of science and technology:’ 
he commented. 
As  the  lead center for Spacelab 2, MSFC hosted the two-day conference in 
which  numerous  science  teams  shared  early  data  from  the  mission.  The 
teams represented the science disciplines of solar physics, atmospheric phys- 
ics,  plasma physics,  life sciences,  technology  research,  infrared  astronomy, 
and  high-energy astrophysics.  Among  those  attending the  conference were 
many  of  the  principal  and  co-investigators  for  the  13  experiments,  all  the 
payload and  mission  specialists,  some  invited members  from  NASA  Head- 
quarters who supported mission work,  and a number of MSFC  science and 
engineering team members. 
Some  results thus  far,  according to  Urban,  confirmed  what  scientists had 
earlier  predicted but could  not  measure,  while  other  results yielded  some 
surprises. For example,  the superfluid helium experiment confirmed theoreti- 
cal predictions of wave behavior of very thin films of super-cooled helium in 
microgravity.  But  the  infrared  telescope  surprised  researchers  when  it  indi- 
cated that the “Shuttle glow”  phenomenon observed on past flights was weak 
i n  the short  infrared wavelength region, where the  researchers expected it to 
be strong. 
The  soiar  physics experiment also  gathered  much data,  according to  Ur- 
ban.  He  cited  in  particular the  experiment  called  SOUP,  the  Solar  Optical 
Universal Polarimeter, which studied the visible surface of  the sun.  “We were 
able to obtain  long sequences of high-resolution photos of the solar surface:’ 
he said.  “We  now have the means to study the growth and fading of various 
solar features like sunspots over  long periods of time.” 
An example of the special qualities of  Spacelab 2 was the Vehicle Charging 
and Potential Experiment, VCAP,  in  which a beam of charged particles from 
an  electron  generator  passed  from  the  orbiter‘s  payload  bay  through  the 
ionosphere. %r 
the first  time:’  Urban pointed  out,  “we  had an  interactive 
experiment w i th   the  VCAP  in  which we  could observe  the  experiment  re- 
the  Plasma  Diagnostics  Package,  another  experiment  we  al- 
motely-from 
lowed  to  free-fly  and  sense  environmental  conditions.  Together  the 
diagnostics  package and VCAP  found  some  highly  interesting  correlations 
between  the  man-made electron  beam  simulations  of  the  ionosphere  and 

381 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

naturally occuring  auroras. The  information  w i l l   help  us  understand better 
how such auroras are formed from beams of charged particles from the sun.” 
(Marshall Star,  Nov 20/85,  1 )  

Decenrber 24: Marshall Space  Flight Center (MSFC) announced preliminary 
scientific results from  Spacelab  3  flown on the Space  Shuttle Challenger on 
mission  51-B  launched April  29,  1985.  Researchers and  participants in  the 
sevenday  flight  gathered  in  December at  the  Center  to  present their  initial 
findings. 
“The  mission has made some major contributions  in  the  physical and  life 
sciences,”  said  Dr.  George  Fichtl of  MSFC’s  Systems  Dynamics  Laboratory. 
“We  have  gained  a  lot of  insight for  future  Spacelab  and  space  station  r e  
search. And I think we can now say  that space  research  i s  becoming routine.” 
Initial  results from  the  three  Spacelab  3  crystal growth  experiments wlere 
very promising,  Ficthl noted. The two triglycine sulfate crystals and the single 
mercuric iodide crystal grown in  the space laboratory were at least as  good’ as 
the  best crystals grown  to date on  earth. And  they  might  actually  be better, 
although additional testing was necessary to confirm  this,  Fichtl said. “This  i s  
of major significance, because normally we must grow between one and two 
thousand crystals on earth to get just one crystal that  i s  equal to the quality of 
those grown on  Spacelab 3.  Mercuric  iodide crystals  have  application  in  X- 
ray detectors, and triglycine sulfate crystals are used in infrared detectors,”  he 
said. 
In addition,  the flight proved the reliability of the methods used to grow the 
crystals.  Triglycine  sulfate crystals were  grown from  a solution  as  part of  an 
experiment provided by Alabama A & M  University. The mercuric iodide crys- 
tal grew using a vapor transport process  in  an experiment provided by EG&G 
Energy Measurements Inc. 
The  third  crystal  growth  experiment,  provided by  France  and  which  also 
used  mercuric  iodide,  performed  as  expected  and  added  to  researchers 
knowledge  about  the  process  of  crystal  nucleation,  a  process  difficult  to 
study on earth because of gravity-induced convection. 
The Drop Dynamics Module,  a fluid physics experiment developed by the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, enabled  researchers  to do  some  experiments not 
possible  on  earth.  Results  confirmed  some  of  the  theories  on  how  drops 
behaved when  rotated,  the  first  opportunity  to test  theories posed centuries 
ago  including those by  Isaac Newton. The experiment also proved that using 
sound waves was  a viable technique for manipulating  liquids in  a micrograv- 
ity  environment,  which  had  direct  application  to  containerless  materials 
processing i n  space.  The technique allowed  processing of materials without 
incurring the contaminating effects of the container. The experiment showed 
that  the  “acoustic  bottle”  or  “crucible  of  sound”  containing the droplet  had 
much better characteristics than originally theorized. 

382 

Spacelab 

Drop dynamics  experiments  confirmed  theories  on  how  drops  behaved 
when  rotated slowly;  however,  experiment  data  showed violation  of  some 
basic theories relating to the behavior of drops rotated at  higher rates.  It was 
found,  for example,  that drops tended to transition (change) to a new shape at 
rotation rates lower than predicted. ‘fill this tends to indicate that some of our 
theories may  need to be modified,”  Fichtl said. 
Researchers for  the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell Experiment reported that 
all  102  hours of  data  looked good,  confirming  existing  theories  of  convec- 
tion,  and were expected to lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of 
stellar interiors and planetary atmosphere. However, the research team noted 
that at  higher heating rates-such  as  those that might be found on the sun- 
the data showed some significant departures from that anticipated. After  the 
mission,  researchers developed computer models of some of this  new  infor- 
mation. 
The  Atmospheric  Trace  Molecules  Spectroscopy  (ATMOS)  experiment, 
sponsored by  the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  for  the first  time  simultaneously 
measured  the  concentrations  of  chemical compounds  associated with  car- 
bon,  nitrogen,  oxygen,  and  other  chemical cycles  in  the  atmosphere. This 
would  provide better  insight into the  chemical  processes that  governed  the 
distribution of minor and trace gases  in the atmosphere between 10 and  100 
kilometers. The  instrument recorded concentrations of gases  as  low as  parts 
per  100 billion,  the  first  time  such sensitive measurements were made,  and 
detected and measured traces of nitrogen pentoxide, a compound previously 
undetected in  the atmosphere. 
Results from the Research Animal  Holding Facility showed that the appar- 
ent case of  space adaptation syndrome i n  one of  the monkeys supported the 
contention  that  this  species  would  be  a  good  model  for  future  studies  of 
vestibular adaptation in  microgravity. Results from studies of the largest group 
of rats flown aboard a single spacecraft showed their hind muscles became 11 
to   36%   smaller  and  the  bones  were  less  strong  after  their  flight.  (MSFC

Missiles 

kb rua ry   6  Finnish army  divers  had  recovered the  main  section of  a stray 
Soviet  rocket that  had  crashed  December  28,  1984,  through a frozen  lake, 
and  military  officials  said  i t  was  not  a  cruise  missile,  the  Washington Post 
reported. A  helicopter  recovered  the  missile’s  main  frame  and  engine after 
divers  had  brought  up the  nose  cone  and  other  debris.  Finnish authorities 
said the debris showed i t  was  “an  old-type missile dating from  1971 or 72  and 
without m i  I itary capacity.” 
U.S.  officials, contradicting an earlier statement by  Defense Secretary  Cas- 
par Weinberger that i t  was an  “air  cruise missile:’  agreed with the Finnish that 
the missile was  an  older-generation drone and unarmed. 
The Soviet Embassy in  Helsinki, which said the missile had gone off course 
wh i le   in  use for  target practice over  the Barents Sea,  had requested return of 
the remnants. 
The  Finnish  later announced  they would  return  the  fragments,  but asked 
Moscow to  pay  for  the  recovery.  (W  Post,  Feb  3/85,  A17,  Feb  6/85,  A151 

April  1:  The  Department of  Defense’s  1985 edition of Soviet Military P o w r  
said  the  USSR  was  continuing  in   1984  deployment  of  new  nuclear  and 
conventional military weapons systems,  including test firings of fifth-genera- 
tion  ICBMs,  launchings  of  new  classes  of  submarines,  and  installing new 
strategic bombers,  the  Washington Times reported. 
The  book detailed several  significant developments by  the Soviet military, 
the  article  said,  including continued  test  firings  of  the  SS-24  and  SS-25 
intercontinental ballistic missiles,  launch of two units of new Delta IV-class of 
strategic ballistic missile submarines to be fitted w i th  the SS-NX-23  subma- 
rine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM)  then being flight tested,  and  comple- 
tion of sea  trials of a third 25,000-ton  Typhoonclass strategic ballistic missile 
submarine to jo in  the two Typhoon units already operational and fitted with 
20  SS-N-20  SLBMS. 
The  book also  said  the  Soviets  had developed  a  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle 
capable of putting 150-ton payloads into orbit as  part of an  “extremely  high 
priority”  military-related space program. The  Soviet version of the US. Space 
Shuttle and  manned  Space  Station  would  benefit  from  this  heavy  booster. 
Major emphasis  in  their  space  program was  on  longduration manned mis- 
sions for  military research. 
The  USSR  continued  research on  ground-  and  space-based,  antisatellite 
high-energy  lasers.  “The  Soviets  currently  have  the  world’s  only  deployed 
antisatellite weapons system  that can attack  satellites  in  nearearth orbit,”  the 
book said.

The  Soviets  also continued  upgrading detection  and  tracking  systems  for 
ballistic missile defense and development of  new early-warning and air-sur- 
veillance radars. Their work on a new,  large phased-array  radar at Krasnoyarsk 
violated  the  ABM  treaty,  the  book  stated,  and  “in  addition,  the  Soviets  are 
actively engaged in  extensive research on advanced defenses against ballistic 
missiles.”  ( W  Times, Apr  1/85,  1A) 

September  3:  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  Gorbachev  today  told  a  U.S.  Sen.ate 
delegation that the USSR would make “radical  proposals” to reduce strate:gic 
and intermediaterange offensive nuclear arms one day  after the U.S.  agreed 
to  prohibit the militarization of space,  the  Washington Post reported. Gorba- 
chev told the eight visiting senators, headed by Sen.  Robert Byrd (D-W. Ma.), 
that the Soviet Union opposed research on military space defense programs, 
such  as  President  Reagan‘s  Strategic  Defense  Initiative (SDI), that  went  be- 
yond what was done  in  laboratories. 
Clarifying the Soviets’ position, Gorbachev said that any research outside of 
a  laboratory was  considered verifiable and  subject  to  limits defined  in  the 
Antiballistic Missile Treaty  ratified in  1972  by both countries. 
During the discussion on SDI  research,  according to  notes taken  by  Sen. 
john  Warner (R-Va.),  Gorbachev said,  “You  can’t  verify what‘s  going on  in  the 
brain  . . . and that‘s  what we  refer to as  fundamental or basic research. 
”But  as  soon as  you go beyond the  laboratory, to mock-ups, models,  con- 
tracts w i th  defense contractors,  here surely verification can be done. 
“We  want  a  ban  on  that  phase  of  research  that  approaches  design  and 
manufacture,”  Warner said his notes concluded. ( W  Post,  Sept 4/85,  A l )

kbruary   7:  The USSR  today boosted the nuclear-reactor core of  its Cosmos 
7607 radar ocean-surveillance satellite  (RORSAT) to  a higher orbit,  marking 
the end of  its 92day  mission,  Aerospace  Daily reported. 
Some  observers  linked  the  maneuver  to  the  failure  the  week  before  of 
Cosmos  7625,  a  solar-powered  electronic  ocean  reconnaissance  satellite 
(EORSAT). They  b e l i e d  that  EORSATs  and  RORSATs  worked  together  to 
monitor mowments of  potentially hostile ships and that,  upon the failure of 
Cosmos  7625,  the Soviets decided Cosmos  7607was not worth maintaining. 
Others said  the  Soviets  terminated  the  Cosmos  7607 mission  because  i t  
had operated successfully for  three months,  and were therefore  uncertain of 
the  satellite’s  reliability  i f   kept  in   operation  any  longer.  (The  Soviets  h,ad 
problems w i th  RORSATs  in  the past-parts  of the  Cosmos 954 reactor came 
down   i n  Canada  in  1978, and the  nuclear power-pack components of  Cos- 
mos  1402 reentered over  the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic  in  early  1983.

Cosmos  1266  lasted  only  about  a  week  in   1981,  and  in   that  same  year 
Cosmos  1299 only a  little longer.  In 1982 Cosmos  1412 was  operational for 
only 40 days.) 
Cosmos  7607 was  the second Soviet RORSAT of  1984;  they safely boosted 
the  power  pack  of  Cosmos  1579,  launched June 28,  to  a  higher  orbit  on 
September  28.  The  Soviets  boosted the  power  packs to  high orbit  so  their 
decay would occur after half-life of the nuclear elements. ( A D ,  Feb  11/85,  1) 

February 7: The USSR had launched Meteor-2, a meteorological satellite that 
would obtain global pictures of cloud cover  and the surface below in  visible 
and  infrared frequencies in  both the  recorded and direct transmission mode 
and would observe penetrating-radiation flow  in  nearearth space,  FBlS Tass 
International Service in  Russian reported. 
The  satellite also carried an  earth-orientation  system,  equipment  to auto- 
matically  align solar  panels to  the  sun,  a radiotelemetry  system  for  satellite 
monitoring,  and a radio complex for transmission of data to earth. A l l  e q u i p  
ment was  functioning normally,  the  service  reported.  (Tass  Intl.  Service  in 
Russian,  Feb  7/85) 

lune  27: The USSR today  launched a secret  rocket from  i t s  Tyuratam  launch 
site that may  have  been an antisatellite weapons test or the  first  launch of a 
new  Soviet  rocket  that  used  liquid  hydrogen  fuel  instead of  kerosene,  the 
Washington Post  reported. The  rocket later broke into three pieces,  the  larg- 
est of which was three feet  long,  the North American Air Defense Command 
(NORAD) said.  One  piece  fell  out of  orbit June 24  and  burned  up  in  the 
atmosphere;  the two other pieces came down June 28. 
The objects were  in  an  orbit  121  miles high  at  the  lowest point and  215 
miles at the highest. The orbit was  inclined at 64.4O,  a course only slightly off 
the one the  Soviets  use to test  new  rockets and  satellites,  because it passed 
directly over  a highly instrumented corridor  in  the Soviet Union. 
U.S.  intelligence  sources said  they  were  baffled by  the  small  size of  the 
three pieces. One  source suggested the launch may have been a test of a new 
Soviet  rocket that used liquid hydrogen fuel that  resulted in  the  launch vehi- 
cle exploding  w i th   most of  the  debris  falling  to  earth  out of  radar  contact. 
Another  source speculated  it might  have  been  a test  of  a  new  antisatellite 
weapon that failed or was deliberately blown up. 
The June 21 mystery  launch followed  that same  day  the  launches of  Cos- 
mos  1663  and  Progress  24 .   The  Soviets  launched  Cosmos  1664 June 26 ,  
resuming their  numbered  Cosmos  series  after  skipping  the  June 21  ”no- 
name”  launch.  NORAD gave  the secret  launch the designation  1985-53-A. 
(The  “53”  stood  for  the  53rd  object  put  into  space  that  year;  ‘A“  meant 
NORAD classified  i t  as  a payload,  not a rocket launcher.  NORAD gave  the 
suffix “B”  to  launch vehicles that went  into orbit.) ( W  Post, July 5/85,  A21

the century an  orbiting power plant equal  in  size to a small town to provide 
electricity by solar energy. The craft would also carry panels of solar batteries. 
Soviet cosmonauts had already  tested  in  outer  space  assembly methods for 
such a plant. (FBIS,  Moscow Wcrld Service  in  English, Jan 25/85) 

March  15: Soviet cosmonaut Aleksey  Leonov said  in  an  interview with a l a s s

without extravehicular activities,  FBIS Tass  in  English reported. Leonov e i w  
merated  the  accomplishments  of  cosmonauts  during extravehicular  optra- 
tions,  but pointed out that the benefit of  space  research was  not confined to 
appiied tasks.  "Cosmonautics engenders a host of ideas the solution of which 
holds out a promise of  immense benefit to mankind:'  he said. 
He  added that he hoped the space age would contribute to the unification 
of a l l  people and states so  they  could concentrate on common problems. "It 
seems  to me that  it would be reasonable that a l l  countries should pool  their 
efforts  and  resources,  which  are  unfortunately  now  used  for  military  pur- 
poses, for the lofty cause of peaceful uses of outer space:'  Leonov concluded. 
(FBIS,  Tass  in  English,  Mar 15/85) 

April  1:  The  Department of  Defense's  1985 edition of  Soviet Military Power 
pointed  out  that  the  Soviets  were  developing a  version  of  the  U.S.  Space 
Shuttle,  a space  plane,  and  directedsnergy weapons  and  were  engaged  in  
military-related experiments abroad the Salyut 7 space  station,  the  Washing- 
ton  Times reported. The  book concluded that the USSR's  grand strategy was 
to attain  global supremacy  "by  means short of war-exp lo i t ing   the coercive 
leverage inherent  in  superior  forces,  particularly nuclear forces."  ( W  Times, 
Apr  1/85,  1A) 

April  9:  In remarks at a meeting marking the 25th anniversary of the Gagarin 
Space Training Centre, Gen. Georgiy Beregowy, center commander, said that 
i t  had become an  international space  academy where  58  USSR  cosmonaiJts 
and participants in  international space  prcgrams from  the socialist countries 
and from  France and  India trained,  FBIS,  Tass  in  English reported. 
Beregovoy also  said  results of  space  research  were  used  in  virtually every 
sector  of  the  national economy,  w i th  more than  800 USSR  institutions and 
organizations using the  research  results.  He said  that  during missions,  cos- 
monauts were concerned w i th  problems of agriculture;  radio and electronics 
engineering; metallurgy; welding;  studies of sea currents, offshore areas,  and

bottom sedimentation  in  river estuaries;  and  compiling maps of  shoals and 
coastal areas. 
In other  remarks at  the meeting,  Leonid Kizim,  a participant in  the  longest 
space mission,  which  had  lasted 237 days,  said that during its 25   years  the 
training center had become a major research  institution capable of  resolving 
most of the USSR’s  complex  scientific and technical problems. (FBIS,  Tass  in

May 27:  U.S. Air Force’s  imaging reconnaissance spacecraft had observed the 
USSR’s  200-foot tall oxygen/hydrogen-powered  rocket hardware,  to  be used 
in   both  their  space  shuttle  and  new  unmanned  heavy  booster  programs, 
being frequently mounted and  rem& 
from  its Tyuratam  launch  pad,  sug- 
gesting Soviet dissatisfaction w i th   the  ground  test  results and  leading  U.S. 
space experts to believe the troubles could greatly slow the Soviet‘s  ability to 
launch  large  new  space  station  elements  or  space  weapons  such  as  laser 
battle stations,  Aviation Week reported. 
The Soviets  had not test  flown any  of the new  heavy space  shuttle or  new 
unmanned-booster hardware, and serious delays  in  their flight test schedules 
would undoubtedly arise from  the ground test  problems. 
However,  U.S.  reconnaissance had also discovered the Soviet shuttle  pro- 
gram  recently  had  added  a  significant  new  element-a  second  large space 
shuttle  orbiter  whicle--observed  sitting partially  in  a  hangar  at  the  Soviet 
Ramenskoye Flight Test  Center east of Moscow. The other Soviet heavy orbi- 
ter was  sitting outside the hangar.  The orbiters were  almost  identical in  size 
and design to the U.S. Space Shuttle orbiter,  and the discovery of the second 
vehicle showed a forward program direction. (AvWk, May 27/85, 21) 

lune 5: The USSR  launched at 10:40 a.m.  Moscow time today the Soyuz T-73 
carrying cosmonauts Col. Vladimir  Dzhanibekov, mission commander and a 
veteran of four previous space missions, and Viktor Savinykh for a rendezvous 
w i th  the Salyut 7space station  in  the first Soviet manned  launch  in  nearly a 
year,  the Washington Times quoted the official news agency Tass  as saying.  By 
late  evening,  Soyuz  T-73,  fitted  w i th   new  flight  controls,  was  in   an  orbit 
ranging from 203 to  182 miles above earth. 
O n  June 8 the  Soyuz  spacecraft docked w i th   the  space  station  using the 
new  flight  controls  and  an  onboard  computer  in  the  Soviet  program’s  first 
known manual docking. The time between launch from the Baikonur cosmo- 
drome  in  Kazakhstan and the rendezvous with Salyut 7was twice as  long as 
in  previous Soviet space  missions,  leading obseners to believe the time was 
spent testing the new flight controls. 
In  the  past,  personnel  on  the  ground  and  automated  onboard  systems 
controlled Soviet spacecraft docking w i th  Salyut stations,  while cosmonauts 
on board simply monitored the operation.  But since there had been aborted 

389 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

dockings  in   recent  years,  the  Soviets  might  have  given  more  control  to 
Dzhanibekov. 
The Salyut space  station had been mothballed since the previous October 
when three Russians returned to earth after 237  days  in space,  a  record.  ( W  
Times, June 7/85,  7A;  NYT,  June 8/85,  4;  W Post, June 9/85,  A27) 

Duringlune:  Although  the  Soviet  Union  in   the  past  had  responded  to  the 
introduction of every  new U.S.  weapons system  by  installing a corresponding 
system of  i t s  own and many observers assumed  the same would be true w i th  
the  Strategic  Defense Initiative (SDI), there were  increasing indications that 
the Soviet leadership might decide to restrict itself to taking countermeasures 
against the U.S.  system and renounce the development of any  Soviet counter- 
part to SDI,  the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists reported. 
In  1983 Henry Trofimenko,  head of  the  Foreign Policy  Department of  the 
Institute for  the  Study of  the  USA  and Canada,  said  that  in  giving effective 
answer  to  the  U.S.’s  military program  “the  USSR  i s   not going to  match the 
U.S.  in  development  of  every  new  system  of  weapons,  nor  i s   it going  to 
imitate it.” 
More recently,  a  Soviet analysis  by  a committee of  scientific and  strategic 
experts  of  the  implications  of  SDI  stressed  that  Soviet  countermeasures 
against  a  prospective  U.S.  system  could  be  very  effective,  could  be  taken 
quite easily and  quickly,  and would cost much  less  than  the  system  against 
which they were directed. 
Possible countermeasures discussed in  the analysis  included destruction of 
the space platforms (done by  relatively small  missiles,  by  land-based  lasers, 
by armed satellites functioning as  “space  mines,”  or  by  “clouds”  of obstacles 
set  in  their  path;  encasing missiles w i th  material capable of  absorbing  laser 
beams or of  reflecting them;  masking missile launches by  means of  smoke- 
screens;  designing a pattern of  missile  launches over  time  that  would  force 
the  lasers  constantly  to  redirect  themselves  in   haphazard  fashion,  thereby 
reducing  the  effectiveness of  the  system;  or  launching  dummy  missiles  in  
order to use up the destructive power of the system. 
The  Soviet  scientists  agreed with  western  investigators that  an  estimated 
total cost of SDI could eventually reach $2  trillion,  and even  at that expendi- 
ture  SDI  could  not  guarantee  that  at  least  a few  missiles  in  a  hypothetical 
Soviet first strike might not get  through to their targets. 
The  Bulletin  also  pointed  out  that  Soviet  scientists  had  noted  that  the 
technologies  required for  countermeasures were  in  a much  more advanced 
state than those required for SDI itself; in  fact,  much of the necessary technol- 
ogy already existed. Well before SDI would be in  place,  “an  effective means 
of counteraction” could be set  up and would probably cost only  1 or  2%  as 
much as  the  system  i t  was  designed  to  counteract.  (Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists, JundJu ly  85,  38)

July 5: The first month of the flight of cosmonauts Vladimir  Dzhanibekov and 
Viktor  Savinhkh aboard  Salyut 7 was  drawing to a close during which time 
the  crew  had accomplished  all  planned  activities  to  bring the  Soviet  space 
station  into  a manned flight  mode,  checked  the  condition of  onboard  sys- 
tems,  and  carried  out  a  variety  of  scientific  research  projects  and  experi- 
ments,  FB IS  Moscow TASS  in  English reported. 
The cosmonauts had unloaded the  Progress-24 transport spacecraft,  posi- 
tioned  the delivered equipment,  and  replaced three sets  of storage  batteries 
as  well  as  individual  instrument units.  They  had  used oxygen delivered  in  
containers  aboard  the  transport  to  pressurize  the  Salyut's  living  compart- 
ments. The cosmonauts had started preparation of the station's united propul- 
sion unit for  refuelling by checking for leaks in  the fuelling lines. They would 
then pump compressed nitrogen out of the fuel  tanks. 
The schedule for July 5 called for the cosmonauts to perform maintenance 
on  a system  for  the  regeneration of  water  from  atmospheric moisture,  take 
medical checks including measurements of body mass and evaluations of the 
condition of muscles, and exercise on a bicycle ergometer and running track. 
The cosmonauts would continue geophysical experiments in  a  research pro- 
gram  on earth's  natural  resources and environment.  They  also would make 
visual observations and take photos of individual areas of the Atlantic Ocean. 
(FB IS  Moscow Tass  in  English, July 5 / 8 5 )  

July  70 :   The  USSR today  launched Cosmos  7667 intended for the continua- 
tion  of  research on  the  effects  of  spaceflight on  living organisms,  TASS  in 
English  reported.  During  the  flight,  there  would  be  experiments  to   study 
processes of adaptation to weightlessness and to investigate opportunities for 
rad i at i on shield i ng d u r i ng spacefl i ght. 
The satellite carried two monkeys,  Verny and Gordy,  for studies on vestibu- 
lar and hemodynamic responses of  living organisms to  weightlessness at  the 
acute period of adaptation.  Experiments carried out at  that time would take 
quantitative measures  of  the  excitability of  the  vestibular  apparatus and  to 
note increases in  i t s  reactivity. The experiments would  also yield direct data 
on the outflow and  inflow of blood to the head. 
Experiments with  10 male rats aboard the satellite were  intended to deter- 
mine the  influence  on all  parts of  a  living organism  of  the  acute  period  of 
adaptation to weightlessness and  later readaptation. 
Ten  tritons (mollusks) carried on the  satellite  previously  had a portion of 
their  front  limbs  and  lenses  amputated  in   order  to  study  possibilities of 
regeneration and division of cells at zero gravity. And a biocalorimeter would 
monitor 1,500  Drosophila flies aboard the satellite to determine processes of 
energy  exchanges  during  the  emergence of  the  flies  from  nymphs  and  to 
study  the  flies'  metabolism. Guppy fish,  cornseeds,  and crocuses were  also 
experimental subjects.

Scientists from  the  U.S.,  Bulgaria,  Hurigary,  the  German  Democratic  Re- 
puhiic,  Poland,  Romania,  Czechoslovakia, and  France  cooperated with  So- 
viet scientists  in  developing the experimental equipment for the flight and  in  
pre- and  postflight examination of  the animals and  plants abroad the space- 
craft.  (FBIS,  Tass  i n  English,  July 10/85, July 13/85) 

July 22  During a  “Science  and  Engineering”  radio program,  Boris  Belits,kiy 
responded to a New Zealander‘s question about the possibility of there sonie- 
day  being a  larger Soviet  space  station,  FBIS Moscow World  Service  in  En- 
glish reported. 74  Soviet orbital station of the next generation w i l l  be a larger 
and more comfortable complex w i th  better facilities for  research work,  p i lo t  
production,  cosmonaut  exercises,  recreation,  and  everyday  life  generally,” 
Belitskiy said. 
When  asked  whether  the  Soviets  were  developing a  reusable  spacecraft 
like the  U.S. Space  Shuttle,  Belitskiy responded,  “For  the present,  freight’ers 
of  the  Progress  type  meet  the  needs  of  resupplying Salyut  orbital  stations. 
Nevertheless,  Soviet  space  scientists do  see  a  future  for  reusable transport 
systems  and have been conducting tests  in  this area.  The technological p r o b  
lems involved have,  on the whole,  been solved,  but this cannot be said of the 
economic  problems  . . . This  being  so,  Soviet  space  scientists  are  inter- 
ested  in  quite a few  other approaches to the problem as  well.” 
In response to a question about a manned mission to Mars,  Belitskiy said, 
“Some  day,  undoubtedly,  there w i l l  be such  a  mission but that’s  still a  long 
way  down the road.  And a vast  project of this kind,  bound to be very expen- 
sive,  would  be  greatly  facilitated  by  more  cooperation  between  the  major 
space powers.”  (FBIS,  Moscow World Service in  English, July 22/85) 

lu ly   2 8  Over  700  enterprises  and  organizations  in  the  Soviet  Union used 
pictures taken  from  Soviet orbital  Salyut  space  stations,  helping to  save  the 
equivalent of  $8 million,  FBIS Moscow World  Service  in  English  reported. 
For example,  the photos assisted  in  selecting routes of tunnels for the Baykal- 
Amur  railway  in  eastern USSR.  And  cosmonauts Vladimir  Dzhanibekov and 
Viktor  Savinykh,  then  aboard  Salyut  7,  were  working on  a  new  program of 
geophysical  research.  (FBIS Moscow World Service in English, July 28/85) 

September  1 8  The Soyuz T-14  spaceship,  after launch September 17,  docked 
today  with  the  Salyut-7/Soyuz  T-13  orbital  complex  manned  by  Vladimir 
Dzhanibekov  and  Viktor  Savinykh,  FBIS  TASS  in   English  reported.  After 
checking the  integrity of  the docking compartment,  spaceship commander 
Lt.  Col. Vladimir Vasyutin,  flight engineer Georgiy Grechko,  and  research Lt. 
Col.  Aleksandr Volkov entered the station. 
During the  planned eightday joint  flight,  the cosmonauts would conduct 
geophysical,  astrophysical,  and  medical  research  as  well  as  technical  and

USSR 

biotechnological  experiments. Then  Savinykh,  Vasyutin,  and  Volkov  would 
continue work  on the  station,  while  Dzhanibekov and Grechko returned to 
earth i n  the Soyuz  T-13.  (FBIS,  Tass  in  English,  Sept  17/85, Sept  18/85) 

September  26:  Soviet  cosmonauts  Vladimir  Dzhanibekov  and  Georgi 
Grechko i n  the Soyuz  T-13  spacecraft returned to earth  September 2 6   from 
the  Salyut 7 orbiting complex,  making a soft  landing  2 20   km  northeast of 
Dzhezkazgan,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Vladimir  Vasyutin,  Viktor 
Savinykh,  and  Aleksandr  Volkov  remained  onboard  Salyut  7.  The  partial 
replacement  of  the  crew,  FBlS  Moscow  Domestic  Service  in   Russian  r e  
ported, for the first time provided for continuous use over a prolonged period 
of a manned space complex,  thus substantially enhancing its efficiency. 
The present Soviet space effort was  the fourth long-term expedition aboard 
the  Salyut  7 station  since  its  1982  launch.  The overlapping of  crews  meant 
that  the  Salyut 7 would  not have to be shut down and  restarted.  Left empty 
after  the  previous  mission  ended  in  October  1984,  the  station  suffered an 
electrical failure that  created severe  and dangerous problems for  Dzhanibe 
kov and Savinykh when  they docked June 8 w i th  the station. 
The Soviet space program emphasized endurance flights in  space with the 
ultimate goal of establishing large permanently manned orbiting complexes. 
The previous Soviet space mission set a record for human endurance in  space 
when  three crew members lived aboard Salyut 7fOr 237  days.  (W  Post,  Sept 
27185, A21;  FBlS Moscow Service in  Russian,  Sept  26/85) 

October  14  At a news conference to discuss the recent flights of cosmonauts 
Vladimir  Dzhanibekov and Georgiy Grechko,  Soviet space officials said  to- 
day that they expected to have a permanently manned space station by  1990, 
but  that  the  Salyut  7 orbital  laboratory  would  not  be  the  spacecraft  that 
hosted the rotating crews,  the NY  Times reported. Oleg Gazenko, head of the 
health ministry's Biomedical Problems Institute, which oversaw  space medi- 
cine,  said  no  unresolved problems  remained  to  block development  of  the 
permanent station and that the crew  rotation on Salyut 7showed that incom- 
ing  cosmonauts performed their research work better when they were spared 
the start-up operations needed to  reactivate the space  laboratory. 
At  about the same  time,  Soviet officials told a U .S .   Congressional delega- 
tion headed by Rep.  B i l l  Nelson (D-Fla.)  [see U .S .  Space Policy/lnternational, 
Oct.  101  that  it was  building a  new  space  station  that  would  be  ready  for 
launch in  1986, Defense Daily  reported.  Because the Soviets d id  not want to 
have  two  space  stations  in   orbit  at  the  same  time,  timing  of  the  launch 
depended on the condition of the orbiting Salyut 7station, which was  nearly 
doubled in size in  September by the orbiting and deployment of a large new 
module.  Nelson said the Soviets gave  no details of the new station, which,  i f  
it i s  designed to be permanently manned, would beat the planned U.S.  space 
station by  seven  or eight years.  (NYT, Oc t  15/85, C11;  D /D ,  Oct 21/85,  259)

October 3 7:  The Soviet Union, which had kept its space program under tight 
military control  since  i t  launched in  1957 the first satellite,  announced crea- 
tion of a civilian space agency,  the NY  Times reported. The agency would  be 
responsible for  the design,  construction,  and  use of  spacecraft for  scientific 
research,  remote sensing applications such as surveys of resources and crolps, 
and jo in t  space programs w i th  other countries. 
In making the  announcement,  the government newspaper  lzvestia  identi- 
fied the new agency as  the Main Administration for  the Creation and Use of 
Space Technology for the Economy and for Scientific Research, the Post said. 
It would be known as  Glavkosmos, an acronym for the Russian terms “maiin” 
and “space.” 
lzvestia d id   not  s p e c i f y   the  position  of  the  agency  in  the  Soviet  govern- 
ment‘s  table of organization but d id  identify the head of the agency as  A.  1. 
Dunayev. 
The only other publicly disclosed spacerelated agency in  the Soviet Union 
was  the  Space  Research  Institute,  founded  in  1965 and a unit of  the  Soviet 
Academy  of  Sciences.  Western  officials generally  regarded  that  institute as 
performing  some  civilian  space  coordinating  functions.  However,  in   an- 
nouncing Glavkosmos,  lzvestia said,  “It  goes without saying that the effective 
use  of  space  technology  i s  of  interest  to  many  government  ministries and 
agencies  and  to  scientific  organizations.  The  space  program  has  reached 
such scope as  to require the creation of a special coordinating agency.” 
According  to   the  announcement,  the  new  agency  would  consider  pro- 
posals  for  projects,  work  out  long-term  plans,  and  administer  programs.  It 
would also be responsible for  launching satellites on vehicles expected to be 
supplied  by  the  military  and  for  collection  and  dissemination  of  satellite 
information. 
lzvestia said the agency would administer the lntercosmos program and the 
search  and  rescue  satellite  program,  an  international effort  of  the  Soviet 
Union,  the U.S.,  Canada,  and France. The announcement d id  not make clear 
whether  the  new agency would  administer any  manned flights;  but the em- 
phasis  seemed  to  be  on  automated  space  vehicles  concerned with  remote 
sensing,  which  until then  had been part of  the Cosmos series,  a mixture of 
nearly 1700 civilian and military  satellites  launched since  1962. (NY  Times, 
Oc t  31/85,  813) 

November 27: The Soyuz  T-74  spacecraft carrying three  Soviet cosmonauts 
made an unscheduled return to earth today because its commander, Vladimir 
Vasyutin, was  ill and needed hospital treatment, the  Washington Post quoted 
the official news  agency Tass  as  saying. The  illness forced  the  crew  to  leave 
the  Salyut  7 orbiting  laboratory,  the  first  time  in  either  the  Soviet  or  U.S. 
programs that  a spaceflight was  curtailed because  a crew  member  became 
sick  in  orbit,  the  Washington Times said.

Vasyutin, who was  making his first flight,  landed after spending 65 days  in 
space.  He,  Viktor  Savinykh,  and Alexander Volkov,  who were both  reported 
feeling  well,  had  been  conducting  scientific experiments aboard  Salyut  7. 
Tass  gave no  details of Vasyutin’s  illness, but western space experts said it was 
unlikely he was  suffering from a simple case of space  sickness-the 
inability 
to  acclimatize properly  to conditions  i n  space.  The Tass  report quoted doc- 
tors  who  performed  a  preliminary  examination  on  Vasyutin  as  saying  his 
condition was  satisfactory. 
The  unscheduled  return of  the  cosmonauts  left the  Salyut  7, which  had 
been in  orbit since April  1982,  unmanned for the first time since June. 
Almost a week  later, the Post reported that officials at Johnson Space Center 
said  that  cosmonauts  who  stayed  in   touch  with  US.  astronauts  had  said 
Vasyutin  caught a cold that grew worse  and  spread  to  his sinus cavity  and 
lungs.  The sources said Vasyutin had a fever  that  refused to  break and may 
have  come  down  with  viral  pneumonia,  which  was  untreatable with  the 
antibiotics the cosmonauts carried.  (WPost, Nov 22/85,  A26,  27/85,  A3;  W 
Times, Nov 22/85,  2A) 

December 37: During  1985  the  Soviet  Union  launched  96  spacecraft,  the 
US.  17,  the  Washington Post reported,  reflecting what space specialists said 
was  the  fact  that  most Soviet  s p y   satellites  burned out within  weeks  while 
U.S.  satellites  often  remained  in  orbit  for  years.  The  Soviets  launched  3 3  
photo  reconnaissance satellites,  amounting  to  more  than  one-third  of  the 
total Soviet  launches from January 1 through December 26. 
In  1985 the Soviets  continued  to stress  the ability to   locate w i th   satellites 
U.S.  ships at  sea,  Navy officials commented. One type  of  Soviet ocean sur- 
veillance  satellite,  which  had  radar  beams  that  could  penetrate  clouds, 
sought aircraft carriers and other b ig  ships. The radar provided the location of 
ships  below the  satellite,  forcing  the  Navy to  resort to  new  methods to foil 
radar detection. 
Nicholas Johnson, advisory  scientist to  Teledyne Brown Engineering Co., 
kept a widely used log of U.S.  and Soviet space launches, and he said that the 
Soviets launched in  1985 five ocean surveillance satellites, two carrying radar 
and three equipped with electronic eavesdropping gear.  He added that Soviet 
launches included  19  communication  satellites,  two of  a variety  never  seen 
before,  and seven  satellites designed to warn Moscow of a nuclear attack. 
Through  espionage  the  Soviets  had  learned a  great  deal  about  U.S.  s p y  
satellite  capabilities and  had  taken  steps  to  mask  some  of  their  military 
activities,  intelligence  officials  noted.  Space  specialists  largely  agreed  that 
the  US.  was  well  ahead  of  the  Soviets  i n   the  art  of  spying  from  space, 
although  they  indicated  the  Soviet’s  reconnaissance satellites  were  steadily 
improving.  (WPost, Dec 31/85,  A4)

Spacecraft 

February  2 8   The  USSR ‘s   Vega  7  and  Vega  2 Venus  and  Halley’s  Comet 
exploratory spacecraft  had  traveled  18.7 and  17.8  m i l l ion  miles  from  earth, 
respectively,  and  were  functioning  normally,  Tass  in   English  reported.  The 
Soviets  had had 67   radio communications with  the  stations since  launch to 
measure  flight-path  parameters,  monitor  onboard  systems,  and  to  receive 
scientific and telemetric data. 
Stations  located i n  Evpatoriya and Simeiz  in  the Crimea,  Goldstone (U.S.), 
Jodrell Bank  (U.K.), Canberra (Australia), and Onsala (Sweden) received on 
January 2 1  and February 18  signals from the spacecrafts’  radio transmitters to  
prepare  for  research on  the  circulation  of  the  Venusian  atmosphere  using 
balloon  probes.  The  reception of  signals  tested  correlation  of  the  various 
ground-measuring systems to ensure pinpointing of balloon probe locations 
during  their  forthcoming  drift  i n   the  Venusian  atmosphere.  (FBIS,  Tass  in

A p r i l  2 6  The U S S R  today  launched the automatic “Prognoz-10-Intercosmos” 
station  to  study  the  structure of  interplanetarj and  nearearth  shock  waves 
arising from  the  interaction of  solar  wind  plasma and  the  earth’s  magnet@ 
sphere,  FBIS,  Tass  in  English reported.  The  station  carried  scientific e q u i p  
ment  designed  by  U S S R   and  Czechoslovakian  scientists  under  an 
“intercosmos”  program of  international cooperation. 
The  station  was  i n  a  high  elliptic  orbit  with  an  apogee  of  200 ,000   km, 
perigee of  400  km,  period of  96  hours and  2 5   minutes,  and  inclination of 
65O.  The  report  stated  all  onboard  systems  and  scientific equipment were 
functioning normally and that the USSR’s  coordinationcomputer  center and 
institutes of the Academy of Sciences were  processing incoming data.  (FBIS, 
Tass  in  English, Apr  26/85) 

M a y 2 9  Finland and Sweden would together bu i ld  measuring equipment for

quoted  Risto  Pellinen  of  the  Finnish Meteorological  Institute as  saying,  be- 
cause  i t  was  the first time Finns would  bu i ld  equipment to be launched into 
space. 
Altogether 11  countries and the European Space Agency would  participate 
i n  the program. The Mars probes would  study solar winds,  the planet itself,

lune   72 :   Geoffrey  Perry  of  the  United  Kingdom’s  Kettering Group  said  the 
radio  aboard  the  Soviet  Salyut  7 space  station  came  on the  air  June  12, 
indicating the two cosmonauts who entered i t  had been successful in  repair 
efforts,  Aerospace Daily reported. Perry said he had received no radio signals 
from the Salyut for some time,  supporting the belief of Western obsemrs that 
the space station experienced some kind of electrical problem since the  last 
cosmonauts had  left it in  October  1984. 
Perry noted the cosmonauts were transmitting on June 12  from 7:09  a.m.  to 
7:16  a.m.  GMT on the Soyuz frequency,  but by 8:46  a.m.  GMT,  the next time 
they were w i th in  his radio range,  they had switched to the Salyut frequency.

August  5: Cosmonauts  Vladimir  Dzhanibekov  and  Viktor  Savinykh,  after 
completing  a  docking operation,  boarded  the  Salyut  7 orbital  station  to 
discover cold and darkness,  FBIS Moscow World Service in  English reported. 
The electricity supply system had broken down,  water was  frozen, and a crust 
of  ice covered  the  instrument panels.  It took  a week  and  a  half of  intensive 
work  by the cosmonauts to eliminate the defects  and  restore electricity and 
life  support  systems.  Mission  planners  sent  an  automatic  cargo  ferry  that 
delivered  instruments,  fuel,  water,  and  food  supplies.  After  restoring  the 
station,  the crew continued w i th  planned research. 
In a report on a Pravda article on the same topic, the Washington Post said 
the failure  of  two batteries had  paralyzed the  Salyut  7 station after  the  pre- 
vious  threeman  crew  mothballed the  station  in  October  1984  following a 
record 238 days  in  orbit. 
A  N Y  Times  article  noted  Pravda  mentioned  the  risky  docking  took  50 
hours, during which the cosmonauts had to rely on visual clues instead of the 
automatic electronic  radar  pulses  exchanged  between  the  Salyut  and  their 
Soyuz T-13  spacecraft. 
“They’ve  snatched  it back  from  the  brink of death,”  the  NY  Times quoted 
James Oberg,  an American expert on the Soviet space program, saying.  “It’s  a 
major coup.” 
Later the cosmonauts made a five-hour  space walk  in  which they  replaced 
two of the ship’s  solar panels. The excursion gave them a chance to test  new 
semirigid space suits,  which were shown on Soviet TV.  (FBIS Moscow World 
Service in  English,  Aug 5 /85 ;   W  Post,  Aug 6/85,  A12;  N M ,  Aug 7/85,  D19)

bital station following the October 2 docking w i th  Cosmos  1686,  FBIS Mlos- 
cow  in   English to  North America  reported.  Soviet  space  officials designed 
Cosmos  7686 to function as a heavy transport vehicle, an  inter-orbit tug,  or as 
a specialized module for  research  or  production.  During docking,  the  Sovi- 
et‘s  flight control center and crew on the orbiting complex guided search  for 
the satellite, approach,  and mooring. 
Cosmos  1686  delivered equipment and various other  cargo for  continued 
functioning of  the  complex;  the  cosmonauts would test  satellite equipment 
and elements of  its construction and develop methods of  controlling orbital 
complexes of  large dimensions and masses. 
Soviet science correspondent Boris Belitskiy said of the Cosmos  1686  niis- 
sion:  “The  experience  gained  in   recent  years  in   operating  such  modular 
spacecraft w i th  the Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 stations  showed that such satelliites 
can considerably extend the active  life of future orbital complexes and make 
their  operation  more  fruitful.  Satellites of  this  new  type  have  an  advanced 
computerized  control  system,  a  large  supply  of  propellant,  and  a  power 
system  incorporating solar  batteries. The satellite’s  control system makes pos- 
sible the automatic search for an orbital station,  rendezvous, and docking,  a l l  
in  an  unmanned mode.  The  onboard  computer  enabled mission control to 
transmit flight assignments that would over  several days,  if necessary months, 
assure  the autonomous functioning of  the satellite’s  control system. 
‘Also,  the sate!lite’s  control system  i s  highly economical,”  Belitskiy contin- 
ued.  “The  control  system  itself could  select  an  optimal  mode dictated  by 
considerations  of  saving propellant. A  previous heavy  satellite of  this  new 
type,  Cosmos  1443,  was  tested  in   1983  as  a  transport craft  of  large  cargo 
capacity.  It was  fitted  with  a  recoverable capsule which  returned  a  350-kg 
payload  to  earth.  The  present  Cosmos  7686  i s   a  modular  version.  Such  a 
modular  design  of  future  extraterrestial colonies  i s   particularly  promising 
because  long-term  orbiting  stations can  most  reasonably be  assembled di- 
rectly in  orbit from separate  modules. 
“Can  such  automatic  craft  make  space  research  significantly  more  effi- 
cient?” Belitskiy continued. “That  i s  the question the flight of Cosmos  1686  i s  
expected to answer.  The  total weight of the craft w i th   its payload exceeds 20 
tons,  and it‘s  almost as  long as  the Salyut Is ta t ion .  The diameter of  i t s  widest 
part exceeds four  meters and  i t  carries over  three tons of propellant and five 
tons  of  cargo.  Docked w i th   the  Salyut 7 station,  Cosmos  1686  has  almost 
doubled  the  working  space  available aboard  the  orbital  station  and  made 
conditions  for  the  crew  more  comfortable.  Its  flight  program  provides  for 
extensive  research  for  economic  needs.”  (FBIS Moscow in  English to  North

the Max  Planck  Institute for  Extra-terrestrial Physics  in  Garching,  West  Ger- 
many were planning to launch in  spring 1986 an observatory to investigate X- 
rays  i n  space,  the magazine Geo reported. The observatory would  carry four 
instruments  intended  to  investigate  the  X-ray  stars  of  the  M i lky   Way,  the 
remnants of dying stars (supernova), and nuclei of other active galaxies. They 
called the project "Salyut-Hexe,"  in  which Salyut referred to the Soviet space 
station  and  Hexe  to  the  English abbreviation  for  high-energy  X-ray  experi- 
ment. 
The magazine noted that Dr. Claus Reppin of the Max Planck Institute said 
i t  was  not clear whether  the  observatory would  be  coupled  to  the  existing 
Soviet  Salyut  7 space  station  or  to  a  new  space  station,  Salyut  8.  Reppin 
confirmed  that  the  German scientists would  not,  for  reasons  of  secrecy,  be 
present at the  installation and assembly of the  instruments.  Soviet scientists 
had  spent  two  weeks  in  West  Germany  to  familiarize  themselves w i th   the 
instruments so  that they would be able to assemble and install them.  Reppin 
also said the West  European scientists d id  not know whether  they could be 
present at  the  launch,  which would  probably  be at  Baykonur,  but he  indi- 
cated  i t  was  probably  more  important  that  they  be  at  the  ground  control 
center  i n   or  near  Moscow  by  a  few  days  after  launch,  when  measuring 
instruments would begin operation. 
The experiment, the magazine added, was part of the Soviet effort to set up 
a permanently inhabited  large space  station.  At  the  beginning of  1986,  the 
Soviets planned to  launch the new station with several coupling connections 
for attachment of various modules.  In this way,  a settlement in  space would 
grow gradually according to  a building block principle; up to  30  cosmonauts 
were  in  training to  serve as crew on the new station.  (FBIS,  Hamburg DPA  in

They  had run through launch procedures and checked a l l  spacecraft systems 
to avoid any  surprises  at  liftoff, ending with a simulated  liftoff at 4 p.m. 
Garn,  who would fly on Challenger as a congressional observer,  was  chair-

March 20:  In response to numerous comments regarding the appropriateness 
of Sen. Jake Garn’s  (R-Utah) flight on the Space Shuttle,  Sen.  Barry Goldwater 
(R-Ariz.) wrote  in  a  letter to  the  Washington  Times that Garn  had as  good  a 
background in  aviation as  any member of Congress and his was  a long, deep, 
and sincere  interest.  “Of  a l l  the members of  this body that  I know,  he  i s  the

Sen.  Goldwater  concluded  that  he would defend  the  desirability of  Sen. 
Garn’s  flight,  as he would be able “to  give the rest of us  in  Congress who vote

February 8 The EC-18B  advanced-range instrumentation aircraft (ARIA), the 
first of four former 707 commercial aircraft modified by Aeronautical Systems 
Division’s  (ASD) 4950th  Test  Wing,  rolled  out  on January 4,  the  Air  Force 
Systems Command’s  (AFSC) Newsreview reported. To  augment ARIA-mission 
capabilities,  ASD  had purchased the Boeing 707-320 aircraft from American 
Airlines  i n  1982 as  replacements for four of the seven  Boeing EC-135s  in the 
current ARIA  fleet. 
The aircraft would provide worldwide missile- and space-testing support by 
sewing  as  airborne  tracking  stations  over  land  where  geographical  con- 
straints limited ground-tracking stations and over broad ocean areas where no  
tracking  stations  existed.  The  EC-18B’s  ARIA  fleet  improvements  included 
more  room  for  mission equipment,  increased fuel  capacity,  and  more fuel- 
efficient engines. 
Modification of  the  707s had offered major cost savings over  purchase of 
new aircraft;  program costs for the four aircraft were $25 million-$6  m i l l ion  
for  aircraft  purchase and  $19  m i l l ion   for  ARIA  conversion.  At  the  time  of 
purchase, Boeing officials had estimated new aircraft would cost $25 m i l l ion  
each,  not including ARlA-conversion costs. 
The most obvious external modification was the large bulbous nose-a  9 ft. 
radome housing the world’s  largest airbornesteerable antenna, a 7 ft. dish for 
telemetry reception. The nose also housed a smaller weather antenna. Other 
additions  included a smaller  radome for communications on the aircraft top 
and w ing t ipprobe  antennas for high-frequency radio transmission and recep  
tion. 
ASD  also  outfitted  the  aircraft  with  a  navigation  station,  mission-crirical 
cockpit avionics, a modified electrical system,  and an  improved environmen- 
tal-control system.  (AFSC Newsreview,  Feb  8/85,  6) 

A p r i l 2 5  Ted S t e n s  (R-Aka.),  chairman of the Senate defense appropriations 
subcommittee,  told  Air  Force  officials  today  that  Congress  would  provide 
funds  in  FY 86 to buy a number of Northrop  F-20  Tigershark fighters,  poss i-  
b ly  for  the Guard or Reserve,  despite what the Air  Force decided about  the 
plane,  Defense Dailyreported. “You’re  going to get some F-20s  i f  you  like i t  
or not,”  he said,  although he added  i f  the Air  Force could prove to Congress 

404 

United States 

the F-20  could not do the job,  that would be a different matter.  He also said 
that  no  one  in   Congress  was  “shilling”  for  one  company  or  another,  but 
simply wanted to have competition,  which would ensure the best product at 
the  lowest price. 
Air  Force Assistant  Secretary  Thomas  Cooper  said  the Air  Force was  very 
interested in the F-20,  but that the question had not been put to the Defense 
Resources Board and that  the  Defense Department had made no final deci- 
sion to buy the F-20  in  FY 87. 
When Sen.  William Proxmire (D-Wis.) asked about cutting the FY 86  F-16 
buy  from  180  to  161  aircraft and  using the  money  freed  to  buy  32   F - ~ O S ,  
Cooper answered that the Air  Force would not simply buy 32   F-20s  without 
a follow-on commitment. 
Northrop had proposed to provide 396 F-20s  to the Air  Force over  a four- 
year  period  at  a  fixed  price  of  $15  m i l l ion   each.  However,  Cooper  said 
General Dynamics had told the Air  Force that  i t  would provide a fixed-price 
proposal for  the  F-16  i f  the Air  Force  requested it. 
Sen.  Warren  Rudman  (R-N.H.)  pointed out  the  “supplier  of  the  F-16  has 
not  had  the  best  record  recently  in  defense contracting,  . . .  in  fact,  i s   in  
m i ld   disrepute  with  some  sectors”  of  the  Department  of  Defense  and  i s  
“guilty  of some misconduct.”  Therefore,  he said,  the government should not 
“continue  to  reward them”  i f  there was  a viable competitor who gave  them a 
better price.  (D /D ,  Apr  26/85,  321) 

May  1 4  A  Northrop F-20  Tigershark crashed  today while practicing i t s   rou- 
tine  for  the  Paris Air  Show  during a stopover a t  Goose  Bay,  Labrador,  Aero- 
space  Daily  reported.  The  pilot,  whose  name  was  withheld  pending 
notification of next of kin, was  fatally injured. A  Northrup spokesman said an 
investigation was  underway to determine the cause  of  the crash and that  the 
company “would expect the cooperation of the Air Force in  the  investigation 
since they are  the executive agency  for  the F-20.” 
The only other F-20  was  at  Edwards Air  Force Base,  California,  and would 
remain there  to  continue the  flight demonstration program  “because  of  the 
high interest in  the F-20  program in  this country,”  the spokesman continued. 
The  first  F-20  had crashed  the  previous October during a  demonstration 
flight a t  Suwon Air  Base near Seoul,  South Korea,  killing Northrop chief test 
p i lo t  Darrell Cornell.  Northrop reported at the time that the crash was  “pilot 
induced” and  the  “the  aircraft and a l l   its systems  functioned  properly.”  The 
fourth Tigershark was  on the assembly  line. 
An  attempt earlier  in  the month to provide funding for  the  Northrop F-20 
failed,  Defense Daily  reported,  when  an  amendment by  Rep. James Courter 
(R-N.J.) to  substitute 30  Northrop F-20s  for  24 General Dynamics F-16s  in  
FY  86,  brought  up  in  a closed door  markup by  the  House Armed  Services 
procurement and military nuclear systems  subcommittee,  failed  by a note of 
8-4.  An  amendment  by the panel‘s  chairman,  Rep.  Samuel Stratton (D-NY), 

405 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

calling for competition between the F-20  and the F-16  in  the  FY 87 budget, 
prevailed. 
The Stratton amendment specified that the Secretary of the Air Force,  in  the 
development of the tactical aircraft fighter program for the Five-Year Defense 
Plan  beginning in  FY  87,  “shall  establish  a  competition for  procuremenit of 
tactical  fighter  aircraft  to  meet  the  requirements of  the  Air  Force  above  a 
minimum number  of  F-16  and  F-20  aircraft  that  the  Secretary  determwnes 
appropriate for  meeting the  requirements of  the  active  and  reserve cornipo- 
nents.  Such competition shall be among a l l  suitable aircraft,  including the F- 
16  and  F-20  aircraft.” 
A  report drafted for  the  subcommittee stated  that  the  F-16  and  F-20  “are 
both  roughly  comparable  aircraft.  Both  have  new  and  modern  radar  and 
avionics  systems,  both  haw  excellent  performance  as  air-to-air  combat

report d id  note that the F-16  had the advantage in  range and payload capabil- 
ities,  while  the  F-20  has  “a  significant advantage“  in   reliability and  main- 
tainability factors that affect the combat readiness and operating costs.”  (ND ,

May  77 :   The  U.S.  Air  Force  awarded Martin Marietta Corp.  an  $87-million 
contract  to  begin  production of  the  Low-Altitude Navigation and  Targeting 
Infrared  System  for  Night  (LANTRIN),  the  Air  Force  Systems  Command 
Newsreview reported. The award enabled Martin Marietta to buy specialized 
factory equipment  to  produce the  first  two of  700  navigation pods for  LAN- 
TRIN,  which consisted of navigation and targeting pods mounted on tactical 
aircraft and  a  head-up display  in  the cockpit.  The  Air  Force  scheduled  pro- 
duction of the targeting pod for  spring 1986. 
Production of  the  entire  system,  which  would  give  tactical  pilots  a  day/ 
night under weather  navigation and weapondelivery capability,  would cost 
$3.16  b i l l ion  for  the 700 systems  for  use on  F-15EI  F-16,  and A-10  aircraft. 
The  remaining  698  systems  would  come  under  fiscal  year  options  on  the 
contract over  the next eight years. 
The  only  system  of  its  kind,  LANTRIN  had  a  terrain-following  radar  that 
scanned the horizon while keeping the pilot at  a safe  altitude,  even  in  poor 
visibility.  The  navigation  pod  turned  night  into  day  by  distinguishing  the 
difference in  temperature of the terrain below. The result was  a daylight scene 
that  appeared  on  the  head-up  display  mounted  in   front  of  the  pilot.  The 
combination of  infrared  and  radar  allowed  the  p i lo t   to  fly  safely  at  a  few 
hundred feet  above ground. 
The  targeting  pod  also  contained  a  laser  designator  for  delivery  of  laser 
guided  weapons  and  an  automatic  handoff  capability  to  allow  acquisition 
and delivery of Maverick missiles against tactical targets.  (AFSC Newsreview,

May 31:  The  U.S.  Air  Force’s  Aeronautical  Systems  Division’s  4950th  Test 
Wing  unveiled  a  generic  testbed,  the  airborne digital  avionics  test  system 
(ADATS),  for flight testing newly developed aircraft avionics systems,  the Air 
Force System  Command’s  Newsreview  reported. The wing‘s  flight  test  engi- 
neering division developed the test pallet in  a continuing effort to enhance its 
mission capabilities at  reduced costs. 
Air  Force  personnel could easily  load and  unload the  test  pallet from  C- 
141 and C-130  aircraft and would use i t  to flight test aircraft components that 
used a  Mil-Std-1553B  data bus (a format  for  transferring digitized  informa- 
tion to  and from various systems and sensors  in  an aircraft). 
The avionics test system  pallet provided or simulated all electronic signals 
the  test  item  received  from  the  aircraft  in  which  i t  was  designed  to  fly.  To 
accomplish this the  pallet had navigation,  air  data,  and timemeasuring  sys- 
tems.  A  mission  computer  on   the  pallet  controlled  the  test  item  and  the 
ADATS’s  functions.  Flight-test engineers instructed the ADATS through a com- 
puter console during each test. 
Before ADATS,  test w ing  electronic technicians typically  built a dedicated 
test  pallet for each  test  item. With ADATS,  only  software  needed changing. 
Future planned upgrades for ADATS  included a global positioning system  for 
better  navigation  accuracy,  a  radar  altimeter,  and  Doppler  velocity  sensor. 
Other  planned  improvements should  permit  ADATS  to  satisfy  most  digital 
avionics flight-test  requirements through  the year  2005.  (AFSC Newsreview,

/ u / y  8 In an  internal memorandum Assistant Defense Secretary James Wade 
Jr.  asked  the Air  Force why  F-15  and  F-16  fighter jets  were  getting more- 
rather than  less-expensive 
to bu i ld  as  time went on,  the  Washington  Times 
reported. The cost of  an aircraft  normally  decreased over  the years  because 
the high initial costs of design, engineering,  and getting an assembly line into 
operation were  no longer charged. 
The  memo  said  the  price  of  the  F-15-calculated 
in   1970 dollars-rose 
from $5.5  m i l l ion  to $7.4  m i l l ion  a plane in  1985. In current dollars,  an  F-15 
cost  26.3  million.  The  price  of  an  F-16, 
in  1975  dollars,  rose  from  $3.9 
m i l l ion  in  1980 to $4.8 m i l l ion  in  1984.  In current dollars,  the plane cost $14 
million.  McDonnell  Douglas  Corp.  had  been  making  F-15s  since  1970; 
General Dynamics Corp.  started building F-16s  in  1975. 
A  Pentagon  spokesman  said  the  Air  Force  was  working  on  a  response. 
However,  Pentagon documents  provided to  Sen.  Charles  Grassley  (R-Iowa) 
showed  construction  hours  for  both  aircraft  were  well  above  engineering 
predictions. A  single F-15  was  supposed to take 22,978  manhours to build; 
during  the  first  quarter  of  1984,  McDonnell  Douglas  needed  37,193 
manhours to  complete a  plane,  the documents reported. An  F-16  was  s u p  
posed to take 837,300  manhours to  build;  in  the  first quarter of  1984,  Gen-

August  1 :  Under-Secretary of the U.S.  Air  Force E.  C.  Aldridge, Jr. announced 
i n  an  internal information memorandum that the policy of the U.S.  Air  Force 
was  to   “ensure  that  the  unique  capabilities that  can  be  derived  from  the 
presence of military man in  space shall be utilized to the extent feasible and 
practical  to  enhance existing and future missions  in  the  interest of  national 
security objectives.”  The memorandum implied that U.S.  Air  Force would be 
committed to  working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administra- 
tion  i n   i ts   most  recent  manned  space  undertaking  to  deploy  in   orbit  a 
manned, permanent orbiting space station in the early  1990s. Memorandum

August 2Or  Honeywell’s Military Avionics Division would soon begin for the 
McDonnell Aircraft Co.  full-scale development,  costing about $500 million, 
of a tactical electronic warfare  intermediate support system  (TISS) for the  F- 
15  Eagle aircraft program,  Defense Daily reported. The award  to  Honeywell 
was  part of a larger contract the U.S.  Air  Force recently awarded to McDon- 
nell to  upgrade the  F-15  tactical warfare system  (TEWS). 
The  Honeywell  TISS  would  test  the  F-15’s  electronic  warfare  system  to 
minimize downtime,  reduce maintenance costs,  and  improve overall missile 
effectiveness. 
Stanley  Moeschi,  Honeywell  vice  president,  noted  that,  “This  contract 
demonstrates the  maturity  of  Honeywell’s  automatic  test  technology a,nd a 
substantial  advancement in  state-of-the-art digital  and  radio frequency elec- 
tronic warfare testing.”  (D /D ,  Aug 20/85,  1) 

September 5 As  part of  i t s  FY 87 defense budget planning,  the  Department 
of  Defense (DOD) approved a competition  between the  Northrop  F-20  Ti- 
gershark  and  the  General  Dynamics  F-16  Falcon  as  a  fighter  interceptor 
aircraft for the air defense fleet,  Defense Daily reported. However,  DOD had 
not decided how many prototype aircraft it would purchase for the competi- 
tion. 
Although  a  FY  86 defense authorization  bill specified  a competition  be- 
tween the two aircraft,  some members of the U.S.  House wanted to direct the 
Air  Force to  set  a  minimum number of  F-16  and  F-20  fighters that  i t  would 
procure in  FY  86 and then  institute the competition. 
The possibility of a competition  had set off a price war  between Northrup 
and General Dynamics, w i th  General Dynamics proposing a specially confi- 
gured F-16C  to  compete in  cost and effectiveness w i th  the F-20.  (D /D ,  Sept

September  2 6  A  Federal  grand jury  in  St.  Louis subpoenaed 11  McDonnell 
Douglas employees and certain company records as  part of  i t s   investigation 
of  alleged overcharges on  F-15  contracts with  the Air  Force,  Defense  Daily 
reported.  The  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  alleged  that  the  company 
furnished  inaccurate cost and pricing data to justify $28 m i l l ion  in  probable 
inflation in  the cost of manufacturing major pieces of the F-15% equipment. 
McDonnell  spokesman Gerald Meyer  said  the  subpoenas apparently  r e  
lated to  an  investigation of pricing elements in  FY 80  and 81 F-15  contracts, 
although McDonnell did not know the full scope of the  investigation. 
Meyer said McDonnell had “no  reason  to  believe there was  any  unlawful 
conduct”  on i t s  part and that  it would cooperate w i th  the Justice Department 
and other government agencies participating in  the  investigation. He  added 
that  McDonnell  felt  the  serving of  the  subpoenas  “was  inappropriate and 
unnecessary  because  it  was  not  preceded  by  more  ordinary  channels  of 
communications. A l l  they  had to do  was  ask.”  ( D D ,  Sept 26/85,  130) 

NASA and U.S.  Air  Force 

kb rua ry  27: As  a result of White House prodding,  the Air  Force had signed 
an agreement to use NASA’s  Space Shuttle for at least eight flights a year for  10 
years  starting  i n  1988,  and  the Air  Force would  get  a discount when  NASA 
worked out a new pricing policy for the start of  FY 89,  the  Washington Post 
reported. The Air  Force would pay a fixed fee at  the start of each fiscal year, 
then  a  per-flight charge  less  than  commercial  and  other  government  cus- 
tomers would pay. 
Under the agreement,  NASA would drop opposition to an Air Force plan to 
buy 10 single-use unmanned rockets to orbit two satellites a year for five years 
starting  in   1988,  and  NASA  and  the  Department  of  Defense would  work 
together to ensure a fully-operational and cost-effective Space Shuttle. 
NASA  hoped the Space Shuttle would begin to break even  in  1987,  as  the 
agency anticipated making from that time on 24 Space  Shuttle flights yearly 
for 10 years. The new agreement called for the Air Force to use one third of all 
Space Shuttle flights for  the  10 years  starting in  1988. 
The agreement also permitted the Air  Force to pick the single-use rocket it 
would use to  orbit secret satellites too small for economical use of the Space 
Shuttle.  ( W  Post,  Feb 27/85,  A22) 

April  2 6  Assured  access to space  i s  one of the  Defense Department‘s  “bot- 
tom  lines”  in  fulfilling i t s  mission, said Col. Victor Whitehead,  deputy for the 
Air  Force Space Command’s  (AFSC) Expendable Launch Vehicles  (ELV),  “and 
we‘re  quite proud of our  record,”  AFSC‘s  Newsreview reported.  “We’ve  gone 

409 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

three years  in  a row without a launch failure.  In that time we have  launched 
30 totally  successful ELVs. 
“We’ve  learned over the years what makes a successful launch; we don’t  go 
until everything i s  ready.” 
The  Space  Command  was  examining what  might  be  beyond  the  Space 
Shuttle  and  ELVs  for  space  transportation,  considering  both  manned  and 
unmanned  systems  as  a  follow-on.  “But  I don’t  think  you’ll  see  a  future 
scenario in which we w i l l  be dependent on a single system,”  Whitehead said. 
”There  w i l l   be alternative ways  of  flying  payloads. Our  job   i s  to determine 
what they are.” 
The colonel  pointed out that the Space Shuttle was a very good system, but 
that the Air  Force recognized that i f  it stopped using ELVs and was  dependent 
on   the  Space  Shuttle  alone,  “our  access  to  space  would  be  limited  i f   the 
shuttle,  for  some  reason,  i s   not available. We  therefore  found we  needed a 
complementary ELV.” 
Whitehead  noted  the  follow-on  Titan  34D7 would  fu l f i l l   this  alternative 
need. “This  new booster w i l l  g i w  us  into the mid-1990s a totally separate way 
to  launch a payload,”  he said.  “We  determine it should have the same capa- 
bilities  as  the  shuttle  in  terms  of  performance,  payload,  and  volume.  This 
way,  a payload that could  fly on the shuttle can also fly on the Titan  34D7.” 
But i t  was a true complement to the Space shuttle in  that  i t  had “no  common 
modes w i th   shuttle.  We  have  a completely  separate  set  of  contractors  and 
separate  launch facilities for the shuttle and Titan.  If one system  i s  down,  the 
other continues on and flies  those payloads,”  Whitehead concluded.  (AFSC

November 20. NASA announced i t  had scheduled an Air  Force AF-16  satel- 
lite for  launch  December  12  aboard  a  Scout  launch vehicle  from  Wallops 
Flight Center. 
NASA  and  the  Department  of  Defense  entered  into  agreements  in  June 
1962  for  joint  use  of  the  Scout  launch  vehicle.  NASA  and  the  Air  Force 
Systems  Command continued  the  agreement  under a memorandum of  un- 
derstanding  dated  April  19,  1977,  and  amended  May  17,  1983.  Under  the 
agreement,  NASA  maintained the  Scout  launch  vehicle  system,  and  DOD 
used  the system  for appropriate missions. 
The Air  Force had requested NASA to provide Scout launch vehicles for the 
Instrumented Test  Vehicle Program. The Air  Force would  pay  in  accordance 
w i th   the  existing  interagency  agreements  the  costs  associated  with  this 
launch  of  a  Scout  vehicle.  (NASA  MOR  M-490-605-85-01

January  11:  Research  at  LaRC  would  improve  teleoperation  capabilities by 
gradually  increasing the automation  level of  their teleoperation  equipment, 
the  Langley Researcher reported,  as  tests  focused  on the  interface between 
the  human operator  and  the  remotelycontrolled  equipment  using a direct- 
view  station  and a  station  where  the  operator  controlled  the  action  while 
viewing a TV monitor to assess  performance loss as  a result of the TV  link. 
Operators used a Unimation Puma manipulator to  pick up a peg,  depress 
switches w i th   it,  and insert it into a receptacle. In one test,  operators individ- 
ually moved each joint.  In another, operators used resolved-rate control (con- 
trolling all  joints  at  once,  somewhat  like the  human arm)  to  move the  end 
effector  in  attitude and translation  in  its own  axis system. 
Use of the  smaller of  two  pegs  and  resolved-rate control significantly im- 
proved  performance;  however,  there was  no  significant  difference between 
viewing directly  or  through  closedcircuit  TV.  Researchers would  use  these 
results to  assess  future  incremental  improvements  to  the  teleoperator  man/ 
machine interface.  (LaRC Researcher; Jan 11/85,  2 )  

January  16:  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) announced completion of a 
study done by McDonnell Douglas under a 1983 contract that showed unde- 
niable need for both humans and machines in  space.  MSFC was  continuing 
to refine and validate the data. 
In the human role in  space (THURIS) study,  engineers identified 37 generic 
tasks  requiring  human  involvement  ranging  from  removing and  replacing 
protective coverings around spacecraft to surgically acquiring tissue samples. 
The study then established three criteria for allocation of tasks  (performance 
time,  relative cost,  and  technological  risk),  which  became the  basis  for  an 
objective  method to allocate  tasks  and determine how much of each of  the 
generic  tasks  would benefit from human involvement. 

41 1 

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

For  each  task,  researchers  rated man’s  participation from  essential  to  not 
significant.  For  example,  in  a task  entitled “compute  data,”  man’s  role rated 
not significant.  However,  for the task  “surgical  manipulations”,  man’s  partici- 
pation rated essential. 
A  second THURIS  product was  an  analytical  method to define how man 
should participate in  space  systems.  The method objectively  compared hu- 
mans,  machines,  and  systems  requiring  both  humans  and  machines  and 
consisted of  a short,  logical sequence of questions and a set  of  highly  con- 
densed supporting data covering performance times,  relative costs for  each 
madmachine combination,  and  technology  availability data  for  the  3 7  ge- 
neric activities. 
“The  study  provided  a  set  of  fundamental  data  for  planners  that  can  be 
used as  a guide  for  many  future  activities,”  MSFC’s  Stephen Ha l l  said.  “To 
me  . . . machines and automation allow  man  to  proceed to greater  chal- 
lenges and achievements.  .  . The THURIS study found  that  there are  tasks 
for  which  man  i s   best,  and  tasks  for  which  machines  are  best.  For  most 
activities,  a mixture of both i s  the best guarantee of success.”  (MSFC Release

August  2  NASA  announced  that  NASA,  the  Department of  Energy  (DOE), 
and  the  Department of  Defense (DOD) selected  the  reactor  thermoelectric 
power system concept for  further  design,  development,  and ground demon- 
stration testing i n  Phase  II cjf  the SP-100  space  reactor power program. The 
SP-100  program required developing and demonstrating a compact nuclear 
power system  that  would  provide a safe  and  highly  reliable source of  hun- 
dreds of kilowatts of electric power for a broad range of civilian and military 
space applications including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in  the early 
to  mid-1990s and beyond. 
In  the  past,  lower  power  nuclear sources  provided the electric power  for 
several NASA and DOD missions including Transit,  Pioneer,  Apollo,  Viking, 
Voyager,  and  Lincoln  Experimental satellites. The Galileo  and  Ulysses  mis- 
sions would also use nuclear electric power sources. 
The selection of the reactor thermoelectric power system concept followed 
three years  of  Phase  I data collection  and technical  investigation. The three 
agencies considered four reference reactor system concepts employing differ- 
ent  power conversion techniques:  inco re  thermionics and out-ofcore ther- 
moelectrics,  which  were  both  static  energy  conversion  processes,  and 
Stirling and Brayton cycle engines,  which were both dynamic energy conver- 
sion machines. 
Selection criteria included safety;  reliability; the capability of the system to 
meet mission power requirements; the potential for the technology to cover a 
range of  power  requirements up to  1000 kw;  cost,  schedule,  and  program- 
matic  risks;  survivability; and  launch operations. The  three  agencies deter- 
mined  all  of  the  power  system  technologies  were  adequate  under  those 

412  

United States 

criteria;  however,  they  ranked  the  reactor  thermoelectric  power  system  as 
having  the  greatest  potential  to  fulfill  reliably  the  overall  requirements for 
future space  power  needs w i th  minimum performance and schedule risk. 
The next steps  in  the SP-100  program required DOE to prepare the request 
for  proposals and,  pending the availability of funds,  to select  competitively a 
contractor to design,  develop,  fabricate, and test during the period FY  1986- 
1991 the major systems  of the selected concept.  DOE would select shortly a 
site for  the reactor system  program test.  (NASA  Release 85-116)

July  IZ A  Congressional Office of Technology  Assessment  report on space 
cooperation, commissioned by Sens.  Spark Matsunaga (D-Hi.) and Claiborne 
Pel1  (D-R.I.),  said  the  US.  and  USSR  could  conduct  valuable  scientific  ex- 
changes,  but  the  US.  must  handle  any  renewal  of  exchanges  carefully  in  
order to protect national security,  the Washington Times reported. The report, 
the  release of which coincided with the  10th anniversary of the jo in t  Soyuz- 
Apollo docking mission in  space,  said the US. space  program could particu- 
larly benefit from Soviet expertise in  the  life sciences and planetary sciences 
and that cooperation could  lead to  ”substantive  gains”  in  some areas of  U.S. 
space  research  and applications. 
In  1982  the  US.  cut  off  scientific  contact  between  the  two  countries to 
protest the Soviet’s  invasion of Afghanistan,  the declaration of martial  law  in  
Poland, and the ex i le  of Russian human rights activist Andrei Sakharov.  How- 
ever,  Congressional attitudes toward jo in t   U.S.-USSR  ventures  had  changed 
since then. 
The  report  addressed  scientific  and  practical benefits of  cooperation,  the 
potential  for  transferring  sensitive  military  technology  and  know-how,  the 
foreign  policy aspects  of  space  cooperation such  as  reducing tensions,  and 
perceptions  about  Soviet  motivations and  behavior w i th   respect  to  overall 
US.-Soviet  relations. 
Angelo Codevilla,  an  aide to Sen.  Malcolm Wallop  (R-Wy0.1  and an  expert 
on  strategic space  programs,  said  the key  to cooperation with  the Soviets  i s

vehicledmilitary  space planes. The  latter could  provide a two orders of mag- 
nitude reduction  in  the  cost  of  transporting  a pound  of  payload  into orbit. 
Keyworth said he believed  i t  was  possible to develop the  technology for  the 
follow-ons to current commercial jetliners and the Space  Shuttle under one 
R&D  program.  Although  he was  not  certain  i f  one  vehicle  could  f i l l   both 
roles,  he predicted that the vehicles would  be "very  similar." 
Keyworth did not give specifics about funding  requirements or a timetable 
but said that the government should in the course of the coming fall's discus- 
sions of the  FY  8 7  budget focus on  the opportunities available  in the  hyper- 
sonic  area.  Alluding  to  the  British view  that  they  could  build  the  HOTOL 
(Horizontal  Take-Off  and  Landing)  transatmospheric  vehicle  by  1997,  Key- 
worth said  i t  was  possible for the U.S.  to exceed  that goal. He noted that the 
Reagan Administration over  the next few  months would work w i th  the aero- 
space  industry  to  develop  a  program  focusing  on  welldefined  goals  and 
added  that  he  hoped  NASA  and  the  Defense Advanced  Research  Projects 
Agency  would  appropriately  budget funds  to make  the  program  stand  out. 
Keyworth said he was  not talking about tomorrow's  technology in  the hyper- 
sonic area  but technology that  " i s   here" waiting to be assembled. 
At  the  same  hearing,  Rep.  Tom  Lewis  (R-Fla.)  said  the  British claimed that 
the HOTOL would be able to put payloads in  orbit at one-half to one-fifth  the 
cost of the Space Shuttle,  and that they would  capture 7 5%  of the commer- 
cial  launch market by the year  2000 .  Deputy Assistant Commerce Secretary 
Crawford  Brubaker  added  that  Britain had  closed  to  the  outside world  all 
information  about  the  engines being developed  for  HOTOL,  so  "they  think 
they  have  made  a  breakthrough"  on  those  engines.  It was  reported  that  a

February 4  The Office of Science and Technology Policy,  Executive Office of 
the President,  reported that the President's proposed FY 8 6  budget requested 
$ 6 0  b i l l ion  for research and development (R&D), of which $40 b i l l ion  would 
support non-DOD projects and nearly $8  billion,  basic research. 
Although  obligations  for  non-DOD  R&D  would  decrease  slightly  from 
1985 to  1986, reflecting determination to  reduce the  federal  deficit, obliga- 
tions  for  basic  research in  the  physical  sciences and engineering would  in- 
crease  by  7% ,  and  those  for  all  basic  research  would  increase  1% .   Actual 
outlays  during  1986  would  grow  by  5'10,  permitting  some  modest  real 
growth. 
In testimony before the U.S.  House Committee on Science and Technology, 
Dr.  G.A.  Keyworth,  Science Advisor  to  the  President,  said  he  strongly  s u p  
ported the necessity of  slowing the growth of  science and technology fund-

ing  in  the  short term,  but wouldn‘t  hide his concern over  the vitality  of  U.S. 
science over the long run. “Our  real challenges w i l l  come in  fiscal years 1987 
and  1988,  when  we  simply  w i l l   have  to  find  ways  to  ensure our  ability  to 
pursue-and  pursue vigorously-new  avenues of  research.  .  .  . We have to 
be  prepared  to  make  hard  choices  to  fund  new  starts  for  high-priority  re- 
search  facilities  under  whatever  fiscal  scenario  we  face  in   coming  years. 
What w i l l  be at  stake w i l l  be the scientific leadership that we  can’t  afford to 
compromise.”  (Office of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  release  Feb  4/85; 
U.S.  House Comm. on Science and Technology testimony,  Feb  5/85) 

During February:  In  i t s   Federal Scientific and Technical Workers:  Numbers 
and  Characteristics,  1973 and  7983, the  National  Science  Foundation  re- 
ported that  the federal  government was  the  largest single employer of  scien- 
tific and technical personnel in  the U.S. 
Government  employment  of  scientists  grew  by  20%  between  1973  and 
1983,  from  74,000  to  89,000,  although such  employment declined  during 
that period at  NASA and the Department of  Defense. 
The variation by  government agency  in  the  proportion  of  scientists,  engi- 
neers,  and  computer  (SEC) specialists with at  least a bachelor’s  degree was 
not great,  ranging from  95%  at  the  Department of  Transportation  (DOT) to 
99%  at  NASA.  The  proportion  of  NASA  SEC  personnel with  advanced de- 
grees  increased  from  29%  to  36%   between  1973  and  83,  reflecting the 
higher  separation  rates  of  bachelor’s degree  holders and  those without  de- 
grees during the long-term cutbacks in  SEC employees at NASA. The number 
of  SEC  s ta f f  at  NASA declined 8%  between 1973 and 8 3 .  
The  decline  of  1,800  electronics  technicians during the  period  reflected 
primarily a fall  in  total white-collar  employment  levels of  10% at  DOT and 
NASA;  DOT’S electronics technicians went from 8,800  to 7,800,  NASA’s  from 
900 to 600. (NSF 85-312  [final report],  Feb  85) 

l u n e  27: The  National  Science  Foundation (NSF)  in   its  Science Resources 
Studies Highlights  reported that since  1980,  annual  increases i n  federal s u p  
port of  industry-performed research and development, primarily as  a result of 
Department of  Defense funding,  had outpaced growth  in company-financed 
R & D  expenditures. 
In 1983 federal funding of industrial R&D performance amounted to $20.4 
billion,  11%  more than the 1982 level (7%  in constant 1972 dollars), whereas 
industry’s  own   R&D  spending  increased 8%. Federal  and  company  funds 
together  in  1983 were up 9%  to a total of  $62.9  billion. An  NSF  projection 
for  1984 placed total industrial R&D expenditures at $70.5  billion,  12% over 
the  1983 level. 
Companies in  aircrafdmissiles and electrical equipment industries received 
more than  three-fourths of all R&D funds provided by  the government.

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

Industrial firms  spent  $42.5  b i l l ion  of  their  own  funds  on  R&D  in   1983; 
between 1975 and  1980 the average annual constantdollar  rate of growth in  
company  R&D financing was  6.6%,  which slowed to 4 .9k   over  the follow- 
ing 3-year period. 
The  number of full-time-equivalent  (FTE) R&D scientists and engineers  in  
industry rose 3% during 1983 to 538,000.  The electrical equipment industry, 
which  employed  over  one f i f th   of  industrial  R&D  scientists and  engineers, 
showed  the  highest  gain-6%.

July 5 University of Texas  scientists recently held a farewell ceremony at  the 
McDonald Observatory  in  the  mountains of  west  Texas  for  the  Korad  laser 
that  had for  the  past  16  years  measured the distance between the earth and 
the moon to w i th in  four  inches, the  Washington Post  reported. 
The laser,  one of the last experiments s t i l l  in  use from the days of the Apollo 
moon missions, would  have  as  a replacement the McDonald Laser  Ranging 
System,  which would compute the constantly changing distance to the moon 
to w i th in  two inches. However,  the two lasers worked  the same way,  bounc- 
ing a  beam of  laser  light off  a  reflector left on  the moon by  astronauts Neil 
Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz”  Aldrin and measuring its return to the observa- 
tory‘s  107 in. telescope.  ( W  Post,  July 5/85,  A151 

During October:  Despite  a  recent  surge  of  interest among  undergraduate 
students,  many  university aerospace  engineering  departments were  coping 
w i th   faculty  shortages,  uncertain  research  support,  and  inadequate funding 
to operate and maintain their research facilities,  the National Research Coun- 
cil’s  (NRC)  NewsReport  reported.  A  study  prepared  for  NASA  by  an  NRC 
committee  chaired  by  Morris Steinberg,  vice  president for  science  at  Lock- 
heed  Corp.,  said,  “Faculty  positions  today  are  not  especially  attractive  to 
ambitious young aerospace engineers.”  The  number of doctorates awarded 
annually  in  the field dropped by half in  the decade ending with 1983,  indica- 
ting  students were  choosing careers  in   industry  rather  than  academe.  The 
committee concluded  that  NASA,  which depended on  the nation’s  universi- 
ties  for  ideas  and  expertise,  should  take  several  steps  to  help  remedy  the 
problem. 

NASA  should  bolster  i t s  support of campus  research efforts that addressed 
“long-term  fundamental  problems whose solutions are  likely to  have  lasting 
impact,”  the  committee  said.  NASA  also  should  institute  a  system  of  peer 
review of  research  proposals,  establish Ph.D.  fellowships in  aerospace  engi- 
neering, and coordinate i t s  efforts to support university research and teaching 
in  the field.  (NRC NewsReport, Oa 85,  17)

U.S.  Space Policy 
During January: The U.S.  government released an  unclassified version of the 
National  Space  Strategy  based  on  the  National  Space  Policy  President 
Reagan unveiled on July 4, 1982, and on his 1984 State of the Union Address, 
Space  World  reported. The  strategy  identified selected  high-priority efforts 
and responsibilities and provided for  implementation plans for major space- 
policy objectives. 
The document gave  new  impetus for  future manned military-space opera- 
tions,  underscored Administration support for the space station program and 
establishment of future civilian-space goals,  encouraged space commerciali- 
zation,  ordered a jo in t   NASNDepartment of  Defense (DOD) study of post- 
1995 launch  vehicles,  and  called  for  full  Space  Shuttle  cost  recovery  by 
October  1,  1988. 
Gilbert Rye, director  of space  programs for  the  National Security Council 
(NSC), said of the strategy: “To  our knowledge this  i s  the first document of  i t s  
k ind  to  lay  out in  any  coherent manner a  l i s t  of priorities that cover the total 
U.S.  space  program.  It should be useful for  the Congress,  the private sector, 
executive branch agencies,  and the American people to fully understand the 
main thrust of  the US. space program in  the years to  come.” 
The strategy authorized DOD to procure a limited number of expendable 
launch vehicles to  complement the Space Shuttie,  but did not specify partic- 
ular  civilian space  program  goals.  A  Presidential  National  Commission  on 
Space  during  1985 was  to   identify goals,  opportunities,  and policy options 
for the  U .S .   c iv i l  space sector for the next 2 0  years.  (Space  World, Jan 85, 8) 

April  76:  USA  T i a y  reported that  i t s  debate for  that day  would  explore the 
pros  and  cons  of  U.S.  manned  space  missions.  In  i t s   editorial,  USA   T i a y  
said,  ”Human  brains can adapt  to change. Machines cannot. Without men 
and women  i n  space,  there  would  be  no one  to  even  try  to  f ix   the  Navy’s 
stranded satellite”  [Navy communications satellite carried on the  Discovery 
51-D mission].  ’ I .   .  . Space  i s  our  last frontier.  Without humans aboard to 
ride  rockets to  the  stars  and  beyond,  man w i l l   never  embrace what  he has 
envisioned,”  the editorial concluded. 
USA  Today  guest  columnist  Geoffrey  Keller,  a  professor  of  astronomy  at 
Oh io   State  University,  wrote  that  one  of  the  values  of  the  manned  space 
program was  that it would help to lengthen the useful life of expensive space 
telescopes (for example,  the  Hubble Space  Telescope),  by  permitting  astre 
nauts  to  replace  worn-out  telescope  parts  and  to  make  telescopes  more 
powerful  as new and more efficient cameras were  invented and  installed. 
In  an opposing view,  James Van  Allen,  a professor of physics at  the Univer- 
sity of  Iowa, wrote that  nearly all of what  he considered the  really important 
and  durable  products  of  space  technology  were  “achieved  by  much-less- 
expensive  unmanned  spacecraft,  operating  automatically  and  under  com- 

4 1 7  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

mand control  from ground stations,  often for many years  in  earth orbit or  in  
the far  reaches of the solar  system. 
”.  . . The  public  acclaim  for  the  Apollo  program  has  left a  permanent 
imprint on NASA and has,  in  effect,  committed  i t  to an  overriding emphasis 
on further development of manned space flight,”  Van  Allen  continued. “This 
emphasis  i s   simultaneously  NASA‘s  greatest  strength  and  its  greatest weak- 
ness.  Manned  space  flight,  w i th   all  its  mythological  foundations,  has  as- 
sumed  the  aura  of  a  religion.  The  space  shuttle  and  the  proposed 
permanently manned space  station are  primarily  embodiments of  this  reli- 
gion,”  he wrote. But,  he added, ”the  relevant results to date are far too meager 
to   justify  such  hyperbolic  expectations  and  such  enormous  expenditures. 
Meanwhile,  the proven applications of space technology are  languishing for 
lack of  resources.”  (USA  T i a ~  Apr  16/85,  8A) 

l u l y   26:  A  new  study  issued  by  the  Congressional  Office  of  Technology 
Assessment  (OTA)  said  competition  from  other  nations  and  several  private 
companies in  launching spacecraft put the U.S.  under pressure to protect i t s  
economic  and  technological  leadership  in   space,  the  N Y  Times  reported. 
This  protection  could  be  accomplished  by  reassessing  the  Space  Shuttle’s 
pricing policy,  promoting  greater  private  investment in space-related goods 
and  services,  and  forging  a  long-term  space  policy to  assure  a competitive 
edge,  report recommended. 
The European Space Agency,  a consortium of  11  western European govern- 
ments,  broke  the  U.S.  monopoly  in   launch  services  for  the  West  w i th   its 
Ariane  rocket  program.  Arianespace,  a  corporation  owned  by  the  French 
government and European banks and aerospace companies, was aggressively 
pursuing customers for  Ariane’s  services and had won  several  contracts that 
would otherwise have gone to US. conventional rockets or the Space Shuttle. 
France was  planning  later  in  the  year  to  use  the  Ariane  to  inaugurate the 
world’s  first  commercial  remotesensing  satellite  service,  competing  w i th  
U.S.  Landsats  that  surveyed  the world’s  geologic,  water,  and  agricultural r e  
sources. 
China announced  the  previous month  a new  commercial space  program 
using its own  satellites,  launching rockets, and ground stations. The Chinese 
had  rockets  capable  of  boosting  satellites  into  the  high  orbit  needed  for 
communications satellites. 
Japan, emphasizing the export potential of space technology, was develop 
ing  its own  rocket launching capability and was  planning to  launch the next 
year  the first of a series of ocean and  land remote-sensing satellites. 
India also had joined the nations launching satellites, and Brazil was build- 
ing a  rocket  base  with  the  intention  of  becoming the  first  South  American 
launching power. 
Although  the USSR  was apparently tempted to enter the commercial mar- 
ket, western space experts questioned whether the Russians would  ever  be a 

418 

United  States 

major  force  in  commercial space  operations. They  said  the  USSR  might  be 
reluctant to allow outside scientists and businessmen access to  their facilities 
and other governments would probably not allow advanced communications 
satellites to be exported to  the Soviet Union. 
In  i t s   report,  the  OTA  sa id   that  other  nations developed their  own  space 
launching capabilities out of a desire to  be technologically  independent, to 
gain  any  economic  benefits that  derived  from  space  technology,  and  to  be 
regarded  as  “space  powers.”  Consequently,  the  report  concluded  that  the 
U.S.’s  “competitive  strategy based on price or superior technology alone w i l l  
not prevent foreign entry  into the  launch service business.” 
At stake,  besides prestige,  was  a share  of what  by the end of  the  century 
could  be  a  $50   b i l l ion   annual  business,  according to   estimates  by some 
economists i n  the aerospace field. 
The  report  recommended that  the  U.S.  government investigate new  trade 
and  regulatory  policies to  reduce  the  risks and  uncertainties that  hindered 
private  investment in  space technology.  The study concluded that  NASA  by 
itself was  “not  wellequipped either to promote or to  regulate growth  in  the 
commercial  exploitation  of  space.”  The  report  suggested  the  regulation of 
“space  industries”  should be  integrated with the regulation of their counter- 
parts on earth.  (NYT  July 26/85,  A l )  

September 6 :  NASA  and the  U.S.  Air  Force announced award of  $5   m i l l ion  
26-month  contracts  to  Boeing  Aerospace  Co.,  General  Dynamics,  Martin 
Marietta,  and  Rockwell  Internatl.  to perform studies on  space transportation 
architecture-the 
total  transportation  system  of  flight  elements,  ground and 
orbital support  systems,  and their operational  interactions.  NAWs  Marshall 
Space  Flight Center  (MSFC) awarded  and  would  manage  the  General  Dy- 
namics and  Martin Marietta contracts;  the Air  Force  Space  Division  in  Los 
Angeles,  the  Boeing  and  Rockwell  contracts.  The  two  agencies  and  four 
companies would maintain close coordination throughout the award period. 
Broad objectives of the studies were to determine the nation‘s overall space 
transportation system architectures,  including transportation and support sys- 
tems needed to simultaneously meet mission and operational requirements, 
wh i le  substantially reducing total life-cycle cost;  to identify the technologies 
required for  the architectures;  and to  refine the  resulting transportation  and 
support system concept($ for the mid-1990s i f  firm requirements were identi- 
fied. 
After  the agencies first analyzed and provided projected mission/payload/ 
operational  requirements for  the  mid-1990s to  2010,  the  companies would 
analyze mission requirements, develop and analyze architecture approaches, 
define future transportation system concepts, and identify technologies appli- 
cable to transportation system  options. 
Transportation  system  architectures and  concepts  would  include  launch 
and  upper-stage  flight  systems,  mission  control  concepts,  ground  support 

419  

Astronautics and  Aeronautics,  1985 

systems,  logistics support systems,  and on-orbit operations for  both manned 
and unmanned systems. The resulting transportation architecture and vehicle 
concepts  should  outline  and  define  the  most  promising  concepts  for  im- 
proved cost-effectiveness and mission need accommodation for the specified 
period.  (NASA Release 85-126) 

November  72: NASA announced that i t s  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) 
issued a  request for  proposals to  LTV,  Martin Marietta, and TRW  to compete 
for  a contract to  design,  dewlop,  and  manufacture an  orbital  maneuvering 
vehicle (OMV). The  three companies worked  previously on OMV definition 
studies  and  had  until  December  20, 1985,  to  respond.  NASA  expected  to 
award the  contract  in  June 1986 and  planned the  first  OMV flight for  early 
1991. 
The contract would  include provisions for  testing and hardware flight test- 
ing  before  the  OMV’s  actual  operational  missions.  The  company  selected 
would bu i ld  one  vehicle,  w i th   NASA  having an  option to  request construc- 
t ion  of a second. 
Often  called  a  “space  tug,”  the  OMV  would  transfer  satellites and  other 
objects between earth orbits and would extend the reach of the Space Shuttle 
by about  1000 miles.  It would have the ability to retrieve satellites from  high 
orbits,  bring them back to the Space Shuttle for maintenance and repair, then 
return  them  to  their  operational  orbits.  The  OMV   would  also  be  able  to 
reboost s2tellites as  their orbits gradually decayed. 
The  OMV   would  be  an  unmanned  spacecraft,  15  feet  in  diameter  and 
approximately 4 feet  long. Its life would be about 10 years w i th  refurbishment 
and on-orbit maintenance included in  the design. NASA expected initially to 
deploy the OMV  from the Space  Shuttle for short duration missions;  later the 
OMV   would  remain  in   orbit  for  extended  periods  for  use  in   both  Space 
Shuttle-based and  space  station-based modes  of  operation.  (NASA  Release 
85-151) 

Civilian Programs 

May  13 The  National  Space  Institute  (NSI)  announced  establishment  of 
“Space  Outreach ‘85,”  a program to acquire original  ideas from the public as 
to potential uses of space  for social and economic benefit. The program was 
intended to broaden what appeared to be a too narrow debate on a new and 
clarified set  of  long-term civilian space  goals. 
Rules for the program were that ideas could not exceed 750 words;  s u bm i i  
sions could not include projects already under review by the federal govern- 
ment;  and proposals must be creative,  innovative,  and feasible. 
The  NSI would present a l l  ideas received during the program to Congress, 
NASA,  and,  in  particular, the newly created  National Commission on Space 
[see Mar.  301.

Judges for the program, which had the support of the Sophron  Foundation 
of McLean,  Virginia,  were Walter  Boyne,  director of the Smithsonian  Institu- 
tion’s  National Air and Space Museum;  Evert Clark,  technology editor,  Rusk 
ness  W k  former  astronaut Michael  Collins;  and  Robert  Cowen,  science

August  9 World amateur  radio operators participated in the shuttle amateur 
radio  experiment  (SAREX) on  Space  Shuttle mission  51-F, 
the  lewis  News 
reported. SAREX  a l l o w d  people connected with amateur  radio to  talk with 
Challenger‘s  crew and watch TV  transmissions from  the flight deck. 
The  SAREX  test,  conducted during o f fdu ty   hours  in  cooperation w i th  on- 
board mission specialistsham operators Tony  England and John-David Bartoe 
and  mission  commander  Gordon  Fullerton,  allowed  world  amateur  radio 
operators access to the Space Shuttle’s  voice and video transmissions to earth 
on amateur  2-m  band.  A video  buffer circuit designed,  built,  and  tested  by 
Lewis  Research Center (LeRC) ham operators was  key  to SAREX’s  success. 
The SAREX system worked  in  two primary modes,  one mode at a time. The 
first allowed voice communications back and  forth between  radio operators 
on the ground and spacecraft crew. 
The  second  primary  mode was  amateur TV.  Using a  set-up similar  to  the 
ham  radio system,  amateur  TV  operators and  the  Space  Shuttle crew  sent 
first such  use  of  two-way  video  in  space.  Users 
images to one another-the 
transmitted color TV pictures in a slow-scan-mode-one picture every 8 to 36 
seconds. 
SAREX,  closely  connected  to  the  Young  Astronaut  Program,  was  a  joint 
effort of the American Relay League and NASA. A ham radio experiment with 
mission specialist Owen Garriot conducted  in  1983 on STS-9  was  generally 
credited as  the genesis  for  the current SAREX.  (Lewis News, Aug 9/85,  1) 

October  2 2  In  its  recently  published  “1986  Long-Range  Program  Plan:’ 
NASA outlined plans for an  evolutionary,  permanently manned space station 
in   low-earth orbit;  operation  by  the  year  2000  of  man-tended  platforms  in 
equatorial,  polar,  and  geosynchronous orbit;  and  routine manned missions 
on the  moon  and  later  Mars  by the  early  21st  century,  Defense  Daily  r e  
ported. The  annually  updated  plan,  summarizing the  status  of  NASA  plan- 
ning as  of  the  end  of  February  1985,  also  detailed  some  120 ongoing and 
planned  NASA  space  projects  and  missions for  approximately  the  next  ten 
years,  w i th  some out to the year  2000. 
The  plan did  not  discuss  budget  figures,  but  for  the  near-term assumed 
budgets w i th  the  1% growth  promised annually by  President Reagan  (which 
had since disappeared in  the deficit battle in  Congress).

The  report did not project a need for more than four Space Shuttle orbiters 
but did not rule out such a need, while calling for development by 1990 of  an 
orbital maneuvering vehicle (OMW. 
Beyond 1990,  objectives of the NASA spaceflight program included devel- 
oping an  orbital  transfer  vehicle  complementary  to  the  Space  Shuttle  for 
transportation  of  payloads,  to,  between,  and  beyond  earth  orbits;  defining, 
designing,  and  providing  a  second-generation  space  transportation  system 
including unmanned cargo  vehicles and  second-generation orbiters;  devel- 
oping and operating on a  routine basis,  beginning in  the mid-l990s,  geosyn- 
chronous orbit space  platforms that were  unmanned,  permanent,  and multi- 
functional;  developing and  putting  into  routine operation by  the  year  2000  
geosynchronous orbit facilities that were permanent, multifunction, and able 
to  be  periodically manned;  developing technology and  techniques to  con- 
struct,  deploy,  or  assemble  such  facilities  in   space  and  to  test  and  service 
them  in  orbit;  and encouraging and  supporting NASA and  industry develop 
ment of technology to  improve concepts for space  boosters that significantly 
reduced launch costs. 
The  NASA  report  noted  that  “achievements  in   the  early  21st  century  in  
science, exploration, earth applications, and commercial uses would depend 
on two trends: first,  the increasing capabilities of space systems w i th  regard to 
accessibility,  payloads,  stay  times,  and  variety  and  sophistication of  opera- 
tions;  and  second,  the  increasing capability of  instruments with  regard  to 
detection,  resolution,  pointing accuracy,  and  data  collection  and  manage 
ment  made  possible  by  improvement of  their  power  supplies  and  cooling 
mechanisms.” 
In the  21 st  century,  the  NASA  report  said,  “automated  or  human-tended 
instruments located on the  lunar surface w i l l  begin complementary observa- 
tions”  w i th   instruments  in   lowearth  orbit  and  geosynchronous  orbit.  For 
manned  transportation from  the  space  station,  “a  cyrogenic  version  of  the 
orbital transfer vehicle evolutionary family, currently in  early stages of prelim- 
inary design,  i s  expected to provide by the year  2000 reusability for manned 
and  sortie  flights  to  at  least  geosynchronous orbit  . . .  It also  should  be 
able  to  provide  the  basis  for  transportation  for  longer  flights  to  establish  a 
lunar  base  and  for  planetary  missions  such  as  a  Mars  sample  return  . . . 
Routine  access  to  the  lunar  surface w i l l   make  possible  the  first  intensive, 
systematic study  of another major celestial body,”  the  report noted.  “Exten- 
sive  sample  collection  and  scientific  traverses  conducted  by  humans  and 
long-term  instrument networks  installed and managed  by  humans w i l l   help 
determine the details of the moon’s  structure,  composition, and history. They 
also w i l l  make accessible the  record of  solar  and  cosmic  ray  particle fluxes

November 29 NASA’s  Jet Propulsion Laboratory UPL) pioneered the concept 
of  a  satellite system  for  mobile  users  and,  because a  U .S .   mobile  satellite 
industry was  emerging, was  turning i t s  attention to developing technologies 
critical for future systems,  the JPL  Universe reported. 
Similar  to  cellular  phones  popular  in   urban  areas,  the  mobile  satellite 
system  (MSS) would  provide voice  and data  communications for  the entire 
North American  continent,  employing one or  two  satellites  in  geosynchro- 
nous orbit to  relay communications instead of depending on ground-based, 
line-of-sight  relay towers that celluar phones used. 
There  were  four  categories  of  MSS  users:  people  who  needed  uninter- 
rupted communications wh i le  they traveled over wide geographical areas,  for 
example interstate truckers;  those responding to unpredictable events such as 
medical  emergencies  or  natural  disasters;  people working  at  planned  but 
temporary installations such as  o i l  or gas dr i l l ing  facilities,  mining camps,  or 
archeological excavations;  and those  in  very  remote areas. 
The new technologies JPL was developing included mechanically steerable 
low-profile  and electronically  steerable medium-gain vehicle antennas,  digi- 
tal speech compression, digital modems,  and multiple-access techniques for 
integrated voice and data. 
NASA was working w i th  industry and,  through a joint endeavor agreement, 
would exchange a Space Shuttle deployment for  15% of the channel capacity 
for two years to test the system. “But  first:’  said Dr. Firouz Naderi, JPL‘s  mobile 
satellite experiment project manager,  “we  must further  develop the technol- 
ogy  and  try  to   squeeze  as  many  channels  as  we  can  from  a  very  narrow 
frequency allocation. That  i s  the biggest obstacle we  face.” 
Also,  JPL must design sophisticated multi-beam antennas that service “spot 
areas”  and create techniques so  frequencies could  be reused to  provide the 
most efficient use of the  limited spectrum. 
Recently  JPL  sponsored  a  two-day  briefing on  the  state  of  the  industry. 
Attending were more than 250  representatives of 120 organizations including 
the  Federal  Communications Commission (FCC), which would  regulate the 
MSS;  11  of  12  candidate companies that  petitioned  the  FCC  for  the  right to 
operate the system;  communications equipment manufacturers such as  Gen- 
eral Electric, Harris, and Motorola; Canadian government and industry repre  
sentatives; banking officials;  and potential users of the system. At the briefing, 
the  FCC  said  it hoped by  the  middle of  1986  to  assign  a frequency  to  the 
mobile satellite industry as  well as  license an operator to be in  charge of the 
system. 
NASA scheduled for  launch in  1990 the first generation satellite with a 5 to  
7 m antenna. During the program’s  second phase,  NASA would  launch from 
the  Space  Shuttle a 20m  (65  ft.)  antenna.  NASA  then  planned  for  the  pro- 
gram’s  final phase to construct on the proposed space  station a  50m (180 ft.) 
antenna  for deployment  into geosynchronous orbit.  UPL  Universe, Nov 29/

During Nowmber: Quoting  from the  Congressional Record,  NASA  reported 
remarks  of  Rep.  Don  Fuqua,  (D-Fla.)  chairman  of  the  House  Science  and 
Technology Committee, who introduced the Federal Science and Technology 
Revitalization Act  of  1985. 
The act  “.  . . would establish an  alternative personnel management sys- 
tem  for  scientific  and  technical  people  in  the  federal  government,”  Fuqua 
said.  “This  i s  something  I have been  interested  in  for  a long time,  and  I am 
hopeful that the proposal I am  introducing w i l l  be able to help  improve the 
quality of  government-operated federai  laboratories by  encouraging the  re- 
cruiting  and  retention  of  highly  qualified  scientific  and  technical  individ- 
uals.” 
Major provisions of the bill would permit agencies to  include scientific and 
technical personnel in  the new personnel management systems;  simplify job  
evaluation and remove covered positions from the classification requirements 
of  5 U.S.C.,  Chapter  51;  provide flexibility  to develop a salary structure that 
ensured  a  competitive  position  in   the  labor  market and  that  reflected  the 
hiring and pay policies needed to attract,  retain,  and motivate a highly quali- 
fied  scientific and technical work  force;  increase base  pay on performance, 
not longevity;  allow waiver of the pay cap for  up to  5% of specially qualified 
scientific  and  technical  personnel;  provide  for  performance  and  special 
awards  and  remove the  pay  cap  for  lumpsum  awards;  and  create a  senior 
scientific and technical personnel service. 
In  May  1983  the  Federal  Laboratory  Review  Panel  of  the  White  House 
Science Council  chaired by David Packard reported that federal  laboratories 
had several serious deficiencies and,  consequently, a number of them did not 
meet the quality and  productivity  standards  that  might  be expected,  Fuqua 
explained.  The panel  reported that salaries at  federal  laboratories were  non- 
competitive w i th  the private sector at entry and senior  l e v e l s  and that federal 
laboratories had to  deal with a personnel management system that was cum- 
bersome and had little flexibility. 
As  a result, there existed what the panel referred to  as  an alarming “inabil- 
i ty   of  many  federal  laboratories-especially  those  under  c iv i l   service  con- 
straints-to  attract,  retain,  and motivate qualified  scientists and engineers.” 

The  panel  concluded  that  administrative  and  legislative actions  should  be 
initiated to create, at government-operated laboratories, a scientific-technical 
personnel  system  that  was  independent of  current  c iv i l   service  personnel 
systems,  Fuqua continued. 
This  “bill  i s  the  legislative attempt to deal with  these very  real problems,” 
Fuqua said.  ”My  own  experience  .  .  .  i s  that  the  requirements  for  NASA 
and Department of Agriculture labs may be very different,  but attracting and 
retaining quality  personnel i s  absolutely essential for the space program and 
for emerging fields i n  agriculture.”  ( N A U  Activities,  Nov 85,  9)

lanuary 9 NASA Administrator James Beggs,  in  a January 9 speech  in  Wash- 
ington at  the Conference on  International Business  in  Space,  predicted that 
early  in  the 21  s t  century there would be a permanently manned base on the 
moon to serve a  lunar mining industry and as a way-station to other points in  
the solar system. 
He called  space  the endless frontier  and outlined  the  unique attributes it 
offers:  first,  a vantage  point for communications and earth observations and, 
from  telescopes beyond the atmosphere,  an  improved view  of the universe; 
second,  a  zero  gravity  environment,  which  offers  unusual  manufacturing 
opportunities;  and  third,  a near-perfect vacuum,  which also  offers new  o p  
tions for  industrial processes. 
He noted that the communications-satellite business was  one of the fastest 
growing industries  in  the world,  w i th  an  estimated market of more than  $3  
b i l l ion  a year  in  sales potential through the year  2000,  but that the other two 
unique  attributes  of  space  were  under-used.  To  remedy  this,  he  reported 
three  major  NASA  initiatives:  new  high-technology ventures,  new  commer- 
cial  applications  of  existing  technology,  and  unsubsidized  initiatives  that 
would transfer  existing space assets on earth to private hands i f  they could be 
operated for  profit. 
Beggs  concluded  that  expanding  commerce  in  space  would  be  difficult, 
but not impossible,  in  order  ‘ I .   . . to transform the promise of space  into a 
brighter tomorrow  for  a l l  mankind.”  (NASA Release 85-1) 

/anuary  7 7 :   John Townsend,  corporate vice  president and  president of  Fair- 
child  Space  Co.,  said  in   a  January 16  speech  to  the  American  Institute of 
Aeronautics  and  Astronautics’  (AIAA)  National  Capital  Section  that  those 
planning commercial space ventures must monitor the uncertainty of NASA‘s 
Space  Shuttle  manifest  and  orbiter  fleet‘s  long-term  availability,  Aerospace 
Daily reported.  “The  manifest  i s  at  risk,”  he said  and cited difficulties NASA 
had in  “remanifesting”  resulting from the orbiter Challenger‘s thermal-protec- 
tion  tileadhesion problems.  NASA  had cut  back  i t s   planned  13  missions to 
12  in  1985, and Townsend expressed concern over  the potential problems of 
a 4-orbiter fleet that could be exacerbated by an  accident. 
Townsend  also  expressed  concern  over  the  Space  Shuttle  pricing policy, 
noting NASA’s  recommendation  of  a  22%  price  increase  in   Space  Shuttle 
flights from $71 m i l l ion  (1982 dollars) per flight to $87  million, and conclud- 
ing that NASA‘s “expendable  launch vehicle people haw Ariane to face.”  (A/

lanuary  2 5  The  Celestis  Group,  an  organization  of  Florida  undertakers, 
signed a contract w i th  Space  Services,  Inc.,  headed by Donald Slayton,  one 
of the original seven U.S.  astronauts and based  in  Houston, to orbit a payload 

425 

Astronautics  and Aeronautics,  1985 

of cremated human remains at  1,900  miles high,  the N Y  Times reported. The 
mission, scheduled for  late 1986 or early 1987, would cost about $15 million. 
The  Department of Transportation (DOT), which must approve the contract, 
indicated i t  had no immediate objections. 
In 1982 Space Services had become the first private company to launch i t s  
own   rocket,  the  36-foot  Conestoga,  into  suborbital  flight.  The  company’s 
original  liquid-fuel rocket had exploded on the  launching pad a year  before. 
The space-burial mission would use a second-generation Conestoga capable 
of  putting 1,500  Ib.  into orbit. 
John Cherry,  who  had  formed  the  Celestis Group,  said  that  a Conestoga 
nose cone could contain as  many as  13,000  capsules,  each 318  inches by  1/4 
inches,  holding ashes  reduced in volume by a Celestisdeveloped technique. 
Burial price would  be $3,900  a customer. A  reflective material would cover 
the  nose cone  in  the  first  launch,  enabling viewing of  the  satellite  mause 
leum as  i t  passed overhead.  Later missions would be deepspace burials,  in  
which the nose cone would eject the capsules for dispersion into the cosmos. 
The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 empowered the DOT to license 
all commercial space launchings. DOT examined proposals for their effect on 
public safety,  national security,  and international treaty obligations.  ( N q  Jan 
25/85,  A13) 

February 73: The U .S .  Department of Transportation (DOT) approved plans of 
a  Florida-based  undertakers and  engineers’  consortium  to  orbit  in   1986 or 
early  1987 a mausoleum [see  US. Space Policy/Commercialization, Jan. 251 
w i th  the announcement that the plan represented “a  creative response to  the 
president‘s  initiative to encourage the  commercial use of  space,”  the  Wash- 
ington  Post reported. The  approval was  the  first  granted by  the  DOT’S new 
licensing authority for commercial space activities and followed  checks w i th  
the Department of Defense,  the State  Department, and NASA. The mausole- 
um’s  1,900  mile-high orbit would  place the spacecraft in  the Van  Allen  radia- 
tion belts,  a region of space  rarely used by other spacecraft. 
The  mausoleum  would  be  in   the  nose  cone  of  a  rocket,  Conestoga  2, 
designed and  bu i l t   by  Space  Service  Inc.  (SSI),  a  Houston firm  headed  by 
Donald Slayton, one of the original Project Mercury astronauts. Conestoga 1, 
a one-stage  rocket,  had  made a successful  test  flight  i n   1982.  The Celestis 
Group,  Melbourne,  Florida,  would  pay  SS I   $14  m i l l ion   to  put  the  300  Ib. 
cargo  into orbit and charge $3,900  per cremated body. 
A Celestis spokesman said that since announcement of  i t s  plans,  the group 
had received hundreds of calls from  people wanting to sign up.  Slayton said 
seven or eight other companies had approached him about setting up similar 
businesses.  ( W Post,  Feb  13/85,  A2)

dinner  lecture  series,  disparaged  government  attempts  to  commercialize 
space,  the Space Commerce Bulletin reported. “Now  that  I’m  out of govern- 
ment,  I  can say  that  I found nothing funnier than  bureaucrats wringing  their 
hands  in  town around  here about  how to  commercialize something where 
most of them,  myself  included, don’t  have the slightest  idea on  how to make 
investments,  how  to  judge  markets,  how  to  do  all  those  things  that  are 
important for  commercialization,” Mark said. 
He characterized commercial space efforts as  being politically popular but 
backed w i th   little substance,  w i th   much  of  his  criticism directed at  private 
sector remote sensing and expendable launch vehicle operations.  He said he 
didn’t  believe either technology would be a commercial  success  in  the US., 
and  he predicted private Space Shuttle operation would never work. 
Mark considered true commercial space activity to be technology transfer 
programs and  government-industry relations as  set  up in  the  1950s to  build 
hardware  for  government  programs.  He  added,  however,  that  government 
couldn‘t  take credit for technology transfer as being space commercialization 
because that was  not what  “intellectuals  think commercialization means and 
we need to do other things. So  we  need to hire 50  people in  NASA  headquar- 
ters  to do commercialization.” 
Regarding the  impact of the Strategic  Defense Initiative (SDI) on commer- 
cial space,  Mark said,  ”There’s  no doubt  in my  mind that  important commer- 
cial  ventures  w i l l   follow  from  SDI  simply  because  of  the  nature  of  the 
contractor  systems  that we  use.  We  w i l l  build  high-intensity  lasers and  the 
first  commercial  application of  those  lasers w i l l   surely  be  in  welding or  in 
something  like that  . . . That’s  what  I like to call the commercialization of 
space,”  Mark concluded.  (Space Commerce Bulletin,  Apr  26185, 1 )  

l u n e  28: NASA  Administrator James Beggs announced that 21  teams submit- 
ted proposals to establish centers  for  the commercial development of space, 
the objective of which would be to stimulate high-technology research  in  the 
microgravity  environment  of  space.  NASA  expected  this  research  to  lead 
eventually  to development of  new  products that  either had  commercial  po- 
tential or would contribute to possible commercial ventures. 
The  research  areas  proposed by the teams  included semiconductor crystal 
growth,  remote sensing,  communications technology,  and biotechnology. 
A  panel of technical,  managerial, and financial experts would review over 
the  next  45 to  60 days  the  proposals to  identify winning  proposals.  NASA 
would fund,  beginning around mid-September 1985, between  three and  s ix  
of  the centers  for  up to  $1 m i l l ion  per year  each  for  a period not to exceed 
five years.  (NASA Release 85-98) 

ju ly   17:  NASA  and  the  National Bureau of  Standards  (NBS)  announced  the 
first  sales  of  a  product  manufactured  in  space-tiny  polystyrene spheres  to

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

serve as  NBS standard  reference material. The spheres  could  improve micro- 
scopic  measurements made  throughout  the  economy  in  electror?ics, medi- 
cine,  and other high-technology areas. 
A  chemical  process developed  for  NASA  by  Lehigh  University produced 
billions  of  the  10  micrometers  (1/2500th  of  an  inch)  in   diameter  spheres 
during several  space  Shuttle flights.  Earthbound  processes  could  not  yield 
sufficiently uniform materia!s in  usable quantities; when  produced in  a  low- 
gravity environment, the spheres grew  uniformly  in  size and shape. 
NBS had packaged the spheres  into approximately 600 Standard Reference 
Material (SRM) units priced at $384 per unit. Each unit was  a 5-milliliter vial 
that contained about 30 m i l l ion  spheres  in  a 0.4%  concentration by weight; 
the  remainder  was  water.  NASA  and  NBS   shared  sales  proceeds  equally.

August 20:  NASA announced  i t  had signed an  agreement w i th  Space  Indus- 
tries,  Inc.  (S I I)   for  the company  to construct and operate an  industrial space 
facility  (ISF),  the  first  habitable  privately  owned  commercial  platform  in  
space,  which  NASA  would deploy from  the Space  Shuttle.  SI1  also  signed a 
separate  agreement w i th   NASA’s  space  station office that would  provide for 
exchange of  information during the definition and preliminary design phase 
of  the  space  station.  The  agreement  laid  the  groundwork  for  subsequent 
discussions and negotiations during the space station development period to 
begin in  mid-1987. SI1 was  the first private company to sign an agreement w i th  
NASA’s  space station office to  share  information that could result  in a  com- 
mercial facility capable of compatible operations w i th  the space  station. 
The  modular  ISF   would  initially  measure  35   by  14.5  feet.  Although  not 
intended  to  be  permanently  manned,  i t  would  be  habitable and  provide a 
shirt  s leeve   work  environment  for  astronauts when  docked  with  either  the 
Space  Shuttle or space station. 
NASA Administrator James Beggs said,  “We  hope the ISF  w i l l  be the first of 
many  such  platforms  to  be  funded  and  bu i l t   by  private  industry  that  w i l l  
complement the  permanently  manned space  station and  lead eventually to 
an  industrial park  in  space.” 
M a x  Faget,  president of SII,  said,  “The  facility i s  scheduled to be deployed 
in  1989 and w i l l   respond to a variety  of  private research  and manufacturing 
needs.  Industry could take advantage of the unique gravity-free environment 
of  space to  conduct experiments that  cannot  be effectively duplicated  here 
on earth.” 
SI1  considered  the  cost  of  building the  I S F   to  be  proprietary.  Under  the 
novel agreement, a provision stipulated that SI1 would reimburse NASA for a l l  
costs  incurred by  the government associated w i th  the deployment of the  ISF  
when it became operational and was  revenue generating. (NASA Release 85-

August  22:  NASA  announced selection of teams  to establish Centers for  the 
Commercial Development of Space. The Centers were  intended to stimulate 
high-technology research  that  took  advantage  of  the characteristics of space 
to  develop  new  products w i th   commercial  potential. The  five  centers were 
jo in t   undertakings of  government,  industry,  and academic teams and would 
work  closely w i th  NASA  field centers. 
NASA  initially would fund the centers for a period not to exceed five years, 
at  which  time  they  should  be  self-sustaining.  Funding would  range  from 
$750,000  to  $1.1 m i l l ion  on a year  to year  basis. 
The  centers  selected  were  Batelle  Columbus  Laboratories,  Columbus, 
Ohio,  research area: multiphase materials processing; University of Alabama, 
Birmingham, Alabama,  macromolecular cyrstallography  in  space;  University 
of Alabama,  Huntsville, Alabama,  materials processing;  Institute for Technol- 
ogy  Development,  National  Space  Technology  Laboratories,  Hancock 
County,  Mississippi,  space  remote sensing;  and Vanderbilt  University,  Nash- 
ville,  Tennessee,  metallurgical processing in  space.  (NASA Release 85-120) 

September 5: NASA  announced  that  Lewis  Research Center  (LeRC) opened 
the  Microgravity  Materials Science  Laboratory (MMSL) to  aid  scientists on 
earth  in  determining what was  and was  not feasible for  science experiments 
in  space [see  NASA  Installationdlewis Research Center,  Aug.  261. 
"The  MMLS w i l l  permit US. government, university, and industry research- 
ers  to  conduct  scientific experiments using equipment that  functionally du- 
plicates equipment  aboard the Space  Shuttle,"  explained Salvatore Grisaffe, 
chief  of  the  LeRC  materials division.  "Access  to  such  a  laboratory w i l l   give 
U.S.  companies  a  competitive  advantage  in   developing  better  materials 
through microgravity research." 
Other microgravity research facilities at  LeRC  included two drop towers  in 
which  experiment  packages  could  free-fall  up  to  500  feet,  achieving  a 
weightless  condition for  up  to  five  seconds,  and  the  Lewis  Lear  jet,  which 
could fly parabolic trajectories to achieve a microgravity environment inside 
the plane for  up to 22 seconds. 
The  MMSL was  one  part of  NASA's  microgravity science and applications 
program, which fostered research in  the science and technology of  process- 
ing materials in  low gravity. The aims of the program were to obtain a clearer 
understanding of the factors  controlling earth-based processes  to guide their 
improvement and development of new materials that could not be made on 
earth and procedures to support  long-term space operations. 
The  Space  Shuttle then  offered up to  seven  days  for  microgravity experi- 
mentation;  the proposed space station eventually would provide a w r y  long- 
term microgravity research and materials processing capability. However,  the 
most efficient use of such space  resources demanded that experimental  pro- 
cedures  be  based  on  a  firm  scientific  understanding w i th   extensive  prior 
ground-based examination.  (NASA Release 85-123)

September 30: The U.S.  Commerce Department announced it signed a con- 
tract w i th  Earth Observation Satellite Co.  (Eosat) to pay $250 m i l l ion  over  the 
next five years for Eosat to construct two new Landsat satellites (Landsat 6 and 
I); provide a ground system to  operate and process data from the new space- 
craft; and operate,  process,  and market data from  Landsats 4,  5, 6, and 7 the 
Washington Post reported. Eosat,  a joint venture of RCA  Corp.,  which would 
bu i ld   the  new  spacecraft,  and  Hughes Aircraft Co.,  which  would  provide 
satellite instrumentation including the thematic mappers,  would  operate the 
orbiting Landsat 4 and 5 for  their anticipated lifetime at a cost to the govern- 
ment similar to the government‘s  projected cost. The Commerce Department 
said the new satellites,  Landsat 6 scheduled for launch in  1988 and Landsat 7 
scheduled for  launch when  Landsar  6  neared the  end of  i t s   approximately 
fiveyear  lifetime,  should  provide sharper  images and enhance the  value of 
the system  for agricultural uses. 
The  U.S.  government  would  launch  the  new  satellites  from  the  Space 
Shuttle  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $44.9 m i l l ion   and  also  pay  for  any  Space 
Shuttle system modifications  necessary for  the  launches. 
Although  the  contract  called  for  Eosat  to  market  and  operate  the  four 
Landsats,  i t  allowed  the company to terminate date marketing for  Landsat 4 
and  5  i f  cumulative  revenue was  below 65%  of  the  mutually  agreed  upon 
projected revenues for data sales for the two satellites and to terminate opera- 
tions and data marketing for  Landsat 6 and  7 i f  total cumulative revenue fell 
below  60%  of  projected  revenue after  launch of  Landsat 6,  Defense  Da i ly  
reported. 
Landsats used cameras  and other  scanners  to  produce pictures  in  various 
wavelengths for  many uses,  including agriculture, mineral explorations,  fish- 
ing,  forestry,  snow  cover  and  surface water  surveys,  and  land  use  and  city 
planning.  NASA  developed the  Landsat system  and  in  1983 transferred i t  to 
the Commerce Department. (WPost, Oct 1/85, 83; D/D,  Oct 1/85, 153) 

October 29: Society  Expeditions, which specialized  in  offering exotic vaca- 
tions,  announced at an October 29 press conference that on November 15 it 
would  begin  taking  reservations  for  regularly  scheduled  spaceflights,  the 
Washington Times reported. 
Society  Expeditions  scheduled  its  first  flight  for  October  12, 1992, the 
500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s discovery of the new world.  A 
flight would cost $50,000, and there would be a $2000 charge for a threeday 
orientation.  T.C.  Swartz,  president of  Society  Expeditions,  said  more  than 
3,500 people  had  already  expressed  interest  i n  traveling  in  space  and  350 
had signed  letters of  intent and deposited  $5,000  to  confirm  space  on  the 
rocket. 
He explained that his company signed a five-year $280 m i l l ion  contract to  
charter the first  two commercial  reusable spaceships bu i l t  by  Pacific Ameri- 
can Launch Systems.  Pacific American’s  president Gary Hudson said i t  would 

430  

United States 

cost more than $200 m i l l ion  to develop and bu i ld  a 57-foot long rocket and 
that each  launch should cost about $1 million. 
A  flight on  Pacific American’s  PHOENIX  E,  a rocket powered  launch and 
landing  vehicle,  would  begin  somewhere  in  northern California,  circle the 
earth five to eight times,  and  return to the  launch area. 
Before  certification  for  commercial  use,  PHOENIX  E  would  undergo  at 
least  50  test  flights  and  face  vigorous  examination  by  the  Department  of 
Transportation, Hudson said.  Asked  i f  he would  be on one of the test flights, 
Hudson said,  “We  think  it’s  the ethical responsibility of  the designers to go 
up  before the public. But we won’t  be on the first flight. That’s  why there’s  test 
pilots.”  ( W  Times, Oct 30/85,  1 B)  

November  18: The  3M  Corp.  and McDonnell  Douglas joined  as  a team  to

produce  red  blood  cells,  Aviation  Week  reported.  The  ability  of  the  drug 
erythropoietin  to  stimulate the body to produce red blood cells could benefit 
persons who were  anemic or  had a variety  of  other disorders  in  which  red 
blood  cell  levels  were  a  factor.  And  i t   had  the  potential  in   a  number  of 
medical situations to reduce the need for  blood transfusions that carried the 
risk  of  complications.  Erythropoietin was  not widely  used  because  current 
production  techniques could not filter out by-products harmful to the body. 
A  batch of the  material to be produced  in  an  electrophoresis machine on 
the  next  flight  of  Space  Shuttle,  mission  61-B,  would  be given  to  the  first 
human test patients soon.  It was expected the drug could be available for sale 
i n  1988 pending Food and Drug Administration approval. 
McDonnell  Douglas  was  completing  arrangements  to  bring  3M’s  Riker 
Laboratories Div.  into the  program as  the drug company  that  would  market 
the  product  in   place  of  Johnson &  Johnson‘s  Ortho  Pharmaceuticals Div., 
which  recently dropped out of  the  program  in  favor  of  producing the  s u b  
stance through earth-based bioengineering. Ortho believed i t  would be able 
to  bring the drug to market a year sooner,  while McDonnell Douglas believed 
space  processing would be far  more efficient and  less costly. 
McDonnell Douglas was also completing arrangements with a French drug 
company,  Roussel Pharmaceuticals of  Paris,  to  begin processing starting the 
next summer of a French drug on the Space Shuttle as  a second commercial 
space  product. The French product would  be purified  in  the same m iddeck  
unit that  brought erythropoietin  to the animal and human test  phase.  NASA 
and  McDonnell  Douglas were  completing  arrangements  to  keep  the  mid- 
deck  system  operational  for  research and  to  help  generate  new  products 
under their jo in t  endeavor agreement.  (AvWk, Nov  18/85,  16) 

December  17: NASA  announced  i t  had signed with  the  International Space 
Corp. (ISC) an agreement for development of the Normal Freezing Furnace,  a 

43 1 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

high-temperature furnace for producing several types of infrared semiconduc- 
tor  crystals  in   the  microgravity  environment  of  spaceflight.  The  furnace 
would produce materials through a  directional solidification  crystal growth 
process. 
The  agreement call  for  NASA  to  fly  the furnace aboard s ix   to eight Space 
Shuttle missions to perfect the proposed crystal production process,  and  ISC 
would make the experimental equipment available to NASA  for the agency’s 
exploratory space processing operations. 
NASA anticipated that the experiments would  lead to new space  manufac- 
turing  techniques  for  producing crystal materials,  thus  enhancing  the  U.S. 
electronic  industry’s  position in  the highly competitiw worldwide semicon- 
ductor market.  (NASA Release 85-173)

February  8:  A  dispute  over  application of  U.S.  l aw s   to  foreign  companies 
apparently  k i l led  a  joint  U.S.-W.  German  project to  commercialize  remote 
sensingequipment data and could affect negotiations over  European partici- 
pation  in  the  planned  U.S.  space  station,  Science magazine  reported. The 
jo in t   project,  known as  SPARX,  was  to  finance  regular  flights  on  the  Space 
Shuttle of  the modular opto-electronic multispectral scanner,  an  instrument 
developed  by  Messerschmitt-BolkowBlohm (M B B )   under contract w i th   the 
German  Aerospace  Research  Establishment. NASA  said  proposals  received 
from SPARX  were unacceptable, because data would be available solely on a 
proprietary basis to SPARX’s  commercial  customers,  conflicting w i th   NASA‘s 
“open  skies”  policy mandating nondiscriminatory access to a l l  data obtained 
from  U.S.-launched  civilian missions. NASA  and M B B  were  continuing dis- 
cussions on  the  possibility of  a  separate  mnture using the German  e q u i p  
ment  that  would  respect  licensing  conditions  applied  to  U.S.  companies 
under the Land Remote Sensing Commercialization Act. 
Some  members  of  the  European  space  science  community-particularly 
those w i th   reservations about  tying Europe’s  fortunes  too closely to those of 
N M s  proposed space station-were  using the apparent conflict as evidence 
of their concerns,  the Science article said.  The scientists noted the extent  to 
which  the  regulations  and  other  provisions  contained  in   the  legislation’s 
licensing requirements-such  as those requiring licensees to deposit any data 
obtained  in  a single central archive-would  apply  to foreign  companies be- 
coming NAWs  commercial customers. The dilemma hinged on  the conflict 
between companies based outside the U.S.  resenting being subject to legisla- 
tion  over  which  they  had  no  formal  control  and  Congress and  U.S.-based 
companies  that  would  complain  i f  they  saw foreign  companies  getting an 
advantage by not having to meet domestic-licensing requirements. 
Udo Pollvogt of MBB ’s  Washington office said  the  issues  raised  by  SPARX 
“definitely  need to be resolved over  the next two years”  as  Europeans consid-

/une   I 2  NASA Administrator James Beggs  stirred up a controversy when  he 
reportedly told a Washington gathering of the American Stock  Exchange that 
the Soviets  had  "turned us down,  flat,  w i th  no explanation"  on the proposal 
of a jo in t  space mission, the Washington Times reported. Later  NASA  spokes- 
man Miles Waggoner said  the Soviets  had not  rejected the  idea,  but a joint 
manned space  mission was  not  likely to happen within the next few  years. 
President Reagan had offered the Soviets a chance to participate in  a c o o p  
erative  space  venture  about  a year  previously.  The  Soviets  responded  that 
they  believed  it was  not  the  time  to  fly  that  kind of  mission.  "To  us,  that 
means the  item  i s  still open,"  Waggoner  said.  "This  time,  though,  Mr.  Beggs 
decided to  look at  i t  from the other  perspective." 
Other NASA  officials,  indicating the agency hadn't  received any  new word 
from the Soviets about the  proposal, speculated Beggs might have said what 
he d id  to provoke a reaction from them. 
Originally,  NASA  planners  envisioned a joint  practice  rescue  mission  in  
which a US. astronaut would use a jet backpack called a manned maneuver- 
ing unit  (MMU) to fly  from a Space  Shuttle to a Soviet Salyut space  station. 
The  astronaut  might also  use  the  MMU   to  push  a  cosmonaut  back  to  the 
Space  Shuttle for  a brief time.  (W  Times, June 12/85,4A) 

/one 20: The  House Science and  Technology  Committee today  completed 
mark-up of legislation authorizing funding to transfer  the  land remote-sens- 
ing  system  operations  to  Eosat,  a  jo in t   venture  of  Hughes  and  RCA,  Ae ro  
space Daily reported. The  legislation,  H.R.  2800,  was  identical to a measure 
reported out by  the Senate Commerce,  Science and Transportation Commit- 
tee  the  previous week.  Both bills amended  the  Land  Remote-Sensing Com- 
mercialization Act  of  1984  that  authorized  $75  m i l l ion   in   FY  85  for  such 
activities. The House bill authorized $295 million for transfer  activities in  the 
FY  85-89  period,  of which  not more than $125  m i l l ion  would be available 
for  FY 85-86. 

The  Commerce  Department and  Eosat,  which w a s   selected the  previous 
fall to operate the system,  had  not yet  finalized the contract,  but a  National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) official told Congress the 
contract would be signed within two weeks.  Eosat was  proposing to provide 
two  satellites and  a  new  ground  station  for  a  fixed  price of  $250 million, 
satellite hardware continuing present capabilities with improvements, greater 
data processing capabilities at the new ground station, and a program cover- 
ing 10 years.  Government  funding would occur  in  the  first  f i w  years.  ( A D ,

ju ly  6  Taylor Wang,  the first space traveller of Chinese origin who performed 
materials science and fluids studies in  weightlessness during the April  1985 
Challenger  Space  Shuttle flight  51-8,  arrived  in  Beijing,  China,  for  a  two- 
week  visit  at  the  invitation of  the  Astronautics  Industry  Ministry.  Wang,  a 
scientist at the jet Propulsion Laboratory,  was born in China's jiangxi Province 
and had not been i n  China for over  3 0  years. 
Wang  said  the  purpose of  his  trip  was  to  exchange  views  with  Chinese 
scholars  and  to  conduct  academic  exchanges  w i th   Chinese  specialists  in  
Beijing,  Xian,  and Shanghai. 
During a welcoming  ceremony July 8  at  the  Ministry,  Vice-Minister  Bao 
Keming said that China's open policy in  recent years had given great impetus 
to   the  development  of  i t s   space  technology.  He  concluded  by  saying  that 
Wang's  visit would further  promote the friendship and cooperation between 
scientists  of  the  two  countries  and  that  Sino-American  space  science  and

/u ly   8  Vice  President George  Bush,  after  meeting with  French  President 
Francois Mitterrand and other French leaders in  Paris,  said the  U .S .   Strategic 
Defense Initiative (SDI) program and the European French-sponsored Eureka 
technology  program were not incompatible,  Defense Daily reported. Seek- 
ing  to calm concerns that  the  Eureka  program was  in  competition  with  SDI 
for  scientific and  technology  talent,  Bush  said  that  after  his  talks  with  the 
French that "I  more firmly believe  . . . there  i s  no incompatibility between 
Eureka.  .  .and SDI.  . . 
"They  understand our  research  program, which  i s  strictly related to strate- 
gic defense,  and  I think we  understand much more clearly their concept of 
collective  research on broad technology as far as  Europe i s  concerned,"  Bush 
commented. 
Technology ministers from  16 European countries had scheduled a meeting 
for ju ly   17 in  Paris to discuss projects and areas of cooperation in  the Eureka 
program.  Five areas  of  high  technology  were  identified for  joint  programs: 
information technology,  robotics, communications, bio-technology, and new 
materials.  (D/D, July 8/85,  1) 

ju ly   16:  O n   the  10th  anniversary of  the  Apollo-Soyuz  Test  Project,  former 
astronauts Thomas  Stafford,  Donald  Slayton,  and  Vance  Brand and  cosmo- 
nauts Alexei  Leonov and Valery  Kubasov met on July 16  in  Washington D.C. 
at  a  celebration  sponsored  by  the  American  Institute of  Aeronautics  and 
Astronautics  and  the  Planetary Society,  and called on their countries  to  un- 
dertake a jo in t  manned mission to Mars,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
"People  in  both countries are already dealing with the technological ques- 
tions  about  how  to  accomplish  such  a  mission,"  said  Leonov,  who  com- 
manded the  Soyuz  spacecraft that  docked  on July 17,  1975 with  an  Apollo

spacecraft.  “I know  that  all  b ig  things  start  with  small  steps  but  we  can 
accomplish b ig  tasks,  not only in  space but on the ground as  well.  I know we 
want to work  together,”  he continued. 
The conference heard repeated calls for the U.S.  and USSR  to  begin plan- 
ning a jo in t  manned mission to Mars.  Speakers  included Carl Sagan  of Cor- 
ne l l   University;  Bruce  Murray,  former  director  of  the  Jet  Propulsion 
Laboratory;  former  New  Mexico  Senator  Harrison  Schmitt,  a  former  astro- 
naut;  and  Sen.  Spark  Matsunaga  (D-Hawaii),  who  has  sponsored  Senate 
resolutions promoting more cooperation in space between the two countries. 
Other  conference  participants  reminded  the  audience  of  the  difficulties 
inherent  i n  sending men to  Mars.  “Our  two  uppermost concerns are still  a 
large solar flare and the everyday cosmic  radiation the Mars pioneers would 
receive on their two-year round trip,”  Dr.  John Billingham of Ames  Research 
Center said. 
“Massive  solar flares represent the worst hazard,”  he explained.  “In  1972 a 
large flare produced a cloud of  radiation equal to  a dose of  1500 rads and in  
1956 an even bigger flare sent out a dose of 2500 rads.  Both would have been 
lethal to men on a tr ip  to Mars. 
“We  have to  find a way to  create a kind of bomb shelter inside a ship bound 
for Mars and  for  the  crew  to  have  their  own  solar  observatory  on board to  
warn  them of things  like flares,”  Billingham said. 
During the  celebration,  the  Soviet  Union  released details  of  i t s   next  un- 
manned  mission  to  Mars-the  1988  launch  of  a  spacecraft  and  i t s   1989 
landing on  Phobos,  the larger of Mars’s  two moons.  ( W  Post,  July 17/85,  A181 

October  70: Members of  the  House of  Representatives,  former  astronauts, 
and assorted other government people would depart on  October 10 for a f i v e  
day stay  in  Moscow to interest Soviet officials and scientists in  a joint manned 
mission to  Mars,  the  N Y  Times reported. The Soviets  invited the group,  and 
the White House cleared the visit. 
Heading  the  40-member  delegation was  Rep.  B i l l   Nelson  (D-Fla.),  who  
was  chairman of  the  House space  science subcommittee and scheduled  to 
fly aboard the Space Shuttle i n  December. Former astronauts Thomas Stafford 
and Donald Slayton,  also  i n  the group,  would jo in   in a celebration in  Mos- 
cow of the  10th anniversary of the Apollo-Soyuz space mission. 
Nelson  noted  that  the  formal  space  cooperation agreement  between  the 
two  countries  expired  in   1982  and  said  that  he  hoped  the  Congressional 
mission would open the way  to a “new  spirit of scientific cooperation.” 
Under the sponsorship of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,  the group would 
visit  the  space  research  institute,  the  cosmonaut  training  center,  and  the 
mission control center  in  Kaliningrad.  A  U.S.  request  to  visit  the  Baikonur

february 7:  In taking actions that would l ike ly  aggramte the already eroding 
launch service‘s market p s i t i o n  of the Space  Shuttle,  Aerospace  Da i ly  re- 
ported that the Department of Defense (DOD) announced plans to fly at least 
two complementary expendablelaunch vehicles per year  beginning in  1998, 
and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  an- 
nounced  in   its  FY  86 budget submission  that  “three  of  their  satellites  haw  
been committed  to the Titan 11.”  (MD, Feb  7/85,  1) 

March  3:  In  his  “National  Security  Launch  Strategy”  directive,  President 
Reagan  told  NASA  and  the  U .S .   Air  Force  to  begin a  study  leading to  joint 
development  of a bigger and  more powerful space  shuttle that could  begin 
flying missions just before the p a r  2000,  the  Washington Post reported. In a 
major policy change,  the Reagan Administration indicated that the Air  Force 
should  share  w i th   NASA  the  cost  of  designing  and  acquiring  the  second- 
generation space shuttle;  NASA  had borne the $10 b i l l ion  cost of developing 
the current Space Shuttle,  although the Air Force used i t  one third of the time. 
The  directive  also  covered an  agreement  by  the  Air  Force  to  use  NASA‘s 
Space  Shuttle  at  least  eight  times  a  year  for  the  10  years  after  1988  and 
approved an Air Force decision to buy an  improved version of its Titan rocket 
to  supplement  the  Space  Shuttle for  military  launches starting  in  1988 and 
ending in  1993  [see  Feb.  271. 
Defense  Secretary  Caspar  Weinberger  said  in   the  directive  that  the  Air 
Force had decided to buy  10 Titan 34D7 singleuse rockets for  $2.09 b i l l ion  
between then and September  1993 from Martin Marietta Corp. The directive 
d id  not resolve the dispute between NASA  and  the Air  Force over  Air  Force 
plans to  sell  at  bargain  rates  obsolete Titan  II  intercontinental  ballistic mis- 
siles to  launch three weather  satellites for  NOAA [see Feb 251. 
NASA  was  disappointed  in  the Air  Force decision to  buy  the Titans,  as  i t  
had tried to persuade the Air  Force to buy an  upgraded version of the solid- 
fuel  rocket  booster  that  helped  put  the  Space  Shuttle  into  orbit.  Present 
rocket power  limited Space Shuttle cargo weight,  flying height,  and i t s  cross- 
range  (limiting  landings  to  Kennedy  Space  Center,  Edwards  AFB,  and  the 
White Sands  Missile Range). 
The  permanently manned space  station  planned  for  1993 would  require 
loads up to  75,000  Ib. carried into polar orbit and at  least  100,000-lb.  loads 
in to  nearequatorial orbit at altitudes of at least 500 miles. ( W h s f ,  Mar 3/85,

March 25: Brig. Gen. Donald Kutyna, director of Air Force space systems and 
C3, told  the Senate Armed  Services Committee  the previous week  that two- 
thirds  of  the  FY  86  space  budget  w a s   earmarked  for  the  military,  Defense 
Da i ly  reported. The Air Force would receive about 48% of the national space 

436 

United States 

budget,  NASA  33% ,  and other  Defense Department activities  (Defense Ad- 
vanced  Research  Projects Agency  [DARPA],  Navy,  and Army)  the  remaining 
18%. Kutyna added  that  Air  Force space  activities represented about  three  
quarters of the  total  Defense Department space  program,  w i th   the  Defense 
agencies,  mainly DARPA,  coming in  second.  He  noted the Air  Force budget 
for  FY 86 was  $10.95  billion,  with  “no  change percentagewise” from  FY 85 
and  “very  l i t t le  change among the elements.” 
Maj. Gen.  Carl Beer,  deputy chief of staff  for  plans for  the Air  Force Space 
Command,  reported to the same  committee approval of the Air  Force space 
plan,  which  was  divided  into  support  and  operational missions,  including 
the  launch,  orbit  transfer,  and  on-orbit  control  of  spacecraft  and  payloads, 
and the operations necessary  “to  secure  free  passage  in  space  and deny  the 
enemy  the use of  space”  when necessary. 
Beer  confirmed that  the  requirement  for  a space-based  radar  system  was 
established for  the Air  Force and Navy and the two would meet  in  the near 
future to get an  R&D program underway. (D /D ,  Mar 25/85,  129) 
April  10: The  U.S. Navy  implemented  a  plan  announced  earlier  by  Navy 
Secretary John Lehman  to  abolish the  Naval Material  Command  and  to  re- 
structure the Naval Electronics Systems Command to integrate space systems, 
force ships,  and aircraft systems  into a Space and Warfare Systems Command, 
Defense  Daily  reported.  The  actions  were  part  of  a  two-year-old  plan  to 
decentralize acquisition management  in  the  Navy and  streamline the deci- 
sion  making process.  Defense  Daily  reported  the  Navy  as  saying  a  major 
impact  o f   the  reorganization of  Navy  acquisition  management  would  be 
improved accountability by eliminating a reporting layer .  
Adm.  James Watkins,  chief of  Naval Operations,  said  the space  a s p e a  of 
the reorganization was  part of a total package intended to bring the Navy “up 
to  speed”  in   addressing  space  needs.  “We  are  trying  now  to  put  our  act 
together. We  have established  the  Navy  Space  Command.  . .putting  in  my 
office the Space  and C’  Directorate,  rather than just C3,” Watkins said.  “The 
Space  and  Warfare  Systems  Command  w i l l   be  our  technical  depository, 
working w i th  the Naval Research  Laboratory (NRL) and other  laboratories to 
work  our projects  in  space,  of which there are  many.  . .This  i s  a  nice s tep  
p ing  stone on the route to a unified space command,”  Watkins added. 
He  also pointed out that the Navy and the Air Force,  and perhaps the Army, 
would  rotate into the  unified space  command that  President Reagan  would 
establish on October 1,  1985. Therefore, Watkins said,  he saw the reorganiza- 
tion  as  important  not  only  within  the  Navy,  but  also  within  the  unified 
command system  to achieve a higher  level of command decision.  (D /D ,  Apr

August 27: Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger today cancelled the Army’s 
new battlefield anti-aircraft gun,  called the Division Air Defense (Divad) gun, 

437  

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

saying that  tests  showed  i t  would  give  soldiers no  significant  improvement 
m r  existing weapons,  the  Washington  Times  reported. Weinberger  told  a 
Pentagon  press  conference  that  operational tests  held  from  March  through 
June demonstrated the  Divad mobile gun  system  "does  not effectively meet 
the  military  threat"  or  justify  adding  $3   b i l l ion   to  the  $1.8  b i l l ion  already 
spent  for  development and  production of  the  first  Divads. The  cancellation 
was  one of the  largest ever  made of a weapon  in  production. 
Weinberger said the gun showed poor flexibility and a lack of range against 
the threat posed by Soviet missilefiring Hind helicopters. The Army declined 
comment,  other  than to say  i t  would follow Weinberger's direction. Sources 
had said,  however that  the Army  fought  hard  in  meetings over  the  previous 
s M r a l  weeks to keep the Divad in  production. The Army  had planned to buy 
615  Divads for  a total cost  of  $4.5  b i l l ion  and  had accepted delivery of  6 5  
units. 
Ford  Aerospace  and  Communications  Corp.  developed  and  built  the 
weapon,  employing 1900  people  in   its  Divad division  at  Newport  Beach, 
California.  Ford Aerospace  President Donald Rassier  said  the  company  un- 
derstood the basis  for  the defense secretary's  decision and that the firm  had 
already begun work  on  new solutions to the growing Soviet threat. 
The  Divad was  based  on  the 40-millimeter double-barrel Swedish Bofers 
gun system,  designed to be mounted on old M - 4 8  tank chassis that the Army 
had in  stock.  Ford Aerospace equipped it w i th  radar from the F-16  fighter for 
all-weather and nighttime operation. 
The Army considered the weapon essential for the defense of quick-moving 
armored tank  divisions,  especially  in  Europe,  against both helicopters firing 
missiles and fixed-wing aircraft. (W  Times, Aug 28/85,  1A) 

September23: During a ceremony today at  Peterson Air  Force Base  in  Colo- 
rad0  Springs,  the  Department of  Defense  (DOD)  activated  its  first  unified 
space command,  SPACECOM,  to m rsee  a l l  military programs in  space,  the 
N Y  Times  reported.  SPACECOM  would  oversee  and  control  a l l   Air  Force, 
Army,  Navy,  and Marine Corps defensiw space activities, which consisted of 
systems demted to  intelligence-gathering, watching for  an  attack,  and facili- 
tating communications and  navigation,  and would  operate  separately  from 
the civilian programs run by NASA.  H o m r ,  i t  was  the potential role that the 
new  command  might  play  as  headquarters  for  any  space-based  defense 
against  enemy  missiles that  drew  most attention,  despite official  assertions 
that any  such assignment would  lie far  in  the future. 
Although the U .S .  was  committed to the early stage of research for a missile 
defense system  known as  the  Strategic  Defense initiative,  Gen. John Vessey 
Jr.,  chairman  of  the  Joint Chiefs  of  Staff,  said  after  the  ceremony  that  the 
command's  purpose was  an extension of the armed services'  current strategy 
of  deterrence,  and  he  sought  to  allay  concern  that  i t  would  be  a  first  step 
toward war  in  space.

United  States 

“There are several things the command w i l l  not become:’  he said.  “It  i s  not 
a  force  bu i l t   to   escalate  the  arms  race.  it  i s   not  a  force  bu i l t   to  achieve 
dominance for the United States. The command w i l l  make i t s  contribution  to 
that fundamental  element of  United States strategy,  the prevention of war.” 
Rep.  Ken Kramer (R-Colo.),  who strongly favored development of a missile 
defense system,  said  that  the  Space Command opened a new  period  in  the 
lives of  nations.  Noting that  he  could  “speak  a  little more freely”  than  the 
military  officials,  Kramer  said,  “I call  it the  post-nuclear era,  in  which  the 
people of  this  nation  and  potentially  a l l   nations w i l l  no   longer  live  i n  this 
shadow of potential nuclear destruction and nuclear holocaust.”  Kramer had 
fought  hard  to  have  the  military’s  space  functions  united  and  based  in  his 
district and said Colorado had become the “military  space capital of the free 
world.” 
DOD named Gen. Robert Herres,  who headed the North American Aero- 
space  Defense Command and the United States Air  Force Space Command, 
to  command the new organization.  Herres attempted to dampen speculation 
about SPACECOM’s  role i n  strategic defense development.  “There  i s  a lo t  of 
uncertainty about how that research i s  going to turn out. That’s  why we call it 
research:’  he said.  “I could speculate about what our role might be,  but those 
decisions w i l l  depend on how the research turns out. ( N M ,  Sept 24/85,  A281 

Nowmber  1:  The U.S.  Air  Force’s  Electronic Systems Div. awarded Grumman 
Corp.  a  $657  m i l l ion   contract  to   bu i ld  the Joint Surveillance Target  Attack 
Radar System (JSTARS), an airborne radar system for spotting tanks,  personnel 
carriers,  or  any  other enemy vehicle moving or  standing s t i l l ,   the Air  Force 
Systems Command (AFSC)  Newsreview reported. A C-18,  a militarized ver- 
sion of  Boeing’s  707,  would serve  as  the  radar‘s  airborne development plat- 
form.  The JSTAR would  include radar equipment and operations and control 
displays as  well as  communications  links to ground  terminals and weapons 
systems. 
Under the fixed-price incentive contract,  a Grumman team  including Boe  
ing  Military Airplane  Co.  and  United Technologies Corp.3  Norden Systems 
Div. would design,  build,  and test two full-scaledevelopment airborne radar 
systems. 
The Air Force and Army would test the JSTARS ability to detect,  locate,  and 
track enemy ground vehicles and to help ground commanders plan attacks to  
destroy them. The Air  Force expected field testing to begin in  March 1990. 
Col.  Harry  Gillogly, JSTARS  program manager,  said  the  airborne  systems 
would  provide  “an  electronic  high  ground  to  observe  maneuvering enemy 
forces:’ 
telling Air  Force and Army  commanders what forces to apply where 
and when  in  order to  inflict the most damage at the  least cost. 
“Both  services w i l l   be able  to  attack  key  targets,”  Gillogly  said,  “the  Air 
Force  w i th   direct-attack  aircraft  and  missiles,  and  the  Army  with  artillery,

National Space  Commission 

March  29:  In  a  speech  today  before  the  National  Space  Club,  President 
Reagan  urged a greater  U.S.  effort  in  the commercial  development of space 
and announced establishment of a  14-member  National Space Commission, 
which  he said would  “devise  an  aggressive  space  agenda  to  carry  America 
into the 21 st  century,”  the NY  Times reported. He said Thomas Paine,  head of 
a consulting company on high-technology enterprises and former NASA  ad- 
ministrator and  president and  chief  operating office of  the  Northrup Corp., 
would lead the commission. 
Other commission members were  Laurel Wilkening,  NASA  scientist who 
would be vice chairman; Jeanne Kirkpatrick, former  U.S.  ambassador to the 
U.N.;  Brig.  Gen.  Charles Yeager,  retired;  Ne i l  Armstrong,  former  astronaut 
who headed Computer Technology Aviation;  Kathryn Sullivan,  first American 
woman  to walk  in  space;  Luis Alvarez,  Lawrence Berkeley  Laboratory physi- 
cist;  Paul  Coleman,  Space  Research Association  president and  professor of 
geophysics  and  space  at  the  University of  California,  L o s  Angeles;  George 
Field, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory senior  physicist; Lt.  Gen. W i l-  
liam  Fitch,  retired,  former  Marine Corp.  deputy  chief  of  staff  for  aviation; 
Charles Herzfeld,  vice  president and director of  research  and technology at 
In ,  1.  L.  Kerrebrock, head of the department of aeronautics and astronautics 
at  the  Massachusetts  Institute of  Technology;  Gerard ONe i l l ,   president of 
Geostar Corp.;  and David Wbb,  a consultant for  space development. 
President Reagan said  the commission would develop  long-term goals for 
civilian space enterprises,  but he d id  not elaborate on the type of commercial 
space  ventures  he  had  in  mind.  He said  only  that,  “Before  the  end  of  the 
century,  many billions of dollars of commercial activity w i l l  be taking place 
in  and because of space”  and that the U.S.  must use the  incentives of individ- 
ual freedom and the profit motive to encourage these commercial uses.  ( N V

June 5: Although  a mission to put a human colony on Mars seemed unlikely 
anytime  soon,  members  of  the  National Commission  on  Space  [see  U.S. 
Space Policy/National Commission on Space,  Mar. 291 said it appeared to be 
only a matter of time  until such an  undertaking took  place,  the  Washington 
Post  reported.  The  commission  was  due  in  May  1986  to  present  a  report 
outlining what  it thought the  U.S.  space  program should  look  like m r  the 
next 20 years. 
The  U.S.  last  visited Mars  in  1976,  when  unmanned  Viking  7  and  2 mis- 
sions  landed and  began collecting data.  The  Mars Observer was  scheduled 
for  a  1991  launch  to  study  the  planet  from  orbit.  NASA  officials  said  that

beyond that there was  nothing concrete on the drawing boards,  although they 
were  considering sending an  unmanned craft to  land on Mars,  collect sam- 
ples,  and  return  in  a  manner  similar  to  early  moon explorations.  ( W  Post, 
June 5/85,  AS) 

December  18:  Cen.  Lawrence Skantze,  commander of the Air Force Systems 
Command,  declared that the U.S.  military space program was  about to begin 
a new  era  in  which  military space  systems  competed against  terrestrial sys- 
tems  to  determine  which  could better  handle  military  situations,  Defense 
Daily reported. 
Three  dewlopments  had  created  the  military  space  program,  reaching 
what  Skantze called a  “critical  mass.”  These were  the establishments of  the 
Unified Space Command that provided for the first time an advocate for  U.S. 
space activities;  the  Project Forecast  II technology study,  which would  pro- 
pose  among  other  things  “quantum  leaps  in   space  capabilities;”  and  the 
growing momentum of the Strategic  Defense Initiative (SDI). 
“This  ’critical mass,’  merging w i th  the p r m n  combat enhancement roles of 
space  systems  and  a tight  defense  budget,  would  thrust  the  military  into a 
new era of force structure decision,”  Skantze  said.  ‘A  limited budget and  its 
allocation process w i l l  place space systems  in  direct competition w i th  terres- 
trial  systems  for  resources  and  solutions  to  military  problems,”  he  com- 
mented. 
Space  systems would have to demonstrate that the benefits they  provided 
were  worth  more  than  the  terrestrial  force  addition  that  would  haw  to  be 
foregone  for  the  space  system,  Skantze  pointed  out.  In  the  past,  “space 
systems  have  often  competed  for  R&D dollars  w i th   terrestrial  systems  that 
haw traditionally done the same or similar jobs,”  he explained.  ’At times we 
have the luxury of being able to afford both. These times are gone.  Given the 
more  sophisticated  treat,  and  the  corresponding increased complexity  and 
cost  of  all  aerospace  systems,  tradeoffs  among  different  mission  areas  are 
now essential. 
“In an era when fielding a single military satellite can cost up to $.5  billion, 
we  need to carefully consider what we  are w i l l ing  to give  up to get a space 
system,”  he asserted. 
Regarding the outlook for a shift to space systems,  Skantze said that “future 
tradeoffs of space systems w i l l  be tough  for several  reasons.  One i s  that  right 
now,  space systems are fewer  in  number,  more costly,  and subject to different 
logistics concepts than  terrestrial  systems.  While  multiyear contracting can 
reduce  cost,  we  haven’t  been  able  to  take  advantage  of  economic  order 
quantities the way we have for missiles, bombs, or even planes.  Development 
and production costs  for  spacecraft w i l l  continue to exceed the flyaway  cost 
of a B-16 or F-15-even w i th  on-orbit satellite repair on  the horizon. 
”While  the Shuttle offers that possibility,” he added,  “we  still have to bu i ld  
space  systems  reliable,  redundant and  survivable.  For  two to  ten  years  at  a 

44 1 

Astronautics and Aeronautics,  1985 

time,  military spacecraft must survive in-space radiation or combat,  regulat- 
ing their own systems or responding to remote controls.  Ultra-high reliability 
i s  costly,  but we can’t  yet afford squadron-level maintenance of military satel- 
lites  on-orbit.  For  now,  w ’ r e   working on  new  maintenance concepts  and 
better  materials,  propellants,  and  hardening to  reduce  some  of  the  cost  of 
space  systems.  However,  they  w i l l   remain  expensive  military  alternatives 
until w find a new way  of doing business.” 
A  second  reason  making tradeoffs  between  space  and  terrestrial systems 
difficult was  that “the  payoffs are different, and hard to compare,” since space 
systems  were  “force  multipliers:’  that  is,  they  made weapon  systems  more 
capable,  Skantze  said. 
And  a final  reason  that  made  tradeoffs difficult,  he said,  was  “that  a deci- 
sion for a space system can be a l l  or nothing,”  meaning the number of fighter 
wings  could  be  pared  and  still  provide  an  effective  force  to  some  extent, 
”while  the  Unified Space  Command  cannot cut  back  on  satellite numbers 
and still operate an effectiw system.  The  investment question can boil down 
to doing i t  all or just  not doing it:’  he commented.  (DID, Dec  18/85,  241)

MISCELLANEOUS 

May  9: The  Coca-Cola  Co.  had  developed  the  first  container  capable  of 
dispensing carbonated beverages  in  weightlessness,  and NASA officials said 
Coca-Cola could be aboard Space Shuttle flights as early as July, the Washing- 
ton  Post reported.  Coca-Cola  President Donald Keough said  that  including 
carbonated soft drinks on a Space  Shuttle flight  reflected NAW s  interest in  
providing home-like comforts for  the astronauts. 
Because liquids did not pour in  weightlessness,  astronauts had to sip drinks 
from straws  inserted into plastic containers that collapsed as  they were e m p  
tied.  However, gas  in  carbonated drinks expanded in  weightlessness and  low 
atmospheric pressure and therefore could escape  from  plastic containers. 
A company spokesman said Coca-Cola had solved the problem with a steel 
supercan  equipped w i th   a drinking spout,  a screw  to  adjust beverage  flow, 
and a safety  lock to prevent leaks.  ( W  Post,  May  9/85,  A8) 

lune   20: NASA  announced  i t  would  test  on  Space  Shuttle  mission  51-F, 
scheduled for  mid-July 1985,  a Coca Cola Co.  technology,  dewloped at  i t s  
own initiative and expense,  to dispense its carbonated beverage in  space [see 
NASMechnology Transfer,  May  91.  Previously  i t  was  impossible for  astro- 
nauts to consume  carbonated soft drinks  in  microgravity because there was 
no way  to dispense the beverages. The test was  part of an agreement between 
NASA and Coca-Cola under which the company would grant NASA a license 
to  use  the  company’s  patented  technology,  a  specially  designed  can,  for 
unrestricted use  in  dispensing carbonated bewrages  in  space.  NASA would 
also receive the technical  information necessary to fabricate i t s  own cans. 
NASA  added  that  other  companies  in   the  carbonated  beverage  industry 
were welcome to propose different technology for the same  purpose. (NASA 
Release 85-96) 

lune  25: NASA announced that a Pepsi-Cola dispensing technology would fly 
aboard  Space  Shuttle mission  51-F,  scheduled for  launch  on  July 12,  pro- 
vided  time  permitted completion  of  NASA  qualification  procedures at  the 
Johnson Space  Center.  The  container,  developed  by  Pepsi-Cola  USA  and 
Enviro-Spray Systems (a subsidiary of Grow Group) a t  their own initiative and 
expense,  was  capable of  dispensing carbonated beverages,  as well as  other 
liquids in  space,  because pressure within the can was automatically renewed, 
whenever  necessary,  to maintain a steady  flow of  liquid. 
Pepsi-Cola had granted NASA a license for  unrestricted use of the dispens- 
ing technology  for  testing carbonated beverages  in  space,  and NASA would 
receive the technical  information necessary to fabricate i t s  own cans.  (NASA

July  72:  NASA  scheduled  the  Space  Shuttle Challenger  to  take  today  four 
high-tech cans  each  of  Pepsi-Cola and  Coca-Cola,  the  world’s  two  largest- 
selling soft drinks,  into orbit for  the first time,  the  Washington Post  reported. 
Stocking  Challenger  with  both  Coca-Cola  and  Pepsi-Cola  resulted  from  a 
compromise  reached after weeks of  highly sensitive negotiations. NASA had 
not previously flown carbonated drinks in  space because no containers were 
available to control and dispense carbonated liquids  in  zero gravity. 
It took  the  companies  more  than  two  years  to develop and  test  the  cans. 
Pepsi-Cola said  i t s  can cost  i t s  supplier,  Enviro-Spray, $14 m i l l ion  to develop. 
Pepsi-Cola filled  i t s  can w i th  eight ounces of  cola and  a  plastic pouch that 
expanded when chemicals were mixed inside it to create carbon dioxide gas, 
which then  inflated the pouch and forced the beverage out. Coca-Cola’s can 
was  lined w i th  a  laminated plastic bag filled w i th  cola that averlaid a second 
plastic bag containing carbon dioxide under  50  Ib. of  pressure. The  carbon 
dioxide forced the cola out of the can. A drawback to both cans was  that they 
must be drunk  unchilled. 
NASA  retained the  legal right to use whichever container worked best,  the 
Washington Times reported, and to f i l l   it w i th  the drink of  i t s  choice.  ( W  Post, 
July 12/85,  A3;  W  Times, July 8/85,  3A) 

August  6: Sometime  in  1986 or  shortly thereafter a Conestoga rocket might 
launch a capsule carrying the cremated remains of  15,000 human beings into 
an  orbit 1,900  miles above the earth,  Malcom Brown wrote  in  the N Y  Times, 
and a few critics had deplored the idea that the U.S.’s  first private venture into 
space should haul so  seemingly useless a payload. However, Browne pointed 
out,  the  day  might come  when  the  space  undertakers would  orbit  human 
relics  of  genuine  value  to  future  historians,  archeologists,  scientists,  and 
doctors. 
As  the  l iv ing  world became more crowded,  he wrote,  cremation  seemed 
increasingly  attractive  as  a  spacesaving  alternative.  However,  i f   the  trend 
continued,  scientists  in   the  distant  future  might  encounter  a  troublesome 
shortage of  human  remains  representing today’s  society.  Space  burial  of  at 
least a few  representatives of our  society would serve future science admira- 
bly,  he wrote.  Safe  from  grave  robbers,  souvenir  hunters,  land developers, 
and  other  terrestrial  menaces,  an  orbiting body  would  remain  in  the  most 
pristine frozen  storage imaginable. 
Short of  orbiting whole bodies,  he added,  even  the  storing of  samples of 
human  tissue  in  space  would  give  future  scientists  useful  time  capsules. A 
system  patented by a U.S.  inventor, Philip Backman,  reduced a human body 
to 5% of  its natural weight by freezing,  pulverizing, and vacuum drying it. ‘A 
few  grams of the  resulting powder,  taking up no  more space  in  an  orbiting 
mausoleum than cremated remains, would bequeath to future scientists im- 
portant clues about  the deceased person’s  identity,  genetic  makeup,  pathol- 
ogy,  and even  style of  life,”  he wrote.

“Space  may  be  the  arena  of  our  future  wars.  I t  seems  fitting  that  space 
should also  s e w  as  a  graveyard,  from which our distant descendants could 
mine the treasure of knowledge:’  Browne concluded.  (NYT Aug 6/85,  C3) 

August  14:  During a news conference today  at Johnson Space Center, Space 
Shuttle  mission  51-F  commander  Gordon  Fullerton  said  the  Challenger‘s 
crew  members could not endorse either  the  Coca-Cola or  Pepsi-Cola they 
carried  into  space  for  the  first  time,  the  Washington  Post  reported.  Both 
drinks were warm,  fizzy,  and  full of  froth whenever  the crew  tried to drink 
them. 
“They  both failed miserably, mainly because we  had no refrigerator. Warm 
cola  i s  not on  anybody’s  favorite list of things  . . . They  just weren’t  at  the 
right temperature and we had no desire to drain the cans the two drinks came 
in:’  Fullerton said. 
He added that,  although the crew suffered no gastric distress from drinking 
the two colas,  “I just can’t  extrapolate to any  great desire to want  them.” 
When  reporters asked  the  seven  crew  members  i f  they would  forsake the 
fruit juices they usually drank for the colas i f  the colas were  refrigerated, they 
all shook their heads. “The drinks we have on board now are quite attractive,” 
said astronaut Anthony  England. (W  Times,  Aug  15/85,  A8) 

DecemberZO: NASA announced that a cubic crystal art work,  the first nonsci- 
entific  payload  to  fly  aboard  a  Space  Shuttle,  would  go  into  space  in  the 
spring of  1986.  “The  Boundless Aperture:’  created  by  artist  Lowry Burgess, 
was one in  a series of sewn works in  a project entitled “Quiet Axis:’ 
intended 
to express  through art the scientific observation of order and harmony  in  the 
u n iwrse. 
The  De Cordwa Museum,  the New Works  Program of  the Massachusetts 
Council on  the Arts  and Humanities,  and the Massachusetts Artists Founda- 
t ion  funded and would pay  for  launch of  “The  Boundless Aperture:‘  which 
was  a  six-lb.  f ive inch   sq.  cube of bronze-tinted transparent glass.  The  cube 
contained  such  materials as  water  from  18  of  the world’s  rivers and  minute 
amounts,  or an appropriate substitute, of each of the elements in  the periodic 
table. 
After  flying  in   a  middeck  locker  of  the  Space  Shuttle  orbiter,  the  work 
would be  placed inside a petrified sycamore tree obtained from  the Grand 
Canyon;  and both would h w r  in  a permanent magnetic field  inside a  rock 
formation on the grounds of the De Cordwa Museum. 
Burgess was  a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art  in  Boston and 
was  director of  its graduate program  in  fine arts  and design.  He was  also a 
fellow and senior consultant at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NASA  would determine the final cost 
of flying  the work  when  i t  arrived at  Kennedy Space  Center.  (NASA  Release

December  27:  NASA  announced  that  its  Kennedy  Space  Center  (KSC) 
awarded a  research grant  to Tuskegee  University to  research  possibilities of 
growing food  in  outer  space.  In  the  project,  the  researchers  would  select 
several  sweet  potato  varieties  that  looked  promising and  research  nutrient 
delivery and hydroponic systems that appeared best suited to development of 
the crop. 
The  sweet  potato  project  was  part  of  NASA’s  Controlled  Ecological  Life 
Support Systems (CELSS) program to search  for methods to supply a continu- 
ous food source and to regenerate waste during longduration spaceflights or 
for  proposed  lunar colonies.  Dr.  William  Knott,  manager  of  KSC’s  Life Sci- 
ence Support  Facility and technical monitor  for  the  project,  said that,  i f  the 
s w e e t  potato could deliver enough energy conversion efficiency and produc- 
tivity,  NASA would  incorporate  i t   into a  nearly full-scale “breadboard”  of a 
working CELSS that it was  developing. Other plants previously chosen for the 
CELSS  breadboard project included sugar  beets,  lettuce,  snap  beans,  wheat, 
s o y   beans,  and white potatoes. 
The  sweet  potato  research  would  focus  on  three  systems:  plant  growth, 
food  processing,  and  waste  management.  The  program  would  begin  by 
studying the plants in  a sealed 24 b y  12-foot growth chamber with controlled 
light, food, water,  and temperature. Plants would receive food in  the chamber 
by  recycling  the  atmosphere  and  water  that  passed  through  the  nutrient 
system.  NASA expected the chamber,  once  used to  test  the Mercury  space- 
craft for  flight,  might produce enough food for two to three  people. A  waste 
management system  would  treat  leftovers from  the  recycling process,  con- 
verting the waste  products into a nutrient source for the plants. 
Knott said a major challenge of the project was  to harvest the highest yields 
possible while  using a  minimum of  space  and water  to  deliver  nutrients to 
the  plants.  “We  w i l l   take  the edible  seeds  and  fruit out of  the  chamber  for 
processing and storage. The leaws, stems,  and parts of the plant normally not 
consumed also would be converted into a food material.” 
Calling the CELSS  program “a  beyond the year  2000 endeavor,”  Knott said 
NASA would test some of the concepts of the program on the proposed space 
station  “just  to  s e e  i f  they  work.”  However,  he  pointed out,  “resupply  on  a 
longduration spaceflight,  a  lunar  base,  or  on  a  Mars mission  . . . would 
make the  ‘space  farm’  . . . much more attractive.”  (NASA Release 85-180)

SATELLITES,  SPACE  PROBES,  A N D  
M A N N E D  SPACE  FLIGHTS,  1985 

There were  121 space  launches in  1985,  of which the USSR conducted 98 
or 81%;  the  U.S.  conducted 17 launches. The European Space Agency  (ESA) 
was  responsible for  three  launches; Japan,  two;  and the Peoples Republic of 
China,  one. 
NASA  carried  out  14  of  the  U.S.  launches.  Nine of  these were  with  the 
Space  Transportation  System;  three  used  Atlas  Centaur  vehicles;  and  two 
used Scout vehicles. The US .  Department of Defense sponsored the remain- 
ing  three  launches-one  w i th   a Titan  IIIB-Agena D and  two  using Atlas  E 
launch vehicles;  all DOD  launches were from the Western Space and Missile 
Center  (Vandenberg AFB).  During the year  NASA  used all  four  of  the  conti- 
nental  U.S.  launch  sites:  Kennedy  Space  Center  for  all  Space  Shuttle  and 
Atlas  Centaur  launches;  Vandenberg  AFB  for  one  Scout  launch;  Wallops 
Flight Facility for  a Scout  launch; and the White Sands Missile Range (New 
Mexico) for  the final  launch of an Aerobee sounding rocket. 
Soviet space activities i n  1985 indicated their program was on the verge of 
major  advances  in  exploring  and  exploiting  outer  space.  The  USSR  tested 
three  new  space  systems  in   1985,  established a new  network of  Molniya 3 
satellites, conducted three flights in  the inscrutable Cosmos  1603 series,  and 
reactivated the dormant Salyut 7station.  Also of  interest among USSR  space 
advances were  two missions,  of  the  type  normally  supported by  the  D-l-e 
vehicle,  that demonstrated completely new launch profiles,  suggesting either 
the  first  variant  in   15  years  of  the  basic  Proton  booster  or  an  entirely  new 
launch vehicle.  And for  the first time  in  20 years  the  USSR d id  not acknowl- 
edge  a  space  mission  (on  June 21  from  Tyuratam),  leading  observers  to 
speculate  i t  used either a new  launch vehicle or a new class of satellite. The 
overall  USSR  launch  rate,  equalling  their  rates  for  the  previous  five  years, 
resulted  from  a  surge  in   October  that  was  three  times  the  launch  rate  of 
October  1984. In addition,  they conducted three launches within eight hours 
on June 21  and three  in  less than  11  hours on August  8. The USSR  used the 
Plesetsk  facility  for  62  launches,  Baikonur Cosmodrome at  Tyuratam  for  35, 
and  the  Kapustin Yar  complex  for  one.  USSR  launch vehicles  deployed  119 
satellites,  of  which  71  remained operational  by  the  end of  the  year.  O f  the 
Soviet's  95  identifiable  missions,  64  or  two-thirds  were  dedicated  govern- 
ment/military  missions. And also  in  1985 the USSR created Glavkosmos SSR 
to coordinate civilian space  activities in that  country. 
Two  of  ESA's  three  launches deployed  communications satellites-during 
the first  launch one satellite for the Arab Satellite Communications Organiza- 
tion  and  one  for  Brazil.  The  purpose of  the  second mission was  to  deploy 

447 

Astronautics  and  Aeronautics,  1985 

GSTAR  1 (U.S.)  and  Telecorn  18 (France). Their final mission launched Giotto 
for a Halley’s comet flyby.  Both Japanese launches were associated w i th  data 
gathering on  Halley’s  Comet;  and  the  Peoples  Republic of  China  launched 
PRC-  1Z 
Sources for these data include Spaceflight: Satellite Digest; The Soviet Year 
in   Space,  1985; press  releases of  NASA,  Department of  Defense,  National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration,  and  other  government  agencies, 
as  well as  the Communications Satellite Corporation.  Soviet data also d e r i e  
from  statements  in  the Soviet press,  translations from  the Tass  news  agency, 
international news service reports, and announcements and briefings by Se 
viet  officials.  Data on  satellites  of  other  nations also  come from  announce 
ments of their  respective governments or  national organizations.

NASA  LAUNCHES,  1985 

The  following table of  NASA  launches in   1985  includes payloads carried 
by the Space  Shuttle and  rocket launches larger than sounding rockets. 
NASA conducted 14  launches with 24 payloads, a l l  of which were success- 
fu l  or partially successful (the booster on Syncom 3 failed to  ignite and was 
repaired  during STS-511,  Syncom  4  ceased  functioning  after  deployment, 
and Glomr was  deployed during a second mission after  i t  failed to  leave the 
cannister on STS-51  B). NASA flew for  the Department of  Defense two dedi- 
cated  Space  Shuttle missions,  during which  three  satellites were  deployed, 
and conducted two Scout launches, each with two payloads.  In addition the 
Space Shuttle flew the first of what  likely would be a series of experiments for 
the  Strategic  Defense  initiative program.  The  Space  Transportation System's 
Space Shuttles,  along w i th  the Payload Assist Module (PAM) D and  D-2  and 
Hughes's  inertial  upper  stage,  deployed  11  communications satellites  into 
synchronous orbit for  eight organizations and five countries. 
NASA  in   1985  introduced  Discovery,  the  last  and  lightest-weight  Space 
Shuttle orbiter;  and McDonnell Douglas  inaugurated i t s  more powerful u p  
per stage  booster,  the PAM  0-2. 
Space  Shuttles also carried  11  Get Away  Special  (GAS) cannisters in  1985; 
15 middeck (secondary) payloads for such organizations as  3M Corp. and the 
IMAX f i lm   company;  two Shuttle Student  Involvement Project experiments; 
two deployable GAS can satellites (w ry  small satellites  in  a GAS can);  Space- 
lab  3  w i th   the  first  largescale  animal  colony;  Spacelab  2  with  the  ESA 
developed  Instrument  Pointing  System;  and  Spacelab  D1,  a  dedicated 
scientific flight  purchased by the West  German government. 
Crew  members on  Space  Shuttle missions  in  1985  totalled  52  (four crew 
members  flew  twice).  O f   this  total,  19  were  scientists  performing observa- 
tions,  experiments,  or  investigations;  27  were  US.  military officers  (16  Air 
Force,  five  Navy,  four  Marine Corps,  and  two  Army);  and  s ix   were  payload 
specialists from  foreign countries.  A  US.  Senator,  EJ.  "Jake" Garn,  flew  on 
STS-5  1 D. 
The  following table categorizes vehicle and payload performance as  S  for 
successful,  P for  partially successful,  or U for unsuccessful. These categories, 
which are unofficial, do  not take into account that U missions might produce 
valuable  information  or  that  payloads w i th   a  long-life design  might fail  to 
meet the design requirements, thus becoming officially unsuccessful. Further 
information on these  launches appears  in  Appendix A and  in  the text.

M A N N E D  SPACE  FLIGHTS,  1985 

There were a total of  11  manned spacecraft flights worldwide in  1985: nine 
Space  Shuttle missions conducted  by the  U.S.  and two Soyuz  T missions by 
the USSR  to carry crew to and from  the Salyut 7 station. 
The U.S.  total of manned spacecraft hours in  flight in  1985 was  1395 hours 
53  minutes;  total cumulative man-hours in  space  in  1985 were  9280 hours 
43  minutes.  The  1985  USSR  total  of  manned  spacecraft  hours  was  4249 
hours 44  minutes;  their  total  cumulative man-hours  in  space  in   1985 ,were 
10,056  hours. 
In total,  52  individuals flew aboard Space  Shuttles  in   1985.  Four  individ- 
twice.  The 
uals-three  NASA  astronauts  and  one  payload  specialist-flew 
U.S.  Air  Force  flew  payload  specialists  on  each  dedicated  DOD  mission; 
McDonnell Douglas flew  the same  payload specialist on two missions;  U.S. 
Senator E.J.  "Jake" Garn,  one of  NASA's  subcommittee chairman,  flew  as  an 
observer;  a  scientist from  EG&G Corp.  and another  from  the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory flew as  part of the Spacelab  3  mission;  scientists from  Lockheed 
Palo Alto Research Laboratory and the Naval Research Laboratory flew as part 
of the Spacelab 2 mission;  two scientists from West  Germany  and one  from 
the Netherlands flew as  part of the Spacelab D-1  mission; payload specialists 
from Saudi Arabia and France flew on a mission together;  and a scientist from 
Mexico flew to perform experiments. 
Crew  aboard  three  Space  Shuttle missions went  on  space  walks.  On   the 
first,  astronauts attached an  impromptu "flyswatter" to the robot arm  in  p r e p  
aration  for  an  attempt  to  activate  Syncom  IV-3.  Later,  in  a two-part  space 
walk,  two astronauts activated that satellite.  Finally,  in  another twepart exer- 
cise,  two astronauts  carried  out  largestructures  assembly  techniques  in  
space. 
The year  of manned space flights  for  the  USSR  was  marked by the  rescue 
mission  of  Salyut 
the  first  partial  space  station  crew  rotation;  and  the 
emergency  return  to  earth  to  get  an  ailing cosmonaut  to  the  hospital.  The 
USSR  in   1985 conducted five missions to  the manned Salyut 7 station:  two 
manned Soyuz T's,  one Progress  resupply ship,  one modified Progress flown 
under  a  Cosmos  designation,  and  the  fourth  in   a  series  of  enhanced  un- 
manned resupply and support spacecraft. 
The  year  1985 was  the 20th anniversary of the world's  first space walk  by 
Alexei  Leonov on  board Voskhod  2.  Two  cosmonauts  aboard  Salyut 7con -  
ducted one space walk  in  1985 to  install a third and  final  main  solar panel 
attachment on the space  station and test an  improved extravehicular activity 
suit.
