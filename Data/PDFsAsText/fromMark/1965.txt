Th e   year   1965  recounted  by  th is   volume  was  a n   outstanding  one  i n   the  
U.S.  space   program .

when  on  July  14, MAR IN ER   IV  relayed  to   ea r th   i ts   photographs  of  lunar- l ike  
cra ters   on  the  Mar t ian   surface.  The   conclusion  of  the  Ranger  p rog ram   was

cameras   of  RANGER   I X   approached   the   moon  on  March   24.  ALOUETTE  11

Conrad   in   G EM I N I  v  demonstrated  tha t   tra ined   space  pilots were   physically 
capable  of  a  lun a r  mission.  Orb i ta l   rendezvous  techniques  were  thorough ly  
demonstrated  by  the   flights  of  G EM IN I  V I I   and   V I .   Astronauts  Borman  and  
Love11  in   G EM I N I   V I I   took  ano ther   long  step  i n   astronautics with  the ir   fou r -  
teen-day  mission  i n   December  of  206  revolutions.  Throughout  the  Gemini 
operation,  the  team  e f fo r t  involved  closest  cooperation  of  all of  NASA  and   the  
military  services,  con trac tors ,  and  the scientific community. 
Milestones  i n   the   lunar- land ing   Apollo  p rog ram   were  not  as  well  publi- 
cized  as  Gemini  bu t   marked  significant  progress.  Th e  Project  F i re   success 
in  a tmospher ic   en t ry   of  a  test  vehicle  at  speeds  simulating  a  re tu rn   f rom

successes  with  the   orb i t ing   of  Apollo  boilerplate capsules  and  th ree   Pegasus  
micrometeoroid  satellites,  the   Sa tu rn   IB   was  be ing   erected  o n   the   launch  
pad  to begin  i t s  flight  tests  in  1966. 
Spectacular  scientific  and   manned  spaceflight  events  of  1965  could  not 
overshadoh   the   practical  utility  to   man   on   ea r th   of  communications  and  
meteorological  satellites.  TIROS  x ,   placed  in   o rb i t   fo r   the  Wea ther   Bu-

A  chronology  is  not  an   adequa te   subs t i tu te   f o r   a  documented  narra t ive  
history.  But  in   th is   chronology,  spliced  alongside  the   US. space  events  of 
1965,  one   can  no te   the   less  publicized  decisions,  actions,  a n d   discussions 
concerned  with  the   shap ing   of  the  fu ture .   About  90  percent  of  NASA’s 
$5.175  billion  went  to  con trac tors   for   work  done  by  almost  400,000  people 
i n   the   fac tor ies   and   labora tor ies   of  some  20,000  pr ime   con trac tors   and

universities  in   all  fifty  states  were  working  on   space-related  topics. 
I n   add i t ion   to  NASA-related  events  the   chronology  gives  some  of  the   im -  
pac t   on   the   American  scene  of  the   space  effort,  inc lud ing   critical  comment 
testing  in   democratic  fash ion   the   pace  and   scale  of  space   efforts.  Actions, 
deliberations,  and   comment  as  p a r t   of  in terna t iona l   cooperation  a n d   com- 
petition  a r e   likewise  represented  in   these  pages.  Hopefully  th is   volume 
will  serve  the  serious  s tuden t   of  today  a s   he  seeks knowledge  of  past  events 
so  a s  to   better  unders tand   the   fu ture .  
The  la te  Hugh L.  Dryden  once wrote : 
Free  peoples  everywhere  must  retain  a   reliable  perspective  from  which  to  d is-  
cern  better  the  future  scientific,  social,  economic,  political,  and   strategic  con- 
sequences  of  dynamic  advances  now  underway.  The  manner  of  the  impact 
of  technology  upon  society  in   the  future  w i l l   partly  result  from  the  broadest 
possible  appreciation of  its  full significance. 
His  passing  on  December  2  of  th i s   e igh th   year   of  the   Space  Age  wa s   noted 
throughou t   the   world.  He  leaves  lasting  con tr ibu t ions   to  the  development 
of  space  technology  a n d   of  a  sound  philosophy  of  astronautics.  Th i s   vol- 
ume  helps  to  document  12   months  mark ing   what  Dr.  Dryden  called  “the 
opening  of  a  brilliant  new  stage  in  man’s  evolution.” 
I t   should  assist  its 
readers  in   ga in ing   helpful  perspective  upon  man’s  challenging  venture  in to  
space.

Th is   chronology  is  designed  to  collect  in  preliminary  form  per t inen t   in-  
formation  on  aeronau t ica l   and   space  affairs.  Fu tu re   historical  research 
and   narra t ives   will  of  course  deepen  the  process  of  documentation  a n d  
enrich  perspective  on  the   high  velocity  of  contemporary  science  and   tech- 
nology,  as  well  a s   the ir   impact  a n d   implications.  T h e   volume  was  pre-  
pared  from  open  public  sources  to  provide  a  reference  fo r   fu ture  h is tor ians  
and   o ther   analysts,  scholars,  students,  and  writers. 
I t s   detailed  index  was 
intended to prov ide  ready  access to most specialized needs. 
The   en t ire   NASA   Historical  Staff  in  Headquar ters   participated  in   source 
collection,  review,  and   publication.  The   Science  and  Technology  Division 
of  the   L ibrary   of  Congress  was  responsible  f o r  d ra f t ing   of  the  text  proper, 
in  the   persons  of  Miss  Lynn  Catoe,  Mrs.  Anne  Horton,  and   Miss  Shirley 
Medley.  The   index  was  prepared  by  Ar thur   G.  Renstrom,  also  of  the   Li-

we  have  not  had   since World  W a r   11  when the  golden  age  of  electronics

“We  have  been  in  the  ‘rocket  phase’  and  a re   now  en ter ing   the  ‘elec-

by  g ian t   meteorites bore   a  s tr ik ing   similarity  to  the  effect  produced  by 
the  larger   nuclear  weapons;  hence  a  meteorite  fall  might  be  mistaken

“.  . . Of  course,  the  question  of 
lunar   laboratories  is   now  only 
at  the   level  of  scientific  planning.  .  .  . To  bring  th i s  possibility  closer 
to  ou r   times,  it  is  necessary  to  accomplish manned  flights  to  the   region 
of  the  Moon.  Fur ther ,   we  need  to  solve  reliably  the   question  of  meth- 
ods  to  use  for   a  successful lunar   landing  of  a  spacecraft  and   the   re turn  
of  the  cosmonauts  to  Ear th .  
In   my  view,  the  first  lunar  labora tor ies  
will  initially  study  the  possibilities  of  the  prolonged  sojourn  of  man  on 
the  Moon.  Scientists  will  investigate  ways  of  using  the  lunar   condi- 
tions  for   assisting  the  norma l   life  activity  of  people.  .  . .  Finally,  the 
scientists  will  study  the  conditions  of  orientation  on  the  Moon  and   the  
possibilities of  the navigation  of  interplanetary spacecraft.” 
I n   the  same  issue  of  P ravda ,   Soviet  Academician  B.  Konstantinov

According  to  Dr.  Harold  B.  Finger,  Manager  of  AEC-NASA  Space  Nuclear 
Propulsion  Office  ( SN PO )  , NASA  would  not  spend  any  fu r the r   funds   on 
Pro jec t   O r ion   (nuc lear-pu lse  propulsion  p ro jec t ) .   The  decision  was 
based  on the  fac t  tha t   such  a  system could not  be  used while the  nuclear 
test  ban   trea ty   was  in   effect. 
In  addition,  NASA  felt  there  were  more

urgent  pro jec ts   on  which  to  spend  the  money.

no logy   tha t   the  question  of  the   probability  of  finding life  on  Mars   had  
not  been  “fully  and   fa ir ly   aired,”  and   tha t   an   “overbalance  of  the 
positive  viewpoint  has   been  presented  to  Congress  and  the   public  by 
NASA  officials.”  Dr.  Commoner  said  that  if  asked  his  views  on 
Voyager  a s  a  tax-pay ing  citizen,  his  feeling would  be  tha t   “the  value  of 
pursu ing   a  program   to  find  l i fe  on   Ma r s   a t   this  time  is  not  worth  the 
$1.25 billion  to   be  invested  because  the   problem  of  finding  life  there  
has   not  been  adequately explored.”  He  had  made  similar  charges  in  a 
speech  a t   the  AAAS   meeting  last  December  in  Montreal.

January  4 :   Dr.  Gerard  P.  Kuiper,  d irec tor   of  the  Luna r   and   P lane tary  
Labora tory   of  the   Univ.  of  Arizona  and   principal  scientific  investiga-

the  Ranger  Wo r th   the   Cost?”,  which  appeared  in  the   Christian Science 
Monitor  Nov.  18.  Mr.  Cowen had   raised  four  pr inc ipa l   questions:  (1) 
Was  the   recent  RANGER VII  mission  scientifically  jus t if iab le?  
( 2 )   W a s  
( 3 )  Were  the   results  u p   to   expecta-

( 4 )  Where  do  we  go  from   he re?  
C S M :  “Ranger  was  the  U.S.  pioneering program   of  deep-space research 
and   accomplished much more  than   getting t h e  4,300 luna r   photographs. 
I t   established  the  worth  and  feasibility  of  the   ‘parking  orbit’  and   o ther  
concepts  of  space  ballistics,  power  supply,  and   communication,  a s   well 
a s  prepara t ion   f o r  Mars   and   Venus  probes.  . . . The   cost  of  the  4,300 
luna r   records  is  therefore   not  the   full  $270  million  (wh ich   moreover 
includes  Rangers   VIII  a n d   IX ,   not  yet  flown)  bu t ,   say,  $50-$100  mil- 
lion.  N o  ground-based  effort,  even  with  the   3 0 0 - 4W i n c h   telescope 
costing over $100 million,  would,  even  in   the  absence  of  ou r   d is turb ing

I  definitely  know  of  no  better  a n d  cheaper  way

Andrew  T.  Young  of  Harvard   College  Observatory  a n d   published  in  
Science:  “.  . . I t   is  clear  tha t   there   a r e   some  things  tha t   can   only  be

Dr .   Welsh  was  also  critical  of  the  practice  of  criticizing  the   space

what  those   same  dollars  might  accomplish  “if  devoted  to  o the r   endeav- 
ors,  scientific  o r   otherwise.”  He  said  tha t   often  such   dollars  were  not 
transferab le  ; tha t   space  do l lars   might  change  the  general  climate  to  
one  favor ing   broader   a id   to   the   whole  spectrum  of  science;  and   tha t  
s ince   space   expend i tures   sough t   broader   goals  than   those  of  science, 
“ the  compar ison  may well be  invalid on  the  face of  it.” 
He  continued : “The   visionaries, whether  pr imar i ly   scientists  o r   poli- 
cy  makers,  mus t   be  given  the   opportunity  to  po in t   ou t   the   many 
benefits  which  can  flow  f rom   the   manned  and   unmanned  uses  of 
aerospace.  But,  given  such   opportunity,  they  should  use  i t   effectively 
and   affirmatively.  Regardless  of  the ir   motivations,  the pessimists who 
c ry   ou t   aga ins t   aerospace  research  and  technological  endeavors  have  
clearly  set  themselves  aga ins t   progress.  The  United  S ta tes   can   no  
lnnger  relax  and   rest  on  i ts   past  indus tr ia l   laurels.  The  race   fo r   s u r -  
vival,  literally  and  philosophically, i s  on.  Of  course,  we  would  all  like 
to   believe  in   the   solely  non-aggressive  uses  of  aerospace  by  all  coun-  
tr ies   which  have   the   needed  technology.  However,  the  realities  of  life 
dictate  adequa te   prepara t ion   t o   preserve  ou r   na t iona l   and  F ree  Wor ld

Howard  S imons   commented  i n   the   Wa sh in g t on   Post  tha t   these  re-

mission  tha t   could  be  performed  by  a  number  of  different  propulsion 
concepts.  For   example,  manned  tr ips   by  chemical  rockets  would  be 
weight-restricted,  but  chemical  rocket  systems  would  have  the  advan-  
tage   of  having  been  extensively 
flight-tested  on  many  o ther

problem  of  much  higher  spacecraft  speed  ( a n d   thu s   hea t ing) .   Re- 
search  indicates  “ tha t   the  more  pointed  shape, although  it  doesn’t  show 
up  too  well  a t   the  lower  re-entry  speeds, is  better  than   the  blunt  nose  a t  
the  higher  speeds  because  the  bow  shock  is  weaker,  thus  produc ing  
lower  rad ian t   heating  losses.  Thus,  in  a  very  short  time  scale,  bu t  
taking  a  b ig   leap   forward   in  the   velocity-temperature scale,  we  find 
ourselves going in to  ano ther  phase of  the  blunt vs.  pointed nose cycle. 
“.  . . The   switching between  slender  and   blunt  shapes is  not  new  in  
times  of  history.  Going  through  
the  race   for   h i g h   speeds  a i   a!!

NASA   Associate  Adm in is tra tor   Dr.  Rober t   C .   Seamans,  Jr.,  labeled 
the   budget  an   austere  one,  bu t   sa id   the   chances  of  land ing   a  man   on  
the   moon  by  1970  were  still  good. 
In   discussing  the   new  programs ,  
Dr.  Seamans  said  the   requested  $43  million  f o r   Voyager   would  be 
spent  on  pro jec t   definition  of  the   spacecraf t  bus   and   land ing   capsule  to 
explore  Mars   in  the   next  decade.  Th i s   fund ing   would  a lso   enab le  
NASA   to   make  a  Mar t ian   fly-by  in   1969  to   test  the  spacecraf t   and  
launch  vehicle pr ior   to  the  1971 and   1973 missions. 
Ma jor   por t ions   of  the   DOD  space  budge t   were  alloted  fo r   the   follow- 
ing :   ( 1 )  pre-program   definition  phase   of  the   Manned   Orb i t ing   Labo-

spacecraf t ;   ( 3 )  con t inued   development  of  the   T i tan   111  space  boos ter ;  
( 4 )  development  of  the  Defense Communications  Satellite System. 
Two  th i rd s   of  AEC’S  budget  request  was  earmarked   for  development 
of  nuc lear   rocket  propulsion  and   nuc lear   power  sources   fo r   space 
applications.  The  nuclear  propulsion  program ,   P ro jec t   Rover,  was  a l -  
loted  $W . l   million ; the   nuclear  power  source   p rog ram ,   Snap ,   $70.5

P lu to  reac tor  program  was not  included  in  the  budge t  request.

Nation  has   embarked  on  a  bold  p rog ram   of  space  exp lora t ion   and  
research  which  holds  promise  of  r ich   rewards  in   many  fields  of  Ameri-

ASTRONAUT ICS   AND   AERONAUTICS,  1965 
January   25:  NASA   Administrator  James   E.  Webb  and   DOD   Secretary  Rober t  
S. McNamara   announced NASA-DOD  agreement  on   the  Manned Orb i t ing  
Labora tory   (M o l ) ,   released  in  conjunction  with  FY  1966  budget: 
“.  .  . P lann ing   for  the  Defense  manned  orb i t ing   laboratory  program  
will  also  consider,  in   cooperation  with  NASA,  broader   objectives  of  sci- 
entific  and   general  technological  significance. 
“TO de term ine  the  essential  characteristics  of  the  vehicle  tha t   will  be 
required,  the  DOD   will  continue  intensive  studies  and   design  of  experi- 
ments and  systems aimed a t  the pr imary  military  objectives. 
“Cooperative  studies,  by  NASA  and   Defense,  will  identify  and   define 
scientific  and   general  technological  experiments  which  might  be  car-  
ried  out,  with  NA SA   participation,  in  conjunction  with  th e   m i l i tary  
program .  
“DOD ,   with  assistance  from  NASA ,   will  compare   configurations  of 
Apollo  which  may  be  suitable  for   military  experiments with  the  Gemi- 
n i   B-MOL  configuration  to   determine  the  complete system  th a t  c an  meet 
the  pr imary   military  objectives  in  a  more  efficient, less costly, o r   more 
timely  fashion. 
“On  the  basis  of  these  studies,  a  decision  will  be  made  whether  t o  
proceed  with  full-scale  development  by  Defense  of  a  manned  orb i t ing  
labora tory   system  and  what  the  specific  developments  and   vehicle 
configurations  are   to   be.  Th e   Defense  budget  includes  $150  million 
in  FY   1966 f o r  the program.  .  . . 
“Depending  upon  the  manned  orb i t ing   labora tory   decision,  upon  the  
progress  in  the  Gemini  and   Apollo  programs,  and  upon  the   results  of 
NASA   studies,  a  decision  will  be  made  whether  to  proceed  with 
modifications  to  the  Apollo  system  and   the   na ture   and  timing  of  neces- 
sary   specific  developments.  The   NASA   1966  budget  includes  abou t   $50 
million  for  proceeding  with  design  and   pacing  developments.  . . .” 
(NA SA   Budget  Briefing  FY   1966 )  
NASA  Associate  Administrator  Dr.  Robert  Seamans   said  dur ing   FY 
1966   budget  briefing:  “.  .  .  it  is   conceivable  . . . th a t   the   lunar  
land ing   would  occur  in  early  1970   .  .  . we  feel  actually  greatly  en-  
couraged  a t   the  progress  that  has   been  made   freezing  the  design,  and  
we  feel  very  reassured  a t   the  test  results  we  a r e   achieving  on   our 
propulsion  systems  and  with  o u r   stages.  So   tha t   we  really  feel  th a t  
there  is  more   chance  tha t   we  can   get  off  the  flight  o n   an   ear l ier   mis- 
sion than   I would  have sa id  a year   ago.” 
Dr.  Seamans   said  Apollo  gave  the  nation  a  capability  for  a  wide 
variety  of  scientific  and   technological  flights  in  earth  orb i t ,   in   orb i t  
a round   the  moon,  and   also  for   an   extended  lunar   stay  time.  He   com- 
mented  tha t   the  objectives  of  the  curren t   extended  Apollo  (Apollo-X) 
design  and  feasibility  studies  were  to   extend  the  time  of  th e   lun a r  
mission  ou t   to  the  o rd e r   of  two  weeks.  He   also  said  th a t   Apollo-X 
c ircum lunar   flights,  in  polar  orb i t   abou t   the  moon  and  tak ing   pho-  
tographs  of  the  entire  lunar   surface,  on  missions  that  could  involve 
staytimes on   the  moon  of  up  t o   one  o r   two  weeks,  all would  have  grea t  
possibility  and   would  offer   grea t   interest  scientifically. 
I n   comment- 
ing  on  a n   ear l ier   agreement  (1963 )   with  the  Pentagon  f o r   developing 
of  a  manned   orb i t ing   labora tory ,   Dr.  Seamans  s a id :   “At  the  time  of

tha t   agreement,  we  were  really  th ink ing   of  something  th a t   we  now 
realize  is  fur ther   ou t   in   time,  namely,  a  more  permanent  space  station 
tha t   could  stay  in  orb i t   for   a  year’s  t ime   and   could  be  resupplied,  and  
would  permit  the  crew  to  be  ferr ied   into  o rb i t   a n d   b r ing   them 
back.  T h e   study  really  related  to   tha t   kind  of  possibility  which  we 
now  realize  is  much  fur ther   out  in  time  .  . . we  may  end  up   with 
what  is  called  the  MOL ,   and  we  may  also  find  tha t   there  a r e   impor tan t  
uses  for  the  Apollo  system  beyond  the  present  manned  lun a r   land ing  
program.’’ 
He  sa id   NASA  studies  of  improving  both  the   S a tu rn   I B   and   the  Sa t-  
urn   V  launch  vehicles  indicated  th a t   “these  two  launch   vehicles  c an

Janua ry   25:  NA SA   announced  two  Radio  Astronomy  Exp lorer   satellites 
(RAE -A   and   RAE -B )   would  be  designed  to   investigate  low-frequency 
( long   wavelength)  emissions  f rom   ou r   galaxy,  its  planets,  and   the 
stars.  These  emissions  are   mostly  intercepted  by  the  ionosphere  so 
tha t   little  can  be  learned  about  them  from  ground-based  receivers. 
Th is   would  be  the  first  attempt  to   map  the  galaxy  fo r   low-frequency 
emissions.  T h e   280-lb.  spacecraft  would  be  launched  by  Thrus t-  
Augmented  Delta  in to   circular  orb i ts   a t   altitudes  of  abou t   3,700  mi. 
and   would  measure  the  intensity  of  the  signals,  the ir   frequency,  times 
of  emission  and ,   within  limitations,  define  the   regions  of  space  i n  
which  they  originated.  Proposed  designs  called  for   the  development 
of  two  750-ft.,  V-shaped  antennas  tha t   would  be  mounted  opposite 
each   other,  forming  a  g ian t   X.  They  would  be  anchored  to   the  basic 
spacecraft,  a  cylinder  of  abou t   40-by-40  in.,  capped  by  two  truncated 
cones.  NASA   Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  would  design,  integrate,

“ In   considering  the   merits  of  canceling  certain  vehicles  i n   o rde r   to

“The   result  of  the   study  i s   par t icu lar ly   interesting  in  th a t   it  shows  a

collecting d a t a  on  possible  life-forms elsewhere  and  some  of  the  fac tors  
mak ing   the  search  for   ex tra terres tr ia l   l ife   so  challenging.  He  noted 
the   complications  for   Mar t ian   life-detection  i f   retrorockets  were  neces- 
sa ry   to   brake   the   land ing   of  a  scientific  package:  “First,  of  course, 
they   add   weight  to  the   land ing   package,  r igh t   where  it  hu r t s   the   most. 
Also,  the ir   control  adds  complexity  and   increases the   chance of  fa i lure .  
Finally  and   perhaps  most  importantly,  they  would  make  the   problem 
of  life-detection  more  difficult  and   any  results  more   ambiguous ; the  
rocket  exhaust  would  tend  both  to   fuse  the   surface   of  the  land ing   a rea  
(maybe   even  killing  any   existing  o rgan i sm s ) ,   and   to   add  combustioii 
con tam inan ts   of  its  own  in   the  most  crucial  area-around 
the   lander.”

ex tra terres tr ia l   life  ( o r  clues  of  l i fe )   a n d   explained  why  the   dependa-

tential  in  the  shor t-hau l  ‘aerial  bus.’  Both  VTOL  (ver t ica l   take-off and  
l and ing )   and   STOL   ( sho r t   take-off  and   l and in g )   a r e   be ing   considered 
fo r   this  job .   .  . . On   the  basis  of  ou r   curren t   knowledge  I  would  con- 
clude  the   VTOL   commercial  transpor t   offers  tremendous  potential  bu t  
requires  additional  research  .  . . before  i t   is  ready  for   detailed  feasi- 
bility  study  as  a  commercial  transpor t .   On  the   o ther   h and   the  STOL 
machine  is   ready  for   a  careful  examination  since  the  m a jo r   problems 
seem  to   be  in  hand. 
“A  20  t o   50  passenger  STOL   machine  should,  o r   could,  have   a  top  
speed  of  300  t o   400  knots,  a  steep  approach   with  a  touch  down  a t   45  
knots  and   an   operational  field  length  of  some  120 0  to  1500 feet.  All- 
weather  operation  is  required  and ,   with  the  a id   of  space  technology 
advances,  this  appears   qu i te   possible.  We  th ink   we  can   display  elec- 
tronically  t o   the  pilot  the  impor tan t   features  of  the   a i rpo r t   so  tha t   he  
c an   approach   i t   and   land  using  the  same  information  tha t   h e   does  i n  
clear  weather. 
“We  see  two  large  markets  fo r   vehicles  of  this  type. 
I n   a  smaller 
simple  version,  perhaps   bear ing   a  little  sacrifice  in  performance,  an   a i r  
transpor t   well  suited  fo r   use  in  underdeveloped  areas.  Rugged,  easy 
to   f ly   and   simple  to  maintain,  it  could  enable  these  countries  to   jump  
f r om  jung le   o r   desert  tra i ls   to   modern  transpor t   system  without  build- 
ing   enormously  expensive  railways  and  highways.  Th i s   would  b e   a 
good  market  for   U S .   industry. 
I n   a  larger   sophisticated  version  i t  
could  b e   the  vehicle  to   make  the  present  shor t   hau l   feeder  lines  self 
sufficient, not  depending  on  connecting  traffic  f rom   the  t runk   lines. 
T h i s  too  would  be  a  desirable  situation  fo r   American  industry.  NASA  
plans  to   pursue   both  of  these  potentials  actively  until  the   a i r   indus try  
h a s  enough confidence in  success to  proceed  on   its  own.  . . .”

of  his  physical  inferiority,  man   has  been  able  to  ad jus t   himself

February 2 :   Ph i lco  Corp.,  opposing the  bid  by  the  Communications Satellite 
Corpora t ion  to   supply  DOD  with  communications satellite  service,  asked 
the  FCC   to   prevent  ComSatCorp  from   s ign ing   a  “sole  source”  con trac t

satellite  system  for  DOD  under  a  contract  awarded  i n   Ju ly   1963,  sa id  
ComSatCorp’s proposed  contract  “is in  violation of  the le t ter   and   sp i r i t  
of  the  F C C  rules  and   regulations  which  requ ire   competition  in  ComSat-

requirements  impel  waiver  of  the  FCC’S  rules  and   regulations  i s   i n -  
supportable,”  Philco  said. 
Under   ComSatCorp’s plan,  DOD   would  be  supplied  24  satellites  built 
by  Hughes A ircraf t   Co.  and   would  pay  for   service  only  if  the   satellites

Dr.  Homer  E.  Newell,  NASA   Associate  Adm in is tra tor   f o r   Space  
Science and  Applications,  ou t l in ing  progress  made  toward   the   objective 
of  so lar   system  exploration,  sa id :   “ . . . I t   would  appear   . . . tha t  
enough  experience  a n d   know-how  ha s   been  accumulated  to  make  the  
move  to  a  five-ton Voyager  spacecraft  on  the   Sa tu rn   IB  Cen taur   launch  
vehicle  a  reasonable next  step  in   the   unmanned  exploration  of  the   so la r  
system.  There   is  no  question  bu t   tha t   the   size  a n d  weight  of  Voyager, 
plus  the   increased  demands   tha t   will  be   placed  upon  i t ,   will  make  the  
development  of  the  Voyager  a  complex  and   difficult  under tak ing .  
But  certainly,  the  O rb i t ing   Geophysical  Observatory  a n d   Mar iner  
have  shown  us  tha t   we  can   deal  successfully  with  complexity.  As  a 
matter  of  fact,  the  increased  weight  and   size  may   afford  considerable 
relief  from   the  need  to   ta i lor   every  last  function  to  a  gnat’s  eyebrow 
in   order   to  achieve  the   intended  mission,  as  h a s   been  the   case 
hitherto.  . . .” 
Dr.  Newell  sa id   tha t   reliability  was  probab ly   the  most  difficult 
problem  fo r   deep-space  long-dura t ion   missions  and   tha t   “.  .  .  the  
development  of  adequate  spacecraft  sys tems   will  not  be   the   problem. 
The   most  serious  threa t   to  long  life  opera t ion   will  lie  i n   the   potential 
random   fa i lure  of  one  o r  more   [spacecraft]  components.” 
He  added  tha t   this would  probably  be  an   ever-decreasing problem  a s  
we  gained  experience  with  launch  vehicles  and   tha t   “.  .  . launch  
vehicle reliability  is   f a r  less  a  difficult program   than   tha t   of  long  space- 
craf t   lifetime  fo r   very  deep-space missions.’’ 
I n   conclusion,  Dr.  Newell  sa id :   “ . . .  Nevertheless,  the   time 
has   arr ived   when  many  thoughtful  people  urge  a  vigorous  p rog ram   of 
solar  system  exploration.  The   Pres iden t   h a s   in   h is   Fiscal  Year   1966

development  of  a  launch  vehicle  consisting  of  the   Sa tu rn   I B   plus 
the  Centaur.  F ina l   decision  a s   to  whether  to  move  ahead   with  the  
development of  the  Voyager  spacecraft  would  come  a  little  over  a  year

although  we  insist  tha t   Mars   should  not  be  con tam ina ted   by  te r -  
restrial  life  before  we  search  f o r  Mar t ian   life,  we  fail  to  recognize  tha t  
this  is   tantamount  to  say ing   tha t   the  U.S. must  get  there   first,  because

go  ahead  and   devote  efforts  to  develop  a  p rog ram   to  land   on  Mars   i n

Temple  Neumann,  Automated  Biological  Labora tory   program   engi-

re-emphasized  “the  disastrous  effects  tha t   an  unsterilized  spacecraft 
could  have   on   Mars.  . . . If  a  single  micro-organism  should  land   on 
Mars   a n d   have   a  replication  time  of  30  days,  i t   could  grow  to   the

compete  with  Mar t ian   l i fe   bu t   could  result  in  drastic  changes  in   the

JPL’S  Gera ld  A.  Soffen said  tha t   “since  the   decision  between  Mar iner

suggested  tha t   an   800-lb.  spacecraft  could make  a  fly-by of  Mars,  using 
the  Venus  swing-by  technique  a n d   re tu rn   to  ea r th   to   enable  recovery

“ In   prepara t ion   of  th is  budget,  the  President  ha s  faced two  impor tan t  
facts.  The   first  of  these  is  tha t   the  cen tra l   core   of  NASA   activities  a s  
planned  in   1961 is   proceeding with  excellent results.  .  . . 
“The  second  ma jor   fact  faced  by  the   Pres iden t   was  the  necessity  for  
a  continued  emphasis  on  supporting  research  and  development.  .  .  , 
“Bearing  these  two  facts  in  mind,  this  budget  and   this  request  for  
au thor iza t ion   call  for   an  operating  level  which  is  approximately  the  
same  as  tha t   approved  by  Congress  fo r   fiscal  years   1964.  and  1965. 
This  means  tha t   the  work  planned  in  1961 for  accomplishment  in  th is  
decade  must  be   spread   out  over  a  longer  per iod ,   a n d   the  cost  fo r   the  
total  will  be  increased.  .  .  . 
“The  essential  funds  to  give  us  some  opportunity  to   make  the  luna r  
landing  within  this  decade  a re   included.  as  are   funds   for studies toward 
fur ther   use  of  the  Sa turn   launch  vehicles and   the   A P ~ O I I O - L E M  manned 
space  flight  systems  in  the  period  following  the  lunar  land ing .   By 
1969, we  will  have  the  capability  to   launch  6  Saturn-IB’s and   6  Sa turn  
V’s  per  year. 
I n   the  unmanned  area ,   we  have  begun  planning  fo r   a 
Voyager-Mars  mission  in  1971  with  the  possibility  of  a  test  flight  in  
1969 ;   funds   a r e   included  in  the   budget  for   expansion  of  this  design 
effort  dur ing   fiscal  year  1966.  Development  and  hardware  procure-

“Efficient  use  of  available  resources  is  a  ma jo r   consideration  in   the 
conduct  of  the  Apollo  program ,   whereas  a  crash   p rog ram   follows  the 
most  expeditious  course  regardless  of  cost. 
6 6  Finally,  crash   programs   typically  have  goals  beyond  the  existing 
state  of  technology  a n d  pursue   these  goals  under  the  pressure  of  having 
to  achieve  a  technological  break through .   Apollo,  on  the  o ther   hand ,  
harnesses  curren t   technology  in   the   development  of  launch   vehicles, 
spacecraft  and   facilities  to   perm i t   effective  space  exp lora t ion .   The 
greatest  challenges  in   Apollo,  in   fact,  a re   in  the   in tegra t ion   of  those 
systems  and   the   men  who  must  fly  them  a s   well  a s   the   provision  of 
ground   operational  suppor t ,   and   the   overall  management  of  th is   en ter-  
prise.” 
Dr.  Mueller  said  tha t   da ta   received  and   analysis  con t inued   in  1964 
regard ing   rad ia t ion   and   the  lunar   surface   indicated  tha t   these  ma t ters  
were  of  less  importance  than   had   been  previously  deduced:  “.  .  . 
F irs t ,  the   chance of  a  significant so lar  event  occurr ing  du r ing   a  mission 
is  very  low.  Second,  if  the  worst  solar  flare  previously  observed  had  
occurred  dur ing   an  Apollo mission,  the  maximum  dose  tha t   could  have 
been  received a t  the bloodforming  organs  by  as tronau ts  in   the   command 
module  would  have  been  abou t   10  per  cent  of  the  allowable  safe  dose, 
ra ther   than   15  per  cent  as  estimated  last  year. 
Regarding  the  lunar   surface.  the  da ta   from  R A N G E R   V I I   have  been 
“ 
very  helpful.  The  large   area  photography  has   indicated  the  probab i l i ty  
tha t   there   are  many  areas  of  the  moon’s  surface  where  the  design  of  the

“The   accuracy  requ iremen ts   f o r   all  these  missions  a r e   almost  i n -

o r  5  miles  pe r   second,  and   the  booster  and   spacecraft were  accelerating 
a t  approx ima te ly  240  feet  per   second  a t   a  steadily  increasing rate.  A t  
booster  cutoff,  each  e r r o r   of  1.4 feet  per   second  resulted  in  a  difference 
of  approx ima te ly  1 mile  in  apogee  on  the   fa r   side  of  the  Ear th .   Whcn

in   opera t ion   of  relays.  valves,  and   thrus t   term ina t ion ,  it  looks  like  a n  
almost  impossibly  accurate  requirement.

February 20: R A N G E R   V I I I   lunar   photography  probe   struck  its  targe t   on   the  
moon  a t   4:57:36.8  EST ,   af ter   rad io ing   to   ear th   abou t   7,000  close-up 
pictures  of  the  lunar   surface  dur ing   the  last  2 3   min.  of  flight.  Th e  
point  of  impact  was  2.59”  nor th   latitude,  24.77’  east  longitude,  in  the 
Sea  of  Tranquillity,  an   area   slightly  east-northeast  of  the  center  of  a 
full  moon.  The  spacecraft  impacted  a t   slightly  less  than   6,000  mph. 
Total  distance  of  travel  along  its  tra jec tory   from   lift-off  h ad   been 
calculated  as   248,766  mi.  Accuracy  of  the  shot  was  reflected  in  the 
fact  tha t   impact  had   been  planned  for   4:57:30,  and   a t   3”   nor th   la t i-  
tude   and   24”   east  longitude. 
R A N G E R   V I I I   had  been  programed   to   execute  a  “ term ina l   sequence” 
j u s t   before  impact  to   point  the  six  TV   cameras   more  in  the  direction 
of  flight;  this  sequence  was  omitted  to  allow  the  cameras   t o   cover  a 
larger   area   than  planned  and   to   provide  greater  continuity  with  the  
pictures  transmitted  by  R A N G E R   V I I   last  Ju ly   31.  A  second  change  in 
the  flight  was  to  tu rn   on   cameras   2 3  min.  before  impact  instead  of  13 
min.  and   40  sec.  as  planned.  Th e   new  time  had   been  chosen  so  tha t  
initial  pictures  would  be  about  equa l   to   earth-based  resolution  and  
then  continue  into  impact. 
Two  small  anomalies:  one  par t   of  the  spacecraft  had   registered  a 
higher  temperature  than   had   been  anticipated  and  more  telemetry  d a t a  
had   been  lost  dur ing   midcourse  maneuver  than   had   been  expected.

conference  tha t   one  of  the   most  impor tan t   results  of  th is   flight  had  
been  the   discovery  tha t   the   Sea  of  Clouds  and   the  Sea   of  T r an -  
quillity  were  similar  in  s truc ture .   He  noted  several  “odd   depressed 
regions”  and   said tha t   they  could  be  areas  where collapse h a d  occurred, 
which  m igh t   suggest  the   presence  of  lava  fields.  H e   believed  the  luna r  
su r face  was  composed  of  very  light,  fro thy   ma ter ia l   such  as  would  be  
formed   when  rock  was  melted  and   allowed  to   resolidify  within  a  h igh  
vacuum,  like tha t  on  the  moon.  The  material envisioned by  Dr. Ku iper  
might  be  considered  s im i lar   to   cer ta in   volcanic  rocks  found  on  ea r th :  
while  i t   would  probably  be  lighter  than   water,  it  could  still  have  sub -  
s tan t ia l  s treng th .   Th i s  theory  was based  on  labora tory  attempts several 
years   ago   to   simulate  cond i t ions   existing  when  the   moon  was  formed. 
Ewen  A.  Wh i taker   of  the  Univ.  of  Arizona  sa id   he  felt  the  luna r  
ma ter ia l ,   which  he  though t   had   a  consistency  of  crunchy  snow,  would 
suppor t   a  manned  spacecraft.  He  said  color  lines  and  sh a rp   bound-  
ar ies  tended  to  show  tha t   the  surface  was  some  sor t   of  fro thy ,  lava-like 
ma ter ia l   and   definitely  not  dust. 
Ano ther   member  of  the  Pane l ,   Dr .   Haro ld   C .  Urey,  of  the   Univ.  of 
California,  noted  dimples  on  the   moon’s  surface  a n d   said  the ir   curved 
walls  indicated  material  must  have  been  thrown  out  of  the ir   cen ters  
when  comparatively  soft  te r ra in   was  gouged  by   heavy  masses  of  rock. 
He  though t   he  saw  spots  i n   the   center  of  some  dimples  in to   which  sof t  
ma ter ia l   m igh t   be  d ra in ing   and   estimated  the   dep th   of  some   dimples

February 2 4 :   Dr .   Raymond  L.  Bisplinghoff,  NASA   Associate  Adm in is tra tor  
f o r  Advanced  Research  and   Technology,  told  the  House  Committee  on  
Science  and  Astronautics  th a t   “although  space  research,  development, 
and   operations  have  absorbed  much  of  our   resources  within  the  past

s trong   program   of  aeronautical  research  keyed  to  the   Nation’s  needs.” 
He   testified:  “.  . . The   [aeronautics]  program   embraces  the   en t ire  
spectrum  of  flight  from  lowspeed  private  and   V /STOL   a ircraf t   to  hy -

evolution  of 
supersonic  transpor t   proposals,  and   in  the  solution  of  j e t   transpor t  
rough  a i r   problems.  Looking  ahead  to  FY   1966,  we  are   requesting 
$42.2  million  in  Research  and  Development  fo r   aeronautics.  Th is  
figure  can  be  separated  into  two  categories:  one  funds   a  broad   a n d  
con t inu ing   effort  in  the  scientific  disciplines  underlying  advances  in 
all  areas  of  a i r   transpor ta t ion ,   civil  and   m i l i tary ;   th e   o ther   fun d s   a

the  Research  and  Development  request  in   FY  1966  fo r   aeronau t ics   is  
$42.2 million,  we  expect  to  spend  a  total  sum  of  $106.2 million  in  th i s

establish  o u r   coupling  with  indus try   and   the   private  scientific  com- 
munity.  . . .” 
Repor t ing   on  contract  administration,  M r .   Friedl  testified : 
“The  
cost  reimbursement con trac t  ha s  been the basic instrument fo r  procur ing  
research  and   development because  the   Government  has had   to   risk  the  
uncertainties  and  assume the h igh   cost  involved.  No   other  type  of  con-  
trac t   provides  the  Government  and   the  con trac tor   the  la t i tude   and  
flexibility  needed  to   relate  scientific  and   technical  requirements, 
schedules  a n d   use  of  resources  to  mission  objectives.  By  add ing   in -  
centive  provisions  per ta in ing   to   time,  quality  and   cost  to   th is   type  of 
con trac t ,   i t   is  our   intention  to   offset  some  of 
its  deficiencies  a n d  
strengthen  the  purpose  of  the   Government-contractor relationship. 
“NASA   h a s   made  a  concerted  effort  to   in troduce   suitable  incentive 
arrangemen ts   in   ou r   cost  reimbursement  type  contracts  whenever 
practicable. 
I n   each  case,  the  objective  is   to   encourage  the   con trac tor  
to  manage   better  and   improve  his  performance ;   adhere  to   schedules; 
and   hold  down  costs. 
As  a  consequence  of  ou r   incentive  con trac t ing   drive,  there   ha s  
C 6  
been  a  marked  increase in  th is   activity  in   the  past  4%  years. 
In   fiscal 
year  1961  we  had   one  contract  worth  abou t   $100,000.  By  December 
31,  1964,  we  had   awarded  75  contracts  with  a  target  value  of  over 
$751  million,  7  of  these  have  been  completed  leaving  68  contracts 
totalling  over  $724 million  curren t ly   being  administered.  . . . 
“ In   view  of  the  undesirable  features  of  letter  contracts,  NASA   Head-  
quar ters   began  a  concerted  e f fo r t ,  ear ly   i n   1963, t o   curtail the   issuance 
of  new  le t ter   contracts  and   to   assure  the   timely  definitization  of  all 
ou ts tand ing   letter  contracts.  Headquar ters   issued  instructions  to   all 
centers  d irec t ing   program   a n d   project  managers   to  plan  ahead  and  
arleqiiate  lead  time  fo r   the  in i t ia l   negotiation  of   definitive  con- 
.!!ow 
tracts.  . . .  At  the   end  of  January   only  3  le t ter   contracts  hav ing   a 
total  value  of  $4 million  were  outstanding.  We  expect  tha t   these  con-  
trac ts  will  be   definitized  in March  1965.” 
M r .   Fr ied l   said  tha t   NASA   had   “s truc tured   a  sound  practicable  man-  
ager ia l   technique  to   direct  the  planning,  approval  and   execution 
of  . . .  fu tu re   programs.  We  believe  tha t   adoption  of  what  we  have  
termed  ‘phased  project  planning’  will  materially  assist  u s   in   achieving 
th is   goal. 
“Phased  project  planning  represents  an  orderly  sequential  progres-

It  provides fo r   formulat-

roles  of  NA SA   and   DOD:  “NASA’s role  is   to  explore  and   exploit  space  for  
peaceful  purposes.  The   DOD’S  role  is   to . s tay   prepared   to  defend  the

In   a  letter  of  explanation  to  Congress,  NASA   discussed  pr ior i t ies   in  the  
FY   1966  budget:  “.  .  . As   the  President  pointed  out  when  h e   sub -  
I t  
mitted  the  budget  to   the  Congress,  ‘It  is  a  budget  of  priorities. 
provides  for  what  we  must  do,  but  not  for  all we  would  like  to   do.’ 
I n  
assessing  priorities  and  the  most  urgent  national  needs,  the  260-inch 
solid  propellant  rocket  program ,   the  M-1 
l iqu id   hydrogen-oxygen 
rocket  engine  capable  of  providing  l*/z  million  pounds  of  thrus t ,   and  
the  SNAP-8 nuclear  electric  power  generating  system  t o   provide  35  
kilowatts  of  electrical  power  in  space  could  no t   be  supported  in   the  
Fiscal  Year   1966  budget. 
“.  . .  [ N A S A ]   is,  therefore,  prepar ing   plans  for  reprogramm ing   Fis- 
cal  Year  1965 funds  so  a s   to  logically  phase  out  these  program   activi- 
ties  in  such  a  way  as  to  obtain  as   much  technical  informa t ion   as   is 
possible  for  fu ture   use.  .  . .  Every  effort  is  be ing   made   to   achieve 
the greatest possible benefit  from the  funds  already  invested.”

Prof .   Thomas  Gold,  Cornel1  Univ.  astronomer,  discussing  RANGER  
V I I I   photographs  in  an  interview  with  John   Lear,  Wor ld   Book  Ency- 
clopedia  Science  Service,  Inc.,  suggested  tha t   long,  narrow   rills  and  
irregu lar   depressions  could  be  caused  by  moon’s  surf ace  collapsing 
into  crevasses  opened  by  the  movement  of  a  glacier  hidden  beneath 
lunar   dust.  He  a t tr ibu ted   gently  rounded  shapes to   a  sh if t ing   of  small 
particles  by  electrical  forces  which,  on   ear th ,   were  inh ib i ted   by  
atmosphere.  Concerning  the  manned  expedition,  Gold  indicated : 
“The  presence  of  ice   oceans  could  give  r ise   t o   many   problems.  But 
once  these  were  solved,  the   ice  itself  could  be  mined  and   used  t o  make 
hydrogen  for   fuel  fo r   rockets  re turn ing   to   Earth.”  Referr ing   t o   the  
electrically-charged  particles:  “Many  particles  would  be  dislodged  me- 
chanically  by 
the  landing  of  a  spacecraft  or  the  footstep  of  a 
man.  Once  loose,  the  dust  would  jump   in   response  to  electrical  a t trac-  
t ion   o r   repulsion. 
If  particles  landed  on  the  astronaut’s  visor,  brush-  
ing   wouldn’t  remove  them  bu t   would  instead  intensify  the  electrical 
charges  affecting  the ir   behavior.”  Dr.  Gold  recommended  more   re-

Science  and   Applications  Dr.  Homer  E.  Newell  testified  before   the  
House  Committee on  Science and   Astronautics,  Subcommittee on   Space 
Sciences  and   Applications:  “A  preliminary  study  and   design  phase   is  
being  initiated  by  NASA   th is   Fiscal Year   [for   adap ta t ion   of  the   Centaur 
to   the   Sa turn   I B ] .   T h e   pr imary   mission  for   this  vehicle  is   the

In i t ia l   studies  indicate  this  vehicle  is  capable  of  launch ing  
a  payload  to   Mars   in  excess  of  8000 pounds  du r in g  all  of  the  oppor tu-

sent  a  large  engineering  effort,  but  there  is  no th ing   apparen t   a t   th is  
time  which  indicates  tha t   new  technologies will  be  requ ired .   The   Cen-

the  technical  problems  associated  with  adaptation  of  the  Centaur  to  this 
new  booster  a r e  significantly  reduced  and   the  diameter  requ ired   for   all

Dr.  Newell  described  NASA’s sustaining  university  program   as   an  
effort  “to  broaden  the  national  research  base  in   areas   of  importance  to  
the  national  space  effort  and   increase  o u r   capability  to  replenish  con- 
tinually  the  reservoir  of  basic knowledge.  . . . 
“In   response  to   the  continuing  manpower  requirements,  NASA   con- 
ducts  a  predoctoral  tra in ing   program ,   under  which  gran ts   a r e  made   t o  
universities  to  select  and   tra in   outstanding  students  in   space-related

Aeronautics  and   Space  Council,  made   h is   first  address  on   the   U S .  
space  p rog ram   a t   the  Goddard   Memorial  Dinner  sponsored  by   the  
National  Space   Club  in   Washington,  D.C.  He  sa id :   “ I   in tend   to   be 
program  which  will 
an   advocate  of  a  dynam ic   space  program-a 
succeed  in  reach ing   to  goals we  have  set-and 
one  which  will  see  new 
goals-one 
tha t   can  see  beyond  the   moon  and   in to   fields where  we  can 
only  speculate abou t  the  knowledge  awa i t ing  us.” 
The  Vice  Pres iden t   spoke  briefly  abou t   th e   Soviet  Union’s  VOSKHOD  
11  flight:  “ I t   i s   well  for   us   from   time  to   t ime   to  take  stock-to 
take   a

with  ou r  ma in   competitor.  The   facts  a re   tha t   we  d o  have  very  s t rong  
competition  and   hence  we  have  ano ther   b ig   reason  for   a  m a jo r   space 
effort-namely, 
prudence.  Ou r   na t iona l   security  alone  would  suggest 
reason  enough   fo r   u s   to  s tr ive  fo r   absolute  leadersh ip  i n  space  explora- 
tion.” 
Humphrey  pointed  out  that  the   Soviets  remained  ahead  in   propu l-  
sion  for   the ir   rockets,  while  the  U S .   continued  to   lead  “in  the   directly 
useful  fields  of  weather  repor t ing ,   nav iga t ion ,   and   communications.” 
He  con t inued :   “The   Soviets  clearly  have  an   advan tage   i n   s tudy ing   the  
effects  of  space  environment  on  human   beings.  .  . .  We  can  salute 
the  Russian  achievements  .  . . but  we  would  be  foolish  if  we  d id   not 
unders tand   the   military  implications  of  Soviet  space  science  a s   well 
as   our   own. 
“Each   Russian  shock  h a s   produced   action  here .

shock 
should  not  need 
nation  . .  . bu t   we  would  ignore   the  real  interests  of  the  free   world  if  
we  diminished  ou r  military  efforts  in  space.” 
In  the  pr inc ipa l   precentatinn;  the  widow  of  the  scientist  presented 
the  Robert  H.  Goddard  Memorial  Trophy   to   Dr .  William  H.  Pickering,

The   “chief  theoretician,”  jo in t   d irec tor   of  the  Soviet  space  program .

March   20:  Pres iden t   Johnson.  asked  du r ing   a  press   conference,  “where 
does  o u r   space  program   s tand   in   relation  to   the  Soviets’ in  th e  wake  of 
the ir   latest  fea t?”   replied:  “The  Soviet  accomplishment  and   ou r   own 
scheduled  efforts  demonstrate,  I  th ink   dramatically  and  convincingly, 
the  impor tan t   role  that  man  himself  will  play  in   the  exploration  of  the  
space  fron t ier .   The   con t inu ing   efforts  of  both  our   program  and   the  
Russian  program   will  steadily  produce  capability  and  new  space 
activity.  Th is   capability.  i n   my  judgment,  will  help  each   na t ion  
achieve  b roade r   confidence  to  do   what  they  consider  they  ough t   to   d o

satellite  nor   the   orb i t   in  which  it  was  traveling  was  identified. 
The   cosmonauts  related  the  par t   tha t   each   had  played.  Col.  Be- 
lyayev  h ad   operated  the   controls  of 
the   decompression  chamber

af ter   decompression,  he  was  “struck  by   a  flow  of  blindingly  br igh t  
sun l igh t   like  an   a rc   o f   electric  welding.”  The   spacecraft  was  i n   i ts  
second  orb i t ,   passing  over  Kerch  S tra i t .   Space   h a d   an  unexpected 
aspect,  he   sa id :   “Ahead  of  me  was  black  sky,  very  black.  Th e   sun  
was  not  rad ian t ,   just  a  smoo th   disc  without  a n   aureole.  Below  was 
the   smooth-level ear th .   You   could  not  tell  it  was  a  sphere,  only  by   the  
fact  tha t   the   round   edge  showed  on  the   horizon.”  The  acroba t ics  
t ired   Leonov,  especially  because  of  the  effort  required  to   move.  H e  
sa id   tha t   although  the   program   requ ired   tha t   he  carefully  wind  the  
rope   tha t   had   tethered  h im   to  the  craft,  h e   found   i t   “a  waste  of  time” 
and   simply  pulled  i t   in to   the   hatch.  “The  commander  quickly  closed 
the  ha tch  cover  and  injected pressure  into the a i r  lock,”  Leonov sa id .  
Describing  the  manually  controlled  land ing ,   Col.  Belyayev  sa id   the

Ma rch   22:  NASA’s  actions  in  releasing  foreign  satellite  informa t ion   were 
criticized 
in  a  report  by  the  House  Committee  on  Government 
Operations,  based  on   study  by  its  Foreign  Operations  and   Government 
Information  Subcommittee.  Committee  stated  NASA  h a d   deleted  f rom

they  were  designated  as  secret  informa t ion   by  Norad .  
“NASA   h a s   no t

“.  . .  NASA   h a s   ignored  two  clear  requirements  of  law-the 
requ ire-  
ment  for  civilian  control  over  nonmilitary  space  activities  and   the  re- 
quirement  for  the  fullest  possible  flow  of  public  information.  By 
yielding,  automatically,  to  the  military  judgment  on   what  the   Ameri-

M a jo r   Grissom  suFgested  two  possible  reasons  that  the   “Molly

crous   s i tua t ion   of   the   world’s  two  most  powerful  na t ions ,   each   with 
massively  expensive  rival  programmes,  head ing   fo r   a  common  objec- 
tive  which  each  proclaims  is  be ing   pursued   in   the   highest  interests  of 
peaceful  scientific  exploration.”  A   jo in t   venture  would  have   the   ad-  
van tage   of  prov id ing   fo r   contingencies  such  as   rescue  of  as tronau ts  
possibly  s tranded   on  the  moon  or  i n   luna r   orbit-a 
capability  not 
included  i n   P ro jec t   Apollo.  “Th is   situation  can   only  be   satisfactorily 
resolved  by  the   provision  in   luna r   orb i t   of  a  second  sof t- land ing  vehi- 
cle  and   back-up   crew  capable  of  moun t ing   an   emergency  rescue 
opera t ion .   To  achieve  th is   would  requ ire   a  specially  adap ted   version 
of  the  c ra f t   a lready  designed  to   soft-land as tronau ts .  
“Th is   is  where  the  mer i t   of  US-Soviet  cooperation  lies  fo r ,   as   an 
in terna t iona l  venture,  a  project  to   land  men  on  the  Moon  would  surely 
not  be  undertaken  as   envisaged  in   pro jec t   Apollo;  and   certainly  no t  
with  such  r ig id   cons tra in ts   on  time. 
In   all  probab i l i ty   i t   would  be  
p lanned   as  a n   opera t ion   ra the r   than  a  solo mission,  with  logistic  sup- 
po r t   from   a  second  space  vehicle  placed  i n   luna r   orb i t   ahead   of  the

“The   essential  requ iremen t  in   terms  of  the  eventual  luna r   expedition

“Although  a t   this  stage  such  .  .  .  [ a   combined  luna r   expedition] 
would  have   little  influence  on  overall  costs,  it  could  mean  a  grea t   dea l  
to  the  safety of  in i t ia l  manned  missions. 
“Such  a  move  would  demand  concessions  on  bo th   sides. 
I t   would 
mean  America  abandon ing   he r   1970   targe t   da te   fo r   placing  men  on

being  overly  generous  to  nuclear  physics:  “At  the   present  time,  ex-

Donald  E.  Crabhill  of  the  Bureau  of 
the  Budget  discussed  “Space 
Programs   and  the  Federal  Budget”  before  the  National  Space  Club : 
“Wha t   are   some  o f   the  significant  factors  to   be  pointed  ou t   in  the  re- 
lationship  between  the   space  program  and  the  budge t?  
“The  first is,  of  course,  the matter  of  growth  in  the   fund ing   for  space 
and   the  curren t   absolute  amoun t   of  funds   allocated  to   space  programs ,  
including no t  only  NA SA ,   but  also DOD ,   A E C ,   and   activities  in  this  area  by  
In   FY  1957, approximately $150 million  was  expended 
o ther   agencies. 
In   FY  1960,  the   to ta l  
by  the  Federal  Government  on  space  programs. 
was  still  below  $900  million. 
I n   FY  1966, the  tenth  year  of  the  space 
age,  the  President’s  budget  provides  for   space  expenditures  of  $6.9 
billion. 
“Where  does this  amount  stand  in  relation  to   amounts  in   the  admin- 
istrative  budget  fo r   other  programs?  
I t   is  less  than   the   total  amounts 
to   be  spent  in  1966 on   national  defense;  on   health,  labor ,   and   welfare 
programs ;   and   on  interest  on  the  national  debt.  But  i t   is   grea ter   than  
tha t   to  be  spent  for   any  o ther   function  of  Government.  Space expendi- 
tures   of  all  agencies will b e  greater  in  1966 than   those  fo r   in terna t iona l  
affairs and   finance,  fo r  agriculture,  fo r  na tura l   resources,  fo r  commerce 
and   transpor ta t ion ,   for   housing  and  community  development,  fo r   vet- 
erans   benefits  and   services, o r   fo r   o ther   general Government. 
“The  space  program   has   not  been,  since  i t   was  initiated,  and   is  no t  
today,  a  budgetary  underdog. 
“The  second  specific point  to   be  made   is   tha t   the  budget  process  by 
i ts   very  na ture   is  an   exercise  in  priorities.  . .  .  A  grea t   many  merely 
desirable  projects  get  deferred  throughout  the  Government  every  year  
under  the  press  of  the   budgetary  process. 
“In  the  past,  this  pressure  has   not  been  felt  as  severely  i n   the   space 
a r e a   a s   i t   has   in  most  others  because  of  the  emphasis  th a t   h a s   been 
given  t o  crea t ing   in  a hu r ry   a  vast  capability  to  opera te  in  space.  T h e  
space  program   has  been  very  successful  in   meeting  this  aim. 
I n   fact, 
i t   h a s   been  so   successful  tha t   space  is  now  coming  of  age  with  o ther  
Government  programs.  We will  soon  have  a  technical  capability  to   d o

a  grea t   many  more  space  missions  than   we  a s   a  nation  will  probably 
want  to  pay  for .   . .  . 
“There  is   one  other  point  that.  as  a  budget  examiner.  I  feel  I  must 
mention.  Fund ing   and   schedule  estimates  fo r   space  programs  have 
been  historically  quite  unreliable.  Cost  estimates  have  tended  not  so 
much  merely  to  g r ow ,   but  to  mu l t ip ly !   At  the   same  time,  schedules 
have  tended  to   slip,  slip, slip. 
“Th is   was  an   understandable  situation  while  the  space  program   was 
new,  bu t  we  have  had  enough  experience tha t   there  will  be  considerable 
resistance from   now  on  to  escalation  in  price  a n d   radical  slips in   sched- 
ule  of  the   next  generation  of  space  projects.  The  more  detailed  plan- 
ning  we  a re   do ing   now,  the   phased  pro jec t   procurement  processes,  and  
the  experience we  have  gained  in  the   technology  and   the  techniques  of 
Space  opera t ions   must  be  expected  to  show  re turns   in  better  ability 
to make  good  cost  and  schedule estimates  i n  the  first  place,  and   then  to 
meet  the  cost  and   schedule  targe ts   tha t   a r e   approved.”

I n   an  article  written  for

moon  swept  too  close  to  the  ear th   and   partly  disintegrated  under  the

Ap r i l   25:  FAA  Administrator  Najeeb  E.  Halaby  sa id   tha t   FAA’s  son ic   boom 
tests  over  Oklahoma  City  last  year  had   shown  tha t   construction  of  a 
supersonic  a ir l iner   prototype  was  clearly  warran ted  : “My   cu r ren t   con- 
clusion  is  tha t   a  supersonic  a irp lane   can  be  designed  in   terms  of  con-  
figuration,  operating  attitudes  and   flight  pa ths   so  as to   achieve  public

with  release  of  a  three-volume  final  report  on   the   Oklahoma  City  ex-  
periment. 
The  FAA repor t ,   which  included  preliminary  results  from  boom   tests 
a t   the   White  Sands  Missile  Range,  concluded  tha t   only  abnorma l ly  
massive  booms  would  create  serious  problems.  A  principal  finding  i n  
the  “community  reactions”  study  s ta ted :   “Substantial  numbers   of

The   panel,  headed  by  Dr.  George B.  Kistiakowsky  of  Ha rva rd   Univ., 
former   science adviser  to  the  President,  was  comprised  of  15 scientists, 
engineers,  and   economists.  The  panel  held  tha t   the  National  Science 
Founda t ion ,   as  the   sole  agency  of  Government  whose  purpose  was 
suppor t   of  science  across  the  board  without  regard   fo r   immediate 
prac t ica l   gains,  should  be  expanded  to  serve  a s   a  “ba lance   wheel”  to  
soften  the  impact  of  var iab le   research  policies  of  mission-oriented 
agencies on “little  science.”  The  recommendation  tha t   agencies  should 
devote  grea ter   por t ions   of  the ir   budgets  to   basic  research  was  based 
on  the  view  tha t   in  many  cases  these  budgets  were  becoming  s ta t ionary  
while  the   capacity  fo r   scientific  growth  was  expanding.  The   panel 
also  recommended  tha t   in  some  cases  the   Congress  should  extend  the  
mission  of  the  agency to  include the pursuit  of  cer ta in  branches  of  bas ic  
research. 
Three   general  opinions  were  widely  held  by  the  panel  regard ing   the  
balance  of  science  suppor t   today :   first,  Federa l   fund s   should  be 
allocated  w i t h   some  consideration  to  the  geographical-social  effects  of 
the ir  expenditure:  second,  biological  sciences had   been  under-supported 
and   should  receive  suppor t   to  expand  them  faster  than   the   physical 
sciences;  th i rd ,   there   was  an   impending  crisis  i n   the  physical  sciences 
because  mission-oriented  agencies, faced  with  s ta t ionary   budgets,  would 
probably  not  expand  the ir   support  of  basic  physical  research  a s   fas t   as

Japan’s  role  in  space  activity  by  Pe ter   Temm  in   an   article  in   the

Apr i l   26 :   A  37-man  s tudy   g roup   chaired  by  Dr.  Colin  P i t tendr igh   of 
Pr ince ton   Univ.  and   convened  by  the  Space  Science  Board  of  the 
National  Academy  of  Sciences  at  the  request  of  NASA  had   reconfirmed 
the  Academy’s  appeal  for  exploration  of  Mars   t o  receive  “the  highest 
pr ior i ty   among  all  objectives  in   space  science-indeed 
in  the   space

able,  we  believe  i t   entirely  reasonable  tha t   Mars  is  inhabited  with 
living organisms  and  tha t   life  independently originated  there,”  and   thus 
tha t   “ the   biological  exploration  of  Mars   is  a  scientific  undertaking  of 
the   greatest  validity  and   significance.” 
The  panel  noted,  however,  tha t   “while  we  a r e  eager  t o   press  Mar t ian  
exploration  as  expeditiously  as  the  technology  and   other  factors permit, 
we insist tha t   ou r   recommendation  to  proceed  is  subject to  one   r igorous  
qualification :  tha t   no   viable  terrestrial  microorganisms  reach  the 
Mar t ian   surface   until  we  can  make  a  confident  assessment  of  the  
consequences.” 
The  group   made  seven  basic  recommendations:  ( 1 )  “every  oppor-  
satellite-borne instruments should be  exploited”;  ( 2 )  “.  . . An   adequa te  
tun i ty   fo r   remote  observation  of  Mars  by  earth-bound  o r   ballon-and 
program   fo r   Martian  exploration  cannot  be  achieved  without  using 
scientific  payloads  substantially  larger   than   those  currently  employed 
in   outer  unmanned  space  research  program.  .  . .  We  see  very  sub -  
stantial  advantages i n  the  use,  from   the  onset,  of  the   new  generation  of 
large   boosters  which  a re   expected  to   become  operational  toward  the  
end  of  the   decade”;  (3)   since  flyby  missions  “yield  a t   best  a  fleeting 
glimpse  of  the   planet”  and   ca r ry   a  relatively  small  array  of  ins tru-  
ments,  “we  deliberately  omit  an   explicit  recommendation  i n   favo r   of 
any   flyby  missions  additional  to  those  already  executed  o r   p lanned” ;  
(4 )  “Every  effort  should  be  made  to   achieve  a  large  orbiting  mission 
by  1971 at the  latest.  This mission  should precede the   first lander .   . . . 
By  ‘large’  we  mean  a  scientific  payload  tha t   would  include  ins tru-  
mentation  f o r   infrared   and   television  mapping,  microwave  rad iome try  
and   bistatic  rada r ,   infrared   spectromztry,  a n d   optical  po lar ime try” ;  
( 5 )  “The   first  land ing  mission  should  be   scheduled  no  later  than   1973 
and   by  1971  if  possible”  and   will  “ultimately  demand  a  large   lander”  
like  Ab1  (Automated  Biological  L a b )  ;  ( 6 )  “The   ta sk   of  des ign ing   an  
Ab1  should  be  initiated  immediately  a s   a  continuing  p ro jec t” ;   and  
( 7 )   to  ma in ta in   “a  continuing  dialogue  among  a l l   potential  investi- 
ga tors   and   the   engineers  responsible  for  implementing  the ir   scientific 
goals,”  the  Academy’s  Space  Science  Board  should  have  a  s tand ing

April 26:  Sen. Claiborne  Pel1  (D-R.1.)  discussed  in  the  Senate S.  1483, bill 
which he  had   introduced  to  establish  a National  Founda t ion   on  the  A r t s

“Eyewitness  t o  Space”  exhibition  at  the   National  Gallery  of  Art.  Get- 
lein’s  article  showed  “how  cooperation  between  ou r   Government  a n d  
the   a r t s   can  illuminate  some  of  the  most  exciting  moments  in   ou r  
impor tan t   explorations  in  space.”  The  exhibition  contained  some  70  
paintings  and   drawings  by  15 artists  under   the  NASA  a r t   program .  
“. . . The  work shows total  freedom  and  a  wide variety,  rang ing   from  
the   superb   illustrationist’s  style  of  Pau l   Calle  to  the  highly  individual 
abstraction  of  Washington  ar t is t   Alfred  McAdams. 
“.  . . The  space  effort,  therefore,  from   Huntsville  to   the   launch ing

Dr.  Roman  Smoluchowski  of  Princeton  Univ.  said  a t   the   American 
Physical  Society’s  meeting  in   Washington,  D.C.,  tha t   there   was  no  life 
on  Mars.  All  seasonal  changes  in  the   color  of  the  planet  could  be 
traced  to  bombardment  of  minerals  with  energetic  rad ia t ion   under  
varying  temperatures. 
Dr.  Jane   Blizard  of  Boulder,  Colo.,  also  speaking  at  the  APS  meeting, 
suggested tha t   any  as tronau t   braving  a  400-day journey   to   Mars  would 
be   likely  to  get  a  fatal  dose  of  radiation.  Maybe,  she  said,  long   range  
forecasting  of  so lar   storms  can  be  perfected  i n   time.  Or  maybe

opportune,  in  order   to  combine o u r  inventions, ou r   capabilities  and   ou r

often choose one of  those  which is  closest to  u s  and  whose  weight  we  do 
not  th ink   will  overwhelm us. 
“Tha t   is  why  we  a re   imposing  a  financial,  economic, and   monetary

a re   converting  in to   gold  the  dollar  surpluses imported  into  o u r   country

ASTRONAUTICS  AND  AERONAUTICS,  1965 

A p r i l   29:  At  the   Sp r ing   Meeting  of  the   American  Physical  Society,  Dr .  
Homer  E. Newell,  NASA  Associate Adm in is tra tor   for   Space  Science  and  
Applications,  attempted  to  answer  the   question  “What  can  the   space 
“.  .  . the   impact 
program   do  fo r  experimental  sciences like  physics”: 
tha t   space  techniques  a r e   having  and   have  already  had   on  geophysics 
. . . is  three-fold  in  charac ter .   F i r s t ,   the   geophysicist  finds  in  the  
space  program   powerful  tools  to  use  i n   a  new  approach   to  solving  old 
problems.  Seccndly, the   application  of  space  techniques  to  geophysics 
h a s   already  turned   up   a  number   of  exciting  new  problems,  greatly 
broaden ing   the   scope  of  the  discipline.  Th ird ly ,   a s   space  probes,  and  
eventually  men.  reach   other  bodies  of  the   so lar   system  such  as  the  
moon  and   planets,  the   domain  of  geophysics  grows  beyond  the  con-  
fines  of  a  single  body  of  the  solar  system.  Let  us   consider  each  of 
these  extensions to  geophysics  a  little fur ther .  
“.  . . space  techniques  have  provided  new  tools  fo r   s tudy ing   old 
problems  of  geophysics.  Geodesy,  meteorology,  upper  atmospheric 
physics,  ionospheric  research,  and   sun-ear th   relationships  have  all 
benefited  from   the   application  of  space  techniques. 
I n   the  case  of 
geodesy,  the  influence  of  the  ear th   upon  the  orb i ts   of  var ious   artificial 
satellites  ha s   been  measured  by  carefu l   radio.  rada r ,   and  optical  track-  
ing   and   used  to  ob ta in   quantitative  measures  of  the  var ious   harmon ics  
in   the   expansion  of  the   earth’s  grav i ta t iona l   potential.  As  a  con- 
sequence  of  such  measurements  i t   has   been  found   tha t   the   earth‘s 
equa tor ia l  bulge  is some  70 meters  grea ter   than   one would  expect.  .  .  . 
Other depar tures  of  the  geoid  from  the   figure of  hydros ta t ic  equ i l ibr ium  
have  also  been  determined  from   these  satellite  measurements.  .  .  . 
These  measurements  in   tu rn   have  impor tan t   implications  for   the  
d is tr ibu t ion   of  matter  within  the   ear th ,   and   fo r   the   in terna l   strength 
of  the  earth‘s  mantle.”

NACA’S  commitment to  aeronautical  flight.  . . .

Dr.  0. Z .   Gazenko, physiologist  and   member  of  the  Soviet Academy 
of  Sciences,  said  tha t   cosmonauts had   no  difficulty  knowing the   or ien-  
tation  of  the ir   bodies  and   experienced  no  nervous  disorders  if  they 
were  given  visual  cues.  He  based  h is   remarks   o n   experiences  of  s o -  
viet  cosmonauts,  especially  those  of  Lt.  Col.  Aleksei  Leonov  in  
VOSKHOD   11:  “When  he  saw  the  spacecraft,  he  had   no  prob lem   know-

ing   his  orientation,  but  i t   was  different  when  he  didn’t  see  the  space- 
craft.” 
During  the  launch  phase,  the  cosmonauts’ pulse  and   brea th ing   ra tes  
were  greater  than  noted  dur ing   centrifugal  tests  in   ground   labora to-  
ries. 
I n   VO SKHOD   11,  i t   took  a  comparatively  long  time  for   the   norma l  
levels  to  be  reached,  according  to  Gazenko.  Comparison  of  the  da ta  
of  the  Voskhod  flights  with  other  space  flights  showed  fewer  card iovas-  
cu lar   variations  and   better  responses  to  stress.  H e   recommended 
crews  of  several  people  since  “ the   feeling  of  togetherness  of  cosmo- 
nau ts  is very  important.”

Success  of  the  fully  stabilized  British  Skylark  rocket  in   ob ta in ing

id-fuel vehicle  designed  to  ca r ry   150-200-lb.  payload  to  200   km.  (124  
mi.)  altitude.  Using  the  sun  as  a  reference,  Sky lark   could  achieve 
pointing  accuracy  of  between  two  and   three  minutes  of  a rc   in  pitch 
and  yaw,  reported  Kenneth  Pounds,  lecturer  a t  Leicester  College, Eng- 
land,  and   one  of  i ts   users:  “The  new  Skylark  has   revolutionized  the 
whole  field  of  rocket  research  as  far   a s  we’re  concerned.”  He   pointed 
ou t   tha t   many  scientific  experiments, such  as  taking  x-ray  pho tographs  
of  the  sun,  could  not  be  done  by  an   unstabilized  rocket:  “You  need 
100  see.  o r   more  exposure  time,  plus  roll  stabilization,  or  the   pho-

Sen. A.  S. Monroney  (D-Okla.)  told  a meeting  of  the  American  Helicop- 
te r   Society  i n   Washington,  D.C.,  tha t   NASA  was  spending  too   small  a 
sha re  of  i ts  budget on aviation research. 
Sena tor  Monroney,  the  cha irman   of  the   Senate Aviation  Subcommit- 
tee,  sa id   he  became  angry   when  h e   compared  the  $43  million  ear-  
marked  for   aeronautics  next  year  with  the   space  agency’s  total  budget 
of  $5.2  billion. 
He   said  tha t   although  the  agency  allocated  less  than   2  percent  of  i ts  
budget  to  solving  the  many  flight  mysteries  i t   acknowledges still  exist, 
the agency’s working-level scientists  wanted to do  more i n  this area. 
Monroney  also  said  he  disagreed  with  those  who  contended  tha t  
subsidy fo r  the  helicopter  airlines was wasteful and  unwarranted. 
He   said  tha t   while  helicopters  might  not  have  made  the   progress 
many  wished  fo r   and  some  had   promised,  commercial  revenues  had  
increased,  costs had  declined,  equipment  had   improved, and   capability

been  wasted  on  the  abortive  B-70  bomber  p ro j -  
allocated  money-had 
ect,  Howard  Margolis  reported  in   the  W a s h i n g t o n  Pos t .   The   question 
of  how  much  of  the  money  spent  was  wasted  arose  when  McNamara 
was  asked  whether  knowledge  from   the   B-70  work  would  be   valuable 
to  other  military  and   civilian  projects.  McNamara  suggested  tha t   a t  
least  80  per  cent  of  the  money  had   been  wasted,  Margolis  said.  Mc- 
Namara’s  general  view  had   been  tha t   subs tan t ia l   “waste”  of  this  so r t  
was  unavoidable  in  the  defense  program   since  it  was  rare ly   possible  to 
know  how  valuable  a  development  project  would  be  before  large   s u m  
had   been  spent.  Margolis added  tha t  McNamara  suggested minimizing 
such  waste  by  insisting  on  good  evidence  of  probab le   value  before 
allocating  large  expenditures  and ,   even  then,  by  limiting  spend ing   a s  
much  a s   possible  until  the   value  of  a  project  was  proven.

had   been  entirely  satisfactory,  and  indications  were  tha t   i t   would  have 
a  useful  life  of  more   than   a  year,  Ames  said.  Orb i ta l   parame ters  
were:  apogee,  615  mi.  (990   km . ) ;   perigee,  290  mi.  (467   km .)  ; in-  
clination t o  the equa tor ,   51.95’. 
PEGASUS  I ,   launched  Feb.  16,  1965,  was  first  of  a  series  of  three  
satellites  intended  to  measure  meteoroid  penetrations  of  grea ter   s truc-  
tu ra l   thicknesses  and   contained  a  meteoroid  penetration  a rea   of  almost 
2,300  sq.  ft.  Ames  sa id   tha t   although  useful  results had   been  obtained 
with  .0015-in.-thick  panels,  the  da ta   ob ta ined   with  .008-in.-thick  and  
.016-in.-thick  panels  had   not  been  fully  satisfactory  because  of  difficul- 
ties  i n   the   operation  of  the   detection  system.  Still,  PEGASUS  I  had  
provided  significant  informa t ion   leading  to  improvement  of  detection 
systems  on  the  remaining  two  Pegasus  spacecraft.  Orb i ta l   parame ters  
for   PEGASUS   I  were:  apogee,  451  mi.  (726   km . ) ;   perigee,  311  mi.

May  1 7 :   Robert  Hotz  said  in  an  ed i tor ia l   i n   Av ia t ion   Week  and  Space 
Techno logy:   “W i th  each passing  year  i t  becomes more  and more  appar-  
en t   tha t   the  Soviets  agreed  to  the  par t ia l   nuclear  test  ban  trea ty   a t  
a  time  most  advantageous  to  them  and   most  disadvantageous  to 
us.  The   Soviets  already  had   tested  the ir   nuclear  warheads  over  the 
en t ire   spectrum-from 
underwater  devices  to  50-megaton  a i r   burs ts  
inc lud ing   live  ICBM  warheads.  The  U.S.  had   not  tested  a n y   of  its 
nuclear  warheads  in  strategic  systems  and   can  only  theorize  abou t   the  
effects  tha t   high-altitude  nuclear  blasts  in  the  50-megaton-and-up range  
will  have  on  communications  and   control  networks  of  silo-based  ICBMS 
and   other  strategic systems. 
“Mr .   McNamara  has   based  h is   defense  policy  on  the   belief  tha t   he 
will  be  able  to  detect  any  new  Soviet  weapons  development  i n   time  to 
develop  a  U.S.  counter-measure before  the  Russians  can   become  opera-  
t iona l   with  the ir   new  force.  Since  several  of  the  new  Soviet  ICBMS 
a n d   an   anti-ICBM  shown  in   recent  Red  Squa re   parades  came  a s   a 
complete  surpr ise   to  the   Western  intelligence  community,  i t   would  ap- 
pear   tha t   this  assumption  by  Mr.  McNamara  is  open  t o   serious 
challenge.  History  may  prove  tha t   Mr.  McNamara’s  view  of  the  time 
span   available  for   the  U S .   to  counter-develop  weapons  to   thwar t   a

“The  Soviet  Union,  with  its  May  9  display  of  missile  and  space  might, 
h a s   dealt  a  ma jo r   blow  to  the  complacency  of  those  persons  in   the 
United  States  who  consistently  have  underestimated  the   competence of 
the   Russians  in  these  fields,”  wrote William  J.  Coughlin in  a n   ed i tor ia l  
in   Missiles  and  Rockets.  He  continued:  “The  appearance  of  Soviet 
soiid-iuei missiles  ol’ a type  siiiiilar  to  &e  U.S.  M inu tem~ r !  ICEM   ind i-  
cates  tha t   the  Soviets  finally  have  overcome  the   chemical  roadblock 
which until now  has  made possible the U.S.  lead  in solids.  . . . 
“In   a  film  which  the  Moscow  correspondent  of  the  N ew   Yo rk  T ime s  
estimated  to  be   at  least  three  years  old,  the  Soviets  also  displayed 
launching5  from   an   underground  silo.  The   combination  of  these 
events  suggests  the  Soviets  now  a re   in  a  position  t o   rapidly  close  the 
missile  gap   with  the  United  States  to  the   po in t   where  it  is   of  no 
consequence in  military  calculations.  . . . 
“In   the  film  release,  the   Russians  fo r   the  first  time  showed  the ir  
anti-missile missile  in  action.  One  sequence  was  of  intercept  of  an  
ICBM .   .  . . 
“The  increasing  Soviet  confidence  also  is   indicated  in   the  space 
field.  The   Soviets  let  i t   be  known  more   than  a  month  in  advance  tha t  
the ir   next  space  spectacular  could  be  expected  May  9.  . . .  The  
launch   of  LUNIK   v  obviously  was  r igh t   on  schedule.  The   acknowl- 
edgement  af ter   launch  bu t   in   advance  of  impact  tha t   its  goa l   was  a

“At  the  same  time,  the   Russians  released  more   informa t ion   on  the

“All  of  th is   points  toward   grea ter   ma tur i ty   in   bo th   Soviet  missile

ComSatCorp  may   well  face  competition  from   foreign  satellite  com- 
munications  systems  in   the   next  few  years,  David  Sarnoff,  cha i r -  
man  of  the  Board  of  Rad io   Corporation  of  America  predicted  a t   the 
convention  banque t   of  the  Armed  Forces  Communications  and   Elec-

Russia  will  set  up   a  satellite communications system  competitive to  ou r  
own  and  offer  i t   to  other  nations  on  favorable  terms  de term ined   more 
by political  than  economic considerations.” 
Mr.  Sarnoff  advocated  crea t ion   of  “a  single,  privately  owned  Ameri- 
can  company”  to   hand le   all  in terna t iona l   communications  curren t ly  
handled  by  s ix   private  carr iers .   He   argued   tha t ,   among  other 
benefits,  a  single  “unified  ca r r ie r”   was  the  only  way  the   U S .   could 
“deal  on  equa l   terms  with  foreign  government  [communications]  mo- 
nopolies. 
The   RCA   cha irman   warned  tha t   in  only  five  years  the   interim  agree- 
ment  between  ComSatCorp  and   the  45  par t ic ipa t ing   nations  would  be 
up   for   re-evaluation.  The   U S . ,   he  said,  “will  have  to  negotiate  a  new 
contract  under  different  circumstances  and   possibly  vastly  altered  ba r -  
gaining conditions.” 
I t   was  technically  feasible,  Mr.  Sarnoff  sa id ,   tha t   direct  radio/Tv 
broadcasting  by  satellite could  be  undertaken  by  1975.  Three   equa to-  
rial,  synchronous  o rb i t   satellites  powered  by  nuclear  energy,  each 
equipped  with  a  three-Tv-channel capability,  would  be  able,  he  said,  to 
broadcast  programs  
the  entire  United  States  and   pa r t s   of 
to  
Canada.  He   estimated  tha t   the  three  satellites,  exclusive  of  ground  
stations,  would  cost  $30  million  and   compared   this  with  the   $50  mil-

Comparing  the  space  programs   of  the   U S .   and   the   U.S.S.R.  Dr. 
Edward   C .   Welsh,  Executive  Secretary  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and

spc61. In   number  o f   ear th-orb i t ing   payloads  the   United  States  ha s  
launched  almost  three  times  as  many  a s   ha s   the   USSR,  although  the  
1965 ra te   is less than   two to  one. 
“2.  In   the  weight  of  such  payloads,  the   USSR  has   pu t   up   almost  three 
times a s  much  as ha s  the United  States. 
“3.  In   propulsion,  the  Soviets  have  from   the  beg inn ing   enjoyed  an  
operational  advantage  over  the  United  States.  However,  we  a r e   cu r -  
rently  making  grea t   strides  in  th is   regard   a n d   i t   is  hoped  tha t   we  will 
keep moving u p  the propulsion ladder  so  as not  to be overtaken again. 
4.  I n  manned  space flight,  the   USSR  is  ahead  of  t h e  U S . ,   not  only  i n  
6 6  
hours   of  flight  but  also  i n   multi-manned  flight  and   extravehicular  ac- 
tivity.  So  f a r ,   the  U S .   as tronau ts   have  completed  40  orb i ts   of  the 
ear th ,   the  Soviet  cosmonauts  have  completed  342  such  orbits.  More- 
over,  a s   our  Gemini  schedule  proceeds  a n d   con tr ibu tes   continued 
progress,  we  must  look  for   much  more  activity  on  the   p a r t   of  the  
Soviets. 
“5.  In   the  application  of  space  developments  to  directly  useful  pu r -  
poses,  the  United  States  is   well  ahead,  particularly  in   such  fields  as 
weather  observations, navigation,  and  communications.  However,  the 
Soviets  have  potential  capabilities  of  these  types  and   have  already  be- 
gun to show some actual experience in space communications. 
“6.  I n   luna r   and   interplanetary  activity,  the   U S .  may  have  an  edge 
with  the  spectacular  success  of  the  Rangers   and   Mariners.  We  have 
developed this  advantage, even  though  the   Soviets have  made  a  greater 
relative  commitment  in  this  regard,  both  from   the   view  of  absolute 
numbers  of  launches and  also  in  regard  to weight of  payloads. 
7 .   Based  upon  clear  knowledge  of  ou r   own  p rog ram   and   upon  as-  
6 6  
sertions  by  the   Soviets  abou t   theirs,  one  can  reasonably  conclude  tha t  
both  countries  have  manned  lunar  land ing   pro jec ts   under  way. 
I t  
would  be  impossible  to  s ta te  definitely  who  is   ahead  in   this  regard   bu t  
I  am hopeful  tha t  we  will  tu rn   out  to  be. 
“8.  As  regards   the   collection  of  scientific  da ta   from   space,  bo th  
countries  have  made  impressive  strides,  resulting  in   a  possible  advan- 
tage   to  the   USSR  regard ing   the  effects  of  space  environment  on  human  
beings. 
“9.  Both  countries  a re   in  a  position  to  make  many  observations 
from   space,  bu t   bo th   countries  have  pledged  not  to   o rb i t   weapons  of 
mass  destruction  and   have  stressed  tha t   the ir   programs   a re   dedicated 
to  peaceful  uses. 
I  can  only  speak  for   this  coun try   in   regard   to   our 
in ten t   and   do  state  tha t   we  will  maintain  ou r   defenses  while  pledging 
not  to  use space for  aggressive purposes.” 
Dr. Welsh  warned :   “Let  us  not  expect  ou r   space program   to   proceed 
indefinitely  without  some tragedy  involving ou r  astronauts.”

ea r th   orb i t   to  moon,  and   f rom   moon  to   planets,  i t   is  important  to  
recognize  tha t   the  first  two  steps  rest  on  essentially  the   same  tech- 
nologies.  These  a r e   technologies which  have  evolved f o r   decades  and  
which  are   fam i l iar :   chemical  energy  conversion,  relatively  common 
engineering  materials,  measurement  and   control  systems  generally con- 
sistent  with  a ircraf t   and   ground  
technology  and   microwave 
communications.  However,  the  th i rd   step  will  demand  performance 
and   efficiency  well  beyond  the   first  two.  An  entirely  new  level  of 
technology  is  needed ; nuclear  energy  conversion,  new  refractory  mate- 
rials,  accuracy  of  sensors-improved 
by  orders   of  magnitude-and 
laser  communications.  There   a r e   the  underlying  requirements  of 
h igher   reliability  and   longer  lifetimes  than  have  yet  been  demon- 
s tra ted ,  together with  low  specific weight. 
The  requirement  for   improvement  in   th is   spectrum  of  space-re- 
6 6  
lated  technologies will  drive  them well  beyond  the ir   present level.  The  
presence  of  difficult  goals  can  have  a  profound  influence  on   ear th-  
bound   consumer  products  through  the  advancement  of  common  fields 
of  technology  in   addition  to  opening  the   gateway  to  deep  space.  The  
NASA   program   of  advanced  research  and   technology  embraces most  of 
these  elements  at  least  in   the ir   fundamen ta l   forms.  Without  th i s   re -  
search  the   space program   would  soon  wither  and   die.  With  i t ,   by  the  
year  2000,  an   enormous  influence  can  be   exerted  on  national  prestige 
and   strength.”

Discussing  space  projects  of  the   fu ture   a t   the   Conference  on   the 
Peaceful  Uses  of  Space,  Dr.  Wernher  von  Braun,  Director  of  NASA 
Marshall  Space  Flight  Center,  sa id :   “The   reusable  vehicle seems  to  be 
the  key  to  development  of  an   economical  ear th- to-orb i t  transportation

even  politicians  and  
j o u r n a l i s t s - c a n  make the  trip. 
“One  of  the  methods  we  have  been  studying  several  years  combines 
the  experience  gained  in   the  x-15  rocket  plane  program   with  present 
Sa turn   know-how,  for  building  a  high  performance  two-stage  rocket

more  than  three  g’s  in  ascent or   descent. 
“ In   the   orb i ta l   transpor t   under  study,  the  first  s tage   would  fly  mis- 
sion  pa ths   s im i lar   to  the  X-15,  with  the   second  stage,  carrying  pas-

casting  Company’s  recent  proposal  to   put  up  i ts   own  comsat  to  relay 
TV   shows to affiliated  stations for   rebroadcast  to home viewers. 
Dr.  Charyk  said  a  satellite  to  relay  television  programs   to  affiliated 
stations  involved  no  new  basic  engineering  problems  and   offered  “rea l  
potential, sound economic basis.” 
He  envisioned  a  television  satellite  equipped  with  12  channels,  three 
of  which  would  serve  each  of  the  four   time  zones.  A  satellite  of

I ts   effects  were  comparable  to  those  of  a  nuclear  weapon

ASTRONAUTICS   AND   AERONAUTICS ,   1965 

According  to  the  draw ing   and   the   tex t   description,  MOLN IYA   I  had  
an   a ir t igh t   cylindrical  body  with  conical  ends,  one  of  which  contained 
a  rocket  engine used  to  correc t   the  o rb i t ,   a s  well  a s  o ther   so lar   or ien ta-  
tion  devices. 
Expanding  like  spokes  of  a  wheel  from   the  cylinder  were  six  long 
panels  of  solar  batteries  to  supply  electrical  power  to  the   satellite  fo r  
retransmission  of  signals  received  from   ear th .  
I t   was  equipped 
with  two  parabolic  antennas,  one  active,  the   o ther   in   reserve.  These 
were  pointed  toward  ea r th   with  a  high-precision  direction  finder  for  
ear thbound   transmissions.  MOLN IYA   I  would  make  two  12-hr .  revolu- 
tions  around   the  ear th   every  2 4  hrs.  One  loop  would  take  i t   over  the  
Soviet Union  dur ing   daytime periods,  when  i t   could  be   of  most  use  for  
transmissions.  The  other 
loop  would

M a y   31 : All  technical  problems  threatening  the   scheduled  launching  of

involved  what  had  been  thought  to  be  a  malfunction  in  the  water 
management  system  of  the  spacecraft  which  would  provide  water  for  
dr ink ing   and   cooling. 
Instead  of  a  leak,  technicians  found   tha t   a

May  31 :   Aerobee  150A  sounding  rocket,  launched  from   Wallops  Station, 
Va.,  attained  peak  altitude  of  90.5  mi.  (145   km .)  .  Primary  exper i-

modified  Attitude  Control  System  (Ac s )  , a  roll-stabilized  gyro   p la t-  
form,  and   an   optical  tracker-the 
combination  known  as  S trap .   The  
S t rap   system  performed  correctly.  Due  to   an   incorrect  gain  setting, 
the   s tar- tracker   failed  to  lock-on  throughout  most  of  the  flight.  The  
telescope  and   spectrometer  functioned  properly,  but  obtained  no  da ta  
due   to  the  fa i lure   to  lock-on.  Experiment  was  conducted  by  CSFC.

Article  in   Soviet  Life by  Academician  Anatoli  Rlagonravov  described

“The  first  is   the  study  of  the  earth’s  upper  atmosphere  and   the  
portion  of  space ad jo in ing   our  planet.  . . . 
T h e  second is  the study and  exploration of  .  . .  the moon. 
“The  th ird   is   the  study  of  solar  space,  including  the   nearest  planets, 
Mars  and   Venus. 
“Soviet  scientists  are  working in  all  three directions. 
T h e   first  to   be  launched,  always,  are   the   au toma t ic   scouts,  fol- 
lowed  by  men. 
“.  . . The   final  stage  in  the  solution  of  the  first  p r o b l em - e x p l o r a -  
tion  of  near   space-will 
probably  be   to  set  up   a  permanen t   manned 
space  observatory-town,  with  bilateral  contact  ma in ta ined   through  
rockets.  Of  course,  long   before  this,  reliable  systems  of  meteorolog- 
ical  sputniks,  worldwide  television  sputniks,  navigation  sputniks,  etc., 
will have been established.  . . .

space  program   abou t   the   moon,  the   planets,  the  sun ,   in terp lane tary  
space, and  the  ear th  itself.  He concluded: 
“Man’s  growing  understanding  of  the  na ture   and   constitution  of  the 
universe  had   led  to  new  advances  in  ou r   knowledge  of  physics  a n d   of 
chemistry;  and   these  in   tu rn   have  led  to  applications of  this  knowleJge 
to  the  development  of  things  which  men  have  found   useful.  We  have 
never  been  able  to  predict  in  advance  what  the   usefulness would  be   of 
new  knowledge  about  the  na ture   of  the  physical  universe.  All  we 
know  is  that,  by  and   large ,  new  knowledge  always h a s  proved  useful- 
and   often  i t   h a s   proved  useful  in  the  most  unexpected  and  unforesee- 
able ways.  No  one would have  predicted  tha t   Newton’s  enunciation  of 
the  laws  of  motion  would  lead  to  the  age  of  mach inery ;   tha t   Faraday’s 
experiments  would  lead  to  the   age  of  electricity;  o r   tha t   Einstein’s 
theory  of  relativity  and  Bohr’s  theory  of  the  atom  would  lead  to   the  
atomic bomb   and   atomic power. 
“We  do  know  one  th ing :   tha t   scientific  research  which  ha s   been 
aimed  a t   purely  practical  problems  though   it  often  has  been  oi grea t  
value,  has   over  a  long  run   been  of  less  value  in  producing  wholly  new 
things  than  has   the  research  aimed  solely  at 
the  extension  of 
knowledge.  The   extension  of  man’s  knowledge  is  the  basic  and   the  
overriding  purpose  of  the   space  exploration  program.”

McDivitt  exclaimed :  “You  smeared  my  windshield,  you  d ir ty   dog.” 
Flight  p lans   had   called  for   a  ten-minute  walk  i n   space  but  White 
remained  outside  the  spacecraft  for   22  min.  He  experienced  no   dis- 
orientation  du r ing   his  “walk.”  When  he   finally  heeded  commands 
to  re turn   to  the   capsule, he  had   difficulty  closing the  hatch  and   decided 
not  to  reopen  i t   to  jettison excess equipment.  “It’s  the  saddest moment 
of  my  life,”  Wh i te   sa id   a s  he  reentered  the   spacecraft. 
On  June   5 du r ing   the   17 th   orb i t ,   the  astronauts  spoke  to   the ir   wives 
a t   MSC.  Du r ing   the  20th  orb i t ,   McDivitt  spotted  a  satellite  with  “b ig  
arms   sticking  out.” 
He  was  unable  to  identify  it  positively. 
On  June   6  dur ing   the   U t h   orb i t ,   trouble  developed with  the  space- 
craft’s  computer  and  attempts  to  repa i r   it  with  the   aid  of  ground   in -  
structions  failed.  The  malfunctioning  computer  made  it  necessary  f o r  
GEM IN I   IV   to  reenter  on  a  ballistic  trajectory. 
Throughou t   the  flight  the  daily  rou t ine   of  the  astronauts  included 
eating,  exercise,  and  performance   of  medical  a n d   scientific  exper i-

when GEMINI   IV  passed  through   a  heavy  rad ia t ion   a r e a  called  the  Sou th  
Atlantic  anomaly,  Astronauts  McDivitt  and   White  switched  on  rad ia-  
t ion   and   magnetic  field  measur ing   devices  to   take   readings  inside 
a n d  outside the   spacecraft  and   near  the ir   bodies.  They  also  attempted

Before  egressing  f rom   the   spacecraft  to   be  hoisted  to  helicopter, 
as tronau ts   took  biomedical  d a t a   on  themselves.  About  40   min.  la ter ,  
Ma jors   McDivitt  and   White  were  landed  by  helicopter  on   the   flight 
deck  of  the’carrier  Wa sp .   They  were  taken  immediately to   the   ship’s

most  serious  problem  was  fatigue.  “Both  men  were  bushed,”  sa id   Dr. 
Berry.  Maj.  McDivitt  had   a  few  flecks  of  caked  blood  in  h i s   nostrils, 
caused  by   the   dryness  of  the   mucous  membranes  from   inha l ing   pu re

Presently  designated  SLV-3x, the  program   would  seek  a  21,OOO-lb. 
propellant  capacity  increase  in  the  s tandard   Atlas  booster  by  making 
the   top   of  the   vehicle  cylindrical  and  would  increase  the   thrus t   of 
three   Atlas  engines  by  using  modified  Sa turn   H-1 f u e l   in jec tor   and

J u n e   14:  A  New  York  T im e s   ed i tor ia l   by   H a r r y   Schwartz  concerning 
Soviet-American cooperation  in  space:  “The   real  issues  relate  to   the  
of 
advantages  and   disadvantages  in  the   moon  race  itself-including, 
course,  its  propaganda   aspects. 
“The   argument  tha t   cooperation  will  not  mean  significant  savings  is 
strongest for   the   immediate fu ture ,  bu t   i ts  force  weakens  rapidly  a s  one

“Ma jor   cost  advantages  can  certainly  be  gained  by  agreement  on

opening  remarks,  Maj.  Gen.  Don  Os trander ,   AFOSR  Commander,  sa id :  
“The  purpose  of  these  Cloudcroft  meetings  is   t o   stimulate  ideas-to 
act  as  an   intellectual catalyst.  . .  .  We  all  have  a  responsibility  to  t ry  
to  understand  the   complex  interrelationships  between  science  a n d   tech- 
nology,  and   between  technology  and   national  defense;  through  under-  
s tand ing ,   to  participate  in   the  excitement  and   urgency  of  the  creative 
turmo i l  which  is  such an  inescapable p a r t  of  the  age   in  which  we  live!” 
H is tor ian   A .   Hun ter   Dupree,  professor  of  history  a t   the  Univ.  of 
California  (Berke ley)   and   a  consultant  to   NASA,  said  that  scientists 
with  a  negative  a t t i tude   regard ing   the   Nation’s  manned  space  flight 
activities had   a  laboratory-limited  view  of  scientific  endeavor  and   had  
lost  perspective  of  the  con tr ibu t ions   made  to  American  and   world 
science  through   exploration  and   survey  expeditions  i n   the  field.  He  
pointed  ou t   the   relationship  of  the  Pacific  voyages  of  Capt.  Cook  to 
Darwin’s  la ter   theory  of  evolution  and   sa id :   “One  can  as  little  predict 
the   results  of  space  exploration  a s   Captain  Cook  could  have  predicted 
Darwin’s  theory.” 
According  to   Dupree,  i t   was  the   general  expansion  of  knowledge 
tha t   would  lead  to  later  fru i tfu l   developments.  Bu t   to  justify  these 
developments  immediately  o r   to  justify  exploration  i n   terms  of  pre-

An  artificial  frog’s  eye  which  could  be  sent  to   the  surface  of  Mars  
to  detect  living  organisms  was  described  by  Warren   McCullough  and  
Louis  Su tro .   Research  had   revealed  there  were  fou r   varieties  of 
ganglion  cells  in  the   eye  of  the  f r o g - e a c h  processing  different  infor-  
mation.  The  MIT scientists  had   proposed  the  following  scheme  to  
NASA :   the  ar i if ic ia l   eye  woii!c!  be  C G ~ A ~  
to  2  rr.icroscope  in  a  t iny  
computer.  Samples  of  Martian  soil  would  be  seen  b y   the  frog’s  eye 
through   the  microscope.  When  movement was  detected, the  eye  would 
inform   the  computer.  which  would  decide  whether  a  picture  of  the  
moving  organism  should  be  taken  for   relay  back  to  earth.

Theories  on  biological  rhythms  were  proposed  by  Colin  P i t tendr igh  
of  Princeton  Univ.  a t   the  AFOSR  seminar.  He  suggested  tha t   oscilla- 
t ions   o r   biological  rhythms  were  serving  a  fundamen ta l   function  tha t  
was  not  yet  fully  identified  and   tha t   all  organisms  undergo  oscillations 
with  a  periodicity  that  matches  tha t   of  the  external  world-roughly  24 
hrs .   Light,  even  in   negligible  amounts,  could  alter  these  oscillations. 
I n   Pittendrigh‘s  view,  once  the  t rue   face  of  biological  clocks-time 
measuring  mechanisms  inna te   in  all  living  organisms-was 
seen,  sci- 
ence  would  have   vital  clues  to  how  life  developed  on  earth  and   how 
biological  rhy thms   determine what  i t   is  all  living  things  do.

enhanc ing   the   chance  fo r   s t a r  
collisions.  The   effect  of  collisions  a t   these  speeds would  be  to  release

space  activities.  F irs t ,   the  United  States  has   shown  tha t   i t   can  suc- 
cessfully  build  and  launch   complex  spacecraft  to  measure  the   space 
environment  over  large   regions  of  ou r   so lar   system  and   to   extend  our 
knowledge  of  ou r   neighboring  space  bodies.  We  have  developed  a 
capability  to  produce  large   launch  vehicles,  to  test  them,  and   to   launch 
them  successfully.  We  a r e  producing  the   space hardware   fo r   env iron-  
mental  testing tha t   will  prove  out  our   concepts  and   engineering  fo r   the  
large   launch  vehicles  and   spacecraft  tha t   will  be  required  to   opera te  
ou t   to  and   on  the   moon  and  meet  all  the  demands  of  o u r   o ther   difficult 
undertakings.  We  have   successfully  developed  space  technology  f o r  
improved  communications  a n d   weather  repor t ing   and   forecasting  sys- 
tems.  The  Ranger  program ,   completed  with  Ranger  IX,  provided 
17,000  closeup  pictures  of  the  moon  tha t   have   not  only  given  us  a 
better  understanding  of  i t s   topography  bu t   may  reveal  totally  unex- 
pected  processes  tak ing   place  below

of  an   as tronau t   to  opera te   outside  of  his  spacecraft,  a n d   the   utility  of

Some of  the  equipment designed to  accomplish rendezvous and   docking. 
They  also  served  as  an   orb i t ing   space  labora tory   with  several  experi-

Voskhod  11  flight  they  achieved  the  first  extravehicular  activities  of

They,  too,  a r e  expanding  upon  a  sound  basis  fo r  bo th  manned  and   un-

apparen t .   The   exhibition  in  Pa r i s   yesterday  afternoon  of  a  new  very 
large   a i r   transpor t   indicates  the  same  kind  of  emphasis  on   equipment 
to  use  the  earth’s  envelope of  a ir .  
“ In   aeronautics,  i t   is  impor tan t   to   note  the  increasing  tempo  of  ou r  
research  in  not only the  aerodynamics, loads  a n d  structures, propulsion, 
and   opera t ing   problems  of  supersonic  flight,  but  hypersonic  flight  a s  
well.  There   is  a  resurgence  of  interest  in   airbreathing  propulsion  i n  
the  form   of  advanced  turbo je t   and   ram je t   engines  to   meet  the   requ ire-  
ments  of  supersonic  and   hypersonic  transpor ts   and  to  make  them  com- 
petitive  with  transpor ts   operating  in   the  subsonic  range.  And  of 
course,  we  a r e   also  engaged  a t   the  other  end  of  the   speed  spectrum  i n

I n   response  to  questioning, Mr.  Webb  sa id :   “A  substantial  amount 
of  time  is  now  being  put  in to   aeronautics  by  o u r  top   people.  Remem- 
ber ,   we  have   to  g o   through   the  a i r   to  get  to  space.  The  use  of  th in  
wall  s truc tures   and  the  use  of  power  delivered  by  engines  all  come 
ou t   of  the  same  research  competence which  we  have.

should  take  on  the  management  and   development  of  prototypes  a n d

“Each  time  I  have  pointed  ou t   tha t   we  spend  a  large number   of  ou r  
dollars  through   the  military  services  because  they  have  the   procure-  
ment  capability.  They  a re   the   only  people  i n   the   US. Government

received  NASA’s  Exceptional  Service Award  from   Pres iden t   Johnson   i n  
a  special  White  House  ceremony. 
In troduc ing   the  Pres iden t ,   NASA  
Adm in is tra tor   James  E.  Webb  said:  “.  .  . we  .  .  . should  never  fo r -  
get  tha t   a t   the   beginning  of  the  space  age,  in  1957,  the   challenge  of 
th is   new  fron t ier   which  was  laid  down  to  us  was  first  met  by   the   man  
who  is now  the  President  of  the  United  S ta tes  and  who  ha s  so gracious- 
ly   invited  u s   here   today  to  ind ica te   aga in   h is   interest  in ,   a n d   the   im- 
portance  he   attaches  to,  the  new  systems we  have  developed  fo r   bu i ld-  
ing   ou r   national  competence  in  space  and   using  the  science  and   tech- 
nologies  acquired  to  work  toward  a  peaceful  world  and   a  better  world. 
“This  grea t   leader  of  ou r   nation,  and   of  the   F ree   World,  is  still 
pioneering,  th is   time  on  an   even  more  difficult  f ron t ie r   where  we mus t  
learn   to  master  the  restrained  but  decisive  use  of  the   powers  which 
technology  gives o u r   nation.  Those  of  us  who  a r e   responsible  fo r   the  
bu i ld-up   of  our   new  base  of  technology  believe  tha t   power,  based  on  
advanced  technology,  can  provide  new  means  to  hold  back  those  ru th -  
less  forces  which  answer  not  to  the  need  of  all  men  fo r   security,  free-  
dom,  dignity,  and   opportunity.  The   pioneering  which  Pres iden t  
Johnson  is  engaged  in  today  on  this  new  fron t ier   is,  if  any th ing ,  more  
impor tan t   than   his  pioneering  actions  in   1958 to   crea te   o u r   na t iona l  
program   in   aeronautics  and   space. 
“Seldom  in  the history  of  the  world  ha s  one  man   had   to  play  so  v i ta l  
a  role  in   developing  the  tools  of  modern   science  a n d   technology  a n d  
then  in   the  development  of  a  national  capability  to  use  them  t o   achieve 
cooperation toward  a world consistent with  ou r   own  ideals a n d  those we 
have sough t  fo r  o thers  a s  well  a s  ourselves.” 
Accompanying  citations  noted  ‘‘outstanding  con tr ibu t ions”   and  
singled  ou t   Ma jor   White  a s   “the  first  man   to   engage  in   self-propelled 
extra-vehicular  activity.”  Term ing   the  three  “the  Christopher  Colum- 
buses  of  the  20th  century,”  Mr.  Johnson  sa id   the ir   work  had   nudged 
the   world  toward  grea ter   in terna t iona l   cooperation.  “Men  who  have  
worked  together  to  reach   the  s tars   a re   no t   likely  to   descend  together 
in to   the  depths  of  war  and   desolation,”  he   said.  Later,  the   recipients

the   most  powerful  rocket  known  to  have  been  lofted  a n d   the   first 
liquid-fuel  spacecraft  to  be  lifted  from   its  pad  with  solid-fuel  rockets. 
Two  120-in.-dia., 86-ft.-long solid  s trap-on   boosters  generated  a  peak

The  solid-fuel  motors,  made   by  United  Technology  Center,  were 
formed   in  10-ft.-dia. segments  stacked  inside  metal  casings.  Adding

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1965 

June  30 :   Strongly  urg ing   grea ter   emphasis  on  U S .   aeronautics  and   av ia-  
tion  than  now  exists,  Sen.  A.  S.  (M ike )   Monroney  (D-Okla.),  Cha ir-  
man   of  Senate  Aviation  Sub-committee, addressed  Air  Force  Associa- 
tion  in  Dallas, Tex. 
“ I   am  afra id   some  people,  and   I  mean  people  of  h igh   s ta tu re   and  
grea t   influence,  seem  bent  on  relegating  aeronautics  to  a   secondary 
position.  This  I  th ink   is  a   crucial  mistake. 
I n   aeronautics  we  s tand  
on  the  threshold  of  a   boundless  upsurge  which  may  well  dwarf  what 
h a s   been  achieved  by  aviation  over  the  past  61  years. 
“Also,  the  economic  productivity  of  aeronautics  makes  do l lars   .  . . 
and   sense. 
I t  means  money  in  the  bank,  or   ra ther   gold  in  Fo r t   Knox. 
On  the  o ther   hand ,   I  don’t  know  of  any  scheme  .  .  . a n d   I   doub t  
tha t   one  will  emerge  within  this  century  . .  . fo r   fighting  the   balance 
o f   payments  deficit  in  outer  space. 
“There  simply  are   no  dollars  floating  a round   between  here   and   the 
moon.  Fo r   the   time  being,  outer  space  commerce  jus t   doesn’t  seem  to 
be  in  the  cards.  And  as  long  as  th is   is  the  s i tua t ion ,   I  don’t  th ink  
we  should  banish  aeronautics  to   the  back  seat  .  .  . o r   have  a  N A S A  
budget  which  is  better  than   OS  percent  spacecraft  and   less  than   2   per-  
cent  a ircraf t .   And  this  in  spite  of  the   fact  tha t   NA SA   and  i t 5   fore-  
runner ,   NACA ,   were  ostensibly  founded  to   serve  aeronautics ! 
“ I   am  not  saying  this  to  downgrade  space,  but  to  suggest  tha t   we 
s tr ike   a   balance  based  on  how  the  national  interest  and   economy  a re  
served  best.  .  .  .  This  widening  d ispar i ty   between  NASA’s space  and  
aeronautical  efforts  . .  . this  wall  flower  treatment  of  the   a irp lane  
.  .  .  is  a  reckless  gamble,  economically,  politically  and   militarily,  tha t  
will  come  back  t o   haun t   us  in  the  fu ture .   My  criticism,  by  the  way, 
is   not  directed  a t   the  level of  competence i n  tha t   agency  bu t   a t  the   lack 
of  programm ing   of  aeronautical  goals  and   the  fa i lure   to  mobilize  th is  
nation’s  b ra in   power  on  behalf  of  aviation. 
I t   seems  to  me  the  real 
deficiency  is  that  the  well  qualified  aeronautical  talent  in  NA SA   i s   SO 
f a r   down  in   the  h ierarchy   tha t   these  men  rarely  ever  get  involved  in 
the  decision  making. 
It’s crystal clear  tha t   o ther   nations,  the  Russians 
included, have  c u t   this  Gordian  knot  and   a re   rapidly  filling  the   vacuum 
which  we  so   invitingly  created  fo r   them.  . . .”  (T e x t ;   AP ,   N Y T ,

M.  I .   Kiselev  and   E.  B .   Galitskaya  had   worked  out  a  method  of  control- 
ling  spaceships  by  means  of  so lar   pressure.  They  proposed  a  system 
of  reflecting  black  and   white  blades  which  would  work  like  a  propeller 
or   a  “solar  rotary  mill.”  By  regulating  the   inclination  of  the   blades, 
one  could  obtain  a  torsional  moment  and   change  its  direction  and  
deceleration.  Under  conditions  of  weightlessness, the  large   size  of  the  
blades  needed  to  provide  the  required  tors iona l   moment  d id   no t

MSFC   Director  Dr .   Wernher   von  Eraun ,   speaking  before   the   In ter-

two  dom inan t   forces shap ing   the  course  of  human   events  in   ou r   revolu- 
t ionary   age  were  science  and   religion.  And,  Dr.  von  Braun   sa id ,   “it 
is  depressing  to  witness  a  growing  misconception  tha t   these  two  power- 
ful  forces  a re   not  compatible.”  On  the   con t ra ry :   science  was  t ry ing  
to   harness   the  forces  of  na ture   around   man ,   while  th rough   religion 
man sough t  t o  control the  forces of  na ture  within. 
Dr.  von  Braun   sa id   science  and   scientists h ad   been  blamed  fo r   the  
desperate  dilemma  today ,   because  science  h ad   utterly  failed  to   prov ide  
a  practical  answer  on  how  to  handle  the  powerful  forces  i t   had

be   pinned  on  science:  “Science,  all  by 
itself,  ha s   no   mora l  
dimension.  The   same   d r ug   tha t   heals  when  taken  in  modera t ion   will

At  a  news  conference  a t   JPL ,   Dr.  J.  A.  Van  Allen,  Univ.  of  Iowa, 
sa id   tha t   dur ing   i ts   Mars   flyby,  MAR INER   IV  had   discovered  with  a 
variety  of  detectors  tha t   Mars   had   little  o r   no  magnetic  field  and ,  
therefore,  no  rad ia t ion   belts.  Th i s   would  indicate  tha t   the   planet 
lacks  a  liquid  core  and   thus   differs  basically  from   ear th .   Lack  of  a 
metallic  core,  liquid  o r   solid,  would  be  evidence  tha t   the   planet  never 
went  through   the  chu rn ing   in terna l   processes  tha t   gave  the   ea r th   its 
layered  structure.  Mars   would  not  have  continents  formed  of  l igh t-  
weight  rocks  and   ocean  basins  underlain  with  basaltic  rock  a s   found  
on earth. 
W.  M.  Alexander,  NASA  Goddard  Space Flight  Center, expIained  tha t  
there  was  no  evidence  of  a  belt  o r   unusual  concentration  of  cosmic 
dus t   around   the  planet,  nor ,   pointed  ou t   Dr.  H.  S.  Bridge,  MIT,  was 
there   any   evidence  of  a  shock  wave  caused  by  so lar   wind  flowing 
across  the  planet.  The   so lar  wind  was  the  steady  outflow of  thin,  hot, 
high-velocity gas from  the  sun. 
Dr.  William  H.  Pickering,  Director  of  JPL,  when  questioned  by 
newsmen  on  the  possibility  of  higher  life  existing  on Mars,  pointed  ou t  
tha t   the  absence  of  a  magnetic  field  ind ica ted   the  planet’s  atmosphere 
was  h i t   with  all  types  of  rad ia t ion   and   the  existence  of  life  would  de -  
pend  on  how  deep  the  atmosphere was  and   the   extent  of  rad ia t ion   tha t  
reached  the  surface.  Asked  if  he  were  discouraged  abou t   the  possibil- 
i ty   of  finding  life  on   the  planet,  Dr.  Pickering  replied:  “NO ,   I  have 
always  felt  we  will  find  some  sor t   of  life  on  Mars.” 
Dr.  Pickering  pointed  ou t   tha t   one  explanation  for   the  redd ish   hue  
of  Mars  might  be  the  presence  of  limonite,  an   iron   oxide.  Th i s  would

Dr.  Ku r t   H.  Debus,  Director  of  Kennedy  Space  Center,  NASA,  sa id  
in   an   address   a t   the   F i r s t   World  Exhibition  of  Transpor t   and   Com- 
munications  in   Munich:  “ I t   is  my  personal  opinion,  shared  by   some 
colleagues,  tha t   space  flight  will  logically  follow the   pattern  of  histori- 
cal  development  which  has   characterized  the  transportation  industry. 
Tha t   is,  the  exploitation  of  the  system  is   an   outgrowth  of  i ts   invention. 
“This  pattern  is  vividly  demonstrated  by  the  popular  American  leg- 
end  tha t   Henry  Ford   invented  the  automobile,  when  i n   fac t   the  au to-  
mobile  is  not  really  an   American  invention  a t   all.  For  one  thing,  i t  
was no t   invented  by   any  one man,  bu t   by  a  host  of  inventors-most  of 
them  Europeans. 
“However,  Henry  Ford   did  initiate  the   exploitation  of  th i s   invention 
a s   a  means  of  transpor ta t ion   fo r   almost  every  family  i n   America. 
Fo rd   was  a  man   of  great  inventive  genius  who  strove  to   mass  produce 
a  highly  reliable  automobile  at  low  unit  cost.  So F o r d  took  advantage 
of  this  once-novel  invention,  the  automobile,  by  developing  to  a  h igh  
degree  the  a r t s   of  mass  production  with  interchangeable  par ts ,   line 
assembiy,  and   finaiiy  conveyor  assembiy;  and   thus  he  ushered  in  a 
new  age   of  public  transpor ta t ion ,  
“The  automobile  also  serves  as  an  excellent  example  tha t   even  the  
farsighted  a n d   visionary  inventor  often  cannot  visualize  the   ultimate 
utilization  of  h is   invention  by  the   public,  For   the  modern  automobile 
is  a  combination  of  many  inventions-the  wheel,  the   pneumatic  t i re  
which  i n   t u r n   depended  upon  the  discovery  of  vulcanized  rubber ,   the 
in terna l   combustion  engine  and   gasoline--to  name  a  few.  T o   illus- 
t ra te   an   extreme  case,  I  seriously  doub t   if  the  inventor  of  the  wheel 
could  visualize  i ts   use  i n   such  a  superna tura l   machine  a s   the

“The   th ing   to  remember  is  tha t   the   automotive  industry  did  not

I t   came  abou t   because  there  were  inven-

“The  American  scientist, Rober t   Goddard,  who  created  the   first  l iq -  
uid-fueled  rockets  i n   the  United  States,  remarked  tha t   ‘Every  vision  is 
a joke until the  first man  accomplishes it.’ 
“The  men  who  dreamed   up   and   worked  ou t   methods  of  efficient 
transpor ta t ion   unwittingly  opened  up  broad   new  vistas,  and   touched 
off  the  growth  of  tremendous  produc t ion   and   service  industries.  They 
showed  the  way  to   expedite  the  movement  of  people  and   goods,  a n d  
they  also  accelerated  the   exchange  of  ideas  and   customs  and   thus   pro-  
moted unders tand ing  a n d  cooperation. 
“Robert  Goddard  in   America,  like  Hermann  Oberth  in   Europe,  were 
scorned  and   laughed  a t   in  the ir   time.  But  while  we  a r e  meeting  here,

Jdy 15:  “One  absolute  certainty  is  tha t   if  the  atomic  bomb   had   no t   gone 
off  a t   Alamogordo  20  years  ago   tomorrow,  the   spacecraft  Mar iner   4 
would  no t   have  flown  past  Mars   yesterday,”  wrote  William  Hines  in  
the  Washington  Evening  S t a r .   He   continued:  “Space  and   the  atom

been  no  space  race  without  big  rockets  because  the  s tagger ing  develop-

“The  ‘aerospace  business’  of  the  non-atomic ’ ~ O ’ S ,  then,  would  have 
been  ‘airplane  business’  pure  and   simple-and 
a irp lanes   would  be 
much  different  than   they  a r e   today.  There   would  be  no  ‘atomic  en-

these  two  differences  would  have  a 
measurable  economic  impact.  Probab ly   a  million  jobs   nationwide  de- 
pend e i ther  directly or  indirectly on  space and  the  atom. 
“Equally  obviously,  two  vast  bureaucracies  dedicated  to   ‘running’

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1965 
July  16:  Dr.  Edward  C.  Welsh,  Executive  Secretary  of  the   il’ational Aero- 
nautics  and  Space Council, remarked  in  an  interview with Missile  Space 
Da i ly :   “I  do  not  doubt  tha t   with  good  fortune,  the  t r i p   [ to   the   moon] 
will  be  made  dur ing   this  decade,  which  to  me  means  du r ing   the 
1960’s.  Replying  to  a  question  abou t   the   fu ture   use  of  solid  fuel 
rockets,  D r .   Welsh  s a i d :   “ I   certainly  see  n o   reason  to   doubt  tha t   the 
use  of  solids will  continue  to  increase.  Without  attempting  to  predict 
specific  dates  or  missions,  I  believe  large  solid  motor  technology  will 
be  a  very  valuable  element 
in  ou r   growing  national  space 
competence.  . . .”  On  post-Apollo  missions:  “.  . . Under  present 
circumstances,  it  would  seem  tha t   o u r   program   will  include  extended 
exploration  of  the  moon  after  the  first  tr ip ,   provided  conditions  a re  
found   to  be  favorable  to  such  exploration.  Also,  we  should  be   expect- 
ed  to  develop  a  growing  capability  in   ear th-orb i t ing  space  s ta t ions   and  
I  do   not  ra te  
make  an   increasing  effort  in  planetary  exploration. 
these  ma jo r   objectives  one  against  the  o ther   because  I  believe  the 
national  space  program   will  in   time  include  a l l   three  of  the  b road  
missions  I  have   mentioned.”  Dr.  Welsh  said  tha t   he   hoped  the  U S .  
would  be  ab le   to  “maintain  space  expenditures  at  a  figure  above  1 
( M / S  D a i l y ,  7/26/65)

had   been  exploded  by  the  U.S.S.R.  beginning  in   1949, Britain  in   1952, 
France   in  1960,  and   Red  China  in  1964.  Thermonuclear  devices  had  
been  demonstrated  by  the  U S .   in  1952, U.S.S.R.  in   1953,  and   Britain 
in   1957.  Now  Federal  spending  f o r   the  peaceful  uses  of  atomic  en- 
ergy   had   drawn   abreast  of  spending  for   nuclear  weapons  for   the   first 
time  since  the   first  atomic  bomb.  Commenting  on   this  fact,  Evert 
Clark  wrote  i n   the  New  York  T im e s :   “Even  in   the   Atomic  Energy 
Commission  there   is  little tendency  to   view  this  as a  triumph  f o r  peace

ference  on  P lane tary   Cosmogony  in   Moscow  tha t   the   density  of 
matter  on  Mars  and   Venus  was  greater  than  tha t   on  ea r th :   ma t ter   of 
Venus  had   approximately  two  per  cent  more  i r o n ;   Mars   had   approx i-  
mately  six  to  eight  per  cent  more  iron   than   ear th .  
In   mak ing   these 
calculations,  Sofia  Kozlovskaya  used  a  new  “more   exact  model  of  the 
ear th”   which  she  had   built  with  the  da ta   from   recent  seismic

Sciences, noted  in  Tass  interview  the  unusual  weight  of  PROTON   I  a n d  
i ts   special  equipment  for   studying  cosmic  particles  of  super-h igh  
energy.  He  said  the  method  for   counting  the   particles,  worked  ou t  
eight  years  ago  by  Prof .   N.  L.  Grigorov,  had   made   i t   possible  to 
determine  the  total  energy  of  each  particle  separately.  Scientists  h a d  
hesitated  to   use  the  method  in  space  because  of  the   weight  of  the  
equipment.  This problem  had   been  solved with  the  crea t ion   of  a mo re

equipped  with  two upper  stages  called  “transtages”  would  place  one   of 
the   trans tages   in  orbit.  A  T i tan   11  would  send  the  Gemini  c ra f t   af ter  
the   trans tage   and   t h e   two  would  be   docked  i n   orb i t .   Gemini  then

rad io   astronomers  to  crea te   a  10-mi.-dia. an tenna   a r r a y   to  permit  a

Vice  President  of  a  Pa lo   Alto  electronics  firm.  He  estimated  tha t  
1,000  an tennas ,  each  perhaps   10-ft.-dia.,  spread   ou t   over  t h e   area   of  a

In take   of  all  the

energy  would  be  converted  to  sound  energy  and   then  in to   light  to 
prov ide  photographic  images  equivalent  to  optical  images now  taken  of

Missions  to  Jup i ter   could  be  conducted  by  1969,  suggested  Eugene 
Lally,  Space-General Corp.  engineer,  i n   a  paper   presented  to   the   AIAA 
ou t l in ing   a  program   of  six  missions  to  the   planet  Jup i ter ,   beginning 
with  a  fly-by  in  1969  and   culminating  with  a  Jovian  o rb i t   in  the  
mid-1980’s.  A  Jup i ter   mission  would  take  abou t   two  years.  Lally 
postulated  tha t   payload  weights  rang ing   from   a  650-lb.  payload  to  a 
12,400-lb. orb i ter   payload  could  be  easily  handled  by  boosters  rang ing  
from   Atlas-Centaur  with  an   added  kick  stage,  through   the  Sa tu rn   V 
which  would  be  used  to  place  a  man  on  the  moon.  Lally  speculated 
tha t   an  instrumented  probe   would  be  able  to  ob ta in   informa t ion   on  the  
constitution  of  the  core  and   surface  layers,  the   atmosphere,  na ture   of 
the   largest  of  the  planet’s  spots,  topography,  constitution  of  meteoroids 
in   i ts   vicinity  and   the   presence  of  small  satellites  not  yet  discovered 
with  telescopes.  Lally’s  probe   would  con ta in   experiments  to  measure 
the  atmosphere,  magnetic  fields,  and   grav i ta t iona l   fields;  to   conduct 
infrared   and   microwave  examinations  of  the  surface ;   and   to  prov ide

DeMarquis  D.  Wyatt,  NASA  Deputy  Associate  Adm in is tra tor   fo r   P r o -

salt.  Reconstruct  in   your   minds  the  s i tua t ion   10  years  ago  and   evalu- 
ate  the  validity  of  any  discussion  at  tha t   time  of  the  NACA  program   fo r  
the  period  1955-1965.  Such  a  discussion  would  not  have   even  men-

attempted  to   outline  the  NASA  program   fo r   1960-1970  would  have  
widely  missed  the  mark   in   the  prediction  of  today’s  realities.  One  
can,  therefore ,   conclude  tha t   one  of  the  ma jo r   management  problems

cal  s tep   toward  manned  flights  to  Mars  “would  be  a  nine-man  space

’68  budget.” 
Gray  sa id   tha t  meanwhile  NASA  would  continue  i ts   s tudy  p rog ram   on 
planetary  flight.  Propulsion  was  the  limiting  fac tor ,   he  exp la ined ;  
other  problems  such  as  power,  life  suppor t ,   and   communications  were 
expected  to  evolve  satisfactorily  by  the  late  1970’s.  He  foresaw  the  
possibility  of  a manned  flyby mission a round  Mars  by  the  mid-1970’s. 
“Development  of  a  new  launch  vehicle  is  probab le   in   ano ther   four  
o r   five  years,”  he  sa id ,   “and   a  reusable  system  is  a  ‘good  bet.’  Large  
solids will  also  be  a  cand ida te   and  could  be  competitive  with  the  best 
of  the   others  until  the   reusable  vehicle  comes  along.”  Even  then, 
Gray  saw  a  division  of  labor  i n  which  solids  would  hand le   payloads  in  
the   1-to-5-million-lb. class  and   reusable  vehicles  would  concentrate  on 
20,000-to-50,000-lb.  payloads.  Reusable  solids  were  also  under  
consideration.  ( M / S  Da i l y ,   7 /27 /65)

Iu l y   29:  Dr.  Robert  B.  Leighton,  Cal  Tech  professor,  summarized  the  re-  
sults  of  the  MAR INER   IV  mission  to  President  Johnson  in   a  White 
House  ceremony  dur ing   which  the  rema in ing   photos  transmitted  by 
the   spacecraft  were  presented  to   the   President  and   the   Nation.  Dr. 
Leighton  sa id :   “Man’s  first  close-up  look  at  Mars   ha s   revealed  the 
scientifically  s tar t l ing   fact  tha t   a t   least  pa r t   of  i ts   surface   is  covered 
with  la rgec ra te r s .   . . . 
“The  existence  of  Mar t ian   cra ters   is  demonstrated  beyond  question ; 
course,  a  ma t ter   of 
the ir   mean ing   a n d   significance 
is,  of 
interpretation.  The   seventy  cra ters   clearly  distinguishable  on  Mar iner  
photos  Nos.  5  through   15,  range  in   diameter  from   three   to  75 
miles. 
I t   seems likely  tha t   smaller  cra ters   exist,  and   there   also  may  be 
still  larger   ones  than   those  photographed,  since  the   Mar iner   pho-  
tographs,  in  total,  sampled  only  abou t   one   percent  of  the  Ma r t ian   sur-  
face.

“The  observed  cra ters  have   rims  r is ing   a  few hundred   feet  above the 
surround ing   surface   and   dep ths   of  a  few  thousand  feet  below  the 
rims.  Cra ter   walls  so  fa r   measured  seem  to  slope  at  angles  up   to 
about  10 degrees. 
“The  number  of  large  cra ters   per  un i t   area   on  the  Martian  surface is 
closely comparable  to the densely cratered upland  areas of  the  Moon.” 
Dr.  Leighton  said  tha t   no   earth-like  fea tures   were  recognized  and  
tha t   clouds  “were  not  identified and  the  flight  pa th   d id  no t   cross  e i ther  
po lar   cap.” 
Some  of  the   fundamen ta l   inferences  drawn  from  the  MARINER   IV 
photos were: 
“1.  I n   terms  of  i ts   evolutionary  history,  Mars   is  more   Moon-like 
than   Earth-like.  Nonetheless, because  i t  h a s  an   atmosphere, Mars may 
shed much light on ear ly  phases of  Earth‘s  history. 
“2.  Reasoning  by   analogy  with  the  Moon,  much  of  the   heavily  cra-  
tered  surface   of  Mars   must  be   very  ancient--perhaps 
two  to  five  bil- 
lion years  old. 
“3.  The   remarkab le   s ta te   of  preservation  of  such  an   ancient  surface  
leads  us   to   the   inference  tha t   no  atmosphere  significantly  denser  than  
the  present  very  th in   one  ha s   characterized  the   planet  since  tha t   su r -  
face was  formed.  Similarly,  i t   is  difficult  to  believe  tha t   free   water  i n  
quantities  sufficient to  form   streams  o r   to  fill  oceans  could  have  existed 
anywhere  o n   Mars   since  tha t   time.  The  presence  of  such  amounts  of 
water  (and   consequent  a tmosphere)   would  have   caused  severe  erosion 
over the en t ire  surface. 
“4.  The  pr inc ipa l   topographic  features  of  Mars  photographed  b y  
Mar iner   have  not  been  produced  by  stress  and  deformation originating 
within  the  planet,  in   distinction  to   the  case  of  the   Ear th .   Ea r th   is 
internally  dynamic  giving  rise  to  mountains,  continents,  and  other 
such  fea tures ,  while  evidently  Mars  ha s   iong   been  inactive.  The  !a& 
of  in terna l   activity  is  also  consistent  with  the  absence  of  a  significant 
magnetic  field  on   Mars   a s   was  determined  by  the  Mar iner   magnetom- 
e te r   experiment. 
“ 5 .   As  we  had   anticipated,  Mariner  photos  neither  demonstrate  n o r  
preclude  the   possible  existence  of  life  on   Mars.  The  search  for   a 
fossil  record  does  appear   less  promising  i f   Martian  oceans  never 
existed.  On  the   o ther   hand ,   if  the   Mar t ian   surface  is  truly  in  i t s  
primitive  form,  the  surface  may   prove  to   be  the  best-perhaps 
the   only 
-place 
in   the  so lar   system  still  preserving  clues  to   original  organ ic  
development, traces of  which have long  since disappeared  from Earth.” 
Dr.  Leighton  noted  tha t   “one  of  the   most  difficult  problems associat- 
ed  with  the   Mar iner   photographic  mission  to   Mars  w a s   the  wide  illu- 
mination  range”  tha t   was  encountered.  Assisting  Dr.  Leighton  in   h is  
presentation  were:  Prof .   Bruce  C.  Murray ,   Cal  Tech ;   Prof.  Rober t   P. 
Sharp ,   Cal  Tech ;   R ichard   K.  Sloan,  J P L ;   and   J.  Denton  Allen, 
JPL .   President  Johnson  sa id   he  was  a  bit  relieved  that  MARINER’S 
photographs  “didn’t  show more   signs  of  life  ou t   there.”  He  described 
the  Ma r s   p ic tures   a s   “awe-inspiring”  and   sa id   tha t   “the  flight  of  Mar-  
iner   4 will  s tand   as  one  of  the   grea t   advances  of  man’s  quest  t o   extend 
the horizons of  human   knowledge.’’

Ju l y  29:  Dur ing   MARINER   IV  press  conference  a t   NASA   Hq.,  NASA  Adminis- 
t r a t o r   James   E.  Webb,  in  response  t o   a  question  abou t   the  possibility 
of  “ano ther   Mariner  mission  in  the  relatively  near  future,”  replied: 
“We  had  decided  some  time  ago   not  to  fly  another  one  of  these  mis- 
sions  with  the  equipment  we  used  on  MAR IN ER   IV   bu t   to   concentrate 
on  much  more   impor tan t   work  that  we  can   do   with  advanced  equ ip-  
ment. 
‘‘So  I  should  say  tha t   it’s  highly  unlikely  th a t   we  would  revive  con- 
sideration  of  ano ther   flight.” 
Mr.  Webb  sa id   tha t   the   M A R I N E R   I V   flight,  including  the  MAR INER  
111  attempt  tha t   failed,  “cost  over  $100 million.”  He  con t inued :   “Dr. 
Pickering  and   h i s   group   with  the  American  indus tr ia l   companies 
proved  tha t   w e   could  move  out  from  the  e a r th   and   get  to   the   planet 
a n d  do  wha t  we  intended t o  do.  . .  . 
“Second,  the  scientific  experimenters  worked  in  close  harmony ,   and  
the  relationship  between  the  experimenters  and   the  people  responsible 
for  making  the  flight  get  to   its  destination  an d  br ing   the  da ta   back  was 
I  think  a  very  outstanding  achievement  and   also  is  a  p a r t   of  the  learn- 
ing process in  the  space program .  
“Lastly,  i t   certainly  is   very  important,  as   we  have  emphasized  in   the 
manned  spaceflight  program ,   to   gain  some  knowledge,  even  though   i t  
is  not  full  and   complete,  a t   as   early  a  s tage   a s   possible,  because  we 
have  planned  a  broad-based  program   over  a  ten-year  period.  But  we 
also  have 
the  capability  of 
change  and   modification 
in 
the 
program.  And  this  gives  u s   a  good  deal  of  informa t ion   th a t   in   my 
view  will  have  a  s trong   bear ing   on  the   decisions  to   be  made   in   th e  
1967  budget.” 
Mr.  Webb  sa id   tha t   he   d id   no t   see  “very  much  difference  between 
our   Capability  a n d   the ir   [Soviet]  capability  a t   this  t ime   bu t   tha t   we 
a r e   both  moving  into  a  period  when  we  will  be  able  to  select  cer ta in  
options for   fu r th e r  emphasis and  development.” 
I t   was  revealed  tha t   the  results  of  the  MAR INER   IV  mission  would  b e

Of  course,  nearness  can   intensify  hos t i l i ty ;   and   the   fact  tha t   the  first 
manifestations  of  the  technical  oneness  of  the   world  were  two  world 
wars  proves  this  possibility.  But  nearness  can  also  have  the   opposite

I n   the  10-mo.  plan, 
reacquisition  would  be  initiated  when  the  spacecraft  was  abou t   135  
million mi.  from  ear th .   Due to  relative  sun-ear th  positions i n  February

Aviation W e e k  tha t   MAR INER   IV  would  be  of  par t icu lar   scientific  interest 
in  1967.  F irs t ,   there  were  no  o ther   interplanetary  probes  being  sent

within  6,000  mi.  of  Ma r s   July  14,  the   grav i ta t iona l   pull  of  the   planet 
had   tilted  the  plane  of  the  spacecraft  ou t   of  the  p lane   of  the   ecliptic. 
MAR INER   IV,  5.3  million  mi.  above  the   ecliptic  i n   September  1967, 
would  give  scientists  the ir   f irs t   chance  to  compare  in terp lane tary   find-

Pre l im inary   estimates were  tha t   the   10-mo. plan  would  cost  between 
$5  million  and   $15  million,  while  the  four-to-six-week pro jec t   would 
cost  less  than   $1 million.

Comparing  LUNA  111  [LUN IK   1111  and   ZOND 111,  H.  Pfaffe said  in  a n   article

was  ab le   to  photograph  the  moon  under   favorable  illumination  condi-

only  4 0   minutes.  Zond  3’s  tra jec tory   was  so  chosen  tha t   the   probe  
assumed a  planetary  orb i t   around   the  sun.  Luna   3,  on  the   o ther  hand ,  
assumed  an   elliptical  o rb i t   with  the   ear th   a s   one  focal  point.  While

August  16 :   Rober t   Hotz  commented  in  an   Av ia t ion   Week   and  Space  Tech -  
n o l o g y   ed i tor ia l :   “The   summer  of  1965   seems  destined  to  appear   i n  
space  history  as  a  period  o f   form idab le   success  in   extending  the  
horizons  of  man’s  efforts  t o  explore his  universe.  The  two  spectacular 
achievements  of  Mar iner   4  and   Gemini  4  have  been  interspersed  with 
several  o ther   milestones  in  space  technology  a s   the  summer  unfolded. 
“Even  after  all  the   millions  of  words  tha t   have  been  poured   ou t   i n  
describing  the  amazing  feats  of  the  Mar iner   4  spacecraft,  i t   is  difficult 
to  comprehend  the  full  magnitude  of  its  achievements.  The   228-day 
voyage  of  Mariner  4  across  1 3 5  million  mi.  to   the  vicinity  of  Mars, 
and   i ts   transmission  of  the  first  relatively  close-up  pictures  of  tha t  
planet  back  across  the   void  to  ear th ,   probably  will  rank   as  t h e   most 
spectacular feat  of  space exploration  i n  the   first  decade since Spu tn ik   1. 
“More  than   any  o ther   space  flight  since  the  first  manned  space 
mission  by  Vostok  1 ,   this  successful  reconnaissance  of  Mars   has  
demonstrated  the  infinite  possibilities 
tha t   lie  ahead  in   ob ta in ing  
a  truly  scientific  grasp   of  the   universe  around   us.  The   evidence  tha t  
was  provided  by  the  Mariner  4  photographs  was  a  scientific  discovery 
of  the  first  magnitude  and   certainly  showed  the  limitations  of  ea r th -  
based  astronomy.  But  perhaps   its  real  significance 
lies 
in 
the  
demonstration  tha t   a  complex  spacecraft  can  voyage,  communicate, 
a n d   function  over  the   vast  reaches  of  space  under   human   control 
and   command  from  ear th .   . . . 
“There   is  little  doub t   tha t   the  U S .   space  program   would  not  be 
opera t ing   a t   i ts   present  pace  o r   scope  without  the   early,  humiliating 
p rod   of  the   Soviet  Union’s  pioneering  in  th is   field.  However,  the  
results  now  being  produced  f rom   the   U S .   program   a r e   proving  so 
useful  in   such  a  variety  of  applications  tha t   there   should  be  little 
doub t   tha t   i t   is  worth  pursu ing   for  its  own  goals,  even  without  the  
stimulus  of 
in terna t iona l   competition. 
I t   may  well  be  tha t   when 
h is tor ians  write  of  the   space  age  they  will  point  to  the  summer  of  1965 
as  the   time  when  the   U S .   effort  finally  reached  ma tur i ty   and   began 
break ing   its  own  new  ground,  in   contrast  t o   the  ear l ier   e r a   of  s tern-

NASA  was  seeking  buyers  for   rocket  launches,  and   the  improved  Delta, 
incorpora ted   in to   the   launch   package,  might  prove  most  economical, 
William  S.  Beller  reported  i n   Missiles and  Rocke ts .   Cost  of  launch ing  
the  Delta,  e i ther   to  low-earth o rb i t   o r   in to   in terp lane tary   space,  would 
be   the   same.  Cost  to  send  a  package  to  t h e  moon  would  be   $16,000/ 
lb.;  on a Ma r s  flyby,  $21,000/lb. 
Beller’s  article  continued:  “ I t   is  iron ic   tha t   the   fabulously  successful 
series  of  Delta  rockets  is  based  o n  much  of  the   ha rdwa re   and   concepts

used.  Th is   was  the  Delta  tha t   failed  in  i ts   first  firing  i n   1960 with  an  
Echo satellite payload.  The  subsequent Deltas orbited  their payloads i n  
22  successive launchings. 
“The  Vanguard   program,  too,  besides  giving  b i r th   to  Delta  was 
probably  one  of  the  most  economical  buys  of  the  U S .   space  program. 
Originally  budgeted  fo r   a  total  cost  of  $20  million,  Vanguard  ended 
u p   costing  $105  million,  which  was  paid  not  only  for  development  of 
the   Vanguard   hardware   and   several  launchings  bu t   also  f o r   setting 
u p   the   worldwide  Minitrack  network  used  in  Pro jec t   Mercury. 
“Improvements  in  Delta  from   1960  to  the  present  involved  using 
more  energetic  propellants,  lengthening  the   second-stage tanks,  replac- 
ing   the  third-stage  motor  for   a  more  active  one,  add ing  solid  s trap-ons  
to  the  first stage, and  aga in  en larg ing  the second stage. 
“The  result  is  an  inexpensive  and   reliable  bus   whose  launch  can  b e  
(Beller,  M&R ,   8/16/65,  2 4 )  
bought  fo r   less  than   $3.5  million.”

is  every  reason  to  suppose  tha t   a  United  States  satellite  could  have

Leonard  Jaffe.  Director  of  NA SA   Communication  and   Navigation  Pro- 
grams,  told  the Conference tha t   recent  announcement  tha t   DOD’S  naviga- 
tion  satellite  system  was  operational  demonstrated  the  grea t   potential 
of  artificial ear th   satellites for   providing  position  determinations  to   the  
mar i t ime   indus try .   He  said  NASA   had   under   study  a  number   of  tech- 
niques,  different  from   those  employed  in   the  DOD   system,  by  which 
satellites  located  in   medium  o r   synchronous  o rb i t s   could  provide  posi- 
tion  fixes  to  ships  and   a ircraf t .   Techniques  whereby  the  craft’s  posi- 
tion  would  be  determined  at  ground   computer  s ta t ions   might  make 
the   satellite  system  attractive  to  U S .   industry,  he  sa id .  
For  the  fu ture   Jaffe  foresaw  the  combination  of  a  position  deter- 
m ina t ion   method  and  a  communications  system  integrated  in to   a 
single  satellite  to  provide  capability of  a id ing   in  a i r  traffic  control.  He  
said :  “Accurate  position  da ta   and  reliable  communications  readily 
available  to  a i r   traffic  controllers  by  use  of  satellites may  provide  the  
answer  to  the  acute  problem  of  safely  reducing  the   present  separa t ion  
s tandard   of  a ircraf t   flying  across  the   crowded  Atlantic  Ocean  region. 
Similar  da ta   supplied  to   a  maritime  regulatory  agency  may  provide 
(T e x t )  
a  means  for   preventing  mar ine   collisions.” 
Augus t   18-20:  Gen.  Bernard  A .   Schriever, AFSC  Commander,  par t ic ipa t ing  
in  a  panel  discussion  on  the  “Social  Implications  of  Space  Explora- 
tion,”  sa id :   “.  . . there  a re   two  ways  of  looking  a t   space.  The   first 
way  is  simply  as  a  place-as 
the  vast  expanse which  is  an   extension  of 
the   earth‘s  atmosphere  in   every  direction,  and   which  can  serve  as  an  
operational  environment.  There   is  much  we  need  to  discover  abou t  
this  region,  but  it  is  already  clear  tha t   space  adds   a  new  dimension 
to  our   th ink ing   abou t   na t icna l   security. 
“Space  has   at  least  four   unique  characteristics  which  offer  ad-  
vantages  fo r   m i l i tary   operations.  These  a re  :  first,  extremely  h igh  
altitudes  which  offer  line  of  sight  to  large   areas   of  the  earth’s  surface ;  
second,  very  high  speeds;  th ird ,   almost  infinite  flight  du ra t ion ;   a n d  
four th ,   highly  predictable  flight  paths. 
“These  recognized  advantages have  led  to   the   development  of  a  num- 
be r   of  space  systems which  provide  suppor t   to  m i l i tary   land ,   sea,  and  
a i r   operations.  These  include  satellite  systems  fo r   communications, 
weather,  a n d   navigation.  The   capabilities  they  prov ide   a re   e i ther  
unique  o r   represent  a  distinct  improvement  over  o ther   means  of 
accomplishing the  same  task  . .  . 
“On  the  o ther   hand ,   the  advantages  of  space  a r e   frequently  offset 
by  several  disadvantages.  The  first  of  these  is   the   cost  of  launch ing  
payloads  in to   space.  Presently  th i s   amoun ts   to   abou t   $1000  a  pound

in   low  ea r th   orb i t ,   although  i t   is   estimated  tha t   the  T i tan  111  will  reduce 
th is   figure to   about  $500  a  pound,  and   we  foresee  methods  of  reducing 
the   cost  to   the   neighborhood  of  $100  a  pound.  The  second  is   the  
requirement  for   extremely  h igh   reliability-the  need  to  build  satellites 
tha t   will  opera te   for  long   per iods   without  maintenance  a n d   repa ir .  
Th i rd   is the   absence of  a  demonstrated method  of  returning  from   space 
to  a  controlled landing  at  a  specified point.  And  fourth  is  the   env iron-  
ment  of  space  itself-the 
problems  associated  with  hard   vacuum, 
tempera ture   extremes,  and   intense  rad ia t ion .  
“The  need  to   overcome these  disadvantages leads  to  consideration  of 
the  second way  in which space may be   regarded-not  merely  a s  a  place, 
bu t   as  a  pr imary   focus  fo r   man’s  scientific  and   technological  efforts 
i n   the   years  ahead.  The   success  of  these  efforts  will  determine  the  
practical  use  tha t   can  be  made  of  space  for   a  variety  of  purposes, 
including  military  purposes.’’

Augu s t   19 :   Gemini  v  launch  counted  down  to  T-10  min.  before  i t   was

in to   the  fuel  cells  succeeded  only  in   hastening  the  escape  of  hydrogen  
Finally,  a  colder  l iqu id   hydrogen  was  used  with  success.  Ten

minutes  before  lift-off,  apparen t   troubles  with  a  telemetry  programer

On  Aug.  24,  Astronauts  Cooper  and   Conrad  twice  spotted  objects 
on   the   g round ;   they  observed  a  Minuteman  IC BM   launch  f r om  Vanden- 
berg   AFB,  and   tracked  and   photographed  i t ;   they  sighted  a  huge 
checkerboard  design  laid  out  on  the  ground   near   Laredo,  Tex.,  and  
reported  d irec t ion  in   the  which  arrows   in   the  center  of  the  blocks were 
pointed. 
August  21 -29 :   On  Aug.  25,  the   as tronau ts  saw,  tracked,  and  pho tographed  
ano ther   Minuteman  ICBM   fired  from   Vandenberg  AFB  and  identified  a

Dur ing   the   flight, the  as tronau ts  both  remained  i n  good  sp ir i ts .  
teen  of  the   planned  seventeen  experiments  were  conducted.  Despite 
the heavy work  schedule, Cooper and  Conrad each  slept about  five hou r s  
a  day.  The   astronauts  ate  abou t   2,000  calories  of  food  a  day ,   less 
than   the  2,900  calories  prescribed  fo r   the   mission,  and  each  d rank  
six  pounds  of  water  daily.

fuel  cell,  which  threatened  to   exceed  water-storage  capacity;  faulty 
a t t i tude   and   maneuvering  thrus ters ;   and   the  boiling  off  of  hydrogen  
ga s   which  caused  the  spacecraft  to  roll. 
On  Aug.  28,  the   fuel  cell  and   the  left  thrus ter   were  functioning  well. 
Conrad   reported  seeing  “a  ca r r ie r   and   a  destroyer  steaming  r igh t   in to

the   capacity  of  wiping  any  aggressor  off  the   face  of  the   ear th .  
“There   is no  doubt  at  all  abou t  the  intended  identity  of  the  aggressor 
and   among  American  scientists  back  home  there   is  little  doub t   abou t  
the   weapon. 
“There   is  little  doub t   because  the  United  States  spent  7  years   a n d  
$10 million  between  1958-65  to  plan  the   nuclear-powered space  orb i t-  
ing   system called  Pro jec t   Orion.  We  have  h igh-rank ing   scientists who

August  23:  I t  was  too  ear ly   to  set  a  realistic  da te   f o r  man’s  land ing   on  the  
moon,  Mstislav  V.  Keldysh,  President  of  the   Soviet  Academy  of  Sci- 
ences,  said  dur ing   a  Moscow  press  conference  devoted  to  the  ZOND   111 
mission.  He  explained:  “.  .  . we  have  . . .  learned  quite  a  lot  abou t  
the  surface  of  the moon.  Yet  this does not  seem to  be  a  grea t  dea l   . . . 
where  the   choice  of  a  land ing   spot  is  concerned.  . . .  Ou r   knowledge 
of  the   soil  of  the  moon  is  still  somewhat  con trad ic tory ,   and   I  th ink   i t  
is much  too  ear ly   to  s ta r t   looking  for  a  fu ture   land ing   site  . . .” 
Yur i   Khodarev,  engineer  in   the   Soviet  space  program ,   revealed  tha t  
ZOND  111  had   used  photographic  film  instead  of  magnetic  film  to  record 
pictures  for   la ter   playback  on  ear th   command.  T h e  mission  had   been 
essentially  a  test  in   which  the  spacecraft  would  continue  to   play  back 
the   moon  pictures  repeatedly  a t   increasingly  grea ter   distances  up   to  
“hundreds   of  millions  of  kilometers,”  Khodarev  said,  adding,  “we 
have  created  a  new,  compact  photo  television  system  intended  fo r  
pho tograph ing   and  transmission  of  images  of  planets  under   conditions 
of  prolonged  space  flight.”  The   wide-angle  camera   lens  had   a  106.4- 
mm.  focal  length  a t  a  relative  aper ture  of  1:s.  A  25-mm. film was  used 
with  exposures  of  1/100th  and   1/300th  of  a  second.  Describing  the  
ZOND   111  television  system, Khodarev  said  ZOND   111  had   taken  25  photos 
of  the  fa r  side of  the moon  in   little more  than   an  hou r .   Only  one com- 
mand   had   been  given  from   earth-to 
s ta r t   tak ing   the  photographs. 
All  remaining  operations  occurred  automatically. 
The  Z O N D   111  photographs  confirmed  ear l ier   conclusions  concerning 
the   scarcity  of  da rk   depressions  on  the   moon’s  reverse  side,  bu t   also 
revealed  sea-like  formations  up  to  500  km.  (310.5  m i . )   across  and  
abou t   as  long  as  the   mar ia .   These  forma t ions   differed  s truc tura l ly  
from   the  ma r ia   and   lacked  the ir   characteristic  d a r k  color.  The  nor th-  
ern   pa r t   of  the  side  of  the  moon  was  occupied  by   a  b r igh t   elevation 
pitted  with  craters.  Concentration  of  cra ters   throughou t   the   reverse 
side  of  the moon  was  h igh .  
Soviet  astronomer  Alla  Masevich  said  the  moon  pho tographs   were 
as  good  as  those  taken  of  the  visible  s ide   from   ear th-based   observa- 
tor ies :   “They  show  beautiful  half-tone  transitions,  reflecting  the   cha r -  
acter  of  detailed  surface   relief.” 
Alexander  A.  Mikhailov,  director  of  the   Pulkovo  Observatory,  a t-  
tr ibu ted   the   observed  difference between the  moon’s  visible  side  and   its 
reverse  s ide   to  geological  ra ther   than   astronomical  factors.  He   noted 
the  appearance  on  Zond  photographs  of  cha ins   of  cra ters   along  elon- 
gated  frac ture   lines  which  he  a t tr ibu ted   to   volcanic  activity. 
Prof.  Keldysh  noted  tha t   the  tra jec tory   of  ZOND   111  had   passed  f a r  
f rom   the   planets  but  sa id   tha t   “the  experience we  ga ined   i n  launch ing  
this  probe   in to   remote  space  will  be  used  i n   subsequent  launchings  t o

DOD  would  in i t ia te   a  demonstration  program   of  a  h igh-performance  
cryogenic  engine  in  FY  1966,  which  could  provide  up  to   50%  payload 
increase  in  the  fu ture ,   Dr.  Harold  Brown,  Director  of  DOD   Research 
and   Engineering,  told  a  closed  session  of  the  Senate  Aeronautical  and  
Space Sciences Committee.  Brown  said  tha t   the  program ,   which would 
be  closely  coordinated  with  NASA ,   would  provide  the   design  da ta  
necessary  to  initiate  n  high-performance  engine  development  program  
in  the  future. 
Dr .   Brown  suggested  tha t   the  1975-1985  time  period  might  include 
operational  reusable  spacecraft,  possibly  growing  ou t   of  an   Mol  pro-  
gram  requirement  fo r  da ta   re turn   o r   logistic  resupply.  He  foresaw  an  
evolution  of  “reentry  spacecraft  shapes  which  will  provide  grea ter  
flexibility  of  operations,  enjoy  higher  reusability,  and   possess  close  to  
the  same   volumetric  efficiency  of  curren t   reentry  spacecraft.  These 
high  performance  maneuverable  reentry  spacecraft  should  be  capable 
of  performing  missions  calling  for  fast  tactical  response  and   grea ter

Distinction  between  “orbit”  and   “revolution7’  was  discussed  by  John  
A .   Osmundsen  in  a  New  Y o r k   T imes   article:  “An  orb i t   is  simply  the 
completion  of  a  circuit  in  space. 
“A   revolution,  on   the  other  hand ,   is  two  consecutive  passages  of 
a  satellite  over  a  par t icu lar   meridian  on   earth.  . . . 
“The  switch  in  terminology  from  orb i ts   to   revolutions  was  desirable 
for   practical  reasons  involving  ground   tracking,  ground-to-satellite 
communications  and   the  execution  of  satellite  experiments  geared 
to   terrestrial  features,  such  as   volcanoes  and  clouds. 
“I t   is  impor tan t   to   make  the  distinction  between  orb i ts   and   revolu- 
tions  . . . because  a  satellite  moving  east  completes  an   orb i t   in  less 
t ime  than   it  takes  t o  complete  a  revolution.  Hence,  i t   will  make   fewer 
revolutions  than   orbits.”

The ir   value  fo r   surveillance  is  obvious.  As  President  Johnson  sa id ,

body  i n   the   solar  system  known  to  pass  inside  the   o rb i t   of  Mercury ;  
a n d   ( 2 )   Icarus’  o rb i t   was  highly  inclined  to   tha t   of  the   o ther   planets.

If  the  two  measured  po in ts

changed  with  each  close  passage  to  the   sun ,   then  the   sun   would  be  
known  to   be  less  than   a  perfect  sphere.  And,  the  amoun t   by  which

If  the   sun’s  rad ius   a t   the  equa tor   exceeded  i ts   polar  rad iu s   by  a s  
little  as  0 .005% ,   the   distortion  of  the  sun’s  grav i ta t iona l   field  tha t   th i s  
would  cause  would  be  enough  to  account  fo r   10%  of  the   predicted

if  the  distortion  were  found,  the  theory  must  be  incorrec t .

bility  of  many  items  involved  in   America’s  space  program ,   inc lud ing  
He  inserted  in to  the Congressional R e c o rd :  
food. 
“The  Pillsbury  items  scheduled  by  NASA  for   the  Cooper-Conrad mis- 
s i o n - e a c h   ready  to  eat  and   requ ir ing   no   reconstitution-were 
brow- 
nies,  gingerbread,  pineapple  fruitcake,  da te   fruitcake,  apr ico t   cerea l  
bars,  s trawberry  cereal bars ,   toasted bread  cubes and  cinnamon  toast. 
“Cooper  and   Conrad   were  programed  to  ea t   4 meals  each  day ,   p ro -  
viding  a  daily  average  of  approximately  2,500  calories.  The   selected 
menu  . . . was  designed  to   ma in ta in   body  weight  at  zero  gravity 
under  l igh t   physical  activity.  The   8  Pillsbury  items  were  designed  to 
provide  a  h igh   energy  source  tha t   supplemented  the  rehydra tab le   foods 
in   the  menu  for   each  meal.  They  requ ired   no   prepara t ion   time  and  
provided  solid  food consistency.  . . .”  ( C R ,  9/9/65,  A5095)  
William  Hines  commented  on  the  economy  of  low  b idd ing   in   an   article 
in  the  Washington  Evening  S ta r :   “The   lowest  b idder   still  produces 
hardware   for  Uncle  Sam’s  space  effort,  and   th is   arrangemen t   does  not 
always prove  the  most  economical  in  either  time  o r   money.  A  g lar ing  
example  ha s   developed  at  the   Kennedy  Space  Center  in  F lor ida ,   where 
America’s moonport  is  rapidly  nearing  completion. 
“The  lowest  b idder   ha s   built  two  huge  tank-like  vehicles  called 
‘crawler-transporters’ there,  a t   a  saving  of  almost  $3  million  below  a 
competitive  bidder’s  price.  The  only  trouble  is   tha t   the  crawlers  will 
not  do  the   j o b   they  were  designed  for,  which  is  to  ca r ry   a  Sa tu rn   V 
moon  rocket  on  a  mobile  launching  tower  some  three   miles  f rom   an  
assembly building to where  the rocket will  actually blast. 
“Trouble ha s  been traced  to some tapered  roller bearings.  . . . 
“There  seems  to  be  nothing  wrong  with  the   bearings,  which  a r e  
produced  by  the  biggest  and   best  known  manufac turer   of  such 
items.  The   fau l t   apparen t ly   lies  in   incorrect  design  assumptions 
which  result  i n   overloads  sometimes  being  imposed  on  the   bear ings ,  
causing them  to   fail. 
“Since  the  design-offered 
by  the  con trac tor ,  Mar ion   Power  Shovel 
approved  by  NASA  technical  experts,  the   government  will 
Co.-was 
probably  have  to   pay  for  the   redesign  necessary  to  make  the   crawler 
work.  These redesign  costs  could well wipe  ou t   the  difference between 
Marion’s  b id   and   the   h igher   proposal  of  Bucyrus-Erie,  ano ther   large  
builder  of  heavy  mobile  equipment.  . . . 
“As  i t   tu rn s   out,  the   false  economy  of  low  b idd ing   i n   th is   instance 
may  cause  the  United  States  to  miss  i ts   stated  goal  in   space:  men  on

appear  among our  reporters  and  copy editors. 
“If  you  recall,  since  late  1957  there  have  been  a  number  of  h in ts  
tha t   the   advent  of  space  exploration  would  create  some  new   difficulties 
with  ou r   ed i tor ia l   style.  F irs t ,   there  was  the  problem  of  deciding 
whether  to   italicize  the   Russian  word  ‘sputnik.’  Then  we  h a d   to   de- 
cide  on   the   spelling a n d   capitalization  of  ‘a-okay’  (o r  is  it  ‘A -OK ? ) .  
would tax  the abilities of  Clifton Fad iman ,  himself.  .  . . 
“Unfortunately,  we  a r e   now  encountering  some  difficulties  which 
“Perhaps   the  most  serious  problem  . . . stems  apparently  from  an  
oversight  on  the  par t   of  ou r   ancestors. 
I n   writing  out  the  names  of 
the   n ine   planets  of  o u r   so lar   system  i t   became  evident  tha t   we  have 
neglected  to  formally  name  our   own  planet.  At  least  this  is  the  only 
conclusion  one  can  come  to  when  it’s  noted  that  we  capitalize  the  
names  of  all  the   planets  except  our   own.  Webster,  himself,  insists  on 
using  a  lower  case  ‘e’  for   ea r th   while  dignifying  tiny  Mercury  with  a 
capital.  Even the  minor planets such as Eros carry  formal names. 
“The  neglect  is   even  more   conspicuous  in  the   instance  of  o u r   own

such  as  Phobos  we  refer  to  ours  in   the   generic  and ,   consequently, with 
a lower case ‘m’. 
“ I   suggest  we  either  s ta r t   capitalizing  Ear th   and  Moon  o r   else  ask

He  listed  three pr imary  commitments:

“many  Soviet  and   American  scientists will  par t ic ipa te   to  lay  the   foun-

“ (  3 )   Qualify  systems  and   crews  fo r   subsequent  long-dura t ion  space 
missions. 
“ ( 4 )   T o  explore, map  and  survey  the Moon. 
Th roughou t  these  extended  Apollo  missions, the   pr imary   emphas is  will 
be  on  science  a n d  applications experiments. 
“The   founda t ion   for   any   long-range   a n d   b road   national  space   p ro -

Soviet  Cosmonaut  Pave1  Belyayev  reported  a t   the  IAF congress  tha t  
the   exit  of  cosmonauts  in to   space  from  orb i ta l   s ta t ions   to  relieve  the 
crews  and   perform  work  in  space  would  be  made  only  through   a i r  
avoid  dehermetization  of 
the

from   2 6 3 0 %   du r ing   spaceflight.  Sensitivity  of  the  eye  to  color  was 
also  affected.  Drop of  50% occurred in  the case of  green  and  purple. 
Cosmonaut  Aleksey  Leonov  described  in   h is   repor t   the  functioning

excess  pressure  in   the   spacesuit  was  g.4  atmospheres  a n d   before 
reentry  in to   the  spacecraft, he  sa id :   “ I   once more  set  the   pressure  back 
to  $3.27  atmospheres.”  Data  obtained,  he  summed  up,  permitted  the  
conclusion  tha t   stepping  ou t   in to   open  space  does  not  cause  serious 
specific changes in  psychophysiological functions. 
Of  the  fu ture   of  the  Soviet  space  program ,   he  sa id :   “In   time  there  
will  be  many  space  laboratories,  with  crews  be ing   periodically

September  21 :   I n   advance  excerpts  of  his  book,  Wag ing  Peace,  1956-1961, 
Pres iden t   Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  related  his  “reactions to  Spu tn ik   a n d  
the  Ga i ther   Report”  i n  October  and   November  1957.  President  Eisen- 
hower  reviewed  a  meeting  on  October  8, 1957, with  his  principal  mili- 
ta ry   and   scientific  advisers.  The  la te   Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense 
Donald  A.  Quarles  repor ted :   “There  is  no  doub t   tha t   the  Army  Red- 
stone  could  have  orbited  a  satellite  a  year  o r   more  earlier.  . . .” 
Quarles  reviewed  the  reasons  fo r   the   separa t ion   of  the  IGY  Vanguard  
satellite from  the ballistic  missile programs ,  saying:  “The  Russians have  
done   us   a  good  turn ,   unintentionally,  in   establishing  the  concept  of 
in terna t iona l   space,”  a  principle  confirmed  by  the  orbiting  of  Spu tn ik  
over the  a i r  space of  country  af ter  country.  “Late  tha t  same morning,” 
President  Eisenhower  wrote,  “I  directed  Secretary  of  Defense  Charles 
Wilson  to  have  the  Army  p repa re   its Redstone  a t  once  as  a  backup   for 
the Navy  Vanguard.” 
Of  SPUTNIK   11,  which  orbited  “Laika”  on  November 3,  1957,  Pres i-  
dent  Eisenhower  said  it  d id   not  arouse  American  public  op in ion   be- 
cause  people  “seemed  to  resent  the   sending  a  dog  to   certain  death-a 
resentment  tha t   the  Soviet  propagandists  tried  to  assuage  a  few  days

rations.  .  . .

“The   Soviet  satellites,”  Pres iden t   Eisenhower  sa id ,   “were  a  genu ine

President  Johnson  signed  in to   law  the   H igh-speed   Ground   Transpor ta-  
t ion   Act  of  1965  (PL   89-220) 
in  White  House  ceremony.  He   sa id :  
‘ b .   .  . In   recent  decades,  we  have  achieved  technological  miracles  in  
o u r  transpor ta t ion .   But there  is one grea t  exception. 
“We  have  airplanes  which  fly  three  times  faster  than   sound.  We 
have  television  cameras  tha t   a re   orb i t ing  Mars.  But  we  have  the  same  
t ired   and   inadequa te  mass  transpor ta t ion   between  our   towns  and   cities 
tha t  we had   30 years ago. 
“Today  . . .  an   as tronau t   can  orb i t   the  ea r th   faster  than   a  man   on  
the   ground   can  get  from  New  York  to  Washington.  Yet,  the  same  
science  and   technology  which  gave  us  our   a irp lanes   and   ou r   space 
probes,  I  believe,  could  also  give  us   better  and   faster  and   more   eco- 
nomical  transpor ta t ion   on   the  ground.  And  a  lot  of  us   need  i t   more  
on the ground   than  we  need  i t  orb i t ing  the earth.  . . . 
“The  H igh-speed   Ground  Transpor ta t ion   Act  of  1965  really  gives 
us,  fo r   the  first  time  in  history,  a  coordinated  program   fo r   improv ing  
the   transpor ta t ion   system  that  we   have  today,  and   mak ing   i t   a  better

NASA  Deputy  Associate  Administrator  for   Advanced  Research  and   Tech- 
nology  Alfred  Eggers,  speaking  to  the  Aviation  Space Writers  Associa- 
tion  in   Washington,  D.C.,  said  one  of  the  basic  programs  now  under-  
way  in   OART  was  t o   establish  a  mission  capability  flexible  enough  to 
satisfy most  mission  requirements  for   the  balance  of  the  century.  De- 
scr ib ing   the  capability  as  a  “platform”  tha t   could  support  whatever 
mission  the  Nation  wanted,  he  cited  the  present  indecision  over  the  
mission  tha t   should  be  undertaken  after  the  lunar   landing.  Given  the  
d ihcu l ty   of  ob ta in ing   a  consensus  from  the   American  public  and   gov- 
ernment  in   the  matter,  the  only  useful  aiternative  was  to  develop  such  
a  platform.  He  said  the  present  OART   program  would  enab le   th is  
country  to  go  to  Mars,  Venus,  the  asteroids,  o r   the  moons  of  Jup i ter  
(Tex t )  
before the end   of  the 20th  century. 
Je t   a ir l ine   pilots  would  no  longer  be  required  t o   wear  oxygen  masks 
when  flying  above 35,000 ft.  according  to  a FAA  rule  effective a s  of  th is  
date.  Under  the  new  rule,  the  requirement  for   one  pilot  a t   the  con-  
tro ls   to   use  oxygen  would  apply  now  only  above  41,000  ft.,  where  the 
time  element  would  be   much  more  critical  i n   case   of  sudden  de-

Evaluating  the  controversy  on   manned  versus  unmanned  exploration  of

“ I   see  no  meaningful  issue  between  (unmanned )   space  science  a n d  
(manned )   space  exploration.  The  rea l   question  is  what  so r t   of  space 
science contributes  best  to  the  success of  space  exploration.  More  con- 
cretely,  the  question  is   not  whether  t o   investigate  the   moon  with  an  
unmanned  Surveyor  shot  o r   a  manned  Apollo;  it’s  whether  an  ex tra  
Surveyor  mission  now  would  significantly  reduce  the   cost  or  danger   of 
the  eventual Apollo  mission  and ,   if  not,  whether  i t   may  be  wasteful  to 
send  a Surveyor now  when the same information  can  be had  more  easily

“The   Military  Implications of  Space”  were  discussed for   the  Gover-

“Our   military  efforts  in  space  can  be  placed  into  three  broad  cate- 
gories:  f irs t ,   the   development of  space systems t o  support m i l i tary   mis- 
sions  on  ea r th ;   second,  the  development  of  defensive measures  against 
possible  enemy  actions  in  space ;   and   th ird ,   the  conduct  of  experimen- 
tation  and  of  programs  aimed at pushing technology forward.  . . .” 
Schriever  noted  two  examples  of  unmanned   satellite  systems:  (1) 
the  Nuclear  Detection  P rog ram   consisting  of  s ix  Vela  satellites  gather- 
ing   information  on  rad ia t ion   backgrounds  in  f a r  space and  defining an 
operational  nuclear  detection  system;  and   ( 2 )   communications  satel- 
! i ta .   He  reven!ed  that  ~n i ~ i t i z !  I(%D  system  to   satisfy  military  com- 
munications’  requirements  had  been  authorized  by  DOD for  launch  ear-  
ly  next  year  and  would  include  up   to  23  satellites  orbiting  ear th   a t  
random   spacing  a t   about  21,000-mi.  altitude.  The   satellites  would  be 
launched  in   clusters  of  eight  from  three  Titan  I I IC   boosters  and   then 
would  be  positioned  along  an  orbital  path.  An  advanced  system  was 
also planned  in  which  expected  life of  each  satellite would  be  increased 
f rom  one and  a  half  years to  between three and  five years. 
I n   the  advancement of  space technology  he  listed  several  m a jo r   pro-  
grams : manned   orb i t ing   labora tory ,   space cabin  experiments, develop- 
ment  of  cryogenic  rocket  engines,  development  of  the  scramjet,  devel-

Dr.  Willard  Libby,  UCLA,  recommended  development  of  a  nuclear  space- 
sh ip   in  his  address   before  the  Aerospace  Instrumentation  Symposium 
in  Los  Angeles:  “The  only  possible  way  of  reaching  into  the   deep 
reaches  of  space  is  by  accelerating to  incredible  speeds,  speeds  tha t   go 
fa r   beyond  those  which  we  have  obtained  so  fa r   in  t h e  space  program ,  
and   i t   is  completely clear  tha t   the   only way  of  reaching  these  speeds  is  
by  using  atomic  energy.”  Libby  specifically  recommended  considera- 
tion  of  a  reactor  complex  capable  of  supplying  10,000 megawatts  of 
power  to  an  engine with  a  designed  thrus t   of  15,000-20,000  lbs.  Such 
a  spaceship  would  cost  billions  of  do l lars   a n d   be  a  decade  i n   the  
building,  but  “with  it  we  could  expect  literally  to  explore  the   So lar  
System,”  Libby  said.  He  noted  tha t   Pro jec t   Orion-the 
use  of  atomic 
explosions  to   propel  massive  space  platforms-might  be  useful  f o r   de- 
livering  fre igh t   tc   the  moon,  hut  the  shock  of  the  explosions  would 
pose  difficulties  fo r  manned  spaceflight.  H e  was  pleased  with  the   suc-  
cess  of  the  Rover-Phoebus  thermally-heated  atomic  engines  and   felt 
they  might  be  used  to  propel  ships  and   run   a  ferry   service  to   a  moon 
base. 
(T e x t )  
I n   a  press  conference,  Dr.  Libby  urged  a  program  to  put  more  
science  in to   space  exploration  because  “ the   dom inan t   factor  so  f a r   in  
the   manned  space  program  has  Seen  :hc  drive  $0 establish  good  engi- 
neering  technology.”  He  suggested:  ( 1 )   NASA  establish  a  six-man 
scientific  task  force  to   live  and  work  fo r   a  year  with  tra in ing   as tro-  
nau ts  ; ( 2 )   close cooperation  between  scientific  research  a t   ou ts tand ing

A  projection  of  the  U.S.  space  program   was  outlined  by   Dr.  Ed-

“1. After  we  have  made  initial  landings  on  the   moon,  we  will,  i f  
conditions warran t ,   make  many  o ther   t r ip s   to  explore the  var ious   par ts  
of  the luna r  surface  and  possibly to  establish one  or more bases there. 
“2.  Not  only  will  unmanned  probes  be  sen t   throughout  the  solar 
system,  but  manned  expeditions  will  visit  the   planets  whenever  tha t  
becomes scientifically  promising and  practicable.

“3.  We  will  develop  a  family  of  useful  manned  ear th-orb i t ing   sta- 
tions, growing  f rom   relatively  small  orb i t ing   laboratories  to   large   mul- 
ti-manned permanent  stations.  Regular  f e r ry  service  will  transfer   per-  
sonnel and  supplies to  and f rom  such spacecraft. 
“4.  Global  communications  via  satellites  will  become  a  f a c t   in   the  
very  near  fu ture   and, will  be  followed  by  direct  broadcast  of  bo th   voice 
and   TV  by   satellite  to   home  receivers  throughout  large   sections  of  th e  
world. 
“5.  Orb i t ing   spacecraft  will  increase  annually  in   numbers,  in   size, 
and   in  sophistication.  Through   such  activity  we  will  greatly  increase 
o u r  knowledge  about the ear th   as well  as abou t  the heavens. 
“ 6 .  We  can  expect  a  m a r r i ag e   of  the  m a jo r   features  of  both  aero-  
nautics  and   astronautics  .  . . lifting  bodies  and  winged  spacecraft 
with  maneuverable  reentry  ability  will  be  launched  into  n e a r   and   d is-  
tan t  
space  by  means  of 
recoverable  and  
re-usable 
launch 
vehicles.  Drastic  reduction  in  the  mileage  cost  of  space  travel  will 
result. 
“7.  Spaceports  fo r   the  coming  and   going  of  spacecraft  will  be  built 
i n  a  number of  parts  of  this coun try  as  well  as  elsewhere. 
“8 .   Improved  propulsion-faster,  more  powerful  rockets  using  nu- 
clear  as   well  as   chemical  energy-will 
characterize  space  transpor-  
tation.  P lane tary   tr ips   which  today  would  take  many  months  will  be 
done  in  perhaps   a  week‘s  time  o r   less,  while  carry ing   substantial  pay-

9.  As  competence  in  space  increases  . . . w e   can   expect  to   see

Subcommittee.  Ka r th   committee  summarized  the   most  ser ious   rea-  
sons  f o r   Surveyor’s  delay:  l )   the  fa i lure   to  do   adequa te   pre l im inary  
work ;   2 )   a  series  of  ma jo r   modifications;  3 )   inadequa te   staffing by  
J PL   i n   the  first  three   yea r s ;   4 )   too  rap id   expansion  of  personnel  at  a 
la ter   da te ;   5 )   poor  management  on   the   pa r t   of  Hughes ;   6 )   a  resist- 
ance  on   the   pa r t   of  Hughes  to  making  management  changes ;   7)   an 
improperly  conducted  testing  program   by  Hughes ;   8 )   management 
weaknesses  in   NASA;  and   9 )   a  lack  of  vigorous  centralized  con tro l   by  
NASA. 
To  describe  the  magn i tude   of  the   Surveyor  problems,  the   Congres- 
sional  investigators  highlighted  a  NASA  press  release  of  Janua ry   1961, 
which  outlined  Pro jec t   Surveyor  a s   costing  abou t   $50 million,  consist- 
i n g   of  seven  spacecraft,  each  weighing  2,500  lbs.,  capab le   of  placing 
over  200  Ibs.  of  scientific  payload  on  the  lunar   surface,  with  launches 
scheduled  du r ing   the   1963-66   time  period.  The  Subcommittee  then  
noted  tha t   the   first  launch  had   been  delayed  abou t   two  and   a  ha lf  
years,  payload  capability  had   been  reduced  to  only  a  TV camera   on  the  
first  four   spacecraft  and   only  114  lbs.  on  the  next  three   opera t iona l  
models, with  to ta l   costs  so  f a r  of  nearly  $350 million  fo r   the   spacecraft 
R&D  alone.  The   investigation  concluded  tha t   the   responsibility  f o r  
the  Surveyor  situation  could  be  found   in  the   inadequa te   prepara t ion  
f o r   the  project,  the   performance  of  JPL,  the  performance   of  Hughes 
Aircraft,  and   the  performance  of  NASA  Headquarters.  “A  ser ious  mis- 
take”  w a s   made  at  the  very  beginning  of  the   Surveyor  pro jec t   when 
insufficient  preliminary  work  was  done  to  identify  serious  technical 
problems,  judge   feasibility,  consider  alternatives,  and   more   accurately 
estimate costs.  The  investigation  concludvd  fu r the r   tha t   this  was  “the 
inevitable result of  a poorly defined project.”

lined  some  long-range  goals  of  Saturn/Apollo:  “By  1980,  i t   seems 
likely  there   will  be  a  vigorous  program   f o r  manned  exploration  of  the 
nea r   planets,  probably  based  on  a  new  generation  of  space  vehicles 
capable  of  flights  f o r  dura t ions  of  2  to  3 years  with  crews  consisting of 
6  to   8 men.  Although  by  1980  i t   is   not  likely  that  men  will  have 
landed  on  Mars,  i t   is  possible  tha t   a  Mars  flyby  o r   manned  orb i t ing  
mission will  be  imminent if  not  already  accomplished. 
On  the  moon  by  1980,  there  may  be  in   operation  one  o r   more  
C C  
multi-manned  research  observatories,  conducting  astronomical  a n d  
geophysical  operations  on  a  year-round   basis.  These  observatories 
may  also  be  home  base  for  mobile 
lunar  explorations,  using 
self-sufficient surface vehicles. 
“In   ea r th   o rb i t   by  1980  there  may  be  one  or  more  multi-manned, 
orb i t ing   space  stations,  functioning  as  research  laboratories  f o r   the  
advancement  of  human  knowledge  and   increase  of 
living  s tand-  
ards .   In  add i t ion   to  these  permanent  space  stations,  there   could 
be  a  var ie ty   of  smaller  ear th   orb i t ing   spacecraft,  operated  by  private 
indus try   o r   government  agencies  in  much  the  way  a i rc ra f t   operate 
today,  to  ca r ry   out  such  applications  as  long  term  weather  forecasting 
and   con tro l ;   surveys  of  water  resources,  crops,  forests  a n d   ocean  cu r -  
ren ts ;   continuous,  wide-band worldwide  communications;  a i r ,   sea  and  
space navigation,  and  traffic control. 
“These,  then  are   some  of  the  longer  range   objectives  of  the   1970’s 
and   1980’s  which  we  feel can  be  achieved  with  the   wide  base  of  space

Undiscovered  biological  rhythms  in   man   could  prevent  his  visiting 
o ther  planets,  reported  biologist  Eugene  Spangler,  TRW   Systems.  “The  
consequences of  the   removal  [of  man  from   ea r th ]   a re   in  many  respects 
unknown.  The  solution may  not  come except  by  means  of  g radua l   ac- 
cretions i n  the  total  time  tha t  man   spends i n   space together  with  carefu l  
mon i tor ing  of  his  reactions  as tha t  time  is  increased.  But  i t   seems nec- 
essary to   come to  fu r the r  gr ips  with  the  problem  insofar   a s  possible  be-  
fo re   prolonged  space  flight  is   attempted.  The   goals  must  b e   first  to  
define the problem  in  two  steps:  (1) what  specific corre la t ions  exist  be- 
tween  the  life  processes  of  man  and  the  var ia t ions   in   his  geophysical 
env ironmen t?   and   ( 2 )   what  a r e   the  results  of  subs tan t ia l   alteration  of 
tha t   environment  on  these  corre la t ions?”  
Spangler  noted  tha t   all  of  the   known  human   rhythmic  cycles  could 
be  in terrup ted   without  apparen t   harm,  yet  even  the  ad jus tmen t   to   a 
rap id   change  of  several  time  zones  af ter   a  je t   flight  could  involve 
unpleasant  recycling of  the body’s  “biological clock.”

Spacesuits  for  the  Apollo  mission,  which  would  involve  relatively

around   1970  bu t   would  not  be  available  fo r   manned  use  until 
1975.  Tischler  said  tha t   an   ion  propulsion  system  would  never  be 
applicable  for   deep  manned  space  flight  because  of  “its  abhorren t  
thrust-to-weight ra t io   . . . it  is  going  to  take  a  long  time  to   accelerate

Ion  propulsion  systems  would  be  suitable  for   unmanned  missions,

Evaluation  of  the   Soviet  space effort should  be  done  in  terms  of  Russian

Russian angle fo r  a   change may  provide  a   new  view  of  the  whole  space 
race.”  Hines  suggested  tha t   the  orb i ts   of  the  Molniya  satellites were 
egg-shaped because  with  12-hr .   periodicity  “the  Molniya-type  satellite 
stays  over  the  homeland  about  two-thirds  of  the  time  and   comes  back 
a t   exactly  the  same  time  each  day.”  He  sa id   tha t   the  U.S.S.R.  proba-  
bly  had  no  weather  satellites “because  i t   does  not  need  this  b ranch   of 
the  weatherman’s  art.”  A   possible  reason  tha t   there  were no  po lar-or-  
biting  Soviet photographic  reconnaissance  satellites like  the  U S ’ S   Sa-  
mos  was  tha t   they  were  not  needed.  N o  S a tu rn  V-type launch   vehicle

Gemini  6,  ca r ry ing   as tronau ts   Sch i r ra   and   Stafford,  is  now  being  re- 
moved  f r om   the   launching  pad.  We  have  examined  carefully  the 
question  of  whether  th is   booster  could  be  used  f o r   the  launch ing   of 
Gemini  7  in to   a  14-day  orb i t ,   and   our  studies  show  that  the   T i tan

suitable.  This  is   the  reason  fo r   the  change  f rom   the   booster  now  on 
the  pad  to the  one  especially designed fo r  the  Gemini 7 launch.

October  28:  Dr.  Edward  C.  Welsh,  Executive  Secretary  of  t h e   Na t iona l  
Aeronautics  and   Space  Council,  sa id   i n   an   address   to   the   American 
Ordnance  Association:  “.  . . In   the   case  of  the   most  recently  a n -  
nounced  space  pro jec t ,   the  Manned  Orb i t ing   Labora tory ,   we  aga in  
have   an   example  of  a  highly  valuable  exchange  of  technology  a n d  
experience  by   two  operating  agencies  of  the  Government. 
I n   th i s   in -  
stance,  NASA’s considerable  success  i n  manned  space  flight  and   i n   the  
development  of  spacecraft  will  assist  the  A i r   Force   substantially  i n  
carry ing   ou t   the  Manned  Orb i t ing   Labora tory   project.  Such  in tera-  
gency  cooperation  will  tend  to  improve  ra the r   than   impa i r   the   peaceful 
image which this coun try  ha s  established. 
“Since  I  have  mentioned  the   Manned  O rb i t ing   Labora tory ,   it  is 
worth  pausing  r igh t   now  to   challenge  for thr igh t ly   those   who  have   as-  
serted  o r   intimated  tha t   i t   has  something  to  do   with  a  weapons 
race.  We  expect  misinterpretations  of  tha t   so r t   to  come  from   un-  
friendly  countries and  sometimes from  ignoran t   domestic critics.  How- 
ever,  I  w a s   disappointed  to  find  tha t   a  few  otherwise  well  informed  
publications  and   invididuals  have  asserted  tha t   the   M O L  is  a  weapons 
ca r r ie r  and  a project con trary  to ou r  peaceful progress  i n  space. 
“I  assert  as  positively  a s   I  can   tha t   the   MOL   is  not  a  weapons 
system,  is  no t   a  means  by  which  aggressive  actions  can   be  perpe tra ted ,  
and   is  in  rw  way  i n   conflict  with  the   established  peaceful  policies, 
objectives,  o r  methods  of  the   United  States.  Rather,  i t   is  a  p rog ram  
tha t   will  increase  ou r   knowledge of  man’s  usefulness  i n   space   and   will 
relate tha t  ability to  ou r  national defense.”

“One  of  the  most  impor tan t   purposes  served  by  the  crea t ion   of  tech- 
nologies  is  to  provide  options  in   the  selection  of  new  requirements  or 
missions.  The  existence  of  several  technical  options  is  fundamen ta l  to 
sound  planning.  Because of  the many  impor tan t   implications  of  space 
activities,  policy  planners  will  requ ire   tha t   they  be   given  options. 
I t  
therefore  seems  desirable  tha t   the  development  of  a  new  branch   of 
technology  be  directed  toward  a  related  class  of  requirements  or  mis- 
sions  ra ther   than  a  single  requirement.  . . .”

November   4 :  The   impact  of  a  meteorite  might  have  begun  life  on   ea r th ,  
Dr.  Br ian   Mason,  U S .   National  Museum,  told  the   annua l   meeting  of 
the   Geochemical  Society  of  America  in   Kansas  City.  Scientists  had  
speculated  tha t   the   presence  of  organ ic   compounds-substances 
con- 
ta in ing   carbon   and   nitrogen-in  meteorites  indicated  tha t   life  exists, 
o r  had   once  existed,  elsewhere in  the  universe.  Mason  noted  tha t   such 
compounds could be made without  life,  bu t   added :   “I  believe  . . . they 
may  be  a  forerunner   of  life.  A  falling  meteorite  may  be   the   way  life 
got  started.”  Mason  sa id   tha t   most  meteorites  appeared  to  come  f rom  
the   asteroid  belt  which  orb i ts   the  sun   between  Ma r s   and   Jup i ter .  
This  belt  might  be  a  planet  that  never  collected  to   become  a  single 
body,  he   suggested.  Dr.  Mason  was  conducting  research  on  the  
chemical  d ifferences  a  man-ear th  environment  had   imposed  on  meteor-

Five  luna r   and   Mar t ian   experts  applied  geological  methods  to  in ter-

Symposium  in   Kansas  City.  They  found   similarities  between  Mars  
and   the   moon:  both  bodies  were  subjected  to  slow  erosion  from  
showers  of  micrometeoroids  from   space;  there  was  no   evidence of  sur- 
face  water  on  either.  Dr.  Robert  P.  Sharp ,  Caltech,  said  tha t   Mar t ian  
cra ters  were  three-and-one-half times more  numerous  than  o n  the   luna r

being  eroded .   A  nuclear  explosion  in  Nevada,  fo r   example,  created 
a  meteorcrater-like  hole,  resulting  i n   hund red s   of  secondary  impact 
craters.  “I  th ink   the   surface  is  a  fluffy  material,  about  one   meter 
LIIICK,  resting  on  the   iioor  of  smaii  craters,”  he   sa id .   “The   bulk  ef

matter  is  moved  by  the  impact  of  small  micrometeoroids.  Probab ly  
a  good  deal  of  the  ma ter ia l   is  melted  and   the   melt  may  fly  off  in to

believed had   been  formed by meteoric  impact, presumably on  the  moon, 
and  had   splashed  off  to   fa l l   on  earth.  Haro ld   Masursky, US. Geolo-

November  1 2 :   Th e   vast  accumulation of  knowledge  generated  by   the   space 
program   required  a  “new  wave”  of  science  reporters  to  challenge  and

Julian  Scheer, NASA  Aesistant Administrator  fo r   Pub l ic  Affairs,  told  the  
Sigma  Delta  Chi  National  Convention  in   Los  Angeles.  He   referred 
to  a  need  to  look  “beyond  the  obvious  and   the   glamorous  to   what  is 
happening  in  space  and  science and  what  impact  th i s  will  have   socially, 
diplomatically,  politically  and   economically.”

Mars   missions  of  under  1 0 0   flights  per  year.  Only  frequent  flights 
would  increase  the  need  fo r   higher  specific  impulse  and  would  jus t ify  
the  expense, he said. 
Meanwhile,  he   predicted,  chemical  rockets  of  less  than  500  sec.  spe-

Dr.  Hugh  L.  Dryden,  NASA  Deputy  Adm in is tra tor   since  1958,  died 
of  cancer  a t   age  67.  He   was  a  former   Director  of  the   Na t iona l

or- 
the   National  Bureau  of  Standards,  and-for 
forty-five  years-an 
dained minister  in the  Methodist Church. 
An  internationally  renowned  scientist-engineer who  once  sa id   he   and  
the   a irp lane  grew  u p   together,  he   was  recognized  fo r   his  leadersh ip   in  
the   development  of  aeronautics  and   astronautics.  He  generally  was 
regarded  a s   the   man   who  guided  the  United  States  in to   the   space 
age.  Dr.  Dryden  served  the   U S .   Government  with  distinction  since 
1918 in   science and   technology,  as  an   adm in is tra tor ,   a n d  more   recent- 
ly  as  a  skilled  diplomat  in   negotiating  in terna t iona l   agreements  fo r  
cooperative efforts  i n   the  peaceful  exploration  of  space.  The   recipient 
of  many  awards   and   honors ,   Dr.  Dryden  was  especially  known  f o r  his 
scientific  con tr ibu t ions  to  fluid  mechanics  and   bounda ry laye r   phenom-

At  Johnson  City,  Tex.,  President  Johnson   said  tha t   the   dea th   of  Dr. 
Dryden  “is  a  deep  personal

From   Great  Falls,  Mont.,  Vice  Pres iden t   Humphrey,  Cha irman   of

Hugh  Dryden,  whose  vision,  courage,  and   lifetime  of  service  have  
NASA  Administrator  James  E. Webb  sa id :   “Dr .   Hugh  L.  Dryden  was

with  all  the   implications  of  modern  science  and  technology  f o r   the  
accomplishments of  his  time.  He  was  also  a man   for all  times  because 
his  courage  in  undertaking  the  conquest  of  a i r  and  space, his  scientific, 
engineering,  and   administrative  competence  and   h i s   qualities  of  hu-

On  Dec.  6,  Lovell  removed  h is   16-lb. spacesuit,  becoming  first  U.S.

On  Dec.  7,  Borman  fired  thrus ter   rockets  to   achieve  a  h igher   o rb i t

(233.8 km.) . 
On  Dec.  8,  clouds  over  New  Mexico  caused  as tronau ts   to  cancel 
scheduled experiment to  communicate with ground  by laser  beam.

On  Dec.  10 ,   when  temperatures  in   GEM IN I   VII’S  cab in   rose   to   85”’ 
Flight  Director  Christopher  K ra f t   ordered   Lovell to   p u t   on  h i s   space-

tha t  Lovell apply antihistamine ointment to ease nasal dryness. 
O n   Dec.  11, laser  experiment  was  conducted  with  pa r t ia l   success: 
the  Hawaiian  ground  station  received  signals  from   the   spacecraf t  when 
Lovell  locked  h is   hand-held  laser  onto  the   ground-based  one,  bu t   con-

On  Dec.  12,  the   as tronau ts   tried  aga in   to  establish  g round   laser 
communications  over  White  Sands   Missile  Range,  bu t   were  ab le   t o  
pick up  only two quick flashes from  the ground  beacon. 
O n   Dec.  13,  when  GEMINI   VII’S  fuel  cell  warn ing   l igh t   flashed  on, 
the  as tronau ts  flushed excess water  from   the  system  by  forc ing   in   add i-  
t iona l   oxygen  borrowed  from   the   cabin’s  oxygen  supply,  thereby   cor-

l in   by   New  Y o r k  T imes   associate editor  Jame s  Reston  if  expenditures 
f o r   space  exploration  were  questioned  by  Soviet  government 
officials.  He  rep l ied :-“I   would  say  tha t   man  will  always go  on  seeking 
a  solution  to   the  problems  of  the  universe.  The re   w i l l   always  be 
funds   tha t   will  be  set  aside  to  resolve  the  problems  relating  to   the 
if 
th is   is  a l l   to   the  good, 
scientific.  . .  .  We. don’t  have  any  contradiction  in  the  Soviet  Union 
world  and   the  universe; 
it’s  purely 
between  appropr ia t ions   for   space  research  and   fo r   the  needs  of  the 
population.  The   funds  appropriated  a r e   relatively  small  compared 
with  the   fun d s  serving  the  needs  of  the  population  on  education  and  
such.  They  a r e   negligible  on  the  over-all  expenditure.  Space  ex- 
penses do not de trac t  f rom  the needs of  the population.” 
Asked  i f   the  U.S.S.R.  wanted  to   go  fo rwa rd   with  peaceful  space 
arrangements,  Kosygin  sa id :   “We  have  expressed  ou r   view  on 
this.  We  a r e   in  favor  of  peaceful,  not  military,  uses  of  ou ter  
space.  Now,  to  insure  tha t   peaceful  research  in  space  does  not  place 
too  much   of  a   burden  on  us,  states might  reduce military  expenditures 
and  channel the funds in to  peaceful space explorations.” 
Reston  queried:  “You  have  made  grea t   progress  in  space  with  the 
use  of  the  most  sophisticated  and  complicated  computers  and   other 
modern   science, yet  your  speech  on  Sept.  27  was  highly  cr i t ica l   of  the  
lag  in  the  use  of  modern   science  in   Soviet  industry.  Wh y   th is   d is-  
crepancy ? ”   Kosygin  replied : “I  don’t  understand  you r   distinction 
between  space  and   economic  and   indus tr ia l   development.  We  judge 
include  all  spheres.  It  i s   true   that  not

d i t ion   was  to  measure  and   study  the   s truc ture ,   composition,  and   tem- 
pera ture   of  the  chromosphere  and  corona   of  the   sun.  New  informa-  
t ion   was  gathered  on  the   atomic  process  in   the  chromosphere  and  
corona,  including  rad ia t ion   and   collision  phenomena;  findings  were 
made   on   electron  densities  and   dust  concentration.  Presence  of  a 
number   of  spectral  lines  was  discovered,  and   others  tha t   had   been 
previously  suspected  were  confirmed.  The   advantages  of  an   a i rbo rne

observed  ou t   as  f a r   a s   12   so lar   rad i i ,   whereas  ground   observations

D u r i n g   1965:  In   1965, N A S A   attempted  28 missions  with  23 successes,  a 
score  of  82%  mission  success.  Two  spacecraft  were  launched  on  a 
single booster.  NASA   attempted  30 launches  of  space boosters  and   had  
26 successes, a score of  87%  launch vehicle success. 
Of  the  92 payloads  orbited  by  the   U S . ,   NASA   orb i ted   25-five 
of 
which  were  two-manned  spacecraft  and   fou r   were  escape-mission 
probes.  U.S.S.R.  orb i ted   64 payloads:  of  which  one  was  a  manned 
spacecraft  and  seven  were  escape-mission  probes.  France   entered  the  
space  age  with  two  satellites.  one  orb i ted   by  France   herself  ( A - I )   and  
one by  the  U S .   ( FR - I   1 .

followed by  four   two-man orb i ta l   flights  which  logged  more   than   1,300 
manhours   in  space.  G EM I N I   v   and   VII, 
long-dura t ion   missions  (8  
and   14 days   respectively)  proved  man  can  withstand  extended  cond i-

flights.  At  the   year’s  end  Gemini  spaceflights  had   set  fo r   the  U S .  
more   than  10 records,  among  them  the  record  fo r   total  manhours   in 
space:  1,354 hrs., 38 min., vs. U.S.S.R.’s  507 hrs.,  16 min. 
1965 was  a  year  of  extensive  ground   tests  of  the  Apollo  spacecraft 
and  the  Sa turn   launch  vehicles.  There   were  s ta t ic   firings  of  engines

magnetic  field,  according  to  scientific  experiments  by  MAR INER   IV  Mars  
probe.  Because  of  this,  Mar t ian   life-forms  would  have  to   be  able  to  
withstand  intense  rad ia t ion ,   but  possibility  of  Mar t ian   life was  not  ruled 
out.  MAR INER   IV   also  reported  Mars’  atmosphere  was  too   th in   to

Comet  Ikeya-Seki, the  brightest  comet  to  en ter   the  so lar   system  th is  
century,  was  discovered  Sept.  18  and   subsequently  studied  from   the  
ground ,   airplanes,  and   rockets.  The  comet  passed  within  300,000  m i .  
of  the   sun  and   made  a  ha i rp in   turn   Oct.  21,  when  i t   broke   in to   three

I n   terms  of  numbers,  ambitiousness,  and  complexity,  the  world  space 
effort  continued  to   gain  momentum.  A  total  of  160 payloads  was  success- 
fully  orbited  in  a  total  of  102  launches.  Thus  more   than   one  th i rd   of  the 
payloads  was  in   multiple-payload launches.  The  U S .   program  was  up   to 
9 4   payloads  in   61 launches  in   1965  from   76  payloads  in  60   launches  i n

took  the   absolute  lead  i n   manned  spaceflight,  with  five  2-manned  Gemini 
flights  to   the  one   Soviet  2-manned  flight.  But  the   Soviets more  than   dou-

As  we  have   cautioned  i n   previous  years,  the   “Remarks”  column  of  these 
appendixes  is  never  complete  because  of  the   inescapable  lag  behind  each 
flight of  the  analysis  and   in terpre ta t ion   of  scientific  results.

CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR  NASA  LAUNCHINGS 

JANUARY 1 , 1 9 6 5 ,  THROUGH DECEMBER  3 1 , 1 9 6 5  

This chronology  of  ma jor   NASA  launchings  i n   1965 is  intended  to  prov ide  
an   accurate  a n d   ready  h is tor ica l   reference,  one  compiling  a n d   verifying 
informa t ion   previously  scattered  over  several  sources. 
I t   includes  launch-  
ings   of  all  rocket  vehicles la rge r   than   sounding  rockets  launched  e i ther   by 
NASA  o r   under   “NASA   direction”  (e.g.,  NASA  provided  vehicle,  launch   facili- 
FR-1 ) . 
ties,  track ing   facilities,  and   performed  the  launch  fo r   the   French  satellite, 
An  attempt h a s  been made  t o  classify  the  performance  nf  E n t h  the  launch  
vehicle  and   the  payload  and   to   summarize  to ta l   results  in   terms  of  p r ima ry  
mission.  Three   categories  have  been  used  fo r   vehicle  performance  a n d  
(S )  , par t ia l ly   successful  (P )  , and  unsuccessful 
mission  results-successful 
( U )  .  A  fou r th   category,  unknown  (U n k )  , ha s   been  provided  f o r  pay loads  
where  vehicle malfunctions d id   not  give the  payload  a  chance to   exercise i ts  
ma in   experiments.  These  divisions  a re   necessarily  arb i trary ,   since  many  
of  the   results  canno t   be  neatiy  categorized.  Also  they  igiioie  the   fac t   &at 
a grea t   deal  was  learned  from   shots tha t   may  have  been  classified  as unsuc- 
cessful. 
A  few  unique  items  requ ire   separa te   treatment.  The i r   dates  have   been 
kept  i n  sequence  bu t   their  history  ha s   been  relegated  to   footnotes.  Date  of 
launch  is  referenced  to  local  time  a t   the  launch  site. 
Sources used  were  all open  ones, verified  where  i n  doub t  from  the  pro jec t  
offices in  NASA  Hq.  a n d  f rom  the  NASA  Centers.  F o r   further  informa t ion   on  
each  item,  see Appendix A  of  th is   volume  a n d   the  en tr ies   i n   the  main  chro-  
nology  a s   referenced  in  the  index.  Prepared   January   1966  b y   Dr.  F rank

Appendix C 
CHRONOLOGY  OF  MANNED  SPACE  FLIGHT  1 9 6 1 - 1 9 6 5  

Th i s   chronology  contains  basic  information  on  manned  spaceflights  by  
the   United  States  and   the  Soviet  Union  through   1965.  The  informa t ion  
was  compiled  by  William  D.  Pu tnam ,   Assistant  NASA Historian  f o r   Manned 
Space  Flight.  T h e   scope  and   pace  of  the   manned  spaceflight  effort  ha s  
increased  to  the   extent  tha t   a  table  devoted  exclusively  to  manned  flights 
seems a  useful reference tool. 
By  the   end   of  1965,  the   United  States  had   conducted  11  manned 
total  of  13  different 
spaceflights,  nine  of 
these  orb i ta l ,   with  a 
crewmen.  Three   of  the  13 American  as tronau ts   h a d   participated  i n   two 
flights.  The  Soviet  Union  had   conducted  eight  manned  flights,  all  orb i ta l ,  
with  11 different  crewZen.  N o  Soviet  cosmonaut  had   yet  experienced  two 
space   flights.  Cumulative  totals  fo r   manned  spacecraft  hours  i n   flight  had  
reached  704  hours ,   4  minutes  for   the  United  States  a n d   431  hours ,   53 
minutes  for  the  Soviet  Union.  Cumulative  total  manhours   in  space  were 
1,354  hours,  14 minutes,  and   506  hours,  29   minutes,  respectively.  The 
American  lead  in   this  area   came  from   two-man  Gemini  flights;  these  in -  
creased  in   length  from   almost  five  hours  in   March  1965 to  over  330  hou r s  
f o r  the two-week mission of  GEM iN i  vii  in BecemScr. 
Data  on  United  States  flights  a re   the  latest  available  to  da te   within 
NASA.  Soviet  da ta   a re   unofficial  and   derived  from  open  sources,  relying 
heavily  on  the   excellent work  done   on  this  sub jec t   by  D r .   Charles  S.  Shel- 
don   11,  professional  staff  member  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and   Space 
Council.  Details  a re   always  subject  to  revision  a s   information  is  refined, 
bu t   the   ma jo r   aspects  of  United  States  flights  have  been  subject  to  direct 
observation  by  the   interested  citizens  of  the  world  and  scientific  findings 
have   been  presented  to   professional  audiences  a t   symposia  a n d   i n   the  
professional literature. 
Since  specific  astronaut-cosmonaut  ranks   a n d   titles  a r e  subject  to  change 
over  time,  they  a r e   omitted  from   the  chronology  in   the  interest  of 
simplicity.  All  crew  members  listed,  except  Feoktistov  and  Yegorov  of 
VOSKHOD  I,  held  m i l i tary   rank.  Weight  given  is  the  weight  of  the  total 
spacecraft  a s   placed  in  orb i t .   Maximum  altitude  is  chosen  f rom   many  
possible  measurements  because  i t   represents  a  world  record  category  as 
recognized by  the F h d k a t i o n  ACronautique Internationale.
