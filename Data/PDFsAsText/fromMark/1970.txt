Foreword 

This  volume  provides  an   immediate  reference   t o   aerospace-related 
even ts  of  1970, enabling  all  of  u s   t o  broaden  or   to refresh   our   crowded 
memories. As pa r t  of  NASA%  chronology series  it is intended  t o  help his- 
torians  and   o ther   ana lys ts   in  preserving  historical  accuracy   and  preci- 
sian. 
Perhaps  the  Apo l lo   13 problems  tha t  resulted  in using  the  lunar  lander 
Aquarius as  a  “lifeboat”  will  be   th e  most  readily  recalled  of  the   1970 
even ts .   Ye t ,   as   this  volume  clearly  indicates,  there  were  many  signifi- 
can t  milestones in  space and aeronau t ics .  The  lunar samples returned  by 
Apollo  I 2  and   12 were  intensively  studied  in  the  United  S ta te s  and   16 
o ther  coun tr ies ;  the   last two  Apollo missions  scheduled were  cance led ;  
the  feasibility of  reusable space  shuttles  a s  a means of  reducing the  co s t  
and  expanding  the   versatility  of  space   opera t ions   was  examined  in 
greater  detail;  th e  Skylab  program  t o  eva lua te   man’s  adap ta t ion   t o   t h e  
space  env ironmen t  proceeded  toward  i ts  launchings in early  1973. Divi- 
dends  continued  to  be   returned  from  our   scientific  satellites already  in 
orbit: Pioneer VIcompleted  s ix  orb i ts  of  the  sun ,  providing da ta  on  solar 
weather on   the  fa r  side of  the   sun ;  Oao I Ib eg an   transmitting ultraviolet 
spectral da ta  on   some 25 000 s ta r s ;  Ogo III, IV ,   V,  and  VImade  sky  sur- 
veys   which  could  corre la te   geophysical  d a t a   from  o ther   sa te l l i tes ,  
sounding  rocke t s ,   and  ground-based  instruments.  Among  the   38  new 
payloads launched by  the  United  S ta tes  were the  first pro to type   satellite 
for  an operational weather  sys tem ,   ITOS,  and three  In te lsa t  communica- 
tions satellites.  Japan  and  Ch ina  bo th   launched  their first  satellites dur-  
ing  1970. In  aeronau t ics ,  research   and  deve lopmen t  on  t h e  supercr i t ica l  
wing  culminated  in  the  first  flight  tes ts .   And  the   X-24  “lifting  body”  
made  its first  flight  early  in  the   year  and moved  in to  superson ic  flight  in 
October. 
O ther  kinds  of  even ts   a re  a lso   included  in  this  chronology.  Dr.  Cyril 
A.  Ponnamperuma  of  th e  Ames Research  Cen ter  repor ted  t h e  first posi- 
tive identification  of  amino acids of  ex tra terres tr ia l  origins, found  in the  
meteorite tha t  fell near Murch ison ,  Australia, in  1969. Numerous  en tr ies  
evidence  increasing  international  cooperation  in  and  mutual  benefits 
from space  activities. 
Th e  overall  space  program  was  being evaluated  dur ing  all of  1970-at 
perhaps  the   very  peak  of  ou r   technological  and  scientific ach ievemen ts  
in exp lora t ion ,  in basic science,  and  in application t o  earth-bound  needs. 
Ques t ions  of  the  bas iceva lue  of  and  the  need  fo r  space  activities in  rela- 
tion  to needs   fo r  solutions of  problems on ea r th  were  being explored  in 
all  sec to r s  of  ou r  national  life. T h e  space  fron t ier  h a s  been   crossed  and  
m e n ,   their  though ts   and  the ir   machines,  are   no   longer  bound  t o   ou r  
home planet  Ear th .   The  accessibility of  space  will  have  a place  in  man’s 
life and  thinking fo r  all  his  fu tu re .  Even  against  a backdrop  of  t h e  broad 
range  of  earth-bound  problems-poverty, 
pollution,  world  peace ,   and  

iii 

disruptive  changes  besetting  most  social 
institutions-man’s 
new 
perspective  on  his  place  in   a  dynamic universe  is  a basic challenge. We 
appear  to  have  been  in  an escalating  scientific  and  technological  revolu- 
tion  during  the   20th  cen tu ry ,   its  intellectual  stimulus  and  cons truc t ive  
values perhaps  best  symbolized by  the intense  space  venture  of  the  past 
decade .  
The  space  program a s  a human en terpr ise ,  gaining new  knowledge and 
skills  and   applying  them  to   practical  purpose ,   seems   a  symbol  much 
needed  in  a world  bese t   by   doub ts   and   fears   and   frus tra t ions   and  with 
many difficult problems ye t  t o  solve.

Preface 

As  with  its  seven   annual  ances tors   and  several  precursors ,   this  vol- 
ume  is  intended  to   be  a s   comp le te  and   accura te   a  chronicle  of  known 
even ts  and commen tary  in  1970 as could be  documen ted  by  immediately 
cal  and  astronautical  da ta   o Y  in teres t   to   fu ture   historians.  Bu t   it  also 
it  provides  a  running  s ta r t  on  aeronauti- 
available  sources .   Essential1 
serves a s  a general reference  f o r  those  interested  in  science, technology, 
and policy aspec ts  of  aerospace  affairs during  1970. 
For  the  first time, this Astronautics a n d  Aeronautics chronology gives 
In this volume they  are  retained  in  paren t  a eses  following S I  units.  NASA  
all  measuremen ts   in  the  metric  system  according  to   th e   International 
System of Units (SI). Here tofore ,   the   En  iish system  o f   units was  used. 
Policy  Directive  2220.4  of  Sep tember   14,  1970, required  convers ion   to  
the  International  System  of  Un i ts ,   previously  used  in  GSFC’S  Satellite 
Situation  Repor t   and  most  European   publications.  NA SA   was  the   first 
Federal agency to adop t  this policy. 
General editor of  this  volume was  the   Deputy NASA  H is tor ian ,   F rank  
W.  Anderson ,   J r . ,   and  th e   technical  editor  was  Mrs .   Carrie  E .   Kare-  
geannes.  The  entire  NA SA  Historical Office  participated  in  source  selec- 
t ion ,  review,  and  publication.  Archivist  Lee  D .   Saegesser  collects  cur-  
ren t   documentation.  The   Sc ience   and  Technology  Division  of  t h e   Li- 
brary  of  Congress ,   under  an   exchange  of  funds   agreemen t ,   draf ts  
monthly  segments  in  commen t   edition  form ,   which  are  circulated  fo r  
correc t ions  a n d  use.  At  the Library  Mrs.  Patricia  D.  Davis, Mrs.  Carmen 
B. Brock-Smith, and Mrs .  Shirley M.  Singleton carry principal  respodsi- 
bility.  At  the   end   of  the  year ,   the   entire  manuscript  is  reworked  to   in- 
clude commen ts   received  and  recen t   additional  information.  Arthur  G .  
Renstrom  of  the   Library  of  Congress  prepared  the   ex tens ive   index ,  
which  is  indispensable  to  the   usefulness  of  a  chronology.  Th e   index 
serves  also  a s   a  glossary  of  abbreviations  and  acronyms   used  in  the  
chronology. 
Appendix  A ,   “Satellites,  Space  P robe s ,   and  Manned  Space   Flights, 
1970,” Appendix B ,  “Chronology  of  Major NASA   Launches ,   1970,” and 
Appendix  C ,   “Chronology  of  Manned  Space  Flight,  1970,”  were  pre- 
pared by  Leonard  C .  Bruno of  t h e  Library  staff. Appendix D ,  “Abbrevi- 
ations of  References ,”   was prepared  by  Mrs. Brock-Smith. 
Without  the   validation  throughou t   NASA   and  o ther   Federa l   agencies, 
the  con ten t   of  this  volume  would  b e   less  reliable  and  less  nearly  com-

January  I :  Apo l lo   1 1  lunar  landing had been  voted  biggest news  s tory  of 
1969 in poll  of  Associated Press  member newspapers   and  radio and 
TV  s ta t ions ,   AP  announced .   As tronau t  Neil  A.  Armstrong,  Apo l lo  
t I   commander ,   had  been  voted  top  newsmaker  of  year.  AP  poll 
ranked  Vietnam  war  second  biggest  s tory   and  “s tory   of  Sen .   Ed-

0  President  Nixon  in  San  C lemen te ,   Ca l if . ,   signed  National  Environ- 
mental  Policy  Act  of  1969.  Act  declared  Governmen t   policy  “ to  
crea te  and  maintain  conditions under  which  man  and nature can  ex- 
ist in  productive  harmony and  fulfill  the  social, econom ic ,  and o ther  
requirements  of  presen t   and  fu tu re   generations  of  Americans.”  I t  
established  within  Presidential  Execu t ive   Office  full-time,  three-  
member  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  and  required  Pres iden t  
to  submit  environmental  quality  repor ts   to  Congress  annua l ly ,  be- 
ginning July  l ,  1970. Pres iden t  said  tha t   “ the   1970’s absolutely must 
be  the   years  when  America  pays  its  deb t   to   the   past  by  reclaiming 
the  purity of  its air,  its wa te r s ,  and our living env ironmen t .  I t  is liter- 
ally now  or  never .”   ( P D ,  1/5/70, 11-3) 
0  Dr .   Charles  H .   Townes ,   Nobel  Prize  winning  Univ.  of  California 
physicist  and  member  of  NAS   Council,  was  appointed  Chairman  of 
NAS -NRC  Space   Science  Board.  Dr .  Townes  had  headed  President 
Nixon’s  task   force   to   make  recommendations  on   national  space  
program  in  1969. (NASP IO ;  NAS-NRC-NAE   News Rpt, 3/70; A& A 3 8 )  
January  2:  Nike-Apache  sounding  rocke t   was  launched  by  NASA   from

s trumen ts  functioned  satisfactorily.  (SR list) 
*  ApoJJo  10  and  I 1  photos  of  lunar  fa r   side  had  revealed  number  of 
probable  igneous  in trus ions ,   including  three  probable  dikes  tha t  
crosscu t  wall  and   floor of  75-km  (46.6-mi) c ra te r ,   Farouk  El-Baz of 
Bellcomm,  Inc . ,   reported  in  Science. In trus ions  were  distinguished 
by  their  se t t ings ,  tex tures ,   s t ruc tu re s ,  and  brightness.  Recognition 
of  probable  igneous  intrusions  in  lunar  highlands  supported  indica- 
tions of  heterogeneity  of  lunar materials and plausibility  of  intrusive 
igneous activity  on  moon,  in  addition  to   ex trus ive  volcanism.  (Sci-

0  With  adven t  of  SST, information on meteorological  conditions a t  high- 
er   levels  of  s tra tosphere  would  be  needed  for   routine civil-aviation 
operations,  Frederick  G .  Finger  and  Raymond  M .   McInturff  of 
ESSA’S  Weather  Bureau  said  in  Science.  Forecas t   system  would  be  
extended from  12-km (7.5-mi) to 20-km (12.4-mi) altitudes or higher. 
Forecasting  techniques  t o   suppor t   SST  might  be   facilitated  by  ex- 
ploiting  similarities  be tween   stratosphere  and  troposphere  wea ther .  
Much  remained  to   be   done   o n   phenomenon  forecasting.  Wind  ef- 
fec ts   should  be   smaller  for   SST  than  for   subsonic  aircraft  but  wind 
forecas ts  might  be  necessary  during  winter,  when  variations  were 
high  enough  to  effect  economics of  operation.  Knowledge  of  tem- 
perature  fields  and of  ozone   distribution  could  prove valuable. Pos- 
sible solar cosmic radiation  hazards would  be minimized  by ground- 
based  forecasting system  and onboard  detection equipment bu t  son -  
ic boom  problem  a t  ground  level might be  less tractable.  Amplifica- 
tion  and attenuation  of  boom  by  meteorological  conditions could  be 
predicted.  World  Weather  Watch  of  U .N .   and  ESSA’S   satellites  and 
spacecraf t  with  ability  t o  depict  continuous  three-dimensional tem- 
perature distribution  and wind  pressure  over entire globe would  play 
major  role  in  providing  SST  meteorological  information,  a s   would

The  mysteries  of  space  were  nothing.  . .compared  with  the   menac-

Apo l lo   1 1  and  12  were  “ a   quintessential  adven ture   of  American

January  5-9: Apollo  I 1  Lunar   Sc ience  Con fe rence  a t   MSC presented  re- 
su l ts  of  first  sys tema t ic   s tud ies  of  lunar  samples  by  more  than  500 
scientists from nine  coun tr ies .   Samples from Tranquility Base  con-  
sisted  of  basaltic  igneous  rocks ;   microbreccias,  which  were  me- 
chanical  mixture  of  soil  and  small  rock  fragments  compacted  into 
coheren t   rock ;   and  lunar  soil.  Soil  was  mixture  of  crystalline  and 
glassy  fragments  with  small  fragmen ts   of  iron  meteoroids.  Most 
rock  fragmen ts  derived  from  larger  igneous  rocks-probably  once 
part  of  underlying  bedrock .   Some  crystalline fragmen ts  might have 
come from  Highlands  near Tranquility site.  Rocks and  fragmen ts  in 
soil showed evidence of  surface  erosion from hypervelocity impacts 
accompanied  by  local  melting,  splashing, evapora t ion ,  and  conden-  
sa t ion .  Crystalline rocks   ranged  from  fine-grained  vesicular  to  vug- 
gy ,  medium-grained equigranular. 
Most common  minerals found  were  pyroxene ,   plagioclase, ilmen- 
i te ,   olivine,  and  cr is toba l i te .   Three   new  minerals  occurring  in  ig- 
neous  rocks   were  pyroxmangan i te ,   ferropseudobrook i te ,   and chro-  
mium-titanium  spinel.  Free  metallic  iron  and  troilite,  rare   on  e a r t h ,  
were common  accessory   minerals  in  igneous  rocks .   Silicate miner- 
als were  unusually  transparen t   because   of  complete  absence   of  hy- 
drothermal  a l tera t ion .  Te s t s   had  shown  tha t ,   a t   time  of  crystalliza- 
t ion ,  observed  phases   could  have   coexisted  only  in  very  d ry ,  highly 
reducing system  in which oxygen pressure  was estimated to  be   10-13 
atmospheres-more 
than   five  orders   of  magnitude  lower  than  for  
typical  terrestrial basaltic magmas. 
Melting  exper imen ts   indicated  98%  of  primary  igneous  liquid 
crystallized  in  1483-1333  K  (1210-1060°C) tempera ture   range  with 
minor  interstitial  liquids  continuing  to   crys ta l l ize  down   to   1223  K 
(95OOC).  Microscopic  and  microprobe  exam ina t ions   had  produced 
evidence  for   ex is tence   of  interstitial  liquid  rich  in  potassium  and 
aluminum, which probably was immiscible with main  liquid.  Viscos- 
ity of  lunar magmas was calculated ano rd e r  of  magnitude below tha t  
of  terres tr ia l  basaltic  magmas.  Th is   charac ter is t ic   might  be  signifi- 
can t  in  explaining  tex tura l   fea tu re s ,  differentiation mechanisms  tha t  
produced  chemical compos i t ion ,   and  morphological  fea tu re s  of  lu-  
nar seas .  
Chemical compos i t ions   of  all  igneous  rock s   were  similar  excep t  
for   concen tra t ion   of  potassium,  rubidium,  cesium,  uranium,  tho- 
rium,  and  barium.  These   elements  distinguished  two  groups  of  ig- 
neous   rocks ,   with  fine-grained  rocks   containing more  than  coarse-  
grained  rocks.  All  rocks   had  high  concen tra t ions  of  titanium,  scan-  
d ium ,   zirconium,  hafnium,  yttrium,  and  trivalent  rare   ear th   ele- 
men ts ,   and  low  concen tra t ions  of  sodium.  Low  abundance  of  euro- 
pium  was  striking  fea tu re   of  igneous  rocks .   Composition  of  soils 
and  breccias was  similar  t o   but  distinguishable  from  igneous rocks .  
Igneous rocks   contained  a t   least  one  o ther   “rock”   componen t   dis-

tinct from   lunar  basalts  sampled.  Soil was  rich  in  nickel  and volatile 
elements-cadmium,  zinc,  silver,  gold,  copper ,   and  thallium-that 
occurred  in  carbonaceous   chondrites.  Enrichment  was  consistent 
with observed occurrence  of  meteorite material in soil. 
Many  elements  tha t   occurred  in  low  abundance   in  lunar  igneous 
rocks   were  strongly  enriched  in  terrestrial  crus ta l   rocks   tha t   were 
product  of  igneous  differentiation.  I t   had  been  suggested  tha t   low 
abundance of  these  elements derived from residual  lunar liquids was 
indication  tha t   whole  moon  was   depleted  in  number  of  volatile ele- 
ments.  If  inference was co r r e c t ,  it could be  inferred  tha t  lunar mate- 
rial  separated  from  high-temperature,  dispersed  nebula  a t   1273 K 
(lOOO°C) or higher. 
Coincidence of  high  abundance   of  titanium,  separation  of  euro-  
pium  from  o ther   rare e a r th  e lemen ts ,  and  separation  of  barium  and 
strontium  suggested  igneous  liquids were  end   produc t   of  fractional 
crystallization  process  o r ,   less  likely,  that  they  were  produced  by  
partial melting and subsequen t  segregation of  liquid in lunar interior. 
High-pressure  and  tempera ture   experiments  had  shown   tha t   ma- 
terials  with  chemical  composition  of  Tranquility  Base  basalts 
would,  a t   conditions  inferred  fo r   lunar  interior,  have   densities  ex -  
ceeding moon’s average dens i ty .  Therefore ,  basalts  could not repre- 
sent moon’s bulk composition. 
Age  of  basaltic crystalline  rock  was  determined  a t  3.7 billion  yrs. 
Igneous rocks were melted  and crystallized  abou t   10 billion  yrs af ter  
moon’s  forma t ion .   Single exo t ic   rock  fragment  had  yielded  age  of 
4 . 4  billion  yrs  and  indicated  variability  in  age  between  different 
areas  on  lunar  surface .   Relatively  young basalts  showed  moon had 
not been  completely  dead  planet  from  its forma t ion ,   but  tha t   it had 
undergone  significant  differentiation,  a t   least  locally,  in  thin  lunar 
crus t .  Period  before  3.7-billion-yr  even t   recorded  in older  Highland 
areas   was  interval  in  which  earth’s  record  had  been  obliterated. 
Therefore   much  of  lunar  surface   was  important  in  understanding 
early evolution and differentiation  of  planets. 
Observations  showed  lunar  materials  were  produc t   of  consider- 
able  geochemical  and  petrological  evolution.  Optical  properties  of 
soil measured  in  laboratories  agreed  with  those  inferred  from  teles- 
copic  studies  and  indicated  thin  layer  of  soil  must  have   covered  
most of  moon.  Correlation  of  spectral  fea tures   determined  in  labo- 
ratory  with  telescopic  studies  suggested  that  iron  con ten t   of  lunar 
surface might vary .  Measured dielectric cons tan t  of  soil  agreed with 
known  radar  reflectivity  of  moon .   Penetration  dep th   suggested  up- 
per  layers were  electrically  transparen t .   Measured  thermal  conduc-  
tivity suggested tha t   diurnal variations in  tempera ture  should ex tend  
to  less  than  one  meter  in  soil regions.  Thermoluminescence  studies 
on core  samples  showed substantial diurnal  variation  in tempera ture  
12 cm  (4.7  in) below  surface .  
Seismic s tudy   showed  tha t   attenuation  of  lunar  sound  waves   de-  
creased  with  pressure.  High-pressure  velocities  were  cons is ten t  
with  those  observed  in  Apo l lo   12 seismic  exper imen ts ,   suggesting 
possibility of  seismic wave guide a t  shallow  dep th s  on  moon.  Na tu-  
ral  remanen t   magnetization  found   in  crystalline  rocks   and   breccias 
suggested ancient moon might  have  had  magnetic field with strength 
of  few  percen t   of  earth’s  field.  Field  existing  3.7  billion  yrs  ago

might  have  been  result  of  fluid motions  in  lunar  interior-effect  of 
earth’s field  when  moon  and ear th   were  closer  together  o r   result  of 
processes  not yet unders tood .  
Lunar   samples  were   valuable  for   s tudy   of  low-energy,  weakly 
penetrating  radiations  and  had  provided  sample  of  gases  blown  off 
sun  in  solar wind, making it possible t o  determine  isotopic composi- 
tion  and  abundance  of  elements  in  sun  by   direct  measurement.  Re- 
sults would  lead  t o  be t ter  understanding  of  sun’s evolution.  Studies 
of  stored  nuclear  tracks   and  induced  radioactivities  had  shown  ef- 
fec t  of  bombardment  by   solar  flare  particles  and  suggested  activity 
had  persisted  for   long  periods.  Abundance  of  cosmic-ray-produced 
nuclides in samples showed some rocks  had  been on or within sever- 
al  centimeters  of  lunar  surface  for  a t  least  10  million  yrs  and within 
one  or  two meters  (three  t o   six  and a  half  fee t)   for  a t  least  500 m i l -  
lion yrs. 
In  search  for   life origins o n  moon, micropaleontological  examina- 
tion  of  sample by   optical  microscopy  and  by electron  and  scanning 
electron  microscopy  had  produced  uniformly  negative  results.  In- 
tensive  search   for   viable  organisms using  many  environmental  and 
media  combinations  had  produced  negative  results,  as  had  the  one

ASTRONAUTICS AND  AERONAUTICS.  1970 

0  Nixon  Administration  had  decided  against  big  space  program  fo r  
1970s, Thomas O’Toole wro te   in  Washington  P o s t .  There  would  be  
“no   se t  goal  for  landing men  on Mars ,  no plan  t o  colonize the  moon 
and  no   sudden  push  to  orbit  a  permanen t   manned  space  station 
above  the ear th  in  the  nex t  five years.”  While  space program would 
“not  be  allowed to  shrink much”  in  1970, Administration  would  ask 
Congress  for  n o  more  than  $3.7  billion  for  space   in   FY   1971, “ the  
lowest  request  for   space   funds   in  almost  a  decade.”  Low  funding 
level meant space  spending would  not  rise  above  $4 billion  annually 
for  a t  least  several years   and new  programs  would  not be  started  in 
near fu ture .  ( W P o s t ,  1/11/70, A l )  
January  11-18: Washington  Evening S ta r  published  series of  seven   arti- 
cles  on  environmental  pollution.  Many  scientists  feared  “ tha t   the 
1970s will  be  the dawn  of  Doomsday.”  Mail  to White House  on   en- 
vironment  had  doubled  af ter   first  lunar  landing.  “To  many ,   the 
flights  raised  the  question  of  where  technological  priorities  should 
space  or back on  the ear th?”   Some as tronau ts  had 
b e  directed-into 
said tha t  from  space ,  air pollution was so  visible it cu t  into the  joy  of 
seeing  earth  from  hundreds  o r   thousands  of  miles  away .   Articles 
examined “what  man has done  t o  his env irpnmen t ,  and wha t  he can 
do t o  save  it.”  Observers saw “great  promise”  in National Environ- 
mental  Policy  Act  of  1969 signed  Jan .   1.  “To   Congress,  the  Presi- 
den t ,  and  so many o thers  who will  become  embroiled  in  this recent- 
ly  dramatized  issue,  the  task  a t   hand  can  be  summed  up  in  the 
phrase  ‘quality of  life.’ I t  will be a task af  cleaning up ,  of  making the 
air  and  the water  and  the   land  healthier  and  more  en joyab le .  Over

January  12:  AEC Chairman,  Dr .  Glenn  T .   Seaborg,  in  New  York  Times 
article  predicted  new  frontiers  for   nuclear  energy  during  1970s. 
Major  advances  would  include  development  of  large  commercial 
fast-breeder  reactor  which  should  lead  t o   “breeder  economy  in the  
1980’s that will  inaugurate vast savings in fuel resources  and c o s t s ” ;  
use of  abundant cheap  power for  desalting  seawater and introducing 
new  industrial  processes ;   use  of  nuclear  fission  as  power  source ;  
and  melding of  nuclear and  space  ages  “as  nuclear  energy becomes 
a  major  source  of  auxiliary  and  propulsive  power  for   space   activi- 
ties.”  SNAP  systems  for   nuclear  auxiliary  power  would  become 
“principle  source  of  electricity in  space.”  Seventies also would  see  
expanded use  of  nuclear  explosives for   peaceful  purposes ,   such  as 
power  source  for   navaids,  for   underground  excavation  in  stimulat- 
ing  production  of  natural  gas ,   and  in  extraction  of  minerals  from 
low-grade ores  and  oil  from  oil  shales.  Advances were expected  in 
use  of  radioisotopes  in  medicine,  agriculture,  and  industry  and  in 
basic and applied research  in nuclear fields. ( N Y T ,  1/12/70,81)

*  Editorial by  Robert Ho tz  in  Aviation  Week  &  Space  Technology out-

gles in the market-place  a s  the  key programs in  the space  transporta- 
tion  system  of  the  mid-1970s  come  up  for   con trac tor   selection. 
Many observers will be  misled  by  the  relatively  small dollar increas- 
es in Fiscal  1971  space budgets. Many new programs can b e  initiated 
with the  same level of  funding that was  required  for  the  Apollo  e r a ,  
plus  some   heavy  reprogramming  of  existing  projects  that  are   ap- 
proaching  technical  obsolescence  much  fas ter   than  any  planners 
imagined.  By  judiciously  paring  its  present  programs  and  getting 
only  a modest  boost  for  Fiscal  1971,  NASA   can  lay  the  founda t ions  
for the  nex t  decade’s  major  space  program.  Military  space ,  tempo-  
rarily  deflated  by  the  manned  orbiting  laboratory  cancellation,  will 
trend  toward  a broader  program  involving  several major  new  fields. 
Commercial and  nOn-NASA  space will  provide  a modestly  expanding 
market,  and  the big  battle  between  celestial  and  terrestrial  commu-  
nications is shaping into a major clash.”  ( A v  Wk,  1/12/70, 11) 
January  13 :  Dr.  Thomas  0 .  Paine,  NA SA   Administrator,  said  at  N A S A  
Hq .   news  conference   on   fu ture   plans  he  was  directing  portions  of 
space program  to bring operations in line with  FY  1971 budget.  “We 
recognize  th e   many  important  needs  and  urgent  problems  we  face  
here  on   ear th .   America’s  space   achievements  in  t h e   1960’s  have  
rightly  raised hopes  th a t  this country and all mankind can do  more to  
overcome  pressing  problems  of  society.  The  space   program  should 
inspire bolder  solutions and  suggest  new  approaches .   I t  has already 
provided  many  direct  and  indirect  benefits  and  is  creating  new 
wealth and capabilities.”  S trong  space program  continued  a s  one  of 
Nation’s major  priorities.  “However ,   we  recognize  that  under cur-  
rent fiscal  restraints  NA SA  must find  new ways t o  s tre tch  ou t  curren t  
programs  and  reduce   o u r   presen t   operational  base.”  N A S A   would 
“press  forward  in  1971  at  a reduced  level,  but  in  the  right  direction 
with  the  basic  ingredients  we  need  for   major  achievements  in  the  
1970s  and  beyond.  . . .we  will  not  dissipate  the   strong  teams  tha t  
sen t  men  t o  explore the moon  and  automated  spacecraf t  to observe  
the planets.” 
NASA  would  suspend  Sa turn   V  production  indefinitely  af ter   Sa t-  
urn  V  515  completion,  s tre tch   Apollo  lunar  missions  t o   six-month 
launch  intervals,  defer  lunar  expeditions  during  AAP   space  station

launch  to  next  Mars  oppor tun i ty   in  1975. Number  of  employees  in

Positive  aspec ts  of  space  program  for   1970s included Apollo  m i s -  
sions through  Apollo  19, use  of  one  Sa turn  V  to  launch first experi- 
mental AAP   space station  into ear th  orbit in  1972, Mars orbit by two  
unmanned  spacecraf t   in  1971, launch  of  first  Jupiter  probe  in  !972, 
launch  of  spacecraf t  past Venus   to Mercury  in   1973, and continua- 
tion of  scientific satellite launches. 
Design of  reusable  space  shuttle would  be  started and  first experi- 
mental  space  station  would  be   launched ,   as  planned,  in  1972. FY 
1971 budget would  permit proceeding with  design of  advanced  space  
station as permanent  base  in  ear th   orbit,  continued  work  on  NASA -  
AEC  NERVA  pro jec t ,   practical  ear th   applications  of  space   technolo- 
gy ,  and  advances  in  applications of  space  technology  in  fields such  
a s   meteorology  and  communications.  Although  “aus tere ,”   space 
program  for  1971 was  “forward  looking”  and  contained  “basic  in- 
gredients  needed  for   an  effective  space   program  in  the  1970s.”  I t  
would  “extend  ou r   space   capabilities,  expand  our   scientific 
knowledge, and  make  available  new  applications of  benefit  t o  peo- 
ple here on earth.” 
In  response  to  ques t ion ,   Dr.  Paine  said  he   foresaw  no   shutdown 
of  KSC  and  had  no  plans  for  closing other  centers.  Intended  actions 
“represen t   a decision to proceed through the year  1971 and  see what 
our  studies  turn  up.  I   think  it  is  important  t o  realize  these   are  very 
advanced ,  perhaps ,   and we have  a  lot  t o  learn  about the  technologi- 
cal feasibility,  the   c o s t ,   schedules-and 
I  wouldn’t  wan t   to  say  we 
now  have  a complete free  road  into the fu ture .  We don’t.’’ Asked  if

the  United  S ta tes   a t  a  large  number  of  different  levels.  I   think  the 
level we  have  now  is  a  level  we  can  take  great  pride  in  and  I   think

Itos I was  first  in  new  ser ies   of  opera t iona l  meteorological  satel- 
lites to  be  launched  in  joint NASA-ESSA  program  t o  rep lace  TOS satel- 
lites operating in National Opera t iona l  Meteorological Satellite Sys-  
tem.  Itos  I weighed  306  kg  (675  1bs)-more 
than  twice  a s   much  as  
previous  TOS  satellites-and  carr ied   bo th   au toma t ic   picture  trans-  
mission  (APT)  and  advanced  vidicon  camera   system  (AVCS)   camer- 
as ,   previously  carried  on   sepa ra te   missions.  Satellite  was  box-  
shaped with  three-panel  solar  array   and  had  new  “stabilite”  three-  
axis stabilization sys tem .  Onboard  exper imen ts  included two  redun-  
dan t   AVCS  cameras   f o r   s tored   global  cloud-cover  da ta   fo r   remo te

plate  radiometer  fo r   da ta   on   global  hea t   balance;  and   solar  proton 
monitor  f o r   routine  observa t ion   of  solar  flares.  Spacecraf t   would

tions Compare? Report by   Dr.  Charles S.  Sheldon 11, Chief  of  Sci- 
ence  Policy Div.,  summarized  12-yr  efforts of  major  space  powers. 
U.S.  expec ted   to have   spen t  by   June  30,  1970, jus t   over  $56 billion 
on   combined  military  and  civilian  space  programs  in  which  some  
half  million  persons  had  been  employed.  I t  was  likely  U.S.S.R.  had 
“committed  a  similar  amoun t   of  resources.”  U.S.  space  employ- 
ment had  peaked ;  Soviet had  no t ,   “as   judged by their  rising number 
of  launchings.”  There  was  no   evidence  tha t   total  Soviet  aerospace  
industry was a s  fully  equipped  a s  U .S . ,   but missiles of  differing  de- 
sign  philosophies  seen   in  Moscow  parades  suggested  “more   than 
one  design  and  development  team  fo r   space  work  jus t   a s  in  Soviet 
aviation.”  Each   country  seemed  adequately  equipped  with  launch 
pads.  U.S.S.R.  claimed  nationwide  tracking  system  bu t   relied  on  
ships to  fill gaps. 
U.S.S.R.  was   still  using  ICBM   with  1400-kg (3000-lb)  thrus t   and 
improved  staging  to   boost  4700-kg  (10 400-lb)  Vos tok   and  6600-kg 
(14500-lb)  Soyuz .   Proton  launch  vehicle  had  carried  16800   kg 
(37 000 Ibs)  to e a r th  orbit  and might  have  potential  to  lift  27 200 kg  
(60 000 lbs) with circumlunar capac i ty   of  6000 kg (14 500 Ibs).  “We 
have not yet  seen the very  large Soviet  vehicle confidently predicted 
by  N A S A   officials  the  last  three  years.  Lesser  Soviet  launch  vehi- 
cles accoun t  for  unmanned  programs.”  There  was no  sign of  Soviet 
breakthrough  in  fuels  “bu t   their  engines  are   run   a t   relatively  high 
pressure,  increasing  efficiency.”  There   was  no   sign  that  solid-fuel 
rockets had  been used by U.S.S.R.  for  space purposes  and question 
of  Soviet development  of  nuclear  rocket  was  “highly  speculative.” 
Soviet work  on   electric  rocke ts   had  reached  only  “early  proof-of- 
principle”  stage.  U.S.  Sa turn   V  was  “clearly  the   bes t   operational 
weight lifter in the world.” 
Odds  were  “overwhelming”  tha t   Vladimir  Komarov   had  been 
only Soviet Cosmonaut  killed  in  space  so f a r .   “This  is  because  the  
Russians  have   followed  a  conservative  approach   t o   manned  flight 
with heavy vehicles allowing much redundancy in equipment.” 
There  seemed to  be  “little  difference between the  Soviet and U.S. 
space  programs  as  to  general  purpose  and  direction.”  About  three  
fifths of  U.S.  flights were  conducted  for  DOD ;   similar heavy  military 
emphasis existed  in U.S.S.R.  “Soviet  Union has a  large and regular 
program  of  military  suppor t   flights  including  use  of  satellites  for  
photographic  observa t ion ,   electronic  listening,  wea ther   reporting, 
communications  relaying,  and   sh ip  navigation.”  U.S.  did  not  have  
FOB  program,  “because  i t  does   not regard  them  a s  necessary  o r  de- 
sirable.  The  Russians  obviously  d o ,  for   reasons  no t  wholly  clear.” 
While  assessmen t  could  not b e  conclusive,  “suspicion  remains  tha t  
a capability  to   inspect  and  des troy   satellites  has   been  crea ted”   by 
U.S.S.R. 
In  space  applications, U.S.  “has   held  a  clear lead  from  the  earlier 
days  of  the   space program,  and this  experience has  permitted  u s  to  
move ahead  to  more advanced  systems  while  th e  Sov ie t  Union was  
still working  hard  to ca tch  up.”  U.S.S.R.  had  made greater effort in 
number of  lunar  and planetary  flights,  “but  so f a r  has  not gained  a s  
good  results  a s  we have  from  a more modest  program.”  Some   14% 
of  Soviet flights had been in escape  mission  category and 8%  of  U.S. 
flights.  Reasonable  assumption  was  “ tha t   manned  flights  by  the

Nowhere  is this tes t  more evident  than in  the  troub led ,  hesitant pos-

design  “and  a  continual  dropback   in  the   urgency  level  of  ou r   SST 
effor t ,”   SST’S  competitive  advantages were  “being  dissipated by  an 
inexorable ca lendar .”  
Apolfo  I 1  lunar  landing  had  alleviated  Cciigressional  opposition 
to  fu r the r   expens ive   long-term  space   commitments.  “Sudden ly ,   it 
was practical to  think  of  going ahead with  an  expanded lunar  explo-

Space   science  and  applications  program  had  been  marking  time, 
“with  most  programs s tre tched  ou t  to  match the  diminished funding 
made smaller  still by  the  nasty bite  of  inflation.”  But “light  is begin-

million  mark  had  led  space   science  program  steadily  to   shift  “its 
dollar focus  away from the  ear th .”  
Civil  s y s t e m   ac t iv i ty  by  aerospace   community  was  only  token .  
“Yet  1969 may  prove   to   have  been  a  landmark  year  for   the   indus-

Thomas  0. Paine,  NASA  Administrator,  had  said:  “We  are   putting 
into  motion  with  this  budget  a   program  which  does  no t   advance  
toward  a   single climactic  even t .   It follows the   recommendations  of 
the   Space   Task   Group   Report’s  Option  11,  although  a t   a   reduced 
pace.  The   budget  to   implement  the   recommenda t ions ,  however ,   is 
aus tere   and ,   as   a   resu l t ,   does   not  take   full  advantage  of  ou r   total 
capability. But  the  new  program  has  the  flexibility  to  accommoda te  
this reduced budget in FY   1971.” 
Lowes t  NA SA  budget  since FY   1962  “means   substantial cu tbacks  
and deferrals  in a  number  of  programs.  Our bes t  curren t  es t ima te  is 
tha t   the   total  nationwide  employment  on  NASA  work-which  was 
once   420,000  people-will  decline  from  curren t   level  by  ano ther  
45,000, to  abou t   144,000 people  by  the   end  of  fiscal  year  1971. The

think  by  any  possible  measure   tha t   pu ts   th e   space   program  v e ry ,  
very  high  in  the   nation’s  priorities.”  Major  reduction  would  be   in 
manned  spaceflight  “from  a  little  over   $2  billion  in  FY   70  t o   $1,- 
474,000,000 in 71 .”  With “ the   manned  lunar landing behind  us ,  with 
almost all  the  initial  buy of  15  vehicles  now  comp le ted ,  we  a re  able 
to   take   a  major  reduction  in  th e   Apollo  accoun t   as   tha t   program 
reaches  a logical termination.  We  had  hoped  t o  con t inue  the  Sa turn  
V  a t   limited  production  of  several  a  year.  The   decision  was  made 
under these  aus tere  conditions tha t  we would term ina te  tha t  produc- 
tion and take  the  savings.” 
Peak  NASA   expenditure  of  $6  billion  in  1965  included  outlay  fo r  
buildup  of  total  NASA   base .   Fac t   “ tha t   we  are   now  down  between 
the  three  and  fou r  billion  mark  by  no  means  means   tha t  we  will  be 
operating a t   a  substantially lower  space  activity than  we  had  a t  the

can  pu t   a  much  higher  percentage  of  our  expenditures  in to   pro-

However ,   FY  1971 budget would  delay  Apollo Applications flight 
until  end   of  1972;  s tre tch   Apollo  lunar  flights  to   two   a  year ,   with 
Apollo  16  occurring  before   AA   program  launch  in  1972-1973  and 
Apollo  17  and  18 af ter   A A   program  missions; delay  ATS-F  and  ATS-G

NA SA  operational base  by  shutting down  ERC  and possibly  mothball-

would  increase.  “We  feel  tha t   much  of  the   work  tha t   will  be  going 
forward  in the  shuttle program will probably have  some  spin-off  into 
the   aeronau t ics   area .”   Emphas is   would  be   placed  on  V/STOL  and 
quiet engines. 
Orbiting  Solar  Observa tory   launch  recommended  by  Space  Task

one  year ,  to  1973 and  1975. lunar  roving vehicle  would  be  carried on 
Apollo 16, 17,  18, and  19. Decision  on  whether  to  f u n d   two  or  three  
space  shuttle definition  s tud ies  would  be  made af ter   proposals were 
received. In   space station area  experimental  requirements would  be 
emphasized.  Two  Phase-B   definition  s tud ies   were  under  way. 
Summer study of  utilization  of  space stations would  be  international 
conference  “w i th ,   we hope ,   strong participation  from  the European

other  defens ive  space   sys tems .”   F irs t   defense   comsa t   system  had 
been  transmitting  “substantial  load  of  voice  communications  be- 
tween Washington  and Vietnam  since  1967. I t  can  also  handle high-

In  year’s  time  “we  will  be  launching  a   still  fu r the r   improved 
Phase  I1 United  S ta te s  system with grea ter  traffic  handling capac i ty ,  
higher  reliability  and  longer  life  expec tancy .”   F irs t   experimental

c a t e  with each   o ther  in  spite of  intervening obstacles  like mountain

though  their  du t ies   have   largely  been  taken  over  now  by  more  ad- 
vanced  versions.”  Velas had  performed  scientific  chores  like “mon-  
itoring  the   level  of  solar  radiation  during  manned  space  flights,  to  
ensure  against danger t o  the  a s t ronau t s .”  
uSAF  navigation  satellites under  study  would  permit  pinpoint  ac-  
curacy   in  navigation  of  superson ic  a ircraf t   and  surface   and subsur-

more than  200  predoctoral  training gran ts  which had  been  funded  a t

would  end .  S tuden ts  would  no t  b e  c u t  off  immediately, s ince  gran ts  
had  been  step-funded and would  be reduced  ove r  three  years.  NA SA  
Assistant Administrator fo r  University  Affairs F. B.  Smith said oth- 
er   agencies might  assume   fund ing  of  some gran ts ,   since university 
R&D funding in  total  Federa l   budget would  increase  by $1 14 million 
during  FY   1971.  Presidential  Science  Adviser,  Dr.  L e e   A.  Du-  
Bridge,  said  increase  would  not  compensa te  for   leveling  off  of  R&D 
budgets in  past few years  nor  for  effects of  inflation. He noted Gov-

we  must  char t  a  new  course   for  the  next  decade  in  space .  The  Con-

continuing  progress  and  leadership  in  space   and   aeronau t ics .   At 
the  same  time,  NASA   is  going  through  a  difficult  period  of  redirec-

February 23:  At  annual meeting of  American Chemical Society in  Hous-

described  lunar  highlands  a s   “comparable  to  the   continents  of 
e a r th ,   floating  like  icebergs  on  a  more  dense   medium  of  deeper  
rocks.”  Only  chemical  bas is   of  comparison  between  lunar  plains 
and highlands  had  been provided  by Turkevich-designed  experiment 
flown  on  Surveyor  mission  t o   highland  region  near  cra ter   Tycho .  
Compared  with  Apo l lo   11  lunar  sample  d a t a ,   experiment  da ta  
proved  plains  were  darker  and  denser   than  highlands  because  they 
contained  twice  the   abundance  of  elements  heavier  than  calcium. 
Moon’s chemical  con ten t   also  showed  “evidence  for  a  crus t  on  the 
moon.” 
Dr. John  A .  Wood  of  Smithsonian Astophysical  Observatory  pre- 
sented  corroborating evidence  based  on  traces  of  highland material 
in  Apo l lo   I 1  samples.  H e   explained  meteoroid  impact  at  nearby 
highland  area  might  have  showered  lighter-colored  material-anor- 
plain  where  A po l lo   11   landed.  Anorthositic  c ru s t ,  
thosite-on 
formed  by  melting, probably  covered  moon  a t  one  time.  Then giant 
cra ters ,   which  became  plains,  were  blasted  into crus t   by  early  i m -  
pacts  and  lavas  from  beneath  surface   welled  into  holes  and  solidi-

Challenge  and  objectives  of  space   science  and  applications  program

ciate  Administrator  for   Space   Science  and  Applications,  before 
House   Committee  on   Science  and  Astronautics  during  NASA   FY  
1971  authorization  hearings:  “In  the   allocation  of  its  scarce   re- 
sources  NASA   is emphasizing those  projects which  help solve imme- 
diate problems  and deferring  to  a  later  year  those  major  new  s ta r t s  
whose objectives are  primarily  to gain the new  knowledge. Obvious- 
ly, we  canno t   continue  t o   defer  such   promising  scientific  projects 
indefinitely  without  mortgaging  the  economic  health,  the   technical 
progress, and the security of  this Nation. 
“In  the  immediate  fu ture   these  postponements  are  tolerable  be- 
cause  of  our   active  ongoing  program.  Future  Aeronomy  and  Inter- 
planetary  Monitoring  Platform  (IMP) Explorer  missions  will  be  di-

fu ture  missions.”  Establishing scientific priorities,  allocating proper 
resources  to  research ,   and  deciding between  various expensive  sci- 
entific  projects  would  continue  to   be   “a   most  difficult  problem.” 
NASA   would  work  with  in-house  scientists,  advisory  groups ,   and

probability  that  life,  in  some  form ,   may  exist  and  they  have   not 
dampened the enthusiasm  of  the biologist  to search  for  life o n  Mars.

Dr.  Hermann  H.  Kurzweg ,  Director  of  Research ,  OART ,   testified 
on   NASA  basic  research  programs:  NASA-supported  research  had 
developed  new  approach   permitting  for  first  time  step-by-step  nu- 
merical calculation  of  growth  of  disturbances  in  atmospheric  shear 
flows, which  should contribute  t o   detection  and avoidance of  clear-

fluid physics knowledge  t o  atmospheric  pollution  from airborne and 
ground  sources ,   testing  pollutant  action  in  models  of  city  streets. 
New  research  programs  would  apply  knowledge  of  fluid  dynamics 
to  noise  aba temen t   studies.  Establishment  of  direct  relationship 
between  surface   s truc ture   and  electrical  characteristics  of  germa- 
nium  surface during oxidation had  increased  knowledge of  oxygen’s 
role  in  device  performance  and  should  increase  efficiency  in  elec-

During February :   In   AFSC  Newsreview  editorial  Gen .   James   Ferguson  
( W A F ) ,  AFSC Commander ,  praised command’s two  decades  of  “dis- 
tinguished  progress”  in  sc ience   and  technology:  “When  the   F-15 
air-superiority  fighter  ou tc lasses   everything  in  the   air-when 
the  
B-1  advanced   bomber  is   operational-when 
a  new  generation  of 
ICBMS helps  t o  maintain peace-when 
a  million-pound  airplane can  
remain  on  station  indefinitely  because  of  nuclear power-and  when 
military  men  maneuver  in to   and   ou t   of  space  o rb i t s ,   a t  will,  from 
the se ,   and  more,  will  have been  possible 
conventional airfields-all 
not only because of  what we  learn  today  and tomorrow ,  but because  
of  all  the  things we  learned  in  our  first two decades .”   (AFSC   News- 
review, 2 /70 ,2 )  
*  In  Space/Aeronautics  Frank   Leary   commented  on   NA SA   plans  fo r  
manned  Mars  mission:  “A   commitment  to   placing  human  foo t -  
prints  on   the  red  planet  will  spark  an  arduous   and  enormously  ex- 
pensive e f fo r t .  And  i t  will  rank le   those  cr i t ics  who  wan t   the  money 
spent  on  earthly  ills.  Technologically  and  politically,  the  manned 
Mars mission  is no piece  of  cake .   Bu t ,   like Apollo,  it  is virtually  in- 
evitable.”  (SIA ,  2 /70 ,28-38)

0  Progress repor t  on plans  for  National Air and Space  Museum in Wash- 
ington, D .C . ,   was published  in  Astronautics  and  Aeronau t ics .  Dur- 
ing hearings on H.R.  6125, signed by  President Johrlson  in July  1966, 
Smithsonian Institution had  been enjoined  from  asking Congress fo r  
construction  funding until  a f te r  se t t lemen t  of  Vietnam War.  Assist- 
an t  Secre tary  for  Science  Sidney R .   Galler  was  requesting FY  1971 
funds  of  $2  million  to  reappra ise  architectural plans fo r  museum  and 
“listening for  a ‘signal from Congress’ ” before  asking for  cons truc-  
tion  funds .   In  interim,  small  air  and  space   display  was  housed  in 
Smithsonian’s  Ar ts  and  Indus tr ies  Building and  in  small, temporary  
Air and Space  Building.  “The   bulk of  the  200 plus a irframes  and the  
300-400 engines is stored a t  the  Silver  Hill (Maryland) Navy  facility. 
About  80%  of  the   stored  collection  is  e i ther   in  sheds  or  c ra te s .”  
Museum plans  were reviewed  periodically  to reflect  latest  in design. 
Until  747  a ircraf t   and  Apollo  spacecraf t ,   Smithsonian  could  house 
aerospace  history displays. 
“The   to ta l  Smithsonian annual budget runs  abou t  $30 million. The  
Air  and  Space  portion  amounted  to  $538 000 in  1969 or  abou t  2%  of 
the tota!.  . , , S .  Paul Johns ton   retired  in  Sep tember  a s  Director  of

be quarantined  under procedures   similar  to those  fo r  Apollo  1 1  and 
Apollo  12.  Apollo  Mission  Director,  Capt.  Ches ter   M .   Lee   (U SN ,  
Ret.),  said  continuation  of  quarantine-thought 
unnecessary  by 
many scientists-was  based  “solely  upon  the  fac t  tha t   a  segment of 
the  scientific  community considered  the  hilly  upland  site  toecon s t i -  
tu te  a new lunar  env ironmen t   . . . . The  bio te s t s   .  . . phystcal  sci- 
ence ,   and  organic  chemistry  analyses,  have  found   absolutely  no 
evidence of  any  life forms  or  precursors  of  life.” 
1.0  ieduce   risk  of  lightning  from  high-potential  near  thunder-  
storms which  had  affected  Apollo  12, NASA  had  tightened  rules  €or  
launching in bad  weather.  Spacecraf t  would  not be  launched if  nom- 
inal flight path  carried vehicle  through cumulonimbus c louds ,  within 
8 km  (5 mi) of  thunders torm  c loud ,  or  within 5 km (3 mi) of  ove rhang  
from a  cumulonimbus  cloud;  through  a  cold  f ron t   or  squall  lying 
clouds  extending  3000  m   (10 000  f t) ;   through  middle  cloud  layers 
1800 m   (6000 f t )  or  more deep ;  o r  through cumu lus  clouds with  tops 
3000 m  (10 000 f t )  or higher.  Cap t .  Lee   said  although Apollo vehicle 
was well  pro tec ted ,   lightning  discharge did  occu r  and  NASA   officials 
were  “doing every th ing  we possibly  can  to  avoid i t ,  without res tr ic t-  
ing ourse lves  unduly”  to  never  launching a t  all.  (Transcript)

total $15.8 billion  in  FY   1969 and $16.5 billion  in  FY   1970. Cycle of 
rapid  advancemen t   in  Federa l  R&D funding tha t   began  in  1950s had 
ended .  Basic research  obligations  totaled $2.1 billion  in  FY  1968 and 
were  expected  to   be   same  in  FY  1969. In   FY  1970  research   obliga-

sea rch  had  grown  more  rapidly  than  e i ther  applied  research   or   de- 
velopment.  Applied  research   obligations  totaled  $3 .3  billion  in  FY  
1968 and were expec ted  to  be same in  FY   1969. For  FY   1970, obliga- 
tions were  expec ted   to  reach   $3.7  billion.  Applied  research   growth 
ra te   since  FY   1967  had  slowed  to   less   than  1%  annually.  Develop- 
ment obligations  totaled  $10.6 billion  in  FY  1968 and  were  expec ted  
to  decrease  to  $10.4 billion  in FY s   1969 and  1970. From  FY s   1959 to  
1969 development portion of  Federal R&D total dropped from 79% t o  
66%. 
In  FY   1969, 77%  of  Federa l  R&D  fund s  was expec ted  to  go  to  ex-

and  in  the practical application  of  space  for  the   benefit  of  man  here 
on Ear th  is  laid o u t ,  with increasing emphasis on international coop-  
eration.”  Space   shuttle  and  space   station  proposals  contained  re- 
duction in cos t  of  space  activities and  increase in  man’s capability  to 
travel back  and  fo r t h  and  t o  work  in  space  for   long periods.  Space  
shuttle  would  t ak e   off  vertically;  a t   64-km  (40-mi)  altitude  and

plies into ear th  o rb i t ,  with  1st stage returning  to ear th   for  horizontal 
landing. After  mission  of  up t o  two  weeks ,   2nd  stage would  reen ter  
a tmosphere  and land horizontally  for reuse .  
President’s  program  of  planetary  exploration  would  “provide 
man with a closehand  look of  every  planet  in the  solar sys tem .”

holders  ComSatCorp  President  Joseph   V.  Charyk  and  Chairman 
James  McCormack  said:  “Outstanding. progress  has  been  made  in 
the  establishment of  the  global  communications satellite system.  . .a 
goal  toward  which  COMSAT  and  the   International  Telecommunica-

This basic goal  was  achieved  when  a   satellite was  placed  over   the  
Indian  Ocean  in  the   summer  of  1969. . . . In  addition,  the  pace  of 
ear th  station development by  national  entities in many countries has 
been  significant.  Inves tmen t   worldwide  of  abou t   $200  million  in 
ear th  stations and  more than $100 million  in satellites reflects  a  wide-

Mr.  Nixon,  judging  from  his  last  budget  message,  is  disinclined  to 
buck  this  trend.  The  President’s conviction  seems to  b e  that  impor-

ence  and  technology; explore  solar system  with phased  program  of 
lunar  exploration,  search  for   extraterrestrial  life,  and  diversified 
planetary  exploration;  and  use  space   platforms 
t o   expand  
knowledge  of  universe  and  basic  physical  laws.  Panel  urged  tha t  
U.S.  develop technology to  expand  capability  for automated  equip- 
ment controlled by man  in  remote location for  space  exploration and 
civil applications, reduce  c o s t  of  space  operations by  co s t  reduction 
for   expendable  vehicles  and  payload  deve lopmen t ,   strengthen 
biomedical  basis  fo r   possible  long-duration  manned  space   flights, 
and encourage international cooperative programs. 
Panel recommended  NASA  and DOD continue joint  s tudy  of  reusa- 
ble  space  transportation  system  “in  the expectation  tha t   a decision 
can  be   made  fo r   a FY  1972 budget  decision  on  an  STS development 
program .” Design target  should  be replacement  “of  t h e  largest pos- 
sible part of  th e  national  launch vehicle s tab le ,”   including Saturn V. 
“We  urge  the  deferral  of  a  development  decision  on   space  stations 
more elaborate  than  the AAP  space  station.  . .concept until t h e  prior 
availability  of  the  STS can be‘confidently  anticipated.”  I t  was “likely 
tha t   some  form  of  multiply  reusable  space   transportation  system 
will  indeed  become  the   most  a t trac t ive  major  new  technology  de- 
velopment for  the  decade .”  
Other recommendations  were basic  biomedical research  program 
supplemented by   12-  to   18-mo  Apollo  Applications  flight  program, 
to  provide  human fac tors  information for  more  ambitious space  s ta -  
t ion ;   possible  second-generation  space   station  to  utilize  STS; and 
earth-orbital  manned  space   flight  activity  with  systems  using  STS.

recommendations:  “Compared  t o  the   feverish  reach  for   the   moon

take off  for  Mars-at 
the earliest in  1983-will 
there  be  anything like 
the excitement of  the  first trip t o  the moon. Yet  it is a practical  time- 
table NA SA  has developed,  one tha t   promises the  maximum  in  scien- 
tific research within  a budget  reflecting  a lowered  priority  for space. 
Exploration  of  space   is  by  no  means  being  abandoned ,   bu t   urgent

budgetary  ones  o n   the   expansion  of  basic  studies  in  the  manned 
space program.  I t  will  be  a  long time before  as tronau ts  on  missions

Director  of  Medical  Research  and Operations,  Dr.  Charles  A.  Ber- 
ry ,   and  his  staff  “have  been  responsible  for  establishing  medical 
protocols  for  the   missions,  in  a way  that  balances  the   need  for   bi- 
omedical  data  with  operational  demands  and  the  willingness  and 
ability of  the  as tronau ts  to  coopera te .  Some medical  procedures  are 
tedious,  unpleasant,  and even  humiliating, and  when  the work  load 
on   astronauts  is  heavy ,   data  gathering  has  t o   be  limited.  For   this

Lovell announced final code names for  LM  and C M  had  been selected 
according to  theme  of  mythology.  LM  would  be  called  “Aquarius” 
after  mythical  Egyptian  water  carrier  who   brought  fertility  and 
knowledge  to  Nile  Valley.  Code name  originally  selected  for   CM- 
“Auriga,”  f o r  constellation  Auriga-had 
been  dropped  in  favor   of 
“Odyssey ,”   ep ic  Greek  poem  abou t   long  adventures  and  wander- 
ings  of  Odysseus   in  Greek  mythology.  Lovell  said  Apollo  13   crew 
had  “already  had  quite an odyssey just getting trained”  for mission. 
Landing of  Aquarius on  moon  would  be  different  from  previous 
landings, Lovell  said.  Key  to landing was Cone  Cra ter  o n  Fra  Mau- 
ro.  LM  was “being  targeted for a spo t  tha t  we don’t wan t  to land a t , ”  
uprange  abou t   1/2 km  from  desired  site;  “we’re  not  sure  of  the  ac-  
tual  height  of  this  ridge  [of  Cone   Crater].  . .so  we’re  targeting 
uprange to  make  sure  we get over it.”

Reason  for going to F r a  Mauro was  “its  peculiar  geologic forma-

lar  basin  that  was  formed  early  in  the  moon’s  h is tory . .   .by  a  large

little  public  pressure  to   keep   space   exploration  and  development

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS,  1970 

March  31:  Explorer  I ,   first  U . S .  satellite  (launched Jan.  31,  1958). reentered  the  atmos- 
phere  over  the South Pacific after completing 58 408 revolutions and  traveling 2.67  billion 
kilometers  (1.66  billion  miles)  during  its  13-year lifetime.  To  celebrate  the  launch,  Vice 
President Richard M.  Nixon  visited  Jet  Propulsion Laboratory  Feb.  17.  1958.  Examining 
the spacecraft model with  him  (left  to right above) were Dr.  Clark B.  Millikan. Director of 
the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Cal Tech: Dr.  Lee A .   DuBridge, President of 
Cal Tech; Dr.  William  H.  Pickering, Director of  J P L :  Dr. Jack  E. Froehlich,  Explorer  Pro-

Parks, Chief Of  J P L  Guidance Control Division. 

ty  Associate  Administrator  for  Planning,  Dr.  Wernher  von  Braun 
held  press  conference   o n   N A S A  planning  procedures:  Skylab  pro- 
gram  would  consist  of  four   flights.  First  would  be  an  unmanned 
flight  boosted  by  two-stage  Saturn  V-only 
first  and  second  s tage ,  
with third  stage replaced  by orbital workshop ,  now  called Skylab. 
“I t   will  be   this  country’s  first  orbital  space  station.  Attached  t o  
this Skylab is  an airlock module, and  a multiple  docking adap ter ,   to  
which  arriving  command  and  service  modules  can  dock  for   crew 
exchange.  And  also  attached  to  it  is  the   ATM .   . .a  manned  solar  ob- 
servatory  that  will  be   serviced  by  the  people  living  in  the  Skylab. 
O n e  day  af ter   this  Skylab  has  been  launched  into  orbit  and  has  de- 
pioyed i ts  solar panels,  both  o n   the  ATM   and  the Skylab itself,  it will 
be   visited  by  a  Sa turn   1B-launched command  and  service  module, 
bringing  the  first  crew  complement of  three.  The  command  module 
will dock  to the  multiple  docking adap ter ,   the  crew will  slip through 
the  docking adap ter  and the airlock, into the  workshop.  . . . And  the  
men  will  stay  up there   for  28  days .”   Crew  would  then  “crawl  back  
into  their  command  module,  d e t a c h . .   .use  the  service  module  t o

deboos t   themselves,  and  the   command  module  will  reen ter   th e  
ocean and make a norma4 Apollo landing. 
“About  three months a f t e r  the  first flight, ano ther  flight will go  up ,  
and  this  time th e  crew  s t a y . .   .will be  extended  to  56 days .   . . . And 
finally, there  will b e  a third  revisit,  again of 56 days ,   af ter  which the  
third  crew  will  descend.  The   Skylab  will  then  go  into  storage  and 
can  potentially  be   reactivated  any   time  thereaf ter   if  more  revisits 
are planned.” 
Even  without budget  restraints,  it would  be  “something  like  1977 
before we could have a  [space] shuttle flying.” 
NA SA   was  “in  continuous  touch  with  the   Air  Force”   in  space  
shuttle and   space  station  field.  “The  armed forces .   . .have  t h e  du ty  
to  look  into  everything that  may  have  a defense  aspec t ;   and  so  i t  is 
entirely  proper  that  they  wan t   to  understand  the   ramifications  of 
space.”  (Transcript)

During March: Dr. James  A. Van Allen, Univ. of  Iowa Director of  Phys- 
ics and Astronomy Depts..,  discussed  significance  of  lunar  landings, 
in  university  lecture  s e r ~ e s :  “The   Apollo  missions,  t o   me ,   are 
straightforward though  immensely  difficult  tasks.  They   do ,  howev- 
er, yield  relatively  little  in the way  of  fundamental  understanding of 
nature. They  are  not  scientific in  that  sense. There  is a longstanding 
controversy  a s   t o  whether  a  manned  spacecraf t   is  a  better  way  to 
conduc t   science  in  space  than  an  automated,  commandable  space-  
c ra f t .   I’m  sure   there  is  no   simple  answer  t o   tha t   question.  As  the 
general  romance  and  entertainment  value  of  manned  flight  tend  t o  
wear off  a little,  I think this question will be attacked  in a thoroughly 
pragmatic  way.”  Apollo  1 1  lunar  landing  “might  properly  be  com- 
pared  to the   explorations  of  Amundsen  and  Perry  and  Byrd  in  the  
Arctic and Antarctic, or perhaps Lindbergh flying t h e  Atlantic.  These

a re  grea t  achievements,  hero ic  achievements, but  the  general po ten-  
tial af  th e  Moon in its relationship t o  human life on  a large  scale is by 
no  means  obv ious   t o   me.  I don’t  think  any   compe ten t  person  has 
f o a n d a  significant, econom ic ,  human  use  fo r  the  Moon.”  The re  was  
general  feeling, mostly  from  aeronau t ics   and   allied  indus tr ies ,   tha t  
development- of  space   flight was  impor tan t   to  U.S.  fu ture   in  same 
sense  tha t  a ircraf t  development had  been .   “I think this is fundamen-  
t a l y  a false analogy.”  Space  shuttle and space  station were feas ib le .

ty iin  judging.”  (Univ of  Iowa  Spec ta to r ,  3 / 7 0 , 6 )  
* A IA  President  Karl  G .   Ha r r ,   J r . ,   said  in  Aerospace   Techno logy:  “In

landing on the  moon-the  Apollo program. Nor   has  any  o ther  en te r -  
p r i se in  history brokem so much new  technical ground. The  technical

as  of  comparable  national  secur i ty   programs,  are   available  fo r  
b rmd e r   applications in  the  nation’s  serv ice .  The  problem  is  how  t o  
harness   them  effectively  for   such  purposes .   The   Apollo  program 
eenfered on a clearry  s ta ted  goal with adequa te  funding fo r  its a t ta in-

of  authority  and  responsibility  were  c lear ,   simple  and  s trong .   Our  
nation’s environmental problems,  however ,  of ten  do  not en joy  such

innovative means t o  overcome  such  cons tra in ts  so tha t  technology’s 
FevoMionary new  tools can  be more effectively  applied  t o  the  press-

Dr.  Malcolm  Sm i th ,   J r . ,   was  published  by   New  York  Times.  In- 
creased  use  of  spoons ,   use  of  bowls,  and  facilities  for   spreading 
sandwich fillings on   slices  of  fresh   bread  would  provide  Apollo  13 
astronauts  more  nearly  normal  eating  procedures  than  on  previous 
missions.  Freeze-dried  pork  and  scalloped  po ta toes   would  contain 
chunks rather  than  be  of  baby  food consistency  but meal  would  still 
be  lukewarm.  Wider  variety  of  fresh  bread  had  been  baked  fo r

had  shaved  to   improve  his  TV   image.  Lovell  closed  te lecas t   by 
wishing everyone  on ear th  “a  nice  evening,”  saying as tronau ts  were 
ready  “ to   get back  fo r  a pleasant  evening in  Odyssey.’’ Minutes lat-

suggested by  Mission Con tro l ,   nothing  seemed  to   halt  drop   in oxy-

thinking  abou t ,   too.  We’ve  been  talking  it  over.  . . .” Decision was 
made to  abor t  mission. 
Astronauts  hurriedly  had  to   salvage  enough oxygen  to  supply CM  
during reentry  and  keep  gyros  operating until  LM  navigation  equip-

Apollo  13 astronauts:  “From   the   beginning,  man’s  ventures  into 
space  have  been accompanied by  danger. Apollo  13  reminds u s  how 
real those dangers are.  . .of  the  special qualities of  the  men who  dare  
to  brave  the   perils  of  space .   I t   testifies,  also,  to  the   extraordinary 
concer t  of  skills,  in  space  and  on  the ground ,  t h a t  goes into a moon 
mission. To the as tronau ts ,  a relieved Nation  says  ‘Welcome home .’  
To  them  and  to  those  on the  ground who  did  so magnificent  a job  of 
guiding  Apollo  13   safely  back  from  the  edge  of  e tern i ty ,   a  grateful 
Nation  says  ‘Well done.’  ” 
I n  proclamation  designating April  19 a s  national day  of  prayer and 
thanksgiving  for   safe  return  of  Apo l lo   I3  as tronau ts ,   President 
said:  “The   imperiled  flight and  safe return  of  the  crew of  Apollo  13 
were  even ts   th a t   humbled  and  inspired  people  all  over  the   world. 
We were  humbled by  the  knowledge tha t   in  this stage  of  man’s ex-  
ploration  of  space ,   a  safe  splashdown of  an   imperiled  mission  is in 
i ts  way  a s  successful a s  a landing on and s a f e  return  from t h e  Moon. 
We were  inspired  by  the courage  of  the  c rew ,  the  devotion and  skill 
of the  members of  the  NASA  team on  the ground and by  the offers of 
assistance from nations around  the  world.” 
President  spoke   with  Apollo  13  as tronau ts   by   telephone  from 
White House   to  U.S.S.  Iwo Jima  in  Pacific.  He told  them  he  would 
like t o  present them  the  Presidential Medal of  Freedom  in Hawaii on

RASA  held  series of  three   Apo l lo   13 post-recovery  press   conferences  
at  MSC  hosted  by  NASA   Administrator,  manned  space   flight  officials, 
and  technical  specialists.  Dr .   Thomas  0 .  Paine,  NA SA   Administra- 
to r ,   said  although  mission  “mus t   be  recorded  a s   a   fa i lure ,   there’s 
never  been  a   more  prideful  moment  in  the   space   program.”  Most 
impressive  aspec t   of  mission  was  “ tremendous   effectiveness  in 
team work of  ou r  ground  suppor t  operation  . . .  . From  every  s ta te  
.  . . we’ve  had  people.  . . working  to   b a c k s to p - th e   many  d d -

in   a  fa r   shor ter   period  of  time  than  we’d  ever   though t   possible  be-I 
fore  .” 
Dr. George M .   Low ,   NA SA  Deputy Administrator,  said  basic pro- 
cedures  used  for  every  phase  of  mission were  predetermined.  “Fo r  
examp le ,  the burn made  behind  the moon  .  . . was a  s tandard  emer-  
gency burn  that would  be used  in  case   the  service propulsion system 
would  not  work  on   a   normal  lunar  mission  going  into  lunar  orb i t .  
Each one of  these  s teps  had been  predetermined  and also simulated. 
But  putting  them  all  together  into  a   sequence   of  s tep s   .  . . and  
working ou t  some of  the  detailed  procedures   on  how  to  save  power 
and how  to  save  ba t ter ies ;  how  to   save  wa ter ;  those   things were de-  
termined during the course  of  the flight,  both by  the  men  . . . on the

“social  levelers  of  the New  Le f t”   would  seize  on  Apollo  13 near- 
disaster  to  demand  space  budget  be  “soaked  down  into  the  neares t

of  “fa ir  weather fr iends”   of  space  program who were “readying  the  
life-boats for  a  quick exit.”  (Hope ,  W   Star, 4/18/70, A2)  
U.S.  reaction  to  Apollo 13’s  successfu l  splashdown: 
Sign at  MSC was  changed from  “Our  hear ts  are  with the  Apollo  13

observed  tha t   mission  had  not  been  complete  fa i lure .   Spacecraf t  
had gone around moon-feat 
tha t  would have  caused  sensation  two  
years  before.  Dr. Thomas  0. Paine,  NASA Administrator,  said  later 
in  day ,   “I’m  a   little  tired  and  bedraggled  but  I’m  feeling  10  or   20 
years younger than I did yes terday .”  
In  New  York ,   thousands  watched  recovery  on  giant  TV screen  at

and Fred  W .   Ha ise ,   J r . ,  described  their  initial  reaction  to  Apollo  13 
accident  to   press  a t   MSC .   Lovell  explained:  “Fred   was  still  in  the  
lunar  module,  Jack   was  back  in  the  command  module  in  the   left- 
hand  sea t ,   and  I  was  halfway  in  between  the  lower  equipment 
bay.  . .when all  three  of  us  heard  a rather  large  bang,  jus t  one bang. 
Now ,   before  tha t ,   Fred .   . .had  actuated  a  valve  which  nominally 
gives  u s  the   same  sound.  . .so when this bang came we  really  didn’t 
get concerned  right  away ,  bu t   I looked u p   a t  Fred  and  Fred  had  tha t  
expression  like  it  wasn’t  his  fau l t ,   and  we  suddenly  realized  tha t  
something else had occurred ,  but exactly what we didn’t  know.” 
Swigert  said  he  had  fe l t   vibration  accompanying  bang  and  then  
noticed  master alarm and  main bus B  undervolt light.  “ I  transmitted 
to  Hous ton   tha t   we  had  a problem  and   proceeded  t o .   . .look  a t  the  
voltage.  . .[which] a t  that  time was  completely  normal.  . . .” Swigert 
thought bang  had  occurred  in  LM   and  Ha ise ,   in  L M ,   thohght  i t  had 
occurred in CM. 
Lovell said  his first  impression was  “ tha t  we had had  an electrical 
problem tha t  caused  this bang.  . . . That quickly went  away and then 
I  looked  ou t  the  window  and   saw  this  venting and  my  concern  was 
increasing all  the   time.  I t  wen t   from  I wonder  what  this  is going to  
do to  the  landing to  I wonder  if  we  can get back  home  again. I t  was 
apparent.  . .that the  only way to  survive the  situation was to  transfer  
to  the  L M .  , . .”

lined to  you.  . . .” Dr.  Paine  said  Pres iden t  Nixon  ‘‘fully  shares  this 
view .” (Testimony) 
Dr .   Petrone  testified:  “This  long  arduous   voyage  continuously 
presented  the   challenge to  balance  the   spacecraf t   systems  required 
to  perform  necessary  func t ions  against  the  availability  of  consuma-  
bles,  of  wa ter ,  electrical  power,  oxygen ,   and the   lithium  hydroxide 
to   remove  the   carbon   dioxide.  The   op t ions   available  to   flight  and 
ground  crews  in  every   case   permitted  accep tab le   courses  of  action 
to  be  selected.  During  this  emergency  situation,  the   remaining  sys- 
tems  performed  in  an  outstanding  manner  meeting  the   unusual  de- 
mands  placed  upon  them.  At  the  same  t ime ,   the   flight  and  ground 
crews  demonstrated  exceptional  confidence in meeting  these  se t s  of 
unusual c ircums tances .”  
Mission ended with  “ se t   of  consumables which  were within abou t  
two percent of  what we had predicted  back a t  63 hours  or  abou t  sev-  
en hours af ter  the  problem  occu r red ,”   Lunney   told  Committee.  “If  
the  consumable pos ture .   . .had  worsened  or   if  we  had  absorbed  an-  
other failure.  . .we would have had to  resor t  t o  scheduling communi- 
cation  times  with  the  crew.”  Although  probably  within  12 hours  to  
24  of  running  ou t   of  most critical  consumab le ,  wa ter ,   “had  we  pro- 
ceeded  into.  . .duty  cycling  the  communications  gear  onboa rd ,   we 
probably  could have  stretched  tha t  period.” 
Astronaut  Lovell  described  crew’s  feelings  during  crisis:  “We 
soon realized  tha t  our  only hope of  survival was t o  go into Aquarius, 
power up  its  sys tems   and  use  the   sys tems   and  the  consumables  on 
board.  . .for  a  re turn   home.  And  it was  here  tha t   we  realized  tha t   it 
was  now  a   case   of  survival.”  Spacecraf t   was  on  tra jec tory   tha t  
“would  have  en tered   u s   in  a   sor t   of  permanent  orb i t ,   some  . 
230.  .  .thousand  miles  [370000 km] in   apogee ,   and  maybe  a   thou- 
sand  [1600  km]  or  so  in  pe r igee . .   . . Again,  the  ground  came 
through ,  and gave us.  . . the  free  tra jec tory  burn ,  which was required 
to  get us back to ear th .   M y  main  concern a t  this point was t o  get this 
spacecraf t  back within  the  ear th’s  a tmosphere .”   (Transcript)

Nation’s to ta l   scientific  research   effort by at  least 30%.  If  cu tbacks

gravitational  field  and  similar  solid-earth  phenomena:  discovery  of 
general  circulation  of  ocean s  a t  all  dep ths ;   increased  knowledge of 
how  ear thquakes  occur ;   improved  understanding  of  global hea t  bal-

Failure  of  Governmen t  to   define  priorities  in  science  and  technology 
and  stay  with  them  was  one   cause  of  unemployment  among scien-

Atomic  Scientists.  Cutback  in  civilian  space   program  was  prime 
example:  “The  consequences  of  this re trenchmen t  in the  dissipation

of  earth’s geagraphy  and a tmosphere ,  research  into  “physical  proc-

Launch   and  pictures  of  crew  in  spacecraf t   were  televised  in  Mos-

Five  hours  af ter   liftoff  Tass   reported  cosmonau ts   were  “coping 
well  with  conditions  of  weightlessness  and  carrying  ou t   the   flight 
program.”  Only anomaly had  been  dirtying of  windows from engine

were  functioning normally  and Nikolayev  had  begun  “experiments 
linked with the investigation  of  human  peculiarities  as an element of 
the control system  in different dynamic opera t ions .”  
Tass   issued  daily  bulletins  that  described  routine  of  space  flight 
chores  and  experiments:  “While  one   cosmonau t   runs  a  vacuum 
cleaner, the other brews  coffee  or shaves .”   Cosmonau ts  performed 
s trenuous  physical  exercises  each  day  in  special  “load  suits,’’  prac- 
ticed  manual maneuvers  of  spacecraf t ,   and photographed  ear th   and

flight-record 
for  man-hours  in  space  in  Soviet  space  program- 
with  all  systems  functioning  satisfactorily  and  with  crew  demon-  
strating it  could  “withstand  well  the  complex  impact  of  the   fac tors  
of  space   flight  and  retain  high  efficiency.”  Insomnia,  only  problem 
reported  by crew ,  had  been overcome.

by  combustion of  insulation  in  the   space  surrounding  the  tank  blew

landing gear design  system was   “based  on  good  engineering princi- 
ples  backed  by  adequa te  te s t s  and   is basically  sound” ;   landing  gear 
problems  tha t   had  occurred   could  be   related  t o   large  number  of

0  Possible  pollution  of  s tra tosphere   by   SST was  discussed  in  Science: 
“An  environment issue tha t  has been intensifying in recen t  weeks  is

by  the  SST could produce  significant  environmental changes .”   Most 
meteorologists  agreed  gaseous  exhau s t   produc ts   o ther   than   water 
would  presen t  no  special problems. Water was  “mo ie   likely  t o  be   a 
problem  because  s tra tospher ic   water  concen tra t ions   are   generally 
low  a s  the   result of  condensation  in  the  troposphere.’’  Water  accu-  
mulated in  troposphere   could  change radiation balance of  ea r th ;  ini-

flected  into  space ;   or  lead  t o   decrease   in  o.zone  concen tra t ion   of 
s tra tosphere ,   “ thereby   allowing more  ultraviolet  radiation t o   reach

“The  General Accounting Office has  reported  to  me  that  the Fair- 
child Hiller Corp. may  not have been  accorded  an  equal oppor tun i ty  
to  submit a winning bid  because  of  a one-week extension granted  to  
General Electric who turned in  the lower bid. 
“At  the  time  the   award  was  made,  this  time  disparity  was  not

single detail tha t   Fairchild’s  pioposal  was  submitted  one  week ea r -  
lier  than  ours .   . . .both  parties  had  the   opportunity  to   inform  NA SA  
when  they  could  submit  their  proposal  and  both  parties  responded

could  have  been  used  unfairly  by  General  E lec tr ic  by  our   learning 
our   competitor’s  price  and  changing  ours   is  a  shocking allegation. 
No  such  ‘leak’ occurred ,   and  the  GAO   report  specifically  s ta tes   tha t  
there is no evidence to  support tha t  allegation.”  Fink said fac t s  were 
“ tha t   both  parties competed  hard  fo r   this  important  space program

1969:  “ I  really  had  hoped ,  I th ink ,  tha t  the  impac t  [of  lunar landing] 
would  be  more  far-reaching  than  it  has  [been].  I  had  hoped  tha t   it

f ron t  side  when  it’s.  . m o r e  easy  to   provide  a viable  solution  and a 
meaningful one .”  
While  scientific  discoveries  resulting  from  Apollo  11 had  been 
numerous and were  still continuing, Armstrong fe l t   “actual  discov- 
e ry ,  or  revelation,  was  tha t  man  could  in  fac t  live  on  the  moon  in  a 
ra ther  normal  fash ion .”   This was  “necessary   key to  all  fu ture  plans 
for  the  use  of  our   natural  satellite, whatever  they may  be  and how- 
ever they might develop.” 
Armstrong  described  his  feelings  in  looking  a t   moon  from 
ear th :   “ I   see the  moon from the  back yard a s  a friendly  place.  And I 
see a lot  of  landmarks.  I can  no  longer  look  at it  just a s  a spo t  in  the  
sky ;  bu t ,   ra ther ,   I actually  pick  ou t ,  of  cou r se ,  the  Sea  of  Tranqnili- 
ty ,  Clavius, Ar is tarchus ,  and places  I know and have flown by .”  
Asked  if  he  expected  to   fly  in  space  aga in ,  Armstrong said,  “I’d 
be  surprised  if  I  don’t have  the   option  of  buying  a  ticket.”  (Tran-

Dr. Lee  A .  DuBridge, Director of  OST and Presidential Science Advis- 
e r ,  testified  before   House  Committee on  Science and Astronautics’ 
Subcommittee on  Sc ience ,  Research ,  and Development on need  fo r  
adequate  Federa l   science  policy:  “Science  and 
technology 
policy.  . m u s t  be  formulated on  an evolutionary bas is ,  continuously 
under  review  and  sub jec t   to  change  with  changing  conditions.  I t  
must be  a policy  tha t  can be  implemented  both by   the  Aministration 
and  by  Congress  and   one   which will  be  supported  by  the   public.” 
Policy  should  provide  “strong  base  of  sc ience”   and  “mechanisms 
fo r  using  science and  technology  t o  meet  changing problems  of  na- 
tional  concern .”   I t   should “recognize  tha t  policies and even ts  whol- 
ly outside the field of  science and technology may  strongly  influence 
our  R&D expenditure level.” 
Dr.  DuBridge  told  Subcommittee  some  of  nation’s  “most  valua- 
ble  and productive  research   pro jec ts”   had  been  lost  because  of  FY  
1970 amendment  to   DOD  appropriation  bill  which  banned  defense-

Keldysh  said  Soyuz  IX  had  provided foundation  for  new  missions 
of  more  than  30  days ,   “quite  long  enough  for   a  long-term  orbital

I faced  up  to  the  job   in the  Space  Agency.  . .there were  two  ma jor  
responsibilities.  . . .  One.  . .was 
the   meeting 
of 
the  
commitment.  . .[to]  land  on   the   Moon  within  the   decade .   . .and 
the  second was to  lay  ou t  the  post-Apollo program  which would fql- 
low.  . . . The   action  tha t  was  taken   yesterday  by  the  Congress  in 
conference ,   which  essentially  gave  us  more  than  ninety-eight  per- 
cen t   of  the   monies  tha t   the   Pres iden t   had  approved  fo r   the   1971 
budget,  bu t   more  importantly  followed  a  very  intensive  review  by 
Congress of  the  proposals  we  had  made fo r   the  new  space  program 
of  the   seven t ies ,  in  many ways  represen ts   a  major  s tep   forward   in

Apollo program  and  secure   initial approval  fo r  it  in  the  Administra-

was on  solid  founda t ion ,   and would probably be  funded  by Govern-

facing NASA  in FY 1972 budget a s  fu tu re  of  Apollo program ,  particu-

published  by  Journa l   of Aircraft:  “As  the   airplane  becomes  larger, 
fa s te r ,  and a s  a resu l t ,  more comp lex ,  the  balance between  inheren t  
aerodynam ic  stability and stability provided  through  au toma t ic  sys-

Sen .  Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) writing  in  Aerospace  dismissed ecologi- 
cal  arguments  against  SST  program:  Grea tes t   single  consideration 
“in  America’s  Superson ic   Transpor t   program  is   technological: 
Whe ther   the   United  S ta te s  will  con t inue   t o   maintain  its  dom inan t  
position  in the  deve lopmen t  and production of  commercial t ran spo r t  
a ircraf t  fo r   the  world-with 
all  tha t   this  means  t o  the   health  of  the  
domes t ic  economy  and   U.S.  position  in  international.markets.”  In 
nex t  two decades ,   level of  the  world’s commercial airline traffic was 
expec ted  to  rise  to  six times a s  high.  SST was  “logical. and inevitable 
s tep  forward to  meet  the  demands  of  this new volume  of  air travel- 
regardless of  who  builds  it.”  (Aerospace ,  7 /70 ,3-5)  
*  Interview  with  Dr.  John   S.  Fo s te r ,  J r . ,   DOD Director  of  Defense  Re- 
search   and  Engineering, was  reported  by  Air  Force  and Space  Di- 
gest. Dr.  Fos ter   believed  U.S.  held  considerable  lead  over  U.S.S>R. 
in basic  space technology and application of  tha t  technology to  m i l i -  
tary  requirements.  U.S.  programs  in  communications,  mapping, 
warning, surveillance, wea ther ,   and  o ther   activities related  t o  mili- 
tary  had been extremely rewarding.  In  manned military  space  opera-  
tions,  “we  will  come  to  realize tha t  there  are  military  needs  in space  
tha t  canno t   be  accomplished w i thou t  placing  much  larger  payloads 
in orbit.”  (AFISD ,  7/70,31-6) 
European   space  accomplishments  were  reviewed  in  Sc ience  Journal: 
ESRO was evolving a s  cen ter  fo r  scientific  and applications satellites 
and was  interested  in developing satellites fo r  meteorology, naviga- 
t ion ,   and  air  traffic  control.  Less   successfu l   had  been  European  
efforts to   obtain  independence  in  satellite launching  through  ELDO .  
U.S.  had  introduced  new  element  in to   European   deliberations  by 
inviting  collaboration  in  post-Apollo  program.  “So   fa r   the   U.S. 
S ta te   Depar tmen t   has   ruled  against  the   purchase   of  American 
launch vehicles  fo r  European   commercial ven tures ,   such   as  the  re- 
gional communications satellite. This could  be  changed by  coopera-  
tion  in  the  post-Apollo  programme. Eu r op e   could  reserve   the   right 
to   buy   boos ters   fo r   any   non-military  application.”  Co s t   might  be  
problem  since “second  league nations toge ther  spend  approximate-

Sep tembe r  2:  NASA  FY   1971  interim  opera t ing   plan  news  conference  
was held  in Washington, D.C. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NA SA  Adminis- 
t ra to r ,  said principal  decision  was “how  bes t  to  carry   ou t  the Apollo 
and o ther  existing programs to  realize maximum benefits  from them 
while  preserving  adequa te   resources  fo r   the   fu ture .   . . . In  our  dis- 
cuss ions ,  it  became  clear  that  the vitality  of  our  national space  pro- 
gram  depends  on  a   determined  and  vigorous  continuation  of  plans 
for   a   reusable  space   shuttle  followed  by  a   space   station  in  the 
manned  flight  program”;  early  development  of  ERTS,  ATS,  and 
HEAO ;   Grand  Tour   unmanned  flights  t o   d is tan t   p lane ts ;   unmanned 
Viking Mars  landers;  Pioneer  flights to   Venus,  Mercury ,   and  Jupi- 
ter ;  and  “a  healthy aeronautical research  program .” 
“With  all  of  these  considerations  in  mind.  . .actions  have  been 
taken that  will  effectively  reduce NASA ’S  FY   1971 budget reques t  of 
$3.333 billion  to  an  interim  operating plan  of  $3.2687 billion.  . .and 
to  minimize  NASA ’ s   budgetary  requirements  fo r   fu tu re   years .”  
Budget  request  fo r   Apollo  was  being  reduced  by  $42.1  million  to  
$914.4 million  by  canceling Apollo  15  and  19  lunar  missions  and by 
phasing down manpower  levels  a t  major  Apollo  facilities more  rap- 
idly.  Although  Lunar   and  Planetary  Missions  Board  and  NAS -NRC  
Space   Science  Board  had  strongly  recommended ,  af ter   special  re- 
view,  that  NASA  carry   ou t   all  six  remaining  lunar  landing  missions, 
NA SA   had  “most  reluctantly concluded  tha t  a  reduction.  . .should be  
made.”  Remaining  Apollo  missions  would  be  redesignated  14 
through  17  and  would  be   flown  before  s ta r t  of  Skylab  operations  in 
November  1972.  Schedule  would  allow  additional  flexibility  by 
providing Apollo hardware  fo r  possible  use  in Sky lab ,  space  s ta t ion ,  
or o ther  programs where manned opera t ions  or heavy boos t  capabil- 
ity would  be  required.  Advanced  mission  studies would be  reduced 
by $1 million. 
Tracking  and  da ta   acquisition  network  opera t ions  would  be  re- 
duced $8 million by  reducing number of  manned flights and by more 
rapid  phasedown  in  operating  levels.  Construction  of  facilities 
would  be  reduced  to   $25  million  by  deferring  Polymer  Research 
Labora tory   at  ARC,  Calibration  Labora tory   a t  MSC,  and  Multispec- 
tral  Photo  Labora tory   a t   MSFC and  by  rehabilitation  and  modifica- 
tion  effort  and  facility planning  and  design.  Research  and  program 
management  minimum  operating  budget  would  be  established  a t  
$678.7 million,  amoun t   included  in  previous  appropr ia t ions  bill  and 
$13.6 million below  NASA ’ s  FY   1971 reques t .  
Dr.  Paine  said  NASA  had  concluded  “ tha t   it  is  pruden t  and  realis- 
t ic .   . . to  make these  decisions now.  . . to  avoid more  dras t ic  and dis- 
ruptive  actions which  would  result  if  the  decisions  were  postponed 
until  later  in the fiscal year .  We  also no  longer  have the  capability to  
prepare   in  parallel  two  Apollo spacecraf t ,   as  would  be  required  to  
maintain an option  to  reach a  later decision on the  number of  Apollo

NA SA%  cancellation  of  Apollo  15 and  19:  Dr. Thomas  Gold, Cornel1 
Univ.  astronomer  and  member  of  President’s  Science  Advisory 
Comm i t tee ,  had  sa id ,  “It’s  like  buying  a Rolls-Royce and  then  not 
using it because you claim you can’t afford the gas.” 
Dr.  Harold  C .   U rey ,   lunar  exper t   and  Nobel  Prize  winner,  had 
said, “ I   think the American people  and Congress should  realize that 
the  moon  is  an  extremely  old  ob jec t .   .  .this  gives  scientists a way 
of  studying an  ob jec t  that goes back t o  the  very beginning of  the  so- 
lar  sys tem .”   Saving  of  $40  million  by  cancellation  was  “chicken 
feed”   in view  of  $25 billion  already spent on Apollo program. 
Former   scientist-astronaut  Dr.  Brian  T .  O’Leary  said,  “The   sci- 
entific community has become disenchanted with N A S A .  The  presen t  
decision seems ridiculous.”  (NYT ,  9 /4 /70 ,9)

tha t  too   much  money  was  being diverted  from  urgent  social needs. 
But now  tha t  these huge  sums  have  been  spen t  the  need  is to  obtain 
the  maximum  yield,  scientifically  and  otherwise,  from  t h a t  invest- 
ment. Sure ly ,  N A S A ,  which  has been able to reach  th e  moon ,  can find 
a better  solution  than  the one  now  offered  for  adjusting  to austerity 
in  space  research.  One desirable  alternative would  be   LO enlist  for- 
eign  resources  in  the exploitation  of  Apollo  technology,  perhaps by 
offering to send  teams of  British,  French  o r  Soviet as tronau ts  on the

At  meeting on  fu tu re  of  Apollo,  scientists proposed  cra ter  Tycho  
near  moon’s  sou th   pole  and  Descar tes ,   hilly  region  near  Ocean   of 
S torms ,   as  s i tes   fo r   two  of  remaining  four   Apollo  program  lunar 
landings.  Cal  Tech  geologist  Dr .   Leon  T .   Silver  sa id ,   “If  you  had 
only two missions  left to  make,  you’d  send  one  of  them  to  Tycho .”  
Tycho   offered  samples  from  area   of  one   of  last  collisions of  large 
meteor  with  lunar  su r face ,   samples  from  moon’s  original  sou thern  
hills,  and samples from  deep within  moon  tha t   had  come to  surface  
a f te r  impact tha t  had  crea ted  Tycho .   Flight  path  to  and  from  Tycho  
would enable a s t ronau t s  to  photograph  and examine almost half  vis- 
ible face  of  moon  from  lunar  orb i t .  As tronau ts  could  leave scientific 
ins trumen ts  less than  1609 km  (1000 mi) from  moon’s.south  pole,  to  
give earth-bound  sc ien t is ts  listening  post  on  lunar  region  tha t  would 
otherwise  go  unexp lored .   Surveyor  V I I   photos  had  shown  Tycho  
landing  to  be  s trewn   with  many  varieties  of  rocks .   Difficulty  with 
Tycho  landing was  tha t  Apollo crew might have t o  use  so much fuel 
getting  to  it  tha t   they  would  not  have   enough  to   re turn   if  they   en-  
countered  difficulty  on  approach ,   As tronau t   Char les   M .   Duke,  Jr., 
said. Donald K .   S lay ton ,  MSC Chief  of  Flight  Crew Opera t ions ,  said 
NASA  was  studying possibility  of  Tycho   landing:  “Our   position  so

Tycho  becomes a cand ida te  fo r  landing.”

be one  of  two  A  0110  sites where  moonquakes  might be  occurring; 
Dr. Alfred E.  Ringwood of  Australian  National Un iv .  told seminar 
he  had  concluded from  s tudy  of  Apollo  1 1  and  12 lunar samples tha t  
moon once  had hea t  source  160-480 km  (100-300 m i)  benea th  su r face  
tha t  was emitting  1500 K  (2200°F) tempera tures .  Hea t  had  emana ted  
from  abundance  of  rad ioac t ive  minerals  in  moon’s  dep th s ,  he   pro- 
posed ,  and partially  melted moon’s inner  rock ,  which  then flowed to  
lunar  surface   through  pores  or  forced  its way  upward  a s   it expand-  
ed  where pores   did  not  ex is t .  Upswelling  rock ,  Dr .   Ringwood  sa id ,  
caused  lunar  fea tures   visible  on   moon’s  face .   He   specu la ted   tha t  
moon  had  lost most of  its radioactivity and heat 2 billion  yrs earlier. 
Dr.  Char les   P.  Sonne t t ,   ARC  scientist,  said  he   had  found   “little 
bumps”   of  magnetism  along  lunar  surface   when  studying  signals 
from  ins trumen ts   left  on   moon.  Bumps  suggested  tha t   radioactive 
hea t  was  coming to   surface  and  causing par ts  of  moon  to  behave  as  
if  they  had  magnetic field.  Moon  was  “s trong   and   rigid  to   dep th  of 
200 m i   (322 km],” Dr. Sonne t t  sa id ,  “bu t   I believe  that  all  you need  is 
a  porosity  of  abou t   10 per  c en t  in  tha t   crus t   t o  have   a warmer  and 
more plastic  material  leak to  the  top .”  
Dr.  Rolf  Meisner  of  Un iv .   of  Hawaii  said  analysis  of  da ta  from  
Apollo  12 lunar  seismometer  led  him  to   believe  tha t   moonquakes 
could  not  be   caused  by  breaks   in  moon’s c ru s t  but  were  caused  by 
warm  gases  escaping  from  beneath  lunar  surface   in  response  to  
earth’s  increased  gravitational  pull.  He   had  recorded   14  moon- 
quakes ,   all  of  which  seemed  t o   come  from  abou t   240  km  (150 m i )  
eas t-sou theas t  of  seismometer  in  Fra  Mauro  hills, where   Apollo  14 
was to  land in February   1971. 
Dr.  Thomas   Go ld ,   Cornel1 Un iv .   as tronomer ,   argued  tha t   lunar 
maria contained dus t  and no t  lava.  Lack of  electrical activity  of  sur- 
face  material and  the  way  Apollo moonquake de tec to r s  had  reac ted  
to  tremors  and   impacts could  mean  there was  deep  depos i t  of  pow- 
der. Acoustical signal from  Apollo 12 lunar  se ismome ter  was “com- 
patible  with  a deep  layer of  a  very  homogenous na ture   in which  the  
speed of  sound  is uniform.”  (O’Toole,  W Post, 9 /12 /70 ,  A3; 9 /13 /70 ,

Science  by  Dr.  Foy  D.  Koh ler ,   former   U.S.  Ambassador  to  
U.S.S.R.,  and  Dr.  Dodd  L .   Ha rvey ,   both  of  Univ.  of  Miami:  Pro- 
grams  had  been  roughly  equal  in  complexity  and  in  input  of  re- 
sources .   “ I f ,   as  has  been  a s se r ted ,  the  U.S.  moon undertaking  rep- 
resented  a   task  equal  in  technological  complexity  to   the   total  of  all 
the  grea t  tasks  performed by man  from  the  building  of  the  pyramids 
through explosion of  the  atom bomb ,  hardly  less can be  said of  Sovi- 
e t  space  en terpr ise .”   Soviet investment  in  space program  had  been 
comparable  to   tha t   of  U S . ,   “if  no t   substantially  grea ter .”   Both 
programs  had  depended  for  success   on  effective  organization  and  
use  of  existing  organizations  and  exper t ise   and  bo th   had  required 
extensive  organizational  and  administrative  innovations  and  new 
management  techniques.In  both  programs  most  of  basic  scientific 
knowledge  and  technology  already  ex is ted .   Organization  and  man- 
agement had  been complicated by  necessity of  serving both military 
and  nonmilitary  ob jec t ives   and  by  pressures  of  diverging  national 
in teres ts .  Both  programs represented  “organizational  triumphs of  a  
high  order .”   Aspect  of  US. moon  landing  now  generally forgo t ten  
was  “ tha t   a   number  of  knowledgeable  people  were  convinced  it 
could not be done .”  
Programs differed  in  that  “ to  the   Soviet regime.  . . the  name of  the  
game in  space  has been   ‘the sys tem ,’  not scientific and technological 
excellence as   such .”   In  U.S.,  National Aeronautics  and  Space  Act 
“reflected  the  operation  of  the  represen ta t ive  process  a t  what could 
be  called  its best.”  I t s  provisions “sub jec ted   space  activities to  con -  
tinuing  congressional con tro l   in  accord  with  long-established  proc-  
esses .”   U.S.  space   effort  represen ted   “new  so r t   of  par tnersh ip  
between  governmen t ,   indus try ,   and  universities.  . . a   par tnersh ip  
that  has  benefited  and   strengthened  each   of  the   par t ic ipan ts  with- 
ou t  impinging on their in teres ts  and integrity.”

Soviet space effort had  had  less  impact on  national  economy than 
had  U.S.  effort.  Soviet  sources   had  revealed  continuing  shortcom- 
ings  in  computer  technology  and  hardware  upon  which  space  pro- 
gram  was dependent.  Soviet scientists and technologists not directly 
engaged in space program did  not receive d irec t  knowledge of  space  
program’s  technical  discoveries  and  innovations  and  were  denied 
use of  research  tools  and  techniques employed.  “The  Sov ie ts  them- 
selves  are   evidencing  increasing  agitation  over  their  inability  to  
match  the  United  S ta tes   in  transferring  ‘great  prestige’  and  ‘great 
accomplishments’  in  science  and  technology to   meet  the   general 
needs  of  society.”  Authoritative  s ta temen t   indicated  U.S.S.R. 
in- 
tended to  triple  space expenditures  in  next  few  years ,  while  in U.S. 
“prevailing  national  mood  seems   t o  be  moving  strongly  against  in- 
vestments  for   the  future  in  favor   of  maximum  utilization  of  re- 
sources for the  immediate  be t termen t  of  conditions of  life.” 
This  raised  ques t ion ,   “Ha s   the   whole  operation  represented  bu t  
another  highly  successful  one-shot  exercise  in  crisis  management, 
or has  it  represented  incorporation  into American  society  of  a new 
way  to  organize,  systematically and purposefully,  the  development 
and  use  of  scientific  and  technological  resources  to   the  fur therance  
of  national  goals?”  (Sc ience ,  9/11/70, 1049-56)

After  collecting  lunar  samples and  performing o ther   undisclosed 
experiments, Luna XVI l if ted   off  from  moon.  It had  spen t  26 hrs  25

was the  “solution  of  a radically  new  task-automatic  unmanned de-  
livery of  lunar  ground  to  earth.’’  Samples, Tass  sa id ,  were obtained

“bridge to  ou r  fu tu re  in space.”  Space  shu t t le  would be  
“ N A S A ’ s  major single effort during the  nex t  ten  years.”

would  off se t   termination  of  Sa tu rn   V  a f te r   completion  of  Apollo 
lunar  landings  by  1972.  Sky lab   program  schedu led   t o   s ta r t   during 
1973 would provide basis fo r  final design of  space  s ta t ion .  Integrated

“The   space   in  orbit  two   hundred   miles  [320 km]  above  the   ear th  
can be  thought of  as  a  vast  new  con t inen t ,   equa l  in  a rea  t o  th e  sur-

world  source  of  global information  and communication  serv ices  and 
then ,   inevitably,  a s  a  new  home  of  men  from  ea r th .”   Beyond  solar 
system, au toma ted  and manned  astronomical probes  would  “ex tend  
our understanding  of  the universe  through more  intensive investiga- 
tions  in  optical  and  radio  as tronomy   and  space   physics.”  Before 
cen tury’s  end ,  man  might find  answers  t o  “ the   overwhelming ques- 
tions of  man’s origin,  his des t iny ,  and of  his uniqueness  as  the  bear-

Prof .   Oleg G .   Gazenko ,   D irec tor   of  Soviet  Ins t i tu te   of  Biomedical 
Problems,  said  selection of  c rew s  for   longer  space  missions would 
require special personality testing to  identify persons  of  more domi- 
nan t  type fo r  assignment of  roles compatible with tha t  tra i t .  Dr.  Ber- 
ry  said  he   thought  use  of  multinational  flight  crews   was  good  idea 
but chances   fo r  Orbiting International  Labora tory   (OIL)  in  near  fu-

discussed  flashes  of  light  experienced  by  a s t ronau t s   in  space  with 
eyes   closed  or   in  darkened   spacecraf t .   Dr.  Berry  believed  flashes 
might be  produced  by heavy  cosmic ray  particles-atomic  nuclei  of 
intermediate weight-that  produced  ionization in ey e  re t ina ,   affec t-  
ed nervous  sy s tem ,  or  caused   light  flashes  within eye   fluid. Dr .  Ga- 
zenko   said  heavy   cosmic  ray s   were  insufficiently  frequen t   to   ac- 
coun t  fo r  flashes. Soviet cosmonau ts  had no t  exper ienced  phenome-

more intensive exercise program might be needed fo r  flights t o  o ther  
planets, with simulation  of  grav i ty  included. Cosmonau ts  fe l t  effects 
of  weightlessness  were  no t  dangerous  unless  exper ienced   fo r  more 
than one  month.  Soyuz IX cosmonau ts  displayed  photos  of  June  2 
launch and colored films taken  inside  spacec ra f t  dur ing  18-day orb i t .

bothered  previous  cosmonau ts   and  a s t ronau t s   on   early  par t   of

cosmonau ts  s lep t ,  exerc ised ,  and  played  chess ;   cen tra l  module with 
three  windows  and   couches  fo r  use   in liftoff  and  reen try ;   and  third

from statistical cons idera t ions  i t  can  be judged tha t  the  agreement of

there  are  technological problems tha t  we a re  qualified  t o  tack le ;  and 
there   are   areas   where  space   technology,  and  the   applications  of

meter and  mechanical proper t ies  of  lunar  soil and transportability of 
vehicle  were  investigated.  .In  addition,  Tass   said,  “an  instrument 
was used  which  has a punch   for soil in trus ion ,  and a  system of  sen- 
so r s   fo r   measuring  forces   acting  on  the   wheels.”  Panoramic  pic-

Influence  of  high-altitude  a ircraf t   on   s tra tospher ic   ozone   by  adding 
water vapor  from  exhaus ts  was  predicted  in  Sc ience  by  Boeing Co.

water from  the  exhaus ts  of  pro jec ted  fleets of  s tra tospher ic  a i rc ra f t ,  
the ozone  column may  diminish  by  3.8 per  c en t ,  the  transmitted  so-

U.S.S.R.’s  Lunokhod  I, could  no t   explore  surfack  as  well  a s  men

In  1970 NAsAreviewed’priorities and redirected activities to  conform to  
new  national  goals  and  budgetary  res tra in ts   under  Nixon  Adminis-

from  drama t ic   successes   of  1960s  t o   new  plans  for   1970s  and  be- 
yond, with balanced  aeronautical and space  program. 
Major  administrative  even t   affecting  N A S A   was  resignation  of 
Administrator,  Dr.  Thomas   0. Paine,  effective Sep t .   15.  Dr.  Paine, 
who  had  been  nominated  NASA   Administrator  by  Pres iden t   Nixon 
March 5, 1969, returned  t o  General E lec tr ic  Co .  as  a  Vice Pres iden t .  
Dr .  George M .   Low  became  Acting  NASA  Administrator.  In March 
Dr .   Wernher  von  Braun ,   MSFC   D irec tor ,   was  sworn  in  as   Deputy 
Associate  Administrator  f o r  Planning,  and   in  May  NASA Planning 
Board  was established under  his d irec t ion  fo r  coord ina t ion  of  NASA

goals  and  ob jec t ives   announced  in  March .   Design,  deve lopmen t ,  
and  testing  for  Sky lab   program  wen t   forward  and  fabr ica t ion   of 
flight hardware was begun.  System charac ter is t ics  fo r  space  shu t t le ,  
key  element  in  program  for   la te   1970s, were  established  and  s tudy  
con t rac t s  were  let  fo r  vehicle  and engine. Program  definition  s tud ies  
for   space   station  neared  completion.  ERTS spacecraf t   design  was 
completed  and  a ircraf t   flights  tested  remot’e-sensing  dev ices   fo r  
gathering earth resources  da ta  from  space .  Two  flight  spacecraf t  for  
Mariner  Mars  ’71  missions  were  progressing  toward  final  testing. 
Mission design fo r  Grand  Tour  of  ou te r  planets  later  in decade  was 
completed  and  concep tua l  design of  key  elements of  spacec ra f t  es-  
tablished.  NASA   continued  aeronautical  and   space   s tud ies   in  con-

There was an  increase in  the  total  successful  launches-114 
against  110 
in  1969-and 
an  increase  in  total  payloads  orbited-I30 
against  124 in 
1969.  The   difference  between  launches  and  payloads  is  of  coursl:  ac-  
counted  for  by the multiple-payload launches (DOD ,   the  principal user of 
this  system in the past, made only 4 multiple  launches in  1970, orbiting a 
total of  8 payloads;  NA SA  also  made 4 multiple  launches  totaling  8 pay- 
loads;  the  U.S.S.R.,  whose  prev ious   multiple-payload  launch  was  in 
1965, made one  multiple  launch orbiting 8 payloads. 
Of the  1970 world  total,  the United  S ta tes  launched  28 boosters  carry-  
ing 36 payloads (contrasting with 40 and 54  in  1969). Of  these  totals,  DOD 
was  responsible  for   17 launches and  21 payloads. T h e  28  launches made 
the  lowest  U . S .   total  since  1960,  and  t h e   36  payloads  a r e   the  fewes t

The  year  was  marked  by   the Soviet  manned  accomplishments  of  So-

Apoflo  13 was  the   major  even t   on  the   1970 U.S.  space  ca lendar ,   but 
this  third  manned  lunar  landing  a t temp t   resulted  in  a  mission  failure. 
The  lunar  mission  was  aborted  following  a  serv ice ,  module  rup ture   and 
the  three-man  crew  employed  emergency  procedures  and  returned  t o  
ear th   a s   quickly  as  possible.  The   U.S.  also  successfully  completed  a

CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1970 

Th is  chronology  of  major  NASA  launches  in  1970  is  intended  to   prov-  
ide  an  accura te   and   ready  historical  reference ,   compiling and  verifying 
information previously sca t tered  in several sources .  I t  includes launches  
of  all  rocke t   vehicles  larger  than  sounding  rocke ts   launched  e i ther   by 
NASA or   under  “NASA   d irec t ion”   (e.g.,  in  1970 NASA   provided  vehicles 
and launch facilities and launched ComSa tCorp’s  th ree  In te lsa t  I11 sa te l-  
lites, E S S A ~ S  Noaa  I ,  NATO’s Na to   I ,  and  U .K . ’ s  Skyne t   B ,  a s   well  a s  
Australia’s  Oscar V and  USA’s Top0 I  as  secondary   pay loads ;  a lso ,   un- 
der a NASA  and University of  Rome agreemen t ,  an Italian team  launched 
a NA SA  satellite, Exp lorer  X L I I ,  from Italy’s San  Marco  platform off  the 
coas t   of  Kenya ,   on  NASA’s  Scou t   boos ter) .   NASA   sounding  rocke t  
launches  are   published  annually  in  Goddard  P ro jec t s   Summary:  SateJ- 
lites and Sounding Ro ck e t s .  
An  a t temp t  has been  made  to  classify performance  of  bo th   the   launch 
vehicle  and the  payload  and t o  summarize total resu l ts  in terms  of  prima- 
r y   mission.  Th ree  categories have   been  used  fo r  evaluating vehicle  per- 
( S ) ,  partially  successfu l  (P) ,  
formance   and  misston  results-successful 
and  unsuccessfu l   (U).  A  fou r th   ca tegory ,   unknown  (Unk) ,   has  been  
added fo r  payloads when vehicle malfunctions did no t  give the  payload a 
chance  to exerc ise  its main  experiments.  These  divisions are  necessarily 
arb i trary ;  many  of  the   resu l ts   canno t   be  neatly  categorized.  Also  they 
ignore  the  fac t   tha t  a  great deal  is   learned from  missions tha t  may  have 
been  classified  a s  unsuccessfu l .  
Date  of  launch  is  referenced   t o   local  time  a t   the   launch  site.  Open 
sources   were  u sed ,   verified  when  in  doub t   with  t h e   pro jec t   offices  in 
NASA Headquar ters   and  with  NASA  Cen ters .   For  fu r the r  information  on 
each   item,  see   Appendix  A  of  this  volume  and   t h e  en tr ies   in  the   main 
chronology as  referenced  in  the  index .  The  information  was compiled  in 
May  1971 by  Leonard  C.  Bruno of  the  Sc ience  and Technology Division 
of  the  L ibrary  of  Congress.

Appendix C 
CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT,  1970 

This  chronology  contains  basic  information  on  all  manned  space  
flights during  1970 and ,  taken  with Appendix  C to  the   1965, 1966,  1968, 
and  1969  editions  of  this  publication,  provides  a  summary   record  of 
manned  exploration  of  the  space  env ironmen t  through  1970. The   infor- 
mation was compiled  by Leonard  C .  Bruno of  the   Sc ience  and Techno l-  
ogy Division of  the  Library of  Congress. 
The  year  1970 marked  a sharp  down turn   i n  manned  space  flight. Con- 
trasting  with  1969, in  which  four   United  S ta tes   Apollo  flights  and  five 
U.S.S.R.  Soyuz  flights put a  record  23 men  in  space ,   1970 saw  only one  
Apollo  flight and one  Soyuz  flight place a total  of  5  men  in  space. 
The  three-man  Apo l lo   13 mission  failed  in  i ts   lunar  landing  a t temp t  
when  a  service  module  explosion  crippled  the   ship  on  its  way  t o   t h e  
moon.  Th e   lunar  mission  was  aborted  and  the  crew   immediately  em- 
ployed  emergency  procedures  t o  effect a  safe  return  to  e a r t h .  Using the  
lunar module  a s  a “lifeboat”  and  conserving  all  power  and  life  suppor t  
sys tems ,   the  spacecraf t   circled  th e   moon  and  returned  safely  to  e a r t h .  
But the third  U.S.  lunar landing mission  was  unsuccessful. 
Soyuz I X ,  the only  Soviet  manned  flight  of  the  y e a r ,  was  highly  suc- 
cessful. The  two-man crew orbited  the  ear th  for  nearly  18 day s  and  se t  a 
new  world  record  for   the  longest  manned  space  flight.  The   crew   per- 
formed  biological,  geological,  and  meteorological  exper imen ts .   The  
previous manned  space flight record  of  nearly  14 day s  in space was held 
by the U.S.  Gemini VZZflight of  December  1965. 
By  th e   end   of  1970, the  United  S ta tes   had  totaled  23  manned  space  
suborbital,  16 in ear th  o rb i t ,  3  in  lunar o rb i t ,  and 2 lunar land- 
flights-2 
ings-with  a  total  of  26  different  crewmen .   Of  the  26  American  as tro-  
nau ts ,   10 had  participated  in 2 flights e a c h ,  4 had  flown  three times, and  1 
had  flown  four   times.  The   Soviet  Union  had  conduc ted   16  manned 
flights, all in  earth orbit, with  22 cosmonau ts .  Four  cosmonau ts  had  flown 
twice each .  Cumulative totals fo r  manned  spacecraf t  hours   in  flight had 
reached  2446 hours and  5 1  minutes for   the United  S ta tes  and  1479 hours  
7  minutes  for   the  Soviet  Union.  Cumulative  total  man-hours  in  space  
were  6262  hours   42  minutes  for   the   United  S ta tes   and  2548  hours   45 
minutes for  the  U.S.S.R. 
Data on  U.S.  flights  are   the  latest  available  to   d a t e   within  NA SA .   AI- 
though  minor  details  are   sub jec t   to   modification  a s   d a t a   are   refined, 
major aspec ts  of  all U.S.  manned flights remain sub jec t  t o  direct observ-  
ation  by  interested  citizens  of  t h e   wor ld ,   with  a  significant  portion  of 
recent missions seen live on worldwide television.
