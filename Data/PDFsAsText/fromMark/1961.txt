FOREWORD 
A  chronicle of  scientific  and   technological events  in  th e  exploration 
of  space  offers  useful  perspective.  T o   those  of  us  engaged  in  these 
activities,  it  provides  an  inven tory   of  th e   crowded  kaleidoscope  of 
swift-moving domestic  and   foreign  events.  To  o thers   interested  in 
space exploration, it helps provide a sense of  pace and   a clearer aware- 
ness of  genuine achievements a s  well  as grea ter  things  to  come. 
Even t s   of  1961  are   mingled  with  th e   pas t   and   th e   fu ture .   Th e  
groundwork of  th is  year’s milestones was laid several years ago.  T h e  
scientific  discoveries  of  Explorers  I X ,   X,  and   X I I ;   th e   suborb i ta l  
Mercury  flights of  Alan B. Shepard and  Virgil  I. Grissom; th e  a t t a in -  
men t   of  neardes ign   speed  (mach  6 )   and   a l t i tude   (50  miles)  of  th e

weather forecastin  ; and  th e  successful f h t  flight of  t h e  Sa tu rn  booster 
of  1961.  T h e  decisions and  programs undertaken  this year  will  come 
to  fruition  in  th e  mon ths   and   years  ahead. 
Th e   na t iona l   character  of  th e   space  program  is  evidenced  in  t h e  
contributions  b y   American  indus try ,   t h e   scientific  community,  t h e  
m i l i tary   services,  and   o ther   Government  agencies.  Growing  public

Th i s  chronology  represents  b u t   a  first  s tep  in   th e  historical  process 
of  fully  recording  and   explaining  the   myriad  activities,  accomplish- 
men ts ,  and  problems of  the  Na t iona l  Aeronautics and  Space Adminis- 
tra t ion   in   the  exploration and   exploitation  of  space for  the   benefit  of 
all  mank ind .   It,  was  prepared  from  open  public  sources.  Since 
science  and   technology  are   fundamen ta l ly   indivisible,  events  of 
space-related  efforts  by   o ther   governmental  agencies  including  the  
Depa r tmen t  of  Defense, as well  as in terna t iona l  i tcms  of  a non-NASA 
charac ter ,   have  been  included  to   help  provide  the   fuller  context  of 
curren t   history.  We  are   appreciative  of  the   generous help  of  NASA 
offices  and   centers  and   interested  members  of  the   historical  com-

JANUARY   1961 
J a n u a r y   1: White  House  s ta temen t   of  President  Eisenhower  issued, 
s ta t ing  t h a t  “ the  early establishment of  a  communication satellite 
system  which  can  be  used  on  a   commercial  basis  is  a   na t iona l  
objective.” 
Project  Ice   Way   was  established  near  Thu le   by   t h e   Geo- 
physics Research D irec tora te  of  the  Cambridge Research Labora- 
tories  to   tes t   the   feasibility  of  land ing   heavy   a ircraf t   on  ice 
runways.  T h e   tes ts ,   completed  in  Ju n e   1961, demonstrated  th e  
s treng th   and   o ther   engineering qualities  of  th e   ice  runways  con- 
s truc ted   of  na tu ra l   sea water  or reinforced with  s t rand s  of  Fiber- 
glas. 
E a r l y  J a n u a r y :   Because of  the  danger  of  a   power  dra in   in  connection 
with  remote  ( tape  recorder)  operation,  the  wide-angle  camera  of 
Tiros  I1  was  turned   on  only  for  direct  readou t ,   while  satellite

of  th e   Japanese  M in is try   of  Communications  began  s tud ies   of 
space communications a t  NASA’s Goldstone, Calif.,  Deep  Space 
Tracking S ta t ion .  
J a n u a r y   10:  President-elect Kennedy  received repor t   of  special nine- 
man  committee on th e  na t iona l  space program.  Chairman of  the  
committee was Dr.  Jerome B. Wiesner  of  M IT .  
A  Polaris  missile  of  the   advanced  A-2  design  was  fired  from 
Cape  Canaveral  1,600  miles  down  th e   A t lan t ic   Missile  Range. 
It  was  the   th ird   success  in  as  many   firings  for  the   new  Polaris 
designed to  opera te  a t  a range over  1,700 miles.

the  airplane and  the  liquid-fuel  rocket-are  American  inventions. 
Ye t   in  each  case  their  first  application  was  made  by  o ther   na-

there  is no  inheren t   difference between  basic  military  and   non-

a  “world  war  in  the   age  of  mass  extermination.”  Among  basic 
proposals  for  waging  effective  peace,  he  urged  “keeping  nuclear 
weapons  from  seeding  new  battlegrounds  in  ou ter   space.” 
I n  
projecting  the   theme  t h a t   “ the   events  and   decisions  of  the   next 
10 mon ths   may   well  decide  the   fat’e of  man   of  the   next  10,000

“As we  extend  the  rule of  law on E a r t h ,  so mus t  we  also extend 
it  t o  man’s new  d om a i n - o u t e r   space. 
“All  of  us  salute  the   brave  cosmonauts  of  the   Soviet  Union. 
T h e   new  horizons  of  ou ter   space  mus t   no t   be  riven  by  the   old 
b i t t e r   concepts  of  imperialism  and   sovereign  claims.  T h e   cold 
reaches  of  t h e   universe  m u s t   n o t   become  t h e   new  arena   of  an  
even  colder war. 
“TO th i s   end ,   we  shall  urge  proposals  extending  t h e   United 
Na t ions   Ch a r t e r   t o   t h e  limits  of  man’s  exploration  in  th e   uni- 
verse, reserving  ou ter  space for peaceful  use, prohibiting weapons

F ina l  repor t   of  House  Committee  on  Science and  Astronautics 
relating  to   their  hearings  on  “Commercial Applications  of  Space 
Communications Systems” released, hav ing  among its conclusions: 
(1) Because  of  worldwide in teres t   and   po ten t ia l   usefulness  of 
a  space  communications  system,  the   U S .   Government  mus t  
“retain  maximum  flexibility  regarding  th e   cen tra l   question  of 
ownership and  operation of  the   system.” 
(2)  NASA will  no t   only  eva lua te   the   various  commercial pro- 
posals  b u t   will  “conduct  all  space  launches  and   re ta in   direct 
control  over  all  launching  equipment,  facilities,  and   personnel.” 
(3 )   Research  and  development  of  m i l i tary   space  communica- 
tions  systems  should  continue  t o   be  conducted  b y   DOD   b u t   all 
research  and   development  in   space  communications  “should  be 
conducted  under  th e  general  supervision  of  NASA  in  accordance 
w i th   i t s   s t a t u to ry   manda te   to   ‘plan,  d irec t ,   and   conduct  aero-

November  $1:  I n   a  speech  on  “Our  Na t iona l   Program  in   Space,” 
NASA  Administrator  Webb   sa id :  
“ I n   carrying  ou t   i t s   responsibilities,  NASA  cooperates  with 
and  depends upon pr iva te   indu s t ry ,  universities,  and  m any  o ther  
Government  agencies-not  only  the   Depa r tmen t   of  Defense,  the  
Atomic  Energy   Commission,  and   the   Bureau   of  S tanda rd s ,  bu t  
the   Weather  Bureau ,   the   Federal  Communications Commission, 
the   Federal  Aviation  Agency,  the   Na t iona l   Science Founda t ion ,  
and  o thers .  
“ I t   has   been  only  4  years  since  the   first  manmade   satellite 
orbited  the   E a r t h .   Since  then ,   progress  in  this  new  field  of 
space  ha s   been  tremendous.  1 believe  t h a t   in  the   years  ahead 
the   r a t e   of  progress  will  trace   H  steeply  ascending  curve.  1 
believe  also  t h a t   the   many   problems  we  will  solve  to   achieve 
manned exploration of  space will  create a wealth of  new materials, 
consumer  goods,  processes,  and   techniques,  thu s   opening  a  host 
of  new  jobs, careers, opportunities  for  inves tmen t ,   and   a  general 
na t iona l  growth. 
“We  can  be  first  in  space  if  we  advance  our   scientific  and  
technical  knowledge  a t   the   most  rapid  r a t e   possible,  and   if  we 
go  forward  with  the   sustained  effort  t h a t   i t   requires.  T h a t   is 
the  basis of  ou r  na t iona l  space effort.”

General  Cur t is  E.  LeMay ,  Chief  of  Staff, U S .  Air  Force,  said 
in  interview with U.S. News & World  Repor t :  
“I  th ink  we’re  a t  the   period  of  space  technology  t h a t  we  were 
in aeronautical technology along abou t  1914.  At t h a t  time no  one 
could  predict  th e   ty p e   of  weapon  systems  t h a t   the   airplane was 
going  to   produce,  or   the   transpor ta t ion   system  t h a t   i t   would 
eventually  produce.  As  a  m a t t e r   of  fac t ,   i t  was  p r e t ty   much  a 
laughing stock-a 
very   expensive  toy .  
“We, of  course,  initially did a very poor job  in our  development 
program  to   advance  the   science  of  aeronautics  in  th is   coun try .  
I hope we  do a be t te r  job  in space.  At  the  present  time we  can’t 
predict  wha t   will  eventually come o u t  of  research  in space in  th e  
way  of  weapon  systems  or   commercial  vehicles  or   any   o ther  
use  t h a t   we  might  p u t   space  to .   I  am   su re   t h a t   men  are  going 
ou t  in to  space.  I’m su re  t h a t   they’ll  find  useful  things  to  do  o u t  
there ,   and   I’m  su re  t h a t ,  unless  something is  done to  preclude  i t ,  
they’ll  find  things  t o  fight  over o u t   there ,   too .”

December  1 1  : Th e  U.N.’s Political Comm i t tee  unanimously  approved 
a  resolution  calling  on  the   Committee on  Peaceful  Uses of  Ou ter  
Space  to   meet  on  March   3 1 ,   1962,  to  begin  discussions  of  world 
cooperation  in  space.  T h e   resolution  essentially  incorporated 
the  four-point U.S.  program  on   the  peaceful  uses  of  ou te r  space. 
Th e  U.S.S.R.  suppor ted  the  resolution  a l though  it had   previously

T h e   na t iona l   space  program  portends  a  ma jor   technological 
advance  for mank ind ,  NASA Associate Administrator D r .  Robe r t  
C .   Seamans, Jr.,  told  the   New  Orleans  Chamber   of  Commerce. 
Comparing  its  po ten t ia l   to   t h a t   of  the   invention  of  the   s team  
engine, D r .   Seamans noted: 
“Two aspects of  such major  advances are  characteristic.  F i r s t ,  
the   practical  resu l ts   are   largely  unforeseeable,  primarily  because 
they   develop  on  broad  fron ts   and ,   frequen t ly ,   in   unsuspected 
directions.  Second, the  concentration  of  effort  required  does no t  
diminish  effort  expended  on  other  frontiers  of  knowledge,  bu t  
ra the r   spurs   such  activities.  Fo r   example,  despite  fears  t h a t  
space  technology  would  monopolize  the   scientific  effort  of  th is  
coun try ,  such  fields of  ac t iv i ty   as  oceanography, geophysics,  and 
the   physics  of  high-energy  particles  have   grea t ly   increased  since 
the  na t iona l  space effort  has   become  a  serious  one.”

AERONAUTICAL  AND  ASTRONAUTICAL  EVENT S   OF  1 9  6 1 
December  $7:  T h e   “race  in  space”  between  th e   United  S t a t e s   and  
U.S.S.R.  was  t h e   to p   news  s to ry  of  1961 ,   with  the   Berlin  crisis 
running  second,  according  to   a  poll  of  Associated  Press  member 
newspapers  and   radio  s ta t ions .  
D r .  Glenn  T.  Seaborg, Chairman  of  th e  Atomic  Energy   Com- 
mission,  speaking  before  t h e   American  Association  for  the   Ad- 
vancement  of  Science,  said  t h a t   although  science  had   become  a 
determining  factor  in  national  and   international  events,  i t s  
effectiveness was hampered  because  educated men  did no t  under- 
s tand   science.  Yet,  he   said,  science  was  t ru ly   a  p a r t   of  th e  
humanities;  “Who  in  our   times  can  make  an   adequa te   criticism 
of  life without knowledge of  the  ideals, the  methods, th e  dynamics 
of  science?” 
DOD  and   USAF  revealed  t h a t   th e   B-70  bomber  m ay   be  re-

th e   “space  seed”  life  theory  in  American  Association  for  th e  
Advancement  of  Science  paper.  “Panspermic”  theory  did  no t  
seem plausible in  the  light  of  th e  fierce environment of  space and  
th e  vastness  of  th e  universe,  he  said. 
December 28: T i t a n  11, a n  advanced ICBM  a n d  th e  booster designated 
for NASA’s two-man  orbital  flights, was successfully captive-fired 
for  th e  first  time  a t  th e  M a r t in  Co.’s Denver  facilities.  T h e  tes t  
no t   only  tested  th e   flight  vehicle  b u t   th e   checkout  and   launch 
equipment  intended  for  operational use. 
December  29:  D r .  H u gh  L. Dryden ,  D e p u ty  Administrator  of  NASA, 
speaking  in  Denver  before  the   American  Association  for  th e  
Advancement  of  Science,  said:  “T h e   sheer  magnitude  of 
the  
manned  lun a r   exploration  program,  amounting  as   it  will  to   $3  
billion  o r   more  [in  fiscal  year  19631,  represents  a  significant 
application  of  th e   Nation’s  resources.  These  billions  of  dollars 
will  be   spent  in  th e  laboratories, workshops,  and  factories  of  the  
Na t ion   and   thus   constitute  a  significant  factor  in  the   Nation’s 
employment  and   economy  generally.  T h e   personnel  in   the  
space program  are  not  all  scientists  and   engineers b u t   come from 
every walk  of  life. 
“The   u l t ima te   a n d   practical  purpose  of  these  large  expendi- 
tures  is  twofold:  ( 1 )   Insurance  of  the   Na t ion   against  scientific 
and   technological  obsolescence in  a  time  of  explosive advances in 
science  and   technology;  a n d   ( 2 )  insurance  against  the   hazard  of 
military  surprise  in  space.”

difference  between  the   American  open  society  and   the   Soviet

abou t  the  events  through   all news media,  together with  the   pres-
