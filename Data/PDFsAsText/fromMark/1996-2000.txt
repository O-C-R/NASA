JANUARY 1996 
8 January 
Furloughed NASA employees returned to work at the end of a federal government shutdown of 
14 to 21 days. NASA had allowed some critical employees to return before others. The 
government shutdown, resulting from a budget stalemate between the Republican Congress and 
the Democratic White House, forced NASA to cease operations and to clear thousands of its 
employees from field centers across the country. Upon resuming its normal proceedings, NASA 
faced a backlog of work because of the disruption. Workers returning to Houston’s Johnson 
Space Center (JSC) were especially anxious to catch up, because the Center had only three days 
to prepare for a scheduled Shuttle launch. A snowstorm delayed for a few more hours the return 
of workers to Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama.1 
 
9 January 
A delegation from the U. S. Congress traveled to Russia to meet with Russian Space Agency 
officials. Representatives Jerry Lewis (R-CA) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI), members 
of the subcommittee in charge of NASA’s funding⎯the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, 
Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies⎯led the contingent. Their goal 
was to keep intact the coalition of countries dedicated to making the International Space Station 
(ISS) a reality. Faced with Russian insistence that the planned space station connect with the 
Russian space station Mir, the U.S. lawmakers warned Russian officials not to pursue radical 
changes in the plans for the space station. Sensenbrenner noted that obstinacy on the part of the 
Russians might result in the coalition’s building the ISS without Russian involvement.2 
 
12 January 
G. Porter Bridwell retired after nearly 40 years of service at MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama. 
Bridwell had served as Director of MSFC from 1994 until his retirement. He left the Center with 
an annual operating budget of US$2.5 billion and more than 3,000 employees. Bridwell had 
spent most of his career at MSFC, serving briefly as Acting Director of Stennis Space Center in 
1987, and at NASA Headquarters from 1993 to 1994. Bridwell had also been a member of the 
space station redesign team. During his tenure, Bridwell had received NASA’s Exceptional 
Service Medal, the Outstanding Leadership Medal, and the Exceptional Achievement Medal, 
attaining the rank of Meritorious Executive.3 NASA announced that J. Wayne Littles would take 
over as the new Director of MSFC.4 
 
Republican presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan announced that he would cancel a 
controversial political advertisement using images of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident. 
Responding to harsh criticism from New Hampshire residents, Buchanan removed the footage of 
Challenger from the television spot. Buchanan stated that the purpose of the advertisement, his 
first in the crucial primary state of New Hampshire, was to demonstrate his service to President 
Ronald Reagan during difficult times. However, in the home state of teacher-astronaut Christa 
McAuliffe, who had died in the accident, many residents felt that the campaign’s use of the

images exploited the event for political gain. The political controversy brought to the foreground 
the lingering public dismay over the lost Challenger, even as the 10-year anniversary of the 
tragedy neared.5 
 
Shuttle Endeavour lifted off from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
beginning a mission focused primarily on plucking the Japanese Space Flying Unit from orbit for 
analysis. Commander Brian Duffy led a six-person crew, which included Japanese astronaut 
Koichi Wakata. Endeavour also carried a small satellite to deploy. KSC officials delayed 
Endeavour’s launch for 23 minutes because of a series of communications problems between the 
Shuttle crew and the flight-control team. Endeavour’s flight was the first of eight Shuttle 
missions planned by NASA for 1996.6 
 
16 January 
Lockheed Martin announced its intention to cut 200 jobs at its facility for the production of 
external fuel tanks for NASA’s Space Shuttle. NASA’s budget reductions had caused the layoffs, 
according to Lockheed. Lockheed Martin’s facility in New Orleans employed more than 2,500 
workers in 1996.7 
 
NASA released time-lapse photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), making the 
images immediately available on the Internet. Based on these images, lauded as the deepest 
images of the universe ever taken, scientists raised their estimate of the number of galaxies in the 
universe from 10 to 50 billion; “Suddenly, Universe Gains 40 Billion More Galaxies,” the New 
York Times reported. Using a narrow “keyhole” view and focusing the HST on a portion of the 
sky only the width of a dime, telescope operators probed deep into the universe. The images 
revealed the process of a star’s death, as well as new information about how galaxies evolve. 
HST astronomer Howard E. Bond estimated that the Sun would die out in about 5 billion years.8 
 
Space Shuttle Endeavour’s crew used the spacecraft’s 50-foot (15-meter) robotic arm to snare 
NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology Flyer (OAST-Flyer) satellite. The OAST-
Flyer, valued at US$10 million, weighed 2,600 pounds (1,200 kilograms).9 
 
18 January 
Astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour tested new NASA spacesuits in extreme cold. In 
preparation for work on the ISS, U.S. astronaut Winston E. Scott stood nearly motionless in 
space for 35 minutes, in temperatures nearing 100° below 0°F (-73.33°C), to test the suit’s 
insulating capacity. In completing the exercise, Scott became the second African American man 
to walk in space. The newly improved suits, produced at a cost of US$10 million each, proved an

effective barrier against the cold. The gloves and the boots of the suits contained heating 
elements. NASA made the thermal improvements to the spacesuits after the astronauts became 
cold during the February 1995 spacewalk, causing its early termination.10 
 
At a conference of the American Astronomical Society in San Antonio, Texas, a team of U.S. 
astronomers announced the discovery of two new stars with the characteristics to sustain life 
within their solar systems. The astronomers identified the bodies, both visible to the naked eye, 
as star 70 Virginis in the constellation Virgo and a star orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris in the Big 
Dipper. Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler, researchers affiliated with the University of California 
at Berkeley and San Francisco State University, spent nine years monitoring 120 Sun-like stars 
in order to discover the two stars.11 
 
21 January 
Space Shuttle Endeavour landed safely after a successful nine-day mission. The Shuttle crew 
accomplished its primary task of capturing a Japanese satellite. The early-morning landing, in 
which the Shuttle returned to Earth under a shroud of darkness, was a rare occurrence.12 
 
22 January 
NASA released its analysis of the data from the Galileo probe mission to Jupiter, information 
that had caused scientists to rethink their theories about Jupiter’s formation. The data suggested 
that Jupiter does not have the three-tiered cloud structure scientists had anticipated, and that the 
amount of helium present on Jupiter is half of scientists’ projections. NASA Associate 
Administrator for Space Science Wesley T. Huntress Jr. touted the data collected as beyond 
NASA’s highest expectations. The Galileo probe had been one of NASA’s most challenging 
missions undertaken to obtain scientific data. According to NASA, the probe had made the most 
difficult planetary atmospheric entry ever attempted, surviving entry speeds of more than 
100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) per hour and temperatures twice as hot as the surface of the 
Sun.13 
 
23 January 
George W. S. Abbey became the seventh Director of JSC in Houston, Texas. Abbey had been 
Acting Director since Carolyn Hunter had stepped down from the post on 4 August 1995. 
According to NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, Abbey’s distinguished NASA career made 
him the right man for the job. Administrator Goldin announced, “George Abbey is uniquely 
qualified to lead the Johnson team into the future. Over the course of his eminent career with 
NASA, he has distinguished himself as an innovator and pioneer at all levels of Agency 
management.” Abbey had begun working at NASA in 1967 after serving as a pilot in the U.S. 
Air Force. He had worked on the Apollo Spacecraft Program before becoming Director of Flight 
Operations. NASA had recognized Abbey’s superior service by awarding him its Exceptional 
Service Medal and two Distinguished Service Medals.14

28 January 
NASA commemorated the 10-year anniversary of the Challenger tragedy. In advance of the 
anniversary, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin reaffirmed NASA’s dual commitments to 
exploring the frontiers of the universe and to maintaining the highest safety standard possible. 
According to Goldin, “the best way to honor the memories of the crew of Challenger, and of all 
the men and women, who have given their lives to explore the frontiers of air and space, is to 
continue their bold tradition of exploration and innovation.” In the decade following the 
accident, NASA had instituted multiple safety changes in the Shuttle program, including the nine 
changes in the program’s structure recommended by the Presidential Commission on the Space 
Shuttle Challenger Accident (Rogers Commission). By the end of January 1996, NASA had 
launched 49 Shuttle missions since the Challenger accident and had successfully deployed the 
HST. Memorial observances at KSC and JSC took place at 11:39 a.m. (EST), the exact time that 
Challenger exploded.15 
 
30 January 
NASA and the Russian Space Agency announced that the United States and Russia had reached 
an agreement to extend the Shuttle–Mir collaboration until 1998, with both countries reaffirming 
their commitments to building the ISS. At the time of the agreement, Russia was continuing to 
negotiate with the international space community to maintain the Russian station Mir as a long-
term portal to the ISS. Through additional Shuttle flights to the Mir outpost, the United States 
planned to deliver thousands of pounds of materials to space, which otherwise would have 
required Russian launches. The United States offered Russia this significant assistance in the 
hope that the cash-strapped country would be able to keep its commitments to the ISS project. 
Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. and Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin 
announced concurrently that U.S. astronaut William M. Shepherd and Russian cosmonaut Sergei 
K. Krikalev would be the first crew members to live aboard the ISS.16 
 
NASA announced completion of the exterior of the U.S. modules constructed to house the 
astronauts aboard the ISS, as well as more than 80,000 pounds (36,000 kilograms) of flight 
hardware for the station. With the completion of the modules, the United States successfully 
attained the first benchmark in the long and expensive process to complete its part of the ISS. 
Boeing workers had completed the project at MSFC. NASA planned to launch the first node of 
the ISS in December 1997.17 
 
31 January 
NASA announced that, in collaboration with industry leaders and university scholars, it had 
developed an instrument that generates the world’s most intense source of commercial x-rays, 
more than 100 times stronger than conventional x-rays. “This new optical instrument provides

something never before possible; a capability to control the direction for x-ray beams,” said 
Walter M. Gibson, professor at State University of New York at Albany. Using capillary optics, 
the instrument could focus more precisely on a target in a research or medical situation. Daniel 
C. Carter, Director of MSFC, postulated that the new instrument would have numerous medical 
and commercial applications, including improvements in drug research, medical imaging, and 
forensic science.18 
 
FEBRUARY 1996 
1 February 
Astronomers at California Institute of Technology announced the discovery of what they 
believed to be the most distant galaxy ever glimpsed from the Earth. The team of scientists, 
including Thomas A. Barlow, Limin Liu, Wallace L. W. Sargent, and Donna S. Womble, had 
stumbled across the unnamed galaxy while studying a quasar silhouetted by the galaxy’s light. 
The team used the W. M. Keck Observatory atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. In 
comparison to other documented galaxies, their find was a relatively young galaxy⎯probably 
formed less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The galaxy resides near the constellation 
Virgo. Ironically, since the galaxy lies 14 billion light-years away from Earth, the scientists had 
no way of knowing whether their discovery still actually existed. The scientists hoped that their 
discovery would offer new understanding of the period when stars began to congregate into 
galaxies.19 
 
2 February 
Space Shuttle Program Director Bryan D. O’Connor announced his resignation from NASA, 
effective at the end of February 1996. O’Connor stated that the transition in Shuttle management 
had presented him with an opportunity to leave NASA without causing undue disruption. In the 
months before his resignation, O’Connor had voiced some concerns about NASA’s planned 
transfer of responsibility for Shuttle flight operations to United Space Alliance, a private 
contractor formed by Lockheed Martin and Rockwell International. In announcing his departure, 
O’Connor praised NASA workers and astronauts for their exemplary service. After the 1986 
Challenger accident, O’Connor had played an important role in restoring the Shuttle program 
and restructuring NASA. O’Connor, a former U.S. Marine Corps pilot and astronaut, had 
directed a major overhaul of the space station program, taking over as Director of the Space 
Shuttle Program in 1994.20 
 
6 February 
NASA announced its plan to shift authority over the Shuttle program from NASA Headquarters 
in Washington, DC, to Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. JSC also would take 
control over construction of the International Space Station. The shift was one of NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin’s efforts to restructure NASA and remove layers of bureaucracy.

Goldin’s mission centered on controlling costs and improving efficiency. With the change in 
organization, key managers at JSC and other regional centers such as Kennedy Space Center 
(KSC) gained new authority to act without consulting Goldin or other officials at NASA 
Headquarters in Washington, DC. The change caused some observers to comment that NASA 
was shifting back to the less strictly hierarchical model of operation that had characterized it 
before the Challenger accident. In response to the Challenger tragedy and the ensuing Report of 
the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident (Rogers Commission 
Report), NASA had centralized some of its operations, to avoid the poor communication 
between regional centers that had contributed to the tragedy.21 
 
12 February 
Japan’s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) experienced a setback when one of its 
prototypes for a small, robotic spacecraft landed in the ocean and sank. The Japanese officials 
had anticipated the ocean landing immediately after the launch of the Hyflex shuttle, the Hope-X, 
from an island in southern Japan. In spite of the loss of its shuttle, NASDA did not consider the 
exercise an entire failure. The Hope-X had launched successfully, separated from its rocket at a 
height of 70 miles (113 kilometers), and then returned to Earth 19 minutes later, as planned. The 
problem occurred when the craft splashed into the ocean, and a rope connecting the 1-ton (900-
kilogram or 0.9-tonne) shuttle to its flotation device broke, causing it to sink. NASDA reported 
that it had intended to collect data during the flight to test the shuttle’s fitness for reentry, but had 
been unable to procure much of the information needed. Japan had manufactured the US$37 
million shuttle domestically, planning the exercise as a part of its effort to bolster its fledgling 
space program.22 
 
NASA announced the selection of eight proposals for its newly inaugurated Advanced Concepts 
Research Projects (ACRP) program. NASA had received more than 100 proposals for the 
program, founded in September 1995 to identify and support new ideas and technologies that 
might eventually improve the U.S. space program. The ACRP program, allowing up to 
US$250,000 in support for each selected proposal, included proposals covering a wide spectrum 
of technologies and fields, such as: “fusion-based space propulsion, optical computing, robotics, 
interplanetary navigation, materials and structure, ultra-lightweight large aperture optics, and 
innovative modular spacecraft architectural concepts.”23 
 
13 February 
The television series Home Improvement aired an episode showing members of Shuttle 
Columbia’s crew in scenes shot in space. The Shuttle’s crew had captured the film during 
Mission STS-73 in October 1995. The airing marked the first time that NASA had allowed the 
filming of operations in space, specifically for a television series. The NASA crew included 
Kenneth D. Bowersox, Catherine G. Coleman, Frederick W. Leslie, Kathryn C. Thornton, and

Albert Sacco Jr.  Bowersox, who had appeared previously on Home Improvement, praised the 
event as a public relations achievement for NASA.24 
 
17 February 
NASA launched a space probe aimed at a faraway asteroid only about twice the size of 
Manhattan Island. Scientists intended the probe, called Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous 
(NEAR), to reach the asteroid in three years. If the mission succeeded, NASA planned for the 
probe to orbit the asteroid for nearly one year before eventually crashing into the rock. 
Astronomers hoped that the data gathered during the exercise would provide new information 
about the formation of the universe. With a budget of US$120 million, the probe mission was a 
relatively cheap foray into the gathering of space data. The probe’s restricted budget was 
necessary because the new Discovery program had cost US$150 million, and NASA had a three-
year cap on the development of new spacecraft. Johns Hopkins University successfully 
engineered the craft within the stringent guidelines.25 
 
20 February 
Receiving congratulations from the rest of the international space community, Russia celebrated 
the 10-year anniversary of the Russian space station Mir. The pathbreaking spacecraft had hosted 
a steady stream of astronauts for long-term stays in space throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, 
transcending many of the changes in the political structure of its home country. The Soviet space 
program had launched the first Mir module on 20 February 1986 from the desert of Kazakhstan, 
but because of Cold War tensions, the Soviets had not released specific information about the 
station as it entered orbit module by module. Rockets had transported the individual modules 
into space, where cosmonauts assembled them. The fully assembled space station weighed 130 
tons (120,000 kilograms or 120 tonnes). As tensions between the United States and the former 
Soviet Union lessened, Shuttle missions to Mir had become frequent. During the 1990s, many 
countries, including the United States, had paid the fledgling Soviet space administration, which 
became the Russian Space Agency, hundreds of millions of dollars to send their astronauts to 
Mir. Thus, Mir had provided the USSR with a needed source of revenue. However, since the fall 
of the Soviet Union, the Russian space program had received only one-fifth of the government 
funding provided to the Soviet space program. In 1996, even with Mir in an advanced state of 
decline, Russian officials remained committed to preserving the aging craft’s lifespan. Marcia S. 
Smith, an aerospace expert with the Congressional Research Service, described Mir’s state as 
akin to “a car that has 200,000 miles [320,000 kilometers] on it.” Nevertheless, the space station 
had provided scientists with the only spacecraft in space consistently occupied by humans for a 
decade, a significant contribution that deserved commemoration.26

Russia launched the Soyuz spacecraft carrying two cosmonauts. The Russian Space Agency 
intended the mission to Mir to bring Mir residents Yuri P. Gidzenko, Sergei V. Avdeyev, and 
Thomas Reiter back to Earth after their lengthy stay aboard the space station.27 
 
22 February 
Mission STS-75, the 19th mission of Shuttle Columbia, launched from KSC in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida. A seven-person crew embarked on the mission, scheduled to last 13 days. Scott J. 
Horowitz, the first Shuttle pilot with a PhD, captained STS-75. NASA astronauts Andrew M. 
Allen, Jeffrey A. Hoffman, and Franklin R. Chang-Dìaz; Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier; and 
two Italian astronauts, Umberto Guidoni and Maurizio Cheli, made up the crew. One of the 
mission’s priorities was to place in flight the Italian tethered satellite system (TSS), which 
scientists had designed to harness new sources of power for the Space Shuttle. An attempt in 
1992 to deploy the TSS had failed when a bolt in the system’s reel mechanism caused the tether 
to jam. The U.S.- Italian satellite had cost US$443 million to produce. The satellite, extended on 
a 12-mile (19-kilometer) tether, had the potential to use its orbit to create electrical power for 
other spacecraft. NASA planned to fly the satellite for 22 hours. To retrieve the satellite, the 
crew intended to retract the tether until the satellite was about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the 
Shuttle, allowing it to hover at this distance while the Shuttle maneuvered into position to pick it 
up.28  
 
25 February 
NASA announced that the tethered satellite experiment had failed. The 12-mile (19-kilometer) 
tether, attaching the 0.5-ton (450-kilogram or 0.45-tonne) satellite to Shuttle Columbia, broke 
unexpectedly just as the tether had nearly reached its full extension. Before the tether broke, the 
experiment to use an orbiting satellite to produce electricity had been proceeding smoothly. The 
astronauts had been in the process of extending the satellite from the Space Shuttle for more than 
5 hours, when they noted a decrease in tension and realized that the tether and satellite had 
broken away. NASA Commander Andrew M. Allen responded to the break immediately, 
directing the Shuttle away from the satellite to prevent a collision. However, the satellite never 
came close to the Shuttle; it was more than 18 miles (29 kilometers) away only a few minutes 
after breaking free. NASA officials could not immediately identify the cause of the break. The 
astronauts aboard the Shuttle managed to record images of the satellite trailing away from the 
Shuttle. This footage, a black and white rendering of the tether disappearing into space, reached 
Flight Command Center in Houston, Texas, shortly after the event. “Those are some tether 
dynamics we did not want to see,” stated one Mission Control operative. NASA dismissed the 
idea of attempting to retrieve the satellite, explaining that, although it was technically possible, 
such a mission would be too dangerous and too costly in consumption of fuel.29

26 February 
NASA formed an independent panel to review the failure of the tethered satellite experiment and 
the loss of the satellite. NASA selected Kenneth J. Szalai, Director of Dryden Flight Research 
Center, to chair the panel. The formation of such an investigative body in the wake of a costly 
loss conformed to standard practice under NASA’s Space Flight Operations Contingency Plan. 
In a NASA press release announcing the panel’s formation, Szalai stated, “given the public 
investment in the tethered satellite, it is important that we find out what went wrong.”30 
 
27 February 
Continuing its efforts to cut costs by using private contractors, NASA awarded McDonnell 
Douglas Aerospace a US$500 million, eight-year contract to provide “fixed-price medium-light 
(Med-Lite) class expendable launch vehicle services.”31 NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center 
managed the program, and the Orbital Sciences Corporation served as the major subcontractor. 
At the time of the agreement, NASA had planned three Med-Lite missions launching from both 
the East Coast and the West Coast.32 
 
MARCH 1996 
3 March 
NASA scientist Benjamin F. Chao explained to the New York Times the results of his research on 
Earth’s orbit. A geophysicist at Goddard Space Flight Center, Chao attributed the Earth’s slightly 
changed orbital pattern to the increased construction of dams. As the planet’s population has 
grown, people had attempted to maximize use of Earth’s limited water resources by building 
reservoirs. Using geophysics, international data, and theoretical calculations, Chao postulated 
that this increase in impounded water on the Earth’s surface had actually helped speed up the 
Earth’s orbit. Chao first made public his findings in the Geophysical Research Papers. Some 
members of the scientific community challenged his conclusions.33 
 
Columbia astronauts set a series of small fires inside the Shuttle to help NASA scientists 
improve their design of smoke detectors and fire extinguishers for use in a weightless 
environment. The fires spread quickly within the enclosed vehicle. Astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman 
marveled at the behavior of the flames, which was completely different in a weightless 
environment from that typically observed on Earth. The fires scattered quickly and burned much 
more intensely than on Earth. NASA had never before tested the fire-detection equipment in a 
space environment. The fire equipment worked properly, and the crew put out all fires without 
incident.34

The Communist Party of China acknowledged for the first time that a failed satellite launch 
occurring on 15 February 1996 had killed six people and injured 57 others. The Long March 3B 
rocket had exploded, destroying the 15 Intelsat satellite and damaging 80 homes. The secretive 
government of the People’s Republic of China had denied the major accident, announcing simply 
that a setback had occurred. However, foreign news sources had captured video footage of the 
launch rocket as it careened out of control and exploded in a highly populated area. The Chinese 
government ended the news blackout, which had prevented its own citizens from learning of the 
disaster, stating China’s intention to delay future launch plans.35 
 
Henry McDonald became Director of Ames Research Center (ARC) in Mountain View, 
California. NASA had selected McDonald for the position in January 1996 after the selection of 
former Director Ken K. Munechika as NASA’s first Director of Moffett Federal Airfield. A 
former professor of mechanical engineering at Pennsylvania State University, McDonald brought 
to NASA both industrial and academic experience.36 
 
5 March 
For the first time in its history, NASA allowed a researcher to direct an experiment from his 
home university, rather than from Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Martin Glickman led a 
group of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, taking control of a crystal experiment 
aboard Shuttle Columbia. Both NASA and the scientific community praised the experiment as a 
crucial step in the relationship between astronauts and academic scientists. Because they did not 
have to travel to NASA’s MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama, the scientists were able to use their 
own instruments and data systems. Using remote control, they repeatedly cooled and heated the 
crystal samples on the Shuttle. Scientists hoped that allowing universities to control experiments 
from their own institutions would facilitate greater student participation in experiments 
conducted in space.37 
 
7 March 
NASA released Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images revealing much of the surface of Pluto 
for the first time. The Pluto imaging team declared the quality of the pictures better than they had 
expected. “Hubble has brought Pluto from a fuzzy, distant dot of light, to a world which we can 
begin to map, and watch for surface changes,” remarked Marc W. Buie, a member of the team. 
The HST took snapshots of nearly the entire surface of the planet during 6.4 days of its rotation. 
The pictures showed Pluto’s complexity, revealing nearly a dozen distinct provinces, and 
confirming the existence of a polar ice cap, which scientists had suspected but had been unable 
to verify. NASA officials were optimistic that the images would pave the way for a proposed 
Pluto flyby mission in the coming years. Pluto remained the only planet not yet visited by a 
spacecraft.38 
 
8 March 
NASA agreed to restructure and extend its contract with USBI Company, which had previously 
assembled and refurbished the Shuttle’s solid rocket boosters. The new contract extended the

partnership for 45 months, paying US$500 million to USBI to support the Shuttle program. 
Based on the terms of the agreement and on USBI’s production schedule, NASA estimated that 
the partnership would cover approximately seven Shuttle missions annually for the duration of 
the contract.39 
 
9 March 
Space Shuttle Columbia touched down at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, after a 16-day mission clouded by the disappointment of losing a tethered satellite. 
NASA delayed the landing for one day because of poor weather on the coast of Florida.40 
 
12 March 
Having received 550 proposals, NASA’s Office of Life and Microgravity Science and 
Applications awarded US$17 million to 168 scientists from 32 different states, to conduct 
microgravity research. NASA and the scientific community hypothesized that further 
investigation into the effects of low gravity on physical processes would lead to major advances 
in fluid physics and material sciences. The scientists hoped that if they could control the process 
of the formation of materials, they could develop and improve a wide range of materials and 
products, including metal alloys, semiconductors, ceramics, glasses, and polymers.41 
 
13 March 
NASA announced that it had developed a prototype for new software to teach pilots how to fly 
commercial aircraft. The improved technological capabilities of computers had allowed Steve 
Casner, a scientist at NASA’s ARC, to develop a program imitating the flight management 
system of an automated “glass” cockpit and allowing pilots to use their laptops to simulate 
flying. Pilots could load the program onto their own computers, supplementing the training they 
had received through classroom instruction and flight simulators. The program featured five 
windows: “a control/display unit, mode control panel, two maps showing the aircraft’s lateral 
track and its vertical track, and a flight mode enunciator showing which flight systems [were] 
currently controlling the airplane.”42 
 
NASA selected astronaut Wendy B. Lawrence to replace Charles J. Precourt as Director of 
Operations, Russia, making Lawrence the primary contact between NASA and Russian Space 
Agency officials. As Director of Operations, Russia, Lawrence became responsible for 
overseeing the training and preparation of U.S. astronauts at Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center 
in Star City, Russia, outside of Moscow. Lawrence was the sixth astronaut to serve in this 
position.43 
 
14 March 
NASA released its blueprint for the future, the “NASA Strategic Plan 1996.” The plan laid out 
NASA’s vision for the United States’ space exploration; noted its history; and discussed possible

changes in strategy, committing NASA to a threefold mission: scientific research, space 
exploration, and development and transfer of technology. Furthermore, the plan outlined 
NASA’s quest to address science’s fundamental questions, such as, how did the universe, 
galaxies, stars, and planets form and evolve? and, does life in any form, however simple or 
complex, carbon-based or other, exist elsewhere than on planet Earth? NASA intended the 
document as the starting point for future decisions regarding the allocation of its resources.44 
 
20 March 
At the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Adriana C. Ocampo, a geologist at NASA’s Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, announced the discovery of a chain of impact craters in Chad. According 
to a team of scientists, the presence of the craters suggested that a sizable comet or asteroid 
might have struck ancient Earth. Scientists discovered the craters using the Spaceborne Imaging 
Radar-C (SIR-C), which flew on Shuttle Endeavour’s Mission STS-59 in 1994. The impact 
craters were only the second chain of large craters ever discovered on Earth and the first impact 
craters found using the SIR-C technology. Ocampo warned that scientists still needed to excavate 
the ground extensively before they could be sure that the craters were indeed impact structures.45 
 
22 March 
Shuttle Atlantis launched from KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, setting out for the Mir space 
station. Space Shuttle Mission STS-76 was the third Space Shuttle–Mir docking mission. The 
Shuttle carried six astronauts, including Shannon W. Lucid, destined for a five-month stay on the 
Russian space outpost. Complications arose when flight controllers at Johnson Space Center in 
Houston, Texas, detected a potential problem during the launch. A minor leak had occurred in 
one of the Shuttle’s three hydraulic systems used to move the wing flaps. After analyzing the 
extent of the problem, however, NASA officials determined that the mission could go on as 
planned. NASA planned the mission to last nine days, connecting with Mir on the third day.46 
 
Former NASA astronaut Robert F. Overmyer died while test piloting the experimental Cirrus 
VK-30 aircraft near Duluth, Minnesota. Overmyer was performing a series of stalls at an altitude 
of more than 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) when the aircraft “departed from controlled flight.” 
Overmyer had served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1959 to 1986, becoming a NASA astronaut 
in 1969, and piloting Shuttle Mission STS-5 in 1982. After leaving NASA and the Marine Corps 
in 1986, Overmyer worked for McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.47 
 
24 March 
NASA astronaut Shannon W. Lucid became the first female resident of the Mir space station. 
Lucid traveled aboard Shuttle Atlantis to reach Mir, planning to remain on the Russian station for 
five months. She joined Russian cosmonauts Yuri I. Onufrienko and Yury V. Usachev for the 
long-term stay. Atlantis’s crew unloaded more than 5,000 pounds (2,300 kilograms) of supplies

and 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of experiment samples and equipment during the Shuttle’s 
docking. Lucid replaced U.S. astronaut Norman E. Thagard, who had spent 110 days with the 
Russian crew. Lucid’s arrival generated some controversy. In attempting to convey Russia’s 
openness to having a woman aboard Mir, cosmonaut Yuri N. Glazkov commented that the crew 
would appreciate Lucid’s presence, because “we know women love to clean.” Not surprisingly, 
some people resented his remark.48 
 
27 March 
NASA astronauts Michael R. “Rich” Clifford and Linda M. Godwin made an historic spacewalk 
outside the orbiting Mir space station. For the first time, astronauts exited Mir with the Shuttle 
docked at the station. Clifford and Godwin, wearing jet packs as a precaution, scaled the 
passageway connecting Shuttle Atlantis with the Mir complex, installing several experiment 
boxes on the outside of the space station. Some of these boxes were “cosmic dust catchers,” 
meant to gather samples of the materials that might smash into orbiting space stations. The 
spacewalk and associated experiments were part of ongoing research in preparation for the 
construction of the new International Space Station. NASA regarded the spacewalk as more 
dangerous than usual, because the Shuttle was docked with Mir and, thus, unable to give chase 
quickly if one of the astronauts broke away from the spacecraft.49 
 
Preparing to take over the administration of the Shuttle program from NASA, the Rockwell-
Lockheed Martin joint venture, United Space Alliance (USA), named James C. Adamson as its 
chief operating officer.  Adamson came to USA from Lockheed Martin, where he had served 
since 1994 as a group vice president and general manager of Lockheed’s Engineering and 
Science Services. Adamson had served as an astronaut at NASA from 1984 to 1992, spending 
more than 334 hours in space as a part of Missions STS-28 and STS-43.50 
 
APRIL 1996 
1 April 
Shuttle Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California’s Mojave Desert. The nine-day 
mission nearly came to an abrupt halt when Atlantis’s crew had difficulty opening the Shuttle’s 
cargo bay doors during descent. After considering an emergency landing, NASA controllers 
directed Atlantis’s crew to open the doors manually. The crew successfully performed this 
necessary maneuver only to confront dangerous weather that prevented their landing at Kennedy 
Space Center.51 
 
4 April 
An international team of researchers announced that, while tracking Comet Hyakutake in March 
1996, they had discovered x-rays emitting from the comet. German scientists working at Max 
Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, had collaborated on the

project with NASA scientists based at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 
Konrad Dennryl, who had directed the use of Germany’s ROSAT (Röntgensatellit) for the 
project, called the discovery of the x-rays “a thrilling moment.” The comet emitted far stronger 
radiation signals than the scientists had expected, about 100 times brighter than anticipated. The 
scientists could not explain why the comet gave off such intense x-rays, but offered two 
preliminary hypotheses: 1) the gaseous molecules surrounding the comet absorbed x-rays from 
the Sun before reemitting the same x-rays; or 2) violent collisions between the comet material 
and the supersonic wind and particles from the Sun produced the extraordinarily strong x-rays. 
The scientists vowed to ascertain conclusively why the comet x-rays behaved as they did.52 
 
9 April 
Rockwell International Corporation pled guilty to charges of violating federal law in disposing of 
hazardous waste. Federal prosecutors had charged the company with violating the law after a 
1994 explosion at a Rockwell rocket-testing facility in Southern California killed scientists Otto 
K. Heiney and Larry A. Pugh. Rockwell’s Chief Executive Officer Donald R. Beall called the 
incident “a corporate failure for which we accept responsibility.” By pleading guilty, Rockwell 
acknowledged liability and agreed to pay a US$6.5 million fine. According to the U.S. 
Department of Justice, the case was only one aspect of a long-term investigation into Rockwell’s 
compliance with environmental regulations, an investigation that Rockwell’s guilty plea did not 
end. Federal auditors were also looking into the possibility that Rockwell had overcharged 
NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense for disposal costs.53 
 
NASA made its high-altitude research plane available to the disaster-recovery team responsible 
for containing hazardous leakage at the California Gulch Superfund site in Leadville, Colorado. 
The ER-2 plane, a U-2 spy plane adapted for civilian use, captured thousands of measurements 
per second, and its spectrometer mapped hundreds of square miles during each reconnaissance 
flight. Scientists used NASA’s plane to map minerals and other substances, to help them detect 
the location of acid leaks from mines and heavy-metal contamination. Officials estimated that the 
ER-2 plane’s identification of contaminated areas had saved cleanup agencies about one year and 
more than US$500,000.54 
 
11 April 
The U.S. Space Foundation inducted into its Space Technology Hall of Fame three technologies 
that NASA had originally developed for its astronauts: antishock trousers, flame-retardant seat 
materials, and the radiation barrier. The Space Foundation recognized the technologies as 
pathbreaking discoveries that had enhanced the quality of life on Earth. Scientists and engineers 
at Ames Research Center had developed the first two technologies, and members of the Apollo 
program at Johnson Space Center (JSC) had discovered the radiation barrier. NASA employees 
had often referred to the dual use of its technologies as spin-offs, recognizing that such 
inventions served to validate the expenditure of taxpayers’ funds on NASA’s research projects. 
According to a NASA spokesperson, the technologies “are not merely secondary applications.

They provide direct, quantifiable, and invaluable benefits to the American taxpayer and the 
domestic economy.” The U.S. Space Foundation made the inductions at the National Space 
Symposium, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Foundation had inducted 25 technologies into 
the Hall of Fame since the establishment of the awards in 1988.55 
 
12 April 
NASA and the scientific community celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Space Shuttle 
program. NASA had adopted the Shuttle as a means of controlling the costs of exploring space. 
However, NASA conceded that, since its deployment, the Shuttle had flown only nine times per 
year, compared with the 24 to 60 Shuttle flights per year anticipated.  Furthermore, the cost of 
flying the Shuttle had reached almost US$500,000 more per mission than expected. During its 
first 15 years, the Shuttles had flown 76 missions, including 51 following the Challenger 
accident. The Shuttles had transported 545 tons (490,000 kilograms or 490 tonnes) of payloads to 
space, bringing back to Earth 18.5 tons (17,000 kilograms or 17 tonnes) of payloads. During the 
same period, 440 astronauts from 12 countries flew aboard the Shuttles. NASA experts predicted 
that the Shuttle would remain the primary vehicle of space exploration well into the 21st 
century.56 
 
NASA completed the first step in its transition to using a single contractor to conduct all Shuttle 
operations, signing two novation agreements with the newly formed United Space Alliance 
(USA). NASA had announced in 1995 that it would consolidate its Shuttle operations under a 
single contract with USA, on a noncompetitive basis. When Rockwell International Corporation 
and Lockheed Martin Corporation developed USA as a joint venture, the two companies already 
held nearly 70 percent of the dollar value of all Shuttle-related contracts. NASA officials 
expected that the move to a single contract would reduce costs by eliminating duplicative work 
and streamlining management.57 
 
15 April 
NASA disclosed the startling discoveries of Rice University astronomer C. Robert O’Dell and 
graduate student Kerry P. Handron, who had used images captured by the Hubble Space 
Telescope to pinpoint thousands of gigantic, tadpole-shaped objects surrounding a dying star, the 
first time that scientists had observed the forms in such abundance. The scientists hypothesized 
that the final outbursts of the dying star probably caused the gaseous knots, each several billion 
miles across. O’Dell concluded that if a dying star caused the gaseous knots, then trillions of 
these forms might litter the universe.58 
 
With funding from NASA’s Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications and the 
Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, researchers at Utah State University successfully 
developed a strain of wheat suitable for growth in space. The space wheat, called USU-Apogee, 
produced a yield equivalent to 600 bushels of grain per acre (21,000 liters of grain per 4,100 
square meters), a rate three times more than the rate achieved in previous experiments.

Researchers had worked for more than a decade developing the wheat. During the tests, USU-
Apogee had thrived under the difficult conditions of artificial sunlight and high levels of carbon 
dioxide. In conditions approximating the environment in space, the wheat grew on short stalks, 
produced an unusually large number of seeds, and maintained green leaf tips (reflecting proper 
calcium levels). Scientists hoped that astronauts would be able to grow the wheat in the future 
International Space Station, as a more economical means of providing food for long-term space 
residents than frequent Shuttle supply missions.59 
 
17 April 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin informed employees that NASA Headquarters in 
Washington, DC, would reduce its staff by more than 50 percent, citing “increasing budget 
pressures.” Under the reduction plan, staff at NASA Headquarters would decrease from 1,430 to 
between 650 and 700, in less than one year’s time. The Clinton administration had continued to 
push for government-wide budget cutbacks throughout the 1990s. Don Fuqua, President of the 
Aerospace Industries Association, described the staff reduction as a case of the federal 
government following the example of the private sector. According to Fuqua, before NASA 
decided to reorganize, most commercial aerospace business had already reorganized for greater 
efficiency.60 
 
18 April 
Chinese scientists attending a conference under the direction of the World Monuments Fund 
announced that space radar images had allowed them to locate and study two ancient, previously 
undetectable sections of the Great Wall of China. Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar, aboard Shuttle Endeavour’s Mission STS-59, produced the images in 
1994. Diane L. Evans, a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, called the discovery an 
unexpected benefit of NASA’s research: “Archaeology wasn’t one of our original science 
objectives, but the imaging radar data has been found to be very useful for this type of research.” 
Because the radar images penetrated vegetation and loose sand, archaeologists were able to use 
the images to explore the site without excavation. The radar images revealed sections of the wall 
built in two different periods⎯one during the Ming Dynasty and the other during the Sui 
Dynasty.61 
 
23 April 
Russia successfully launched the 21-ton (19,000-kilogram or 19-tonne) Priroda module, the last 
major component of the aging Mir space station, aboard a robotic rocket from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russian scientists designed the Priroda module primarily as a 
laboratory for observing Earth. The module also contained equipment for NASA astronaut 
Shannon W. Lucid’s stay aboard the station. NASA officials at JSC monitored the launch. 
Priroda carried a magnetically levitated experiment platform, a spectrometer, and a “glove box,”

allowing astronauts to handle potentially hazardous material. The module was the sixth major 
portion of the Mir complex launched by Russia since the Soviet Union began the project in 1986. 
Budget shortfalls in the Russian space program had caused some concern that the final module 
might not reach Mir as planned.62 
 
24 April 
Without holding any subcommittee hearings on the matter, the U.S. House Committee on 
Science and Technology voted to trim NASA’s budget for 1997 by US$450 million. NASA 
operated under a US$13.8 billion budget in 1996. Most of the cuts were from the budget of the 
initiative Mission to Planet Earth.63 
 
30 April 
Harry C. Holloway resigned from his post as NASA Associate Administrator for the Office of 
Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications. Holloway was the first person to hold the 
appointment after Administrator Daniel S. Goldin created the position in March 1993. Holloway 
planned to return to the School of Medicine at Uniformed Services University. During his tenure, 
Holloway had established programs to conduct experimental studies in orbit and instituted the 
strategic plan for the Human Exploration and Development of Space. Holloway had been 
instrumental in strengthening ties between NASA and the National Institutes of Health, 
overseeing the signing of 10 agreements between the two agencies.64 
 
At the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society, astronomers 
working with NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) spacecraft announced the 
discovery of the fastest vibrations ever recorded in a star system. The vibrations occur when 
massive neutron stars begin to die out, expelling the outer layers of their solid crusts and creating 
powerful x-rays. The astronomers working with the RXTE recorded x-rays flickering at up to 
1,130 times per second. Scientists were unsure why this process occurred. According to NASA, 
“the possibility that the RXTE has detected actual waves in neutron stars or a very fast rotation 
period of one such star is of great scientific interest.”65

1 May 
NASA announced its 1996 astronaut candidate class, which included the first set of identical 
twins ever selected⎯Mark E. Kelly and Scott J. Kelly. The sibling U.S. Navy pilots joined 33 
other astronauts in the class. NASA selected 10 pilots and 25 mission specialists from an 
applicant pool of more than 2,400 candidates, including members of the U.S. Army, Air Force, 
Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Navy. Six members of the class held PhDs in their respective 
fields, and one was an MD. NASA selected the astronaut class, the largest in nearly 20 years,

another in the United Kingdom.66 
 
2 May 
Joseph B. Gurman of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center announced the pathbreaking 
discoveries of a team of scientists monitoring the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) 
spacecraft. According to Gurman, SOHO had revealed unexpected activity on the Sun, as well as 
the best images yet of the plume-like structures, extending from the Sun. SOHO’s scientists were 
excited and surprised to find that “movies made from SOHO ultraviolet data show that there is 
continuous motion and action everywhere on the Sun.” The scientists observed that the Sun’s 
plumes extend more than 13 million miles (21 million kilometers) into space. NASA and the 
European Space Agency (ESA) collaborated on the SOHO project.67 
 
Former U.S. Representative Norman Y. Mineta received NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal, 
the highest civilian honor awarded by NASA. Mineta had served 21 years in the U.S. Congress, 
representing California’s Silicon Valley in the House of Representatives. As chairperson of the 
House Committee on Public Works and Transportation, he had played a vital role in bolstering 
the nation’s transportation infrastructure and fostering technological research. Mineta remarked 
that serving over the long term as the senior member of the House Committee on Science and 
Technology had given him the opportunity to see firsthand NASA’s significant achievements. 
When he accepted the award at a private ceremony, Mineta said, “I’m deeply honored to be 
recognized by NASA for any contributions I made furthering the mission of our nation’s space 
operations.”68 
 
3 May 
NASA’s Galileo spacecraft discovered a giant iron core taking up half of the diameter of 
Jupiter’s moon Io, as well as a large hole in Jupiter’s magnetic field. Galileo Project Scientist 
Torrence V. Johnson of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) identified Io as the most 
“geographically active body in the [s]olar [s]ystem.” Galileo scientists also measured the intense 
heat Jupiter generates, noting that the planet has a massive gravity field. Galileo managed to 
come within 559 miles (900 kilometers) of Jupiter during its 1995 flyby, allowing scientists to 
locate the iron core and the hole in the magnetic field. Although they were still grappling with 
the significance of the “completely unexpected finds,” scientists reported their early analysis of 
the data in Science magazine.69 
 
10 May 
At Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NASA announced that it had taken a major step 
forward in preparations for the International Space Station (ISS): the station’s air purification 
system had passed a month-long test. NASA scientists tested the ISS’s air pressure and the 
ability of its air system to regulate the mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen that the astronauts

would breathe. In the simulation, scientists used a 6,200-cubic-foot (176-cubic-meter) module 
from which they had removed the oxygen. The air system not only proved it could maintain the 
proper levels of both oxygen and carbon dioxide, but also performed satisfactorily at a reduced 
power level. Engineers hoped to reduce the power level of the ISS during its nighttime orbit. The 
system, called the Atmosphere Revitalization Subsystem, demonstrated that it could provide 
healthy working and living conditions for the astronauts on board the ISS.70 
 
15 May 
NASA and the ESA made available images taken of Comet Hyakutake as it approached the Sun. 
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory had captured the pictures during the appearance of the 
comet in late April 1996. The Naval Research Laboratory had built a special instrument⎯the 
Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)⎯to record the images. Operating aboard 
SOHO, LASCO suppressed the glare of the Sun, exposing the comet and its tails. In addition, the 
instrument produced the equivalent of a time-lapse movie of Hyakutake, thereby documenting 
the comet’s tails as they changed direction in reaction to the Sun’s forces. LASCO also allowed 
scientists to observe coronal mass ejections⎯the expulsion of hot gases. Researchers used the 
data to learn more about how comets interact with the Sun and about the behavior of comet 
tails.71 
 
17 May 
Peter H. Diamandis, President of Angel Technologies Corporation, an aerospace firm located in 
St. Louis, Missouri, offered a US$10 million prize to the first private aviators to complete a 
suborbital flight into space. Diamandis stated that the object of the prize was to motivate private 
companies to invest in space exploration, someday making spaceflights open to the public. 
“We’re looking to spark a constructive competition,” Diamandis explained. To claim the prize, 
the privately financed and built aircraft would have to ascend to 62 miles (100 kilometers) high, 
twice within a period of two weeks, delivering three passengers safely to space and back. 
Diamandis claimed that creating an entirely reusable Space Shuttle would considerably decrease 
the cost of going to space, opening the space frontier to people who had not trained as 
professional astronauts. Diamandis intended to announce the winner of the “X Prize” on 18 May, 
beneath the St. Louis Gateway Arch.  Creator of the Voyager and top contender for the prize 
Burt Rutan, as well as NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, planned to attend the award 
ceremony.72 
 
19 May 
Shuttle Endeavour lifted off from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 
Mission STS-77, scheduled to last 10 days. John H. Casper, making his fourth spaceflight, 
commanded the crew, and Curtis L. Brown Jr. piloted the Shuttle. Four mission specialists, 
Daniel W. Bursch, Marc Garneau, Mario Runco Jr., and Andrew S. W. Thomas, completed the 
flight crew. NASA planned various science experiments for the mission, including deployment 
of a retrievable satellite to test the feasibility of using satellites with inflatable parts. NASA’s 
Office of Space Access and Technology sponsored most of the payloads aboard Endeavour. The 
Shuttle also carried a privately developed SPACEHAB module, holding nearly 3,000 pounds

to construct research laboratories. Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau was making his second trip 
into space.73 
 
20 May 
Endeavour’s crew successfully tested a giant inflatable antenna, deploying the structure and 
gathering data during its orbit. Project Manager Steven Bard, a NASA scientist at JPL, called the 
successful test a giant step toward developing lightweight, cost-effective equipment for space 
research. The silver, inflatable antenna, about the size of a tennis court, cost US$14 million to 
develop. The Shuttle astronauts used the Shuttle’s robotic arm to launch the small satellite 
carrying the antenna. The crew situated Endeavour about 400 feet (122 meters) immediately 
above the antenna, to observe its behavior after deployment, but when the antenna made some 
unexpected tumbling rotations, the astronauts moved the Shuttle to a safer distance. After 
completing the test, the astronauts set off a series of small explosions to cut loose the antenna. 
Before the mission began, NASA officials had determined that deflating and recapturing the 
antenna would be too risky and costly to attempt.74 
 
21 May 
The Boeing Company, Honeywell Space Systems, and the S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space 
Corporation Energia (RSC Energia), based in Kaliningrad, Russia, announced a new venture to 
reduce significantly the cost and time involved in transporting payloads to the Mir space station. 
Boeing estimated that the service would save one year and would cut the cost of transporting a 
standard payload to space by at least US$7 million. The three companies split duties to maximize 
efficiency. Boeing assumed control of the overall management and payload-system integration; 
Honeywell accepted responsibility for providing payload-interface units and payload-integration 
support; and RSC Energia signed on to provide launch services and to oversee installation on 
Mir. Decreasing the expenses involved in sustaining Mir had become urgent in the 1990s, when 
both Russian and American space agencies had to respond to their governments’ respective 
budget cuts.75 
 
Scientists revealed that their analysis of the data from NASA’s Galileo probe had offered new 
insights into Jupiter’s climate. The probe found winds of 400 miles (640 kilometers) per hour, 
extending about 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) from the planet’s core to its cloud top and 
producing storms that could last for centuries. The findings indicated that heat at Jupiter’s core 
fueled the winds. Galileo released a probe, which parachuted 400 miles (640 kilometers) through 
Jupiter’s atmosphere to gather its data, enduring temperatures ranging from -171°F to 305°F (-
113°C to 152°C). The probe exploded after gathering and transmitting the data.76

The trend of commercializing space exploration continued, as Pepsi-Cola Company announced 
the company’s plan to use Russian cosmonauts aboard the Mir space station to record the first 
TV advertisement filmed in space. PepsiCo planned to record images of a giant replica of a Pepsi 
can in space. PepsiCo’s Chief Marketing Officer Massimo F. d’Amore called space “the ultimate 
frontier of global marketing.” The Russian Space Agency expected to receive nearly US$5 
million for the advertising stunt, providing a welcome infusion of cash for the struggling, 
postcommunist space program. In response to its competitor’s advertisement plans, the Coca-
Cola Company furnished Endeavour’s Mission STS-77 with a soda dispenser equipped for use in 
space. The machine cost Coca-Cola Company US$1.5 million to develop.77 
 
23 May 
NASA revealed that the joint U.S.-Italian team investigating the failure of the Italian tethered 
satellite system (TSS) had determined that the tether experiment conducted aboard Mission STS-
75 had revealed numerous fundamental flaws in space physics and plasma theories. The TSS 
experiment had ended with the tether breaking before reaching its full 13-mile (21-kilometer) 
length. The scientists concluded that a number of theoretical models, widely accepted for as long 
as 30 years, were incorrect and in need of revision. According to Noble Stone, a NASA scientist 
at MSFC, the team’s most significant finding was that tether current flows between the satellite 
and the orbiter were three times greater than theoretical models had predicted. Because the 
amount of power generated was directly proportionate to the current, the harnessed energy had 
the potential to furnish thrust for rebooting a space station, satellite, or shuttle in a decaying 
orbit. Stone suggested that tether systems might some day supplement solar arrays as sources of 
power for long-term space platforms.78 
 
29 May 
Shuttle Endeavour made a smooth sunrise landing at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, bringing 
to its close a fruitful 10-day research mission. The Shuttle crew celebrated their record 
achievement of 21 hours flying in close proximity to the satellites they had released. NASA 
planned to move Endeavour to Palmdale, California, for refurbishing.79 
 
31 May 
A team of NASA and university researchers announced the discovery of large quantities of 
ethane and methane gases in Comet Hyakutake, the first time scientists had detected such gases 
in a comet. The discovery led researchers to postulate that at least two basic types of comets 
exist. If validated by further research, the hypothesis would have significant ramifications for 
scientific theories regarding the formation of the Sun and planets. Michael J. Mumma, the lead 
researcher on the project, called the discovery of ethane in the comet “a blinding surprise.” The

NASA and the Italian Space Agency released the investigative report on the failed tethered 
satellite system (TSS) experiment conducted during Shuttle Columbia’s Mission STS-75 in 
February 1996. The 358-page report, produced by a board established to investigate the incident, 
concluded that a breach in the layer of insulation surrounding the tether conductor, possibly the 
result of contact with debris, led to the failure. According to the report, the breach in insulation 
allowed an electrical current to jump from a copper wire in the tether to an electrical ground, 
causing the breakage: “the tether failed as a result of arcing and burning of the tether, leading to 
a tensile failure after a significant portion of the tether had burned away.” The board noted that 
NASA scientists had already announced findings regarding tether current and voltage 
measurements, concluding that the unexpected breakage of Columbia’s tethered satellite did not 
indicate any fundamental problem with the concept of the TSS. Furthermore, the board 
recommended that during future experiments, scientists should take greater precautions to ensure 
that neither debris nor high-voltage arcing compromised the tether’s strength.81 
 
Arianespace, the commercial arm of the European Space Agency, suffered a major setback in its 
bid to maintain control of the satellite-launching market in the face of competition from U.S. 
companies. Only seconds after the launch of Ariane 5, a huge rocket intended to launch satellites, 
Arianespace had to blow up the rocket when it veered severely off course. Arianespace had spent 
10 years and more than US$7 billion to develop the 674-foot (205-meter), 821-ton (750,000-
kilogram or 750-tonne) vehicle. Also lost in the explosion were satellites valued at more than 
US$500 million. Arianespace had projected a launch reliability of 98.5 percent for the rocket, 
considering failure so unlikely that the company had guaranteed a free launch to customers if the 
launch failed. A spokesperson for Arianespace acknowledged the disappointment of the failed 
test, but promised that the company would continue as the world’s leader in launching satellites. 
Aerospace industry analysts predicted that U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin would 
likely gain an increased foothold in the market because of the European company’s misfortune.82 
 
7 June 
The experimental DC-XA flight vehicle completed a successful test flight, flying nearly 2,000 
feet (610 meters) above the desert of the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico and landing 
safely. NASA researchers and administrators hoped that the rocket would one day replace the 
Space Shuttle as the primary means of space exploration. The reusable, unpiloted rocket, taking 
off and landing from a vertical position, would cut significantly the costs of delivering payloads 
into orbit. NASA announced that the vehicle had been renamed Clipper Graham, in honor of

Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham. Graham, who died on 31 December 1995, had served as 
an advisor to President Ronald Reagan and had been an early proponent for the development of 
reusable rockets. Administrator Daniel S. Goldin expressed optimism that NASA would be able 
to replace the Shuttle with the DC-XA flight vehicle: “We are going to fly the [S]huttle safely 
until we can replace it. But, by God, we are going to replace the [S]huttle.”83

A team of astronomers announced at the American Astronomical Society convention that they 
had discovered ordinary vinegar in a stellar cloud 25,000 light-years away from Earth. The 
presence of an organic molecule, which may have played a role in the formation of life, excited 
scientists. “Acetic acid could have been one of the first steps toward the chemicals of life,” 
explained Lewis E. Snyder, a member of the research team that made the discovery. Scientists 
had discovered complex molecules in space before, but formic acid, discovered in 1975, was the 
only other basic molecule detected before the discovery of the vinegar.84 
 
12 June 
Kennedy Space Center (KSC) scientists began the most comprehensive testing to date on how 
plants produce food and oxygen in space. The experiment, part of NASA’s development of a 
Controlled Ecological Life Support System, called for the analysis of 128 potato plants and 6,500 
wheat seeds. NASA scientists planned for the study to last from one to three years. NASA 
agricultural engineer John Sager, praising NASA’s earlier success in producing crop species for 
space, explained the experiment’s significance: “If we plan to live in space . . . we must 
determine if this system will be as successful over longer periods of time.” Scientists were using 
KSC’s Biomass Production Chamber to test the crops in a space-like environment. NASA had 
begun in 1987 to test strains of crops and plants for their ability to produce oxygen and food in 
space.85 
 
13 June 
The Smithsonian Institution named former U.S. Navy pilot and aviation executive Donald D. 
Engen as Director of the National Air and Space Museum. Engen succeeded Martin O. Harwit, 
who had resigned amidst criticism of an exhibition about the Enola Gay atomic bomb mission. 
Some World War II veterans had deemed the exhibition too sympathetic to Japan, and some 
members of Congress had faulted the National Air and Space Museum for deviating from its 
mission of exhibiting the history of the United States’ aeronautical achievements. Smithsonian 
employees praised Engen’s appointment, suggesting that he would restore the museum’s 
credibility.86

launched 10 Gemini missions between 1965 and 1966, each spacecraft carrying two astronauts. 
Many staff members and astronauts involved in the Gemini program went on to work on the 
Apollo Moon program. Gemini astronauts included Neil A. Armstrong, Jim Lovell, and Edwin 
E. “Buzz” Aldrin Jr. The event organizers celebrated the achievements of the Gemini missions, 
in addition to raising funds to establish a permanent monument to the Gemini program.87 
 
20 June 
Shuttle Columbia lifted off from KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, embarking upon Mission 
STS-78. The Shuttle carried U.S. astronauts Terrence T. Henricks, Kevin R. Kregel, Richard M. 
Linnehan, Susan J. Helms, and Charles E. Brady Jr.; French astronaut Jean-Jacques Favier; and 
Canadian astronaut Robert B. Thrisk. NASA planned to use an orbiting research laboratory to 
conduct a variety of experiments during the mission. In addition to its human cargo, the Shuttle 
transported the payload for the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences, used to conduct 
research on musculoskeletal physiology and on the responses of living organisms to a low-
gravity environment.88 
 
21 June 
Russian officials announced that the necessity of cutting costs at the Russian Space Agency had 
caused a 40-day delay in returning cosmonauts Yuri I. Onufrienko and Yury V. Usachev from 
the Mir space station to Earth. Russian budget cuts had slowed the production of the Soyuz 
booster rockets needed to fuel a return trip for the cosmonauts. Because Mir was deteriorating, 
Russia could not leave it without a crew. This was the second time that financial and technical 
difficulties had led Russia to delay the return of the two men. The episode signaled a deepening 
crisis for the Russian space program, the United States’ key partner in building the International 
Space Station (ISS).89 
 
24 June 
Astronauts aboard Shuttle Columbia conducted an overnight experiment on the effects of space 
travel on the body’s biological clock. Four astronauts slept with special caps equipped with 
electrodes to monitor their brain and muscle activity. Astronauts in space have no exposure to the 
once-daily rising and setting Sun, which helps trigger a regular sleep pattern on Earth. In space 
the Sun rises and sets more than a dozen times each “day.” NASA administrators planned the 
experiment because they recognized the value of restful sleep for astronauts working in space 
and were concerned that sleep loss would become a greater disadvantage the longer an astronaut 
stayed in space. With the ISS on the horizon, NASA researchers considered the possible effects 
on astronauts of record-setting stays in space a significant issue. “Sleep disruption is something 
that has to be taken seriously,” said Timothy H. Monk, the lead researcher on the project.90

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) identified what they believed to be the 
most distant objects observed to date. Researchers based at State University of New York at 
Stony Brook found several dozen galaxies so far away that they might have existed when the 
universe was less than 5 percent of its present age. The team of astronomers made its 
calculations on the distances of the galaxies from the Earth by relying on the relationship 
between speed and distance in the expanding universe. According to the scientific understanding 
of the speed-distance relationship, “the expansion of the universe causes the light from distant 
galaxies to be ‘redshifted’,” meaning that, because of the expansion of space, light leaving a 
distant galaxy as blue arrives at the HST as red light. The redshifting phenomenon allows 
researchers to tentatively measure the distance the light has traveled. Noting that other factors, 
such as dust, also might make a galaxy’s light red, Mark E. Dickinson of the Space Telescope 
Science Institute categorized the study as “enticing,” but also clarified, “it’s not a proof.”91 
 
27 June 
NASA’s Galileo spacecraft completed a flyby of Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede, passing only 
519 miles (835 kilometers) above the moon’s surface. NASA had equipped Galileo with 10 
scientific instruments to gather data from the expedition. The instruments began making 
measurements on 23 June, as the probe approached Ganymede. Images revealed an icy surface, 
with bright, clean ice covering part of the moon and darker, dirty ice covering the rest. This was 
the first data gathered during a collection mission planned for 1996 and 1997, in which Galileo 
would pass Ganymede before completing 11 orbits of Jupiter and surveying the planet’s other 
moons. NASA monitored Galileo’s progress through its Deep Space Network, using control 
stations in California, Spain, and Australia. Scientists and engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory had built the Galileo spacecraft.92 
 
JULY 1996 
2 July 
NASA successfully launched its Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) 
aboard the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite, via an Orbital Sciences Pegasus XL 
launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base. A jet flying roughly 7 miles above the 
California coast released the rocket that was carrying the satellite, placing the TOMS-EP in a 
successful orbit. The McMurdo Sound Tracking Station in Antarctica acquired the satellite 
almost immediately and determined that the spacecraft was functioning properly. After it reached 
a circular orbit, the TOMS-EP was ready to conduct its scientific mission.93 
 
Paul F. Holloway, Director of Langley Research Center (LARC) in Hampton, Virginia, 
announced his retirement. Holloway had served at LARC for his entire aerospace career, 
beginning in 1960. He became the Center’s Director in 1991, overseeing 4,500 employees and a 
budget of more than US$600 million. During his tenure, Holloway published 42 technical 
articles in the fields of hypersonic aerodynamics; boundary layer transition and flow separation;

analysis of entry flight mechanics; and Earth orbital and planetary space missions. NASA 
awarded Holloway its Outstanding Leadership Medal, Exceptional Service Medal, Distinguished 
Service Medal, and Equal Employment Opportunity Medal. Holloway also received the 
Presidential Rank of Meritorious Service and two Senior Executive Service Distinguished 
Presidential Rank Awards. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin summarized Holloway’s 
contributions to NASA, saying that his “career spans almost the entire history of the Space Age, 
and his many achievements at Langley are a tribute to his talent, his professionalism, and his 
dedication to the importance of NASA aeronautical programs.”94 
 
Lockheed Martin won the contract to design and build the X-33 test vehicle, a scaled-down 
model of the reusable launch vehicle (RLV) that NASA planned as an eventual replacement for 
the Space Shuttle. NASA set a budget of US$941 million for the project. In announcing the new 
contract, Administrator Daniel S. Goldin expressed NASA’s high hopes for the project: “We 
want to develop technologies that will allow industry to build a vehicle that takes days, not 
months, to turnaround; dozens, not thousands of people to operate; reliability ten times better 
than anything flying today; and launch costs that are a tenth of what they are now. Our goal is a 
reusable launch vehicle that will cut the cost of sending a pound of payload to orbit from 
[US]$10,000 to [US]$1,000.” Lockheed planned to invest US$220 million in the RLV project. 
The X-33 plan built upon the successful engineering of the Clipper Graham (DC-XA), launched 
from White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The agreement between NASA and Lockheed 
Martin split the risk between government and industry. Although NASA passed over Rockwell 
International for the contract, Rockwell designed the vehicle’s engine.95 
 
4 July 
Reuters News Service published an internal NASA memorandum written by an independent 
safety commission, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, cautioning NASA against cutting the 
budget for the Shuttle program too quickly. According to the panel’s analysis, NASA’s attempts 
to reduce costs by conducting fewer Shuttle safety inspections and by transferring responsibility 
for day-to-day operations of the Shuttle program to United Space Alliance had demoralized 
NASA’s workforce at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The memo made clear the opinion of the 
safety inspectors: “Overall, it was the clear consensus of the team that a cooling off period is 
absolutely necessary if KSC operations are to continue safely . . . without this hiatus the safety 
risk is likely unacceptable.”96 
 
5 July 
In a study released in the journal Science, Charles P. Sonett detailed the results of his research 
measuring changes in the motion of Earth. Sonett reported that tidal forces from the gravitational 
force of the Moon had caused the Earth’s rotation to slow gradually over a period of millions of 
years. About 900 million years ago, according to Sonett, the length of the Earth’s day was only

Earth.”97 
 
7 July 
Shuttle Columbia landed at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, ending the longest Space Shuttle 
mission ever. The mission, lasting nearly 17 days, set a new space endurance record for the crew. 
The astronauts had bested their previous record by nearly 7 hours. Columbia had carried into 
space a torch for the 1996 Olympic relay, and upon landing, two members of the crew joined the 
Olympic torch relay team in a special ceremony. The astronauts had overcome several small 
malfunctions to conduct the successful mission and land the Shuttle on time. Less than 2 hours 
before the Shuttle’s scheduled arrival, the crew had discovered a clogged cooling line, but the 
astronauts were able to flush ice from the system to clear the line. In addition, the mission 
brought to light a potential ongoing problem for Columbia. In studying the launch, NASA 
officials had observed gas and flames issuing from the rocket boosters, probably through the O-
ring joints used to connect the booster’s fuel segments. Although Columbia’s crew was not in 
danger, NASA officials decided that the Shuttle would not launch again until scientists had 
determined how well the new water-based adhesive would function under extreme heat. NASA 
had discontinued the adhesive used previously on the rocket boosters, because the adhesive was 
an ozone-depleting agent.98 
 
9 July 
NASA announced the recipients of the 1996 Software of the Year Award, honoring those 
individuals who had created software enhancing NASA’s mission and the U.S. aerospace 
industry. Linked Windows Interactive Data System, developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, and the Tetrahedral Unstructured Software System, developed by LARC, won the 
1996 awards. The former system allowed scientists to examine geophysical and climatological 
data gathered from satellites, and the latter aided researchers in studying problems with 
“spacecraft, rotorcraft, automotive, turbomachinery, and medical analysis and design.”99 
 
14 July 
NASA announced the six-week delay of astronaut Shannon W. Lucid’s return from her outpost 
aboard the Mir space station. NASA made the schedule change because of concerns about the 
reliability of the joint sealant used on the Shuttle’s reusable rocket boosters during the June 
launch of Columbia. NASA planned to replace the booster before launching Atlantis, scheduled 
to retrieve Lucid. The reusable rocket boosters, packed with fuel, launch the Shuttle. After 
pushing the Shuttle into space, the boosters fall off and descend, attached to parachutes, into the 
ocean. Upon retrieving the rocket boosters, engineers disassemble them into smaller pieces, 
repack them with fuel, and rebuild them for a new Shuttle launch, sealing each of the rocket’s 
three field joints with an O-ring. NASA sought to fortify these joints further, and the adhesive 
used to secure them, before launching another Shuttle mission. Space Shuttle Program Manager

Thomas W. Holloway stated that NASA remained confident in the overall design of the rocket 
booster and in the joint, but wanted to take no avoidable risks.100 
 
15 July 
Astronaut Shannon W. Lucid established a new American record for the longest space mission. 
Lucid conducted a news conference from the Mir space station marking her record of 115 days 
and 44 minutes, which eclipsed the record of her predecessor aboard Mir, Norman E. Thagard. 
With the changed date for the rendezvous between Shuttle Atlantis and Mir, NASA predicted 
that Lucid would also break the record number of 170 days spent by a woman in space.101 
 
NASA named the crew members for Mission STS-84, the sixth scheduled docking mission 
between the Space Shuttle and Russia’s Mir space station. NASA selected Charles J. Precourt as 
Mission Commander and Eileen M. Collins as Shuttle Pilot, with Mission Specialists Edward T. 
Lu and Carlos I. Noriega and European Space Agency astronaut Jean-François Clervoy rounding 
out the crew. The scheduled Atlantis mission also included Mission Specialist C. Michael Foale, 
who planned to stay on Mir for four months.102 
 
18 July 
NASA released new images of Io, one of Jupiter’s moons, obtained by the Galileo spacecraft. 
Michael J. S. Belton of the National Optical Astronomical Observatories pointed out that radical 
changes had occurred on the moon during the 17 years between Galileo and the first observation 
of Io, via the Voyager spacecraft in 1979. According to Belton, active volcanoes had altered the 
color of the moon’s surface, forming deposits of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that painted the surface 
white.103 
 
20 July 
NASA commemorated the 20th anniversary of Viking 1’s landing on Mars, the first time that a 
spacecraft had successfully descended to the surface of the planet. NASA marked the occasion 
with an address from Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and the celebration of Mars Day at the 
Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. Viking 1 had searched for life on 
Mars, but at the end of its quest, scientists had found no evidence of life on Mars. As it 
celebrated its accomplishments, NASA continued its efforts to learn more about Mars throughout 
its 20th anniversary year, with the development of Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder.104 
 
22 July 
While constructing a piping trench, two surveyors at NASA’s LARC located the fossil remains 
of a 3.5 million-year-old, 30-foot (9-meter) baleen whale. The workers found the whale’s skull, 
tympanic bulla, vertebrae, and rib fragments. Langley loaned the remains to the nearby College 
of William and Mary. Gerald H. Johnson, a geologist at the College of William and Mary, 
suggested that the discovery provided a clue to the history of the Langley site, indicating that the

24 July 
As Congress prepared to vote on NASA’s budget, Thomas J. Shulz of the U.S. General 
Accounting Office (GAO) testified before a U.S. Senate committee that NASA would likely 
exceed its projected budget for constructing the International Space Station (ISS) and making it 
operational. NASA refuted the claim. GAO’s report suggested that NASA had made unrealistic 
cost estimates and that its system to monitor costs and schedule was inadequate. The report also 
outlined GAO’s concerns about Russia’s continued commitment to the ISS endeavor. Shulz 
testified that “in a worst-case situation, these issues could threaten the future of the program, 
especially if they result in significantly higher cost estimates and substantial schedule delays.” 
NASA’s spokesperson on the issue Wilbur C. Trafton defended NASA’s projected budget and its 
relationship with Russia. Trafton pointed out that Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. and NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had procured a new agreement during a July meeting in Russia, 
indicating the solidity of the partnership between the United States and Russia. GAO’s critique 
occurred against the backdrop of the continuing quest during the mid-1990s to make NASA 
more cost effective.106 
 
31 July 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced the appointment of Jeremiah F. Creedon as 
Director of LARC. Creedon succeeded Paul F. Holloway, who had served for 36 years at LARC. 
With this appointment, Creedon moved up from his position as LARC’s Director of the Airframe 
Systems Program Office to return to the research center where he had begun his engineering 
career 33 years earlier. During his career at NASA, Creedon had received the Presidential Rank 
of Meritorious Executive in the Senior Executive Service, NASA’s Outstanding Leadership 
Medal, and the Presidential Rank of Distinguished Executive in Senior Executive Service.107 
 
AUGUST 1996 
1 August 
The Boeing Company announced that it had purchased most of the aerospace and defense 
holdings of its competitor Rockwell International Corporation. The US$3 billion deal 
restructured the two companies in drastically different ways, permitting Boeing to increase 
significantly its potential to win government aerospace contracts, while Rockwell International 
turned its attention to the lucrative commercial market in automation. Whereas Boeing solidified 
its established dominance in the commercial jetliner construction business, Rockwell left behind 
its signature industry⎯the company had been nearly synonymous with NASA’s piloted space 
program. However, in the face of dwindling government contracts, Rockwell had been 
concentrating for years on developing its commercial product lines. Although the merger was not 
a surprise, the sale of the company responsible for engineering the Apollo spacecraft and the B-1

bombers marked the end of an era in the aerospace industry. The Wall Street Journal estimated 
that Boeing’s share of aerospace and defense revenues would increase to US$8−9 billion 
annually.108 
 
NASA scientist Jay R. Hermon published an article in Geophysical Research Letters, claiming 
that he had used NASA’s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer spacecraft to demonstrate the 
dramatic increase, between 1979 and 1992, of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the 
Earth’s surface. The article, “UV-B Increases (1979−1992) from Decreases in Total Ozone,” 
explained that the ozone necessary to protect the Earth from the Sun’s harmful UV rays was 
declining. Herman found that annual UV-B exposure had increased 6.8 percent per decade at 55º 
north latitude and 9.9 percent per decade at 55º south latitude. Both latitudes had significant 
population centers that emitted harmful emissions destructive to the ozone layer.109 
 
2 August 
NASA and the U.S. Air Force unveiled to the public an “intelligent” aircraft, using a 
computerized system to “learn as it flies.” Researchers had engineered the hypersonic aircraft to 
take inventory of flight maneuvers performed while operating under remote control, eventually 
using its acquired knowledge to develop the capability to fly itself. According to the flight 
researchers, the aircraft’s control system would create a continually altering set of “control 
laws,” to optimize flight performance. After the aircraft had perfected its system, it could assist 
pilots in performing such tasks as landing partially damaged planes. The intelligent aircraft could 
also enable flight at speeds and altitudes that human pilots could hardly ever achieve, while still 
maintaining adequate control of an aircraft.110 
 
5 August 
NASA convened a five-member investigation board to determine the cause of the postlanding 
explosion of the Clipper Graham (DC-XA) rocket on 31 July 1996. The Clipper Graham had 
successfully flown a 2-minute, 20-second flight profile, but had tipped over and caught fire after 
landing when one of its four landing gears failed to deploy. The DC-XA had tested successfully 
three times before the explosion destroyed it. Former astronaut Vance Brand chaired the panel, 
bringing together representatives from NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center, Marshall Space 
Flight Center, Langley Research Center, and Kennedy Space Center. Researchers hoped the 
investigation would illuminate any flaws in the Clipper Graham’s design, allowing engineers to 
make necessary adjustments in future prototypes.111

NASA reported that a team of scientists from Johnson Space Center and Stanford University had 
found evidence that “strongly suggested” that primitive life existed on the planet Mars. During a 
two-year study, the researchers discovered what they believed to be organic molecules of 
Martian origin on a potato-sized meteorite, which members of the National Science Foundation’s 
Antarctica Meteorite Program had found in 1984. Scientists estimated that the meteorite was 
about 4.5 billion years old. According to the team’s report, published in Science magazine, the 
remnants on the meteorite shared several mineral characteristics indicating biological activity, 
possibly even containing microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms. The minute 
scale of the evidence required the careful research of the team of specialists in the fields of 
microbiology, mineralogy, and chemistry. The largest of the possible fossils measured about 
1/100th the diameter of a human hair. Only with recently developed technological instruments, 
including a dual-laser mass spectrometer, were the scientists able to make any substantial 
observations.112 The announcement generated immediate excitement in the scientific community 
and in the mass media, although some scientists responded with a multitude of critical questions. 
The researchers carefully qualified their report, stating, “It is very difficult to prove life existed 
3.6 billion years ago on Earth, let alone on Mars.”113 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
pledged to make samples of the meteorite available to scientists throughout the world, to 
encourage a full scientific investigation.114 
 
13 August 
NASA released images from its Galileo spacecraft, indicating that water might have existed on 
Jupiter’s moon Europa in the past, or might still exist there. According to scientists studying the 
images, Europa may have “warm ice” on its surface. Finding such ice would help scientists 
determine whether Europa’s climate could support life. “What we are really looking for is niches 
that could support life,” Ronald Greeley, a Galileo team scientist clarified, at a press briefing 
releasing the images. At first glance, the pictures, shot from a distance of about 95,700 miles 
(154,000 kilometers), seemed to depict a series of white stripes stretched across Europa’s 
landscape. However, the stripes were actually ice glaciers, long of interest to scientists. 
Researchers had long suspected that Europa might be one of the places in the universe 
possessing water and, therefore, an environment that could support life. NASA Administrator 
Daniel S. Goldin expressed “skeptical optimism” at the Europa findings and urged the scientific 
community to examine the pictures further, in a tempered reaction similar to his stance regarding 
the discovery, one week earlier, of microbiological evidence of life on Mars.115

The Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-24 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan 
carrying cosmonauts Valery G. Korzun and Alexander Y. Kaleri and the first female French 
astronaut, Claudie André-Deshays. The crew of Soyuz planned to resupply Mir’s long-term 
crew.116 
 
19 August 
The Russian Soyuz TM-24, which launched on 17 August, arrived at Mir, carrying France’s first 
female astronaut, Claudie André-Deshays. André-Deshays, a rheumatologist, joined Russian 
cosmonauts Valery G. Korzun and Alexander Y. Kaleri on the flight from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. She planned to study the effects of weightlessness on the human 
body during her stay aboard Mir. The crew of Soyuz joined Shannon W. Lucid, the American 
astronaut who had been aboard the Russian space station since March. Reporting the safe arrival 
of André-Deshays at Mir, the head of France’s space program also announced that France would 
likely end its short-term space missions conducted aboard Russian vehicles. France intended to 
focus on longer, less frequent missions, facilitating more detailed research programs. The change 
in policy went into effect immediately, with France canceling two French-Russian missions 
planned for 1998 and 1999.117 
 
21 August 
NASA launched its Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) Explorer from a test range near Vandenberg 
Air Force Base in California. Engineers had designed the FAST vehicle to travel about 1,500 
miles (2,400 kilometers) above Earth, measuring energetic particles, and magnetic and electric 
fields, at high altitudes where auroras form, to explore the “physical processes that produce 
aurora borealis and aurora australis.” NASA’s Small Explorer Project, tasked with providing 
frequent and low-cost research missions for astrophysics investigations, had carried out the 
FAST mission as the second in a series of five missions.118 
 
23 August 
NASA’s analysts at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), who had investigated the causes of 
the Challenger explosion, joined the probe into the crash of TWA flight 800, which exploded 
near Long Island, New York, on 17 July 1996. NASA offered the services of its MSFC 
investigative team to analyze why the center fuel tank of the Boeing 747 had exploded. Officials 
from the National Transportation Safety Board led the investigation, with support from a variety 
of other agencies, including NASA, the U.S. Navy, and the FBI.119

The Galileo spacecraft lost some of its collected data when a problem with one of its computer 
processors caused a shutdown of nonessential systems. Project Manager William J. O’Neil said 
that much of the lost data was of little consequence to researchers, but that data from Galileo’s 
continuous study of Jupiter’s magnetic field had suffered a significant loss, creating an 
information gap of about one week. The episode, which occurred in the midst of NASA’s string 
of impressive research achievements, highlighted the difficulty of directing a data-gathering 
probe thousands of miles from Earth’s surface.120 
 
28 August  
NASA and Orbital Sciences Corporation signed a contract, which was not a cooperative 
agreement, whereby Orbital Sciences would build a new X-34 reusable launch vehicle, smaller 
than that originally planned. NASA had first made public the original X-34 program in 1994. 
NASA had intended the program, also known as the Reusable Small Booster Program, to 
stimulate the development of a reusable commercial launch vehicle to place smaller payloads in 
low orbit. In addition, NASA planned for the X-34 program to demonstrate that an industry-led 
partnership between NASA and the aerospace industry could accomplish this objective within 30 
to 36 months and within a fixed government budget. On 12 January 1995, NASA released a final 
cooperative agreement notice for the X-34 program, and in March 1995, NASA selected Orbital 
Sciences Corporation as its industry partner. Over the next eight months, as design of the X-34 
progressed, problems arose over the selection of an appropriate rocket engine, resulting in 
NASA’s temporarily shutting down the program on 2 November 1995. In January 1996, Orbital 
Sciences Corporation suggested that NASA explore the potential of a smaller vehicle. Orbital 
Sciences then issued stop-work orders to all its X-34 subcontractors, effectively ending the 
program. Because NASA wanted to use remaining federal dollars to develop a smaller vehicle, 
capable of demonstrating various reusable launch technologies, it rebid the contract in March 
1996. On 10 June 1996, NASA selected Orbital Sciences to build the new X-34.121 
 
SEPTEMBER 1996 
1 September 
More than 200 experts met in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to plan the design and implementation 
of a new fleet of radar satellites. The group emphasized the recent geological discoveries made 
with data from radar satellites, especially from those satellites tracking the movements and shifts 
in Earth’s plates that have been impossible to track until recently. The U.S. Geological Survey 
and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory sponsored the event. Geophysicist Howard A. Zebker 
described the satellites as a “great leap forward. It’s like suddenly having [x]-rays to see inside a 
body.”122

Hurricane Fran delayed the launch of Shuttle Atlantis. NASA managers decided to move the 
Shuttle off the launchpad when it became clear that the hurricane’s path lay through the 
southeast region of the United States. Because of the slow rollback of the vehicle from the 
launchpad to the assembly building, managers determined that they would not be able to meet 
the scheduled 14 September departure date.123 
 
5 September 
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope identified 18 star clusters that they believed to 
be embryonic galaxies. According to the New York Times, because the clusters resided 11 billion 
light-years from Earth, essentially, the scientists had glimpsed back in time. The observations 
supported a theory that galaxies begin with stars grouping together. The astronomers from 
Arizona State University and the University of Alabama called the discovery “the first page in an 
otherwise blank book.”124 
 
NASA named astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria to replace astronaut Wendy B. Lawrence as 
NASA’s Director of Operations at Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. The 
job of the director was to coordinate the training of U.S. astronauts headed for the Mir space 
station and to act as liaison between NASA and the Russian Space Agency.125 
 
6 September 
NASA awarded grants to fund 19 studies that researchers had proposed in response to a NASA 
research announcement. NASA awarded a total of US$2.9 million for the studies, which focused 
on innovative mission concepts in space physics. NASA expected most of the studies to last one 
or two years and to cost about US$100,000 each year. NASA planned to use the studies in 
forming its space science strategic plan and in considering future missions.126 
 
7 September 
Because of delays in launching Shuttle Atlantis, astronaut Shannon W. Lucid broke Elena V. 
Kondakova’s record for longest single flight in space by a woman. NASA engineers had delayed 
the launch because they suspected that the O-rings on the solid rocket boosters were faulty and 
wanted to replace them. During Lucid’s stay in space aboard Mir, she and the two Russian 
cosmonauts had conducted a variety of scientific experiments.127 
 
11 September 
NASA announced that engineers from NASA and Lockheed Martin had completed successful 
tests on a prototype, lightweight, external fuel tank for the Shuttle. The tests measured the tank’s 
strength and reliability under conditions exceeding recommended flight certification. NASA’s 
External Tank Project Manager Parker V. Counts reported that the tests had demonstrated that 
the unique composition of the very lightweight tanks did not reduce their strength. NASA had

awarded Lockheed Martin the contract to produce the lighter tanks, to enable the Shuttle to carry 
cargo to the high inclination orbit where the International Space Station (ISS) would reside. To 
build the tanks, NASA had used aluminum lithium, a material both lighter and stronger than the 
metal alloy used in previous tank construction. NASA had designed the tanks to weigh 7,500 
pounds (3,400 kilograms) less than the models used on earlier Shuttles.128 
 
12 September 
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) received the first images from the 
United States’ Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), as the instrument orbited aboard the 
Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS). GSFC scientists noted the superior 
quality of the initial images. ADEOS continued a long line of satellites launched to aid scientists 
in observing total levels of ozone and volcanic sulfur dioxide. Because of data obtained from the 
TOMS instruments deployed by NASA, millions of Americans became aware of the ozone hole 
and began to use ozone as a household word.  The latest TOMS instrument joined a series of 
instruments aboard ADEOS, including the Improved Limb Atmospheric Sounder, the 
Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases, and the Retroreflector in Space.129 
 
13 September 
In Marshall Space Flight Center’s (MSFC’s) underwater weightless simulator, NASA began 
testing a remotely controlled robot created by a team of researchers from the University of 
Maryland. Team leaders nicknamed the robot Ranger, predicting that it would one day assist 
astronauts aboard the Shuttle or the ISS. Project Manager Joseph Parrish pointed out that 
astronauts often use valuable spacewalk time completing mundane tasks, such as collecting tools, 
establishing footholds, and cleaning up. Scientists hoped Ranger could perform such tasks under 
the command of an operator located in space or even that of an operator at NASA’s command 
center. The 8-foot-long (2.4-meter-long), 1,700-pound (770-kilogram) robot used gas thrusters, 
robotic arms, lights, and cameras. The academic project filled a void in experimental robot 
design, a program affected by NASA’s budget cuts. Allowing university researchers and 
professors to design and test the robot cost NASA about US$8 million, far less than NASA 
would pay for similar projects contracted through an aerospace firm. During the tests, the 
University of Maryland’s team operated Ranger remotely from its campus hundreds of miles 
away from MSFC’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama.130 
 
16 September 
Shuttle Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
Hurricane Fran had delayed the launch and the subsequent Shuttle–Mir rendezvous. The mission 
was the fourth Mir docking mission for a U.S. Space Shuttle. William F. Readdy commanded the 
six-astronaut crew aboard Atlantis, including Pilot Terrence W. Wilcutt and Mission Specialists 
Jay Apt, Thomas D. Akers, Carl E. Walz, and John E. Blaha. During Mission STS-79, the 
Shuttle crew planned to retrieve astronaut Shannon W. Lucid from Mir, leaving astronaut John 
Blaha as her replacement. The Shuttle carried 4,600 pounds (2,090 kilograms) of supplies to Mir.

Mission STS-79, the 17th flight of Shuttle Atlantis, entailed the largest transfer of supplies ever 
made to Mir.131 
 
19 September 
The White House released a new national space policy, the first such directive since the Cold 
War. White House policy advisors constructed the plan over an 18-month period, amidst 
government-wide calls for tightening NASA’s budget. The policy statement called for 
controlling costs by using private-sector industry to build, develop, and operate selected space 
technologies. The directive also advocated drawing together civilian and military space 
activities, and forging closer ties with foreign countries conducting space research. The Clinton 
administration reversed several decisions of President George H. W. Bush, most noticeably the 
former President’s call to land an astronaut on Mars. Space experts called the initiative too costly 
and dangerous. Instead, the Clinton plan relied on robots to explore Mars and targeted the ISS as 
the hub of human-based space exploration, as well as enshrining the “faster, better, cheaper” 
mantra of NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin. Congress planned to hold a funding summit in 
the months following the release of the policy, to bring together key political, military, and 
science officials.132 
 
26 September 
Astronaut Shannon W. Lucid returned to Earth after her record-setting space sojourn on Russia’s 
Mir space station. Space Shuttle Atlantis touched down at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
delivering Lucid home to a celebration honoring her 188 days spent in space, most of it aboard 
Mir. During her mission, Lucid had traveled 75 million miles (121 million kilometers), the 
equivalent of 157 trips to the Moon and back. Doctors stood by to greet the Shuttle, expecting 
Lucid to experience some muscle weakness as her body re-accustomed itself to the effects of 
gravity. President William J. Clinton called to congratulate Lucid, saying, “We are all so proud 
of you.”133 
 
28 September 
During a top-level meeting between officials of the United States and Russia, NASA made 
public a shift in its policy, announcing that U.S. astronauts would not always have command 
aboard the ISS. In a compromise meant to encourage Russia to build its portion of the station, 
NASA conceded that astronauts from other countries would have the opportunity to command 
the ISS for significant periods.134

Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) at Edwards Air Force Base in California commemorated 
its 50th anniversary with a celebration called Discovery Through Flight Research. The Center got 
its start when five aeronautical engineers from Langley Research Center arrived to explore flight 
beyond the speed of sound, in preparation for the X-1 tests, featuring pilot Charles E. “Chuck” 
Yeager at the controls. Researchers at DFRC contributed to a wide variety of aeronautical 
achievements, including breaking the sound barrier and helping launch the Space Shuttle 
program. At the age of 50, DFRC employed 900 government and civilian contractor 
employees.135 
 
With the push of a button at GSFC, NASA discontinued use of the International Ultraviolet 
Explorer satellite, which had been in orbit since 1978. When NASA sent a signal to the satellite 
to empty its fuel, the satellite effectively went to sleep, spinning off into space. Although NASA 
had originally designed the satellite to spend only three years in space, scientists continued to use 
it to gather data far beyond the spacecraft’s anticipated lifespan. NASA ended control of the 
satellite to save between US$1 and US$2 million annually in operating costs. GSFC had 
operated the satellite as part of a three-way agreement with the European Space Agency and the 
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council of the United Kingdom. More than 2,000 
researchers from around the world had made observations from the satellite, research that had 
directly led to the publication of more than 3,200 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals.136 
 
OCTOBER 1996 
1 October 
United Space Alliance (USA), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corporation and Rockwell 
International, took over daily operations of NASA’s Space Shuttle fleet. NASA had previously 
used private contractors. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin marked the occasion as “the first 
day of a new space program in America.” Financial experts forecast that the government-private 
industry pact might be worth as much as US$12 billion by the end of its 10-year venture. 
According to the agreement, USA shouldered the responsibility for the 12 Shuttle-related 
contracts carried out at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Johnson 
Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. NASA stated that USA might take over additional tasks 
in the future. NASA had decided to consolidate the Shuttle operations with USA to improve cost 
efficiency, a vital step in light of congressional budget cuts. Kent Black, the CEO of USA, 
predicted that the move would save NASA as much as 20 percent of its operating budget for the 
Shuttle in the first year of the contract alone. Even with the turnover, NASA maintained 
complete control over planning Shuttle missions, selecting astronauts, and approving launches of 
the Shuttle. NASA planned to take on an oversight role similar to that of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, rewarding USA with bonuses for savings and imposing monetary penalties if the 
company failed to achieve “very good” safety ratings.137

NASA introduced a new technology with the potential to make much smaller and more efficient 
electronic devices: the Thin-Layer Composite-Unimorph Piezoelectric Driver and Sensor 
(THUNDER). Researchers at Langley Research Center (LARC) recognized the potential of 
piezoelectric material, because of its well-known capability to generate movement when 
subjected to an electric current. NASA hoped that the THUNDER technology would improve 
devices in “electronics, optics, jitter (irregular motion) suppression, noise cancellation, pumps, 
valves and a variety of other fields.” LARC’s interdisciplinary team had improved upon already 
available commercial-grade piezoelectric material, producing a more durable, cheaper, and more 
effective product. R&D Magazine announced that it would honor THUNDER as one of its top 
100 most technologically significant new products of the year. Six companies signed agreements 
with NASA to develop THUNDER, and a dozen other companies expressed interest in 
negotiating similar pacts.138 
 
3 October 
China announced it would participate in an international collaborative space research project for 
the first time in its history. Chinese scientists planned to assist their colleagues from Russia and 
the United States in the future Discovery mission. Although China had no plans to send an 
astronaut on the Shuttle, Chinese aerospace engineers volunteered to construct the sophisticated 
magnets needed to build a magnetic spectrometer. The project was the first time the usually 
secretive Chinese space science program had opened itself to outside scrutiny.139 
 
NASA discovered the second of two misplaced hand tools left inside the propulsion system of 
the recently landed Shuttle Atlantis. Although the Shuttle had experienced no problems during its 
10-day flight, NASA formed an investigative panel to determine who had left the tools inside the 
Shuttle’s engine compartment after completing work. Inspectors had discovered the first missing 
tool inside the electronic control compartment of the Shuttle’s reusable rocket booster when they 
retrieved the booster from the Atlantic Ocean shortly after the launch. Workers discovered the 
second tool during a routine postflight inspection of Atlantis’s rocket engine compartment. 
Although the tools likely posed no threat to the safety of the Shuttle crew, a NASA 
representative said that, for safety reasons, NASA intended to find out how workers had made 
the error and, if possible, to identify the Shuttle contractor responsible.140 
 
8 October 
President William J. Clinton signed legislation ending funding for the federal helium reserve. 
The United States, through the Bureau of Mines, had bought and stockpiled helium since the 
1960s⎯expending more than US$250 million. Experts estimated that the U.S. government’s 
helium reserve could supply the world for more than 10 years and the federal government for 80. 
The legislation to end the reserve, spearheaded by U.S. Representative Christopher Cox (R-CA), 
closed down the helium facility outside Amarillo, Texas. NASA planned to sell the helium 
slowly, over a period of 18 years, so that the sales would not destabilize the worldwide helium 
market. The closure had the potential to affect NASA, the federal government’s largest user of

helium. At the time of the reserve’s closure, NASA was using about 70 million cubic feet (2 
million cubic meters) of helium annually to pressurize Shuttle fuel tanks, among other uses.141 
 
10 October 
NASA researchers at Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) completed the testing of the F-
16XL at Edwards Air Force Base. The tests had taken more than one year to complete. Scientists 
were studying how the modified F-16 flew with US$14 million laminar-flow gloves on its wings. 
The data they collected demonstrated that the glove had reduced the turbulent layer of air that 
passes over an airplane’s wing during flight. Project Manager Carol A. Reukauf called the tests 
successful. NASA hoped the results would provide manufacturers with a new technology that 
would improve aeronautical design, decreasing air drag on airplanes and, consequently, reducing 
the fuel required to fly.142 
 
11 October 
NASA marked the 50-year anniversary of the Bell X-1 aircraft’s first flight, which took place at 
the site of Edwards Air Force Base, home of NASA’s DFRC. According to Jay Miller, the author 
of The X-Planes: X-1 to X-33, the X-1 had given flight researchers and engineers their first full-
scale tool to study transonic aerodynamics. The Bell Aircraft Corporation, the U.S. Army Air 
Forces (predecessor of the U.S. Air Force), and NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory 
Committee for Aeronautics, had collaborated to get the first test plane off the ground. The X-1 
test not only provided aeronautical data, but also pioneered the test methods later adopted by 
DFRC flight researchers.143 
 
15 October 
Russia postponed the scheduled launch of Progress M-33, a cargo vehicle loaded with supplies 
for the two Russian cosmonauts and the one American astronaut aboard the Mir space station. 
The delay highlighted once again the severe budget crisis of the Russian Space Agency. A lack 
of funding held up the production of the rocket booster needed to send the craft into space. The 
crew on Mir had sufficient supplies aboard the space station, but missed the visit from Earth. 
Besides supplying food, regular planned visits provided needed contact for the space dwellers. 
The postponement was the fourth time in 1996 that Russia had delayed the scheduled launch to 
Mir because of problems paying for the production of Soyuz-U boosters. Reuters announced that 
because of the delay, a group of laboratory monkeys, already wired to monitor the effects of 
space travel, would die without ever leaving Earth.144 
 
18 October 
NASA announced the completion of a major benchmark in the development of its Advanced X-
ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), as engineers completed the delicate task of assembling the

For the first time in its 30-year history, KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, welcomed the public 
for an open house. Nearly 40,000 visitors came to KSC for the occasion. NASA allowed visitors 
to drive directly down the road used by the astronauts and up to Shuttle Columbia, sitting on the 
launchpad. Many visitors commented on how worn the Shuttle looked, after its many launches 
and reentries. The details of the Shuttle’s appearance were not visible to viewers watching the 
Shuttle on television. NASA officials also opened the Vehicle Assembly Building, one of the 
largest structures in the world. Astronauts were available to greet the public.146 
 
22 October 
NASA announced the retirement of Jay F. Honeycutt, Director of KSC. A search for Honeycutt’s 
successor began immediately following the announcement. Honeycutt had joined NASA in 1966 
after working as an engineer for Redstone Arsenal. He had begun as an engineer in flight 
operations and had worked at JSC, later training Apollo astronauts for the lunar landings, and 
had moved to NASA Headquarters in 1981. Honeycutt had transferred to KSC in 1989 as 
Director of Shuttle Management and Operations and had become Director of KSC in 1995. 
Honeycutt had won two Exceptional Service Medals, the Special Achievement Award, NASA’s 
Outstanding Leadership Medal, NASA’s Equal Employment Opportunity Award, and the 
Meritorious Executive Presidential Rank Award.147 
 
24 October 
DFRC test pilot Edward T. Schneider received the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics Chanute Flight Test Award for his work testing the F-18 High Alpha Research 
Vehicle at extremely high angles of attack. The Institute honored Schneider at the World 
Aviation Congress and Exposition, held in Los Angeles, California. Schneider had participated 
in NASA’s Attack Research Program, meant to improve the control and maneuverability of high-
performance aircraft. He tested the thrust-vectoring control system installed in the F-18, which 
allowed pilots to make high-angle motions and still maintain control of their planes. Schneider 
spent nine years testing the F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle during his distinguished 18-year 
career as a test pilot. Schneider had received NASA’s Exceptional Service Medal in 1996.148

A NASA research team published in the Journal of Geophysical Research its findings on urban-
like pollution over the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. The team used data gathered from an 
experiment called the Transport and Chemistry near the Equator of the Atlantic (TRACE-A), 
conducted with the Brazilian Space Agency and scientists from South Africa. The scientists 
suspected that the high concentrations of ozone, like those found in densely populated urban

areas, resulted from seasonal burnings in South America and Africa. According to the NASA 
researchers, the presence of pollution over the tropical ocean confirmed that humans had 
extended their negative impact on “traditionally pristine air” far beyond reaches directly above 
land. According to one researcher, the results of TRACE-A greatly improved the scientific 
community’s understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of the Southern Hemisphere.149 
 
NOVEMBER 1996 
4 November 
NASA released images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing a dust storm on Mars 
nearly the size of the state of Texas. The storm appeared in the pictures of the planet as a 600-
mile-long (965-kilometer-long), salmon-colored patch. Scientists believed this was the first time 
that one of the huge storms had neared the planet’s northern polar ice cap.150 
 
6 November 
A team of scientists from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia discovered new 
evidence that pushed back considerably the scientifically estimated date of the origin of life on 
Earth. The researchers projected that the Earth’s age might be 350 million years older than 
previously thought. The research team, led by Gustaf Arrhenius, published its findings in the 7 
November issue of Nature. The scientists argued that the presence of apatite (basic calcium 
phosphate) in Earth’s oldest known sediment sequences suggested that life had emerged on Earth 
3.85 billion years ago. The scientific community met these findings with both excitement and 
skepticism.151 
 
7 November 
NASA spacecraft managers reported the failure of two scientific satellites. NASA had designed 
the Scientific Applications Satellite-B (SAC-B), launched three days earlier from NASA’s 
Wallops Flight Facility, to survey solar flares and gamma-ray bursts. The project was a 
cooperative effort between NASA and Argentina. NASA scientists had intended the second 
satellite, HETE (High Energy Transient Experiment), to remain dormant until it detected 
sunlight, at which time it would deploy, transmitting signals. Scientists doubted this would ever 
occur, because the satellite had fallen into a tumbling pattern. Officials hypothesized that the 
satellites had not deployed properly and, therefore, had orbited uselessly, lacking electrical 
power. NASA valued both satellites at more than US$20 million. The launch failure was the 
third miscue in two years for the Pegasus rocket program. The Orbital Sciences Corporation of 
Dulles, Virginia, developed and ran the program.152

NASA launched into space its unpiloted Mars Global Surveyor, the first in a series of missions to 
explore the Red Planet further. The Mars Global Surveyor Mission and vehicle embodied a shift 
in the United States’ approach to space exploration. With the expressed intent to make 
exploration as affordable and reliable as possible, NASA had developed the smaller Mars Global 
Surveyor, measuring 5 by 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 1.5 by 3 meters) and designed to carry less fuel 
than Mars Observer. Mars Global Surveyor cost NASA US$150 million to develop, whereas 
Observer had cost nearly US$1 billion and had failed to reach Mars after its 1992 launch. 
Surveyor’s ability to function with less fuel than previous models heightened the chances that it 
would succeed in its mission. NASA predicted that after ascending to the desired 235-mile-high 
(378-kilometer-high) orbit, the robotic Global Surveyor would have to travel nearly halfway 
around the Sun before catching up with Mars in September 1997. The spacecraft would then 
begin mapping the Martian atmosphere and surface, a survey planned to last 687 days. Mission 
objectives included searching for evidence of life on Mars, gathering data about the Martian 
climate, learning more about the planet’s geology, and determining what resources were 
necessary to support future human missions to Mars. According to NASA, the search for water 
was the unifying theme of all missions to Mars. The Mars Global Surveyor Mission continued 
the exploration of Mars that NASA had begun with the Mariner and Viking missions of the 
1960s and 1970s.153 
 
12 November 
In its annual contest, Popular Science magazine honored NASA’s experimental flight-control 
system as one of the best technological developments of 1996. NASA had installed the system, 
developed for the use of NASA and the U.S. Air Force, in a remotely piloted aircraft called 
LoFLYTE (Low Observable Flight Test Experiment). On board the aircraft, the system used 
techniques involving neural networks to “learn” to fly, actually acquiring flight skills by 
mimicking the actions of the pilot controlling the plane from the ground. Neural networks are 
systems that learn skills by doing them. Scientists hoped the technology might eventually have 
an impact on commercial and military aviation.154 
 
A malfunction in an unpiloted test plane forced NASA officials to detonate the plane high above 
Edwards Air Force Base in California. The lightweight plane, dubbed Theseus, veered out of 
control during a routine test flight. Aurora Flight Systems had developed the US$5 million plane 
for long-term flights to observe climatic conditions from altitudes as high as 60,000 feet (18,300 
kilometers). A spokesperson for Aurora indicated that the company had insufficient data to 
determine the cause of the failure. NASA had contracted with Aurora Flight Systems to develop 
the plane as part of its Mission to Planet Earth initiative. At the time of the forced detonation, 
NASA had not designated funds to develop any subsequent Theseus models.155

NASA appointed Samuel L. Venneri as Chief Technologist at NASA Headquarters, reporting 
directly to Administrator Daniel S. Goldin. The appointment placed Venneri in charge of all of 
NASA’s technology policy initiatives and programs. Venneri had served at NASA since 1981, 
after working as an aerospace consultant for Swales and Associates and as an engineer for 
Fairchild Space Electronics.156 
 
17 November 
A Russian nuclear-powered Mars probe crashed into the South Pacific Ocean, about 500 miles 
(800 kilometers) southeast of New Zealand. The U.S. Space Command, located in Colorado 
Springs, Colorado, monitored the descent of the disabled craft, but was unsure exactly when and 
where the probe had hit the ocean. Russian space scientists assured NASA that no danger of 
nuclear contamination existed. A handful of experts, however, cautioned that in an extremely 
unlikely, worst-case scenario, the impact could result in a small but lethal plutonium cloud. 
President Clinton, vacationing in Australia at the time, offered the services of U.S. teams trained 
to locate and recover stray nuclear materials. Russian officials believed that the probe, named 
Mars-96, had failed to reach orbit because of a malfunction during the fourth stage of the Proton-
K rocket’s ascent. Mars-96 carried plutonium pellets the size of eraser heads, designed to 
withstand the pressures of entering Mars’s atmosphere. The probe’s failure was a setback for the 
international effort to explore Mars, as well as for the Russian space program. Donna L. Shirley 
of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the chief of the U.S. Mars effort, called the failure a 
“terrible, terrible tragedy” for researchers. Some people speculated that the crash would prompt a 
rebirth of protests against using nuclear materials in spacecraft.157 
 
NASA officials confirmed that tense negotiations with Russia over the composition of the first 
crew to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) had resulted in Russia’s withdrawing one 
of its most senior and well-trained cosmonauts from consideration. NASA had selected U.S. 
astronaut William M. Shepherd to lead the 1998 mission and veteran space traveler Anatoly Y. 
Solovyev to accompany Shepherd. Each country strongly insisted that its own astronaut lead the 
international venture. In a letter to Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russian 
space officials stated, “Despite the Russian efforts to make experienced cosmonaut Solovyev the 
crew commander, the American side is [pre]emptorily insisting on the candidacy of American 
astronaut Shepherd.” Because the United States had insisted that Shepherd command the 
mission, Russian officials threatened that Russian Space Agency cosmonauts would not 
cooperate, claiming, “experienced Russian crew commanders doubt the expediency of their 
participation.” The standoff highlighted the diplomatic difficulty of holding together the 
international coalition necessary to construct the ISS.158 
 
19 November 
Space Shuttle Columbia launched from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 
2:55 p.m. (EST). In addition to a five-day delay because of the weather, NASA had delayed the 
mission for a week so that its engineers could conduct a careful check of possible problems with 
the rocket nozzles. News agencies reported that the fifteen-year-old Columbia, the nation’s

oldest Space Shuttle, was carrying into space sixty-one-year-old F. Story Musgrave, the oldest 
astronaut. With his sixth spaceflight, Musgrave became the first astronaut to fly on all five of 
NASA’s Shuttles. In Mission STS-80, NASA’s final Shuttle flight of 1996, the crew planned to 
deploy and retrieve two free-flying spacecraft, conduct spacewalks, and carry out a number of 
microgravity research experiments. Additionally, NASA and the National Institutes of Health 
planned to collaborate on tests further exploring how the human body reacts to the space 
environment. Only hours after Columbia’s launch, Shuttle crew released the U.S.-German 
Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer, designed to make as many as 
300 observations of stars and interstellar gas during the Shuttle’s mission.159 
 
21 November 
The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat) launched from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, aboard a Lockheed Martin Atlas 2A rocket, a satellite aimed at serving the 
burgeoning European television market. The satellite Hot Bird 2 cost US$100 million to develop 
and was powerful enough to beam television images throughout Europe and the Middle East. 
Eutelsat led a consortium of co-owner companies from the 45 different countries that co-own the 
satellite. Eutelsat assumed responsibility for operating Hot Bird 2, calling it “the most powerful 
commercial satellite launched to date.”160 
 
25 November 
NASA returned the record-setting, solar-powered, research aircraft Pathfinder to flight-testing at 
Dryden Flight Research Center. Pathfinder had set an altitude record of more than 50,000 feet 
(15,000 meters) during a flight on 11 September 1995. Wear and tear during previous operations, 
as well as a ground accident inside a hangar, had damaged the craft. NASA had hired 
AeroVironment to repair the remotely piloted plane. AeroVironment made several improvements 
and rebuilt the damaged portions of the aircraft. The company installed stronger rib structure and 
higher-efficiency solar cells. NASA had adopted Pathfinder in the 1980s after the aircraft’s 
release from a classified military program.161 
 
28 November 
NASA canceled a spacewalk for the astronauts aboard Shuttle Columbia when the astronauts 
could not open the outer air lock. After communicating for more than 2 hours with Mission 
Control in Houston, with officials instructing them to “put as much force as you feel comfortable 
applying to the handle,” Columbia’s crew ended preparations for the spacewalk. During the 
spacewalk, the astronauts had intended to test a large crane and various power tools planned for 
the ISS.162

The Russian-built Tu-144LL supersonic passenger jet, which U.S. and Russian aerospace 
industries and NASA had modified for commercial purposes, performed well in its first test 
flight after refurbishment. The aircraft took off from the Zhukovsky Airfield south of Moscow. 
During the Tu-144LL flight, researchers studied the impact of excessive speeds on the aircraft’s 
internal and exterior surfaces, engine temperature, and handling. The aircraft’s body, constructed 
primarily from light aluminum alloy, held up well during the initial test. The Tu-144LL project 
supported NASA’s High-Speed Research Program, which had begun in 1990, to encourage the 
development of technologies supporting supersonic commercial travel. The Boeing Company 
had led the U.S. industry involvement in the project, with support from McDonnell Douglas 
Aircraft, Rockwell International Corporation, Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric Company. 
The project’s aim was to prepare flight-research facilities to adapt to market demands of the 
future. Aviation experts predicted that a commercial market for advanced supersonic transport 
would evolve early in the 21st century.163 
 
DECEMBER 1996 
2 December 
President William J. Clinton awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor to astronaut 
Shannon W. Lucid, the first woman to receive the award. Praising Lucid as a “determined 
visionary,” President Clinton presided over the Oval Office ceremony, as the fifty-three-year-old 
astronaut recounted her 188 days aboard the Mir space station. Lucid recalled fondly her time 
spent with the two Russian cosmonauts, a period characterized by “working together, laughing 
together, and having a good time together.” Lucid’s husband Michael attended the ceremony, 
along with U.S. Senators John H. Glenn Jr. (D-OH) and Conrad Burns (R-MT), NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, and Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov. The U.S. Congress 
had created the Space Medal of Honor in 1969, awarding it to eight astronauts before Lucid. The 
award is distinct from the Medal of Honor, awarded for the highest acts of military service and 
extraordinary heroism on the field of combat.164 
 
Scientists announced the discovery of frozen water on the Moon, calling into question the long-
held belief that the Moon lacked any form of hydration. The Clementine spacecraft had found the 
ice while using radar signals to examine the depths of the Moon’s craters. The discovery was the 
by-product of a US$75 million mission, co-sponsored by NASA and the U.S. Department of 
Defense, to test the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization’s “Star Wars” sensors developed to 
detect and track missiles. The possible ice deposit, composed of the suspected ice crystals mixed 
with dirt and spread over a vast landscape, was termed a dirty lake. The scientists discovered the 
ice in a massive, extremely deep crater. One scientist described the crater as twice the size of 
Puerto Rico and deeper than the height of Mount Everest. Scientists discussing the significance 
of the discovery postulated that the presence of water on the Moon might be a boon to future 
space exploration, perhaps enabling the construction of a “filling station” on the Moon. Other

scientists offered a more sober opinion of the findings, referring to reports that the presence of 
water on the Moon might someday allow for colonization as “hyperbole.”165 
 
4 December 
NASA launched its second unpiloted craft, Mars Pathfinder, less than a month after the first, 
continuing its concentrated program of Mars exploration. The US$196 million Pathfinder lifted 
off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a Delta II rocket, on a mission planned to cover more 
than 300 million miles (480 million kilometers). NASA researchers expected the six-wheeled 
craft to land on Mars, on 4 July 1997, and to journey across the planet’s surface, gathering 
images of rocks and soil. Depending on how useful the images were, scientists planned for 
Pathfinder to roam Mars for at least one week and perhaps for months, straying no farther than 
approximately 60 feet (18 meters) away from its landing site.166 
 
5 December 
NASA officials announced that a funding crisis in Russia would delay the human occupation of 
the International Space Station (ISS) up to eight months. Before the announcement, NASA had 
learned that the financial problems of the Russian Space Agency had virtually halted Russia’s 
work on the orbiting laboratory’s nerve center. Without Russia’s contribution to the station, the 
crew of the ISS would have nowhere to stay during the construction of the station in space. 
NASA officials remained hopeful that Russia would release funding for the project and keep its 
commitment to the effort. Nevertheless, NASA officials began revisiting contingency plans to 
address reductions in funding. Russian Space Agency officials planned to meet with their NASA 
counterparts to discuss the situation.167 
 
6 December 
Scientists at the University of Texas at Dallas revealed their discovery of an ancient river 
channel buried beneath the Sahara Desert in Africa, publishing their findings in Science 
magazine. The discovery offered an answer to a question that had long perplexed the scientific 
community, why does the Nile River, as it flows through the world’s largest desert (in Sudan) 
make a huge, looping bend in its course? The Nile generally flows toward the north, except at the 
Great Bend’s turning, where the river flows toward the southwest for more than 200 miles (320 
kilometers). After this detour, the Nile resumes its course toward the Mediterranean Sea. The 
researchers had used the images taken by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic 
Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), which had flown with Shuttle Endeavour’s Mission STS-59 in 
1994, to study the ancient structures in the Precambrian rock, guiding the river’s course. The 
SIR-C/X-SAR radar waves had penetrated the sand to reveal unseen structures, not visible 
without the satellite images. Diane L. Evans, SIR-C Project Manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL), called the discovery “one of the most exciting discoveries from the SIR-C/X-

Earth initiative.168 
 
7 December 
Shuttle Columbia landed at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Forced to remain 
in space an additional day because of bad weather, Columbia and its crew had set an endurance 
record of nearly 18 days in space, only one day short of the previous record of 17 days. Heavy 
fog in Florida was the cause of the landing delay.169 
 
9 December 
NASA announced the completion, on time and on budget, of the first major component of the 
ISS. Russia’s Khrunichev Industries and the Boeing Company had combined efforts to construct 
Functional Cargo Block (known by its Russian abbreviation FGB), a 20-ton (18,000-kilogram or 
18-tonne) pressurized module. Members of the international space team planned to launch the 
spacecraft from Russia in November 1997. FGB formed the initial building block of the ISS, 
featuring computer equipment, thermal controls, fire detection tools, and navigational apparatus. 
Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center and Boeing Defense and Space Group 
received US$190 million for developing and building the craft. According to the plan, the ISS 
team would add many other components to FGB.170 
 
11 December 
In a postflight inspection, NASA engineers discovered that one loose screw had caused the hatch 
on Shuttle Columbia to jam, preventing the astronauts from taking their scheduled spacewalks. 
The screw had probably dislodged during takeoff, falling into the gears of the hatch. NASA had 
decided to cancel the spacewalks, rather than force the hatch open and risk damaging it 
permanently. With the Shuttle scheduled to launch again in one month, NASA faced the question 
of whether to remove and replace the gearboxes on all the hatches inside the Shuttle as a 
precautionary measure.171 
 
12 December 
Researchers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center announced that tests aimed at improving 
the efficiency of Space Shuttle engines would likely translate into substantial savings for 
commercial airlines as well. Researchers had learned that locating an engine’s turbine airfoils in 
the “optimum position” could cut down the flow of fluttering wakes of gases. When wakes 
occur, an engine requires additional energy to run and generates higher temperatures.  NASA 
researchers predicted that the findings would have special application for the Boeing 777. 
Improving efficiency by a half percent would save hundreds of gallons of fuel per flight. The 
researchers had based the new positioning of the turbines upon the simple principle evident when 
a bike racer drafts behind a competitor⎯because the first rider takes the full brunt of the wind,

the second can travel equally as fast with less exertion. The engineers found that by aligning 
turbines in the most efficient positions, the engine derived a similar drafting.172 
 
New audio recordings, gathered from the excursion of NASA’s Galileo spacecrafts to Jupiter’s 
large moon Ganymede, contained a “soaring whistle and hissing static,” suggesting that the 
moon possesses a planet-like magnetosphere. According to Donald A. Gurnett, who had 
conducted the experiments using Galileo’s plasma wave instrument, the data “is kind of like 
looking at a musical score.” The sound patterns mimic those found on Earth, Saturn, and Jupiter. 
Gurnett suggested that the new findings would have broad significance for the scientific 
community, possibly allowing scientists to draw further conclusions about the interplay between 
magnetic forces and matter throughout the universe.173 
 
NASA announced the successful harvest of the first crop of healthy plants grown completely in 
space. Grown aboard the Russian space station Mir, the super-dwarf wheat grew robustly in the 
microgravity of space. Researchers at NASA’s Ames Research Center termed the successful 
harvest a step toward a greater human presence in space. “The development of plant-based, 
regenerative life support systems is critical to sustaining a crew during long-duration missions 
such as the Mars exploration,” NASA’s David Bubenheim explained. The space station crew had 
raised the plants aboard Mir in a greenhouse designed by a team of Russian and Bulgarian 
engineers. Florescent lights had provided sufficient light for the plants, and the astronauts had 
injected water directly into the soil.174 
 
13 December 
The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel reported its findings on the safety of the Space Shuttle 
program, concluding that aggressive cost-cutting measures had not increased risks. The review 
responded to critics who had suggested that measures, such as outsourcing flight operations, had 
been too drastic, causing a precipitous decline in NASA workers’ morale. Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin, responsible for making NASA a more fiscally lean organization, praised NASA’s 
“clean bill of health.” However, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel warned NASA about 
challenges that would arise during the assembly of the ISS, cautioning those in favor of cutting 
the budget against trimming NASA’s funds too drastically.175 
 
15 December 
The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation announced that McDonnell 
Douglas would merge with Boeing in a stock-for-stock transaction. The merger, the biggest in 
aerospace history, positioned Boeing to compete with Europe’s Airbus Industrie for nearly all 
commercial airline contracts. The merger also strengthened Boeing’s position as one of the most 
influential companies, both domestically and internationally, in the United States. The US$13.3 
billion deal would place under a single umbrella nearly 200,000 employees, producing annual

revenues in excess of US$48 billion. The Boeing Company also emerged from the deal with 
improved chances of winning major military contracts, whereas, previously, the company had 
few ventures involving the military aerospace industry. However, McDonnell Douglas had been 
the main supplier to the military of F/A-18 and F-15 Eagle-model fighter jets to the military. 
Thus, the merger brought together leaders in the commercial and military sectors of the 
aerospace industry, creating what one industry analyst called an “800-pound gorilla.” McDonnell 
Douglas stock rose 20 percent on the first day of trading following the announcement.176 
 
16 December 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin hosted members of Congress and other government and 
aviation industry leaders at a ceremony marking the start of NASA’s General Aviation 
Propulsion program. NASA launched the endeavor to encourage the development of 
technologies and manufacturing practices that would create more cost-effective and 
environmentally friendly aviation-propulsion systems. NASA selected as its partners William 
International and Teledyne Continental Motors, along with the Federal Aviation Administration 
and the Industry Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments Consortium. Aviation 
leaders praised the collaboration as the beginning of a movement to revolutionize aircraft 
engines and, consequently, the aviation industry.177 
 
20 December 
Astronomer and Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan died after a long fight against a bone marrow 
disease; he was 62 years old. Since 1971, Sagan had directed Cornell University’s Laboratory for 
Planetary Atmospheres and Surfaces, where he forged his reputation as an expert in exobiology. 
Sagan helped plan the Mariner, Viking, and Voyager missions, receiving NASA’s Medal for 
Exceptional Scientific Achievement in 1972. Sagan also helped popularize modern science with 
his widely viewed television series Cosmos. Sagan described the television series as an endeavor 
“to show that science is a delight and to end people’s artificial alienation from it.” Sagan’s The 
Dragons of Eden (1977) won the Pulitzer Prize. Throughout his work, Sagan had also argued for 
the possibility of extraterrestrial life.178 
 
24 December 
Russia launched a satellite carrying two monkeys and a collection of insects, snails, and plants. 
The satellite Bion-11 launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, 600 kilometers (373 miles) north 
of Moscow. The Russian Space Agency planned to study the effects of weightlessness on the 
animal “crew.”179

The Clipper Graham (DC-XA) Incident Investigation Board released its final report concerning 
the explosion of the vehicle at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The Board, 
chaired by former astronaut Vance Brand, determined that a disconnected brake line on the 
secondary landing gear had prevented the gear from fully extending. The DC-XA, a prototype 
developed by McDonnell Douglas for NASA, had flown successfully in its fourth test flight on 
31 July 1996, before failing on landing. NASA’s director of space transportation noted that the 
failure, which occurred as part of ongoing research into reusable launch vehicles, had 
strengthened NASA’s resolve to reduce costs and to achieve efficient reusability, safety, and 
reliability, ideally using a combination of automation and human control.180 
 
9 January 
NASA reported that one of the two monkeys sent into space aboard the Russian Bion-11 flight in 
December 1996 had died upon completing postmission tests in Moscow. Both NASA and the 
Russian Space Agency announced that they would investigate the death. According to observers, 
both monkeys aboard the mission returned to Earth alert and active. The purpose of the flight 
was to investigate further the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system.181 
 
12 January 
In the first spaceflight of 1997, Shuttle Atlantis launched for a linkup mission with the Mir space 
station. Mission STS-81 was the fifth Shuttle voyage to bring supplies and new crew members to 
the Russian space station. Atlantis carried the SPACEHAB module in the payload bay of its 
orbiter, with experiments for Atlantis’s crew, as well as equipment for Mir. Michael A. Baker, 
making his fourth Shuttle flight, commanded the mission, with Brent W. Jett Jr. serving as Pilot. 
Astronaut Jerry M. Linenger was also aboard, set to replace astronaut John E. Blaha as the 
representative of the United States aboard Mir. Blaha had spent nearly four months aboard the 
orbiting station, roughly the same tenure planned for Linenger. So that Atlantis could rendezvous 
with Mir, the Shuttle had launched at precisely 4:27 a.m. (EST). Atlantis would spend two days 
orbiting, periodically firing its engines to draw closer to Mir, approximately 240 miles (386 
kilometers) above Earth. The United States and Russia planned for the Shuttle–Mir missions to 
contribute to the international team’s development of procedures and techniques for use on the 
International Space Station (ISS). NASA and the Russian Space Agency referred to the missions 
as Phase I of the ISS effort.182 
 
13 January 
An international team of astronomers announced the discovery of three black holes in three 
nondescript galaxies, suggesting that nearly all galaxies may in fact have massive black holes. 
Using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the researchers took a census of 27 galaxies to 
find a series of black holes massive enough to consume millions of Sun-like stars. The findings, 
which the scientists presented in full at the 189th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, 
provided insight into the origin and evolution of galaxies, as well as clarifying the role of quasars

in the galaxy. Douglas O. Richstone of the University of Michigan, who led the research team, 
stated that two of the black holes had “weighed in” at 50 million and 100 million solar masses, 
respectively. Scientists remained divided on why black holes exist so abundantly in space. One 
theory suggested was that, at the center of most or all galaxies, supermassive black holes exist, 
where gases ignite to the hottest temperatures known, sending nearby stars spiraling in new 
directions. Ralph Narayan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics called the black 
holes “the ultimate victory of gravity.183 
 
14 January 
Henry C. Ferguson, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, 
Maryland, announced the discovery of stars residing outside of any defined galaxy. Scientists 
had long suspected that such stars existed, but Ferguson and his team were the first to confirm 
the theories. They did so using images captures by the HST, which revealed as many as 600 stars 
in the seemingly blank spaces among the Virgo cluster of galaxies, approximately 60 million 
light-years away from Earth. Ferguson suspected that many more stars⎯perhaps as many as 1 
trillion Sun-like stars⎯are adrift in the galaxies of Virgo. The astronomers theorized that 
galactic mergers, or the tidal forces of nearby galaxies, had displaced the stars from their home 
galaxies.184 
 
15 January 
Shuttle Atlantis safely docked with the Russian space station Mir, while both spacecraft orbited 
at speeds of more than 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometers) per hour. Russian cosmonauts greeted 
the six-person American crew with the traditional Russian welcoming gift of bread and salt. 
Communication problems delayed the opening of the connection hatch temporarily, before 
American astronaut John E. Blaha, who had been aboard Mir for four months, was able to greet 
his fellow compatriots and his replacement. Blaha reported that the arriving Shuttle looked like a 
“shiny star” as it approached Mir. On hearing Atlantis’s approach, Blaha, ready to go home, 
reported, “All bags are packed. Ready for transfer.” NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin took 
the opportunity to congratulate Blaha on his contributions to space exploration and to improved 
international relations. “We spent 50 years aiming weapons at each other,” Goldin stated, and he 
praised the United States and Russia for cooperating in sustaining Mir and planning for the 
ISS.185

Johnson Space Center (JSC) awarded BRSP Inc. a US$128 million, five-year contract to provide 
base-operation support services, including plant maintenance and operations, logistics support,

Fred C. Adams and Gregory P. Laughlin, astrophysicists at the University of Michigan, 
presented their theory of a “Dying Universe,” at the American Astronomic Society conference. 
Adams and Laughlin had projected the future of the universe based upon quantitative theory, 
concluding that the Earth would die out with a whimper. According to their theory, the Sun will 
eventually die out, and the light of all stars will vanish. The projection was so far off in the 
distance (10,000 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from now) that 
it drew a mixture of criticism, amusement, and intrigue from the scientific community. Adams 
and Laughlin insisted that recently acquired insights into cosmic evolution had allowed them to 
draw conclusions about the end of the universe, albeit in broad terms. Previously, scientists had 
lacked even the basic data and theoretical framework necessary to undertake the task. The two 
researchers emphasized that they made no claim to foresee when the universe would end, but 
rather offered the first long-term, science-based deduction on how the universe would evolve 
through four periods of expansion⎯the star-filled era (the present), the degenerate era, the black-
hole era, and the dark era. The ultimate result of such a progression was too difficult to estimate, 
according to the scholars.187 
 
NASA announced that planned major modifications of Space Shuttle Atlantis, as well as routine 
inspections, would take place at the Boeing Company’s facility in Palmdale, California, rather 
than at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida. United Space Alliance, the 
company contracted for the maintenance and operation of the Shuttle program, had 
recommended the changes. According to estimates of the U.S. General Accounting Office, 
completing the renovations in California, rather than in Florida, would cost NASA an additional 
US$20 million because of higher labor costs. NASA explained that if the engineers had done the 
work in Florida, the launch schedule at KSC, along with the need for Atlantis to make a 
prolonged stay for extensive modifications, would have threatened future Shuttle flights. The 
changes planned, including rerouting the Shuttle’s fuel lines, involved more than routine 
maintenance. NASA also pointed out that its most experienced engineers worked at the Palmdale 
facility, and that workers at the facility had already made similar modifications to Shuttles 
Discovery and Endeavour. Moreover, NASA maintained that permitting KSC to focus on Shuttle 
launches and missions would be the most efficient use of its resources. Nevertheless, 
immediately after the announcement, some observers criticized NASA’s continued use of 
Boeing’s private facility in preference to that of the government-owned KSC. NASA’s previous 
intimation that the Palmdale facility would be “mothballed” for Shuttle repair and maintenance 
intensified critics’ reaction to the announcement.188 
 
17 January 
NASA released images taken from Galileo as it soared just 430 miles (690 kilometers) above the 
surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa. The images revealed the apparent traces of massive ice 
volcanoes. According to early analysis of the pictures, ice volcanoes and the movement of 
tectonic plates had reshaped the surface of Europa, one of the bodies in the universe that

scientists believed might once have hosted life. The presence of water, organic compounds, and 
adequate heat, all of which would be present if ice volcanoes existed on the moon, had led 
scientists to focus on Europa as a location for possible development of life. According to Galileo 
team member Robert J. Sullivan, the apparent traces of ice volcanoes supported the even more 
significant possibility that an ocean might exist below the surface of Europa. Because NASA’s 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) managed the Galileo Mission, the scientific community credited 
JPL with providing the vital new images of the surfaces of Europa and Jupiter that had led to 
further discussion about the possibility of life beyond Earth.189 
 
21 January 
Astronaut John E. Blaha, just returning from a four-month stay aboard the Mir space station, 
reported that he had experienced feelings of depression and anxiety during his long deployment 
in space. Blaha indicated that the conditions aboard Mir, rather than any elements of the space 
environment, had caused his difficulty. According to Blaha, the lack of private quarters for U.S. 
astronauts, who unlike the Russian cosmonauts did not have even small personal quarters, was 
one of the most difficult aspects of his stay aboard Mir. He also reported that, although relations 
with his Russian counterparts always had remained respectful, the tension of getting to know 
men who spoke a different language in such tight quarters created “another element of 
psychological pressure and stress,” aside from the inevitable feelings of isolation. Blaha reported 
that he had experienced psychological depression, especially during his first month aboard the 
Russian space station. He made these remarks aboard Shuttle Atlantis as it returned him to Earth, 
in the course of radio communications with four people living inside an airtight chamber at JSC 
in Houston, who were taking part in a 60-day experiment for future ISS deployments.190 
 
22 January 
John E. Blaha became the first astronaut to leave the U.S. Space Shuttle carried by medical 
personnel. Blaha was experiencing weakness upon his return to Earth’s gravitational conditions, 
and NASA’s doctors wanted to gauge immediately the effects of long-term weightlessness on his 
body. Blaha remarked upon landing that he could hardly move, saying that he was “absolutely 
stunned” at the difficulty of returning to a gravity-controlled environment. NASA’s doctors 
focused specifically on Blaha’s dizziness and on his weakened bones and muscles, hoping to 
learn how to improve health plans for astronauts living aboard the ISS. Blaha had maintained an 
arduous schedule of exercise aboard Mir, to mitigate the weakening effects of the weightless 
environment. In addition, he had made the return flight aboard Atlantis lying down in a Shuttle 
seat, to minimize the crush of gravity.191

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named Roy D. Bridges Jr., retired U.S. Air Force Major 
General and Shuttle astronaut, as Director of KSC. Goldin called Bridges “the right person to 
take KSC into the next century.” As Director of KSC, Bridges assumed responsibility for the 
only site for launches of the Shuttle. At the time of Bridges’s appointment, about 2,000 
employees worked at KSC, along with 14,000 contractors. Bridges’s appointment followed years 
of highly decorated service in the U.S. Air Force and NASA. Graduating with distinction from 
the U.S. Air Force Academy, he had served in several leadership positions in the Air Force and 
had received recognition as a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Pilot Training and 
Test Pilot Schools. Among other awards, he had received the Distinguished Service Medal, the 
Defense Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the 
Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters, the Meritorious Service Medal, the U.S. 
Air Force Commendation Medal, and NASA’s Flight Space Medal.193

3 February 
Space News reported that the Italian Space Agency had decided not to participate in construction 
of the International Space Station (ISS) because of NASA’s insistence that Italy meet previously 
established deadlines. The Italian firm Alenia Aerospazio had expressed interest in building, on 
behalf of Italy, two nodes, the pieces of hardware used to connect different sections of the 
orbiting laboratory. The Italian Space Agency had requested more time to investigate the 
feasibility of participating, after it determined that funding the $150 million project, solely in 
return for additional future use of the ISS, might strain its budget for other scientific projects. 
Gretchen W. McClain, Acting Director of Space Station Requirements, said that, although 
NASA regretted the loss of Italy’s participation in the ISS, placing the project on hold while the 
Italian Space Agency made its decision would result in significant schedule shortfalls. The 
development highlighted the difficulty of fostering international participation and, at the same 
time, maintaining the target delivery date of the ISS.194 
 
5 February 
Flight International published a story claiming that, more than 10 years after the explosion of 
Challenger, aerospace engineer Ali Abu Taha had discovered new evidence in Time-Life 
photographs demonstrating that a breach and a fire in Challenger’s right solid rocket booster 
(SRB) had caused the explosion. One photograph, taken about 20 seconds after liftoff, revealed a 
3-meter-long (10-foot-long) flame issuing from an SRB joint, and another clearly showed a 
white object separating from the same SRB seconds later. The discovery seemed to support 
Taha’s controversial theory that the booster had caught fire at liftoff and burned continuously 
until the explosion occurred. In contrast to Taha's findings, which focused on dynamic liftoff

loads, the congressionally mandated Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger 
Accident (Rogers Commission) had reported that faulty O-rings caused the tragedy. Automatic 
cameras set up around the Cape Canaveral, Florida, launch site had taken the photographs that 
Taha used as evidence for his theory, images never released to the public. Taha’s photographic 
analysis also revealed that the explosion had propelled Challenger’s crew compartment 
thousands of meters away from the explosion, partially explaining why investigators had taken 
40 days to locate the shell. Taha suggested that a shock wave had killed the crew instantly, 
although NASA had never found evidence of a shock wave. News of the photographs and of 
Taha’s research kept alive the debate surrounding the decade-old accident.195 
 
6 February 
President William J. Clinton released his budget proposal, which included a request for US$75 
million to develop the Space Infrared Telescope Facility. NASA had argued that the infrared 
telescope would aid scientists in answering some of the universe’s most fundamental questions 
including, what is the energy source for the universe’s brightest stars? and, where is the 
universe’s missing dark matter? Presidential support for the initiative led NASA to hope that it 
might finally receive the funding necessary to begin building the last of four space-based 
telescopes proposed as a part of the Great Observatories program. In addition to the highly 
publicized Hubble Space Telescope (HST), NASA had successfully placed in orbit the Compton 
Gamma Ray Observatory and had immediate plans to launch the nearly completed X-ray 
Astrophysics Facility. NASA expected the four telescopes, using various kinds of cosmic 
radiation to survey the atmosphere, would provide an unprecedented view of the universe. The 
four telescopes operating together would allow us “to look at the universe at all ages at once,” 
explained Michael Werner, a scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Upon the 
program’s conception in 1991, the National Academy of Sciences had called the Great 
Observatories the “highest priority for any major new program in space-based astronomy,” but a 
steady stream of budget cuts had made it increasingly difficult to realize the project.196 
 
NASA Administer Daniel S. Goldin praised the Clinton administration’s budget proposal for 
1998 as a sign that NASA’s deep budget cuts were leveling off. NASA had braced itself for a 
budget as low as US$13.1 billion, and, therefore, found President William J. Clinton’s US$13.5 
billion proposal a pleasant surprise. The request still entailed a US$200 million budget cut, and 
Congress might reduce the budget further. Nevertheless, Goldin responded to the proposed 
budget exuberantly, exclaiming, “Holy mackerel⎯this is a great program,” and remarking that 
for the first time during his five-year tenure, NASA could hope for budgetary stability. The 
proposal also projected that NASA’s budget in 2000 would be approximately US$13.2 billion, 
rather than the US$11.6 billion forecast in previous Clinton administration proposals. NASA 
planned to absorb the small reduction in funding by increasing efficiency, especially in the 
Shuttle program, having recently transferred management of the program to the privately held 
United Space Alliance. NASA officials believed that NASA could continue sending up seven or 
eight Shuttle missions annually, if budget trends continued to stabilize. On the day of the budget 
announcement, however, a NASA advisory panel warned once again that a drastic decrease in

the Shuttle’s funding would compromise its safety. Nevertheless, Goldin maintained that the 
proposal would allow NASA to continue fostering “faster, better, cheaper” science.197 
 
Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. met with Russia’s Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to 
discuss, among other topics, the United States’ concern that the Russian Space Agency’s lack of 
funding might derail plans for the ISS. U.S. officials declared that funding was the primary issue 
in the construction of the ISS. “We have no doubts about their science and engineering 
proficiency. Where we have concerns relates to adequate funding on the Russian side,” said one 
American space leader. Although the ISS had received contributions from the United States, 
Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada, Russian construction stoppages on a crucial ISS component 
already had delayed the project. Before the Gore-Chernomyrdin meeting, NASA received 
assurances from the Russian Space Agency that, despite financial difficulties, Russia would 
maintain its commitment to the project. During the meeting, the leaders agreed upon a joint 
statement committing the Russians to a new deadline. Gore stated that he believed the summit’s 
reaffirmation of previous commitments would satisfy members of Congress who were critical of 
Russia’s trustworthiness.198 
 
7 February 
NASA announced that it would join an international consortium of space agencies to support the 
launch of a Japanese satellite designed to create the largest astronomical instrument ever. The 
launch of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Space Observatory would create a 
radio telescope more than twice the diameter of the Earth, giving astronomers their sharpest view 
yet of the universe. Astronomers praised the Japanese-led launch as a significant advance for 
space research. VLBI satellites would allow radio astronomers to link together widely separated 
radio telescopes, so that they would function as a single instrument with extraordinarily sharp 
resolving power. The farther apart the telescopes, the greater would be the image’s resolution. 
NASA equated the power of the new tool with the ability to see a grain of rice in Tokyo from 
Los Angeles. Scientists hoped that the new tool would allow for further exploration of active 
galaxies with massive black holes. Researchers also hoped that the instrument would foster 
understanding of the mysterious quasars, which pour out tremendous amounts of energy and host 
or create black holes. Creating the enormous VLBI network involved 40 radio telescopes from 
15 nations. Japan’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science led the international consortium 
of science agencies, including NASA’s JPL, the U.S. National Science Foundation’s National 
Radio Astronomy Observatory, the Canadian Space Agency, the Australia Telescope National 
Facility, the European VLBI Network, and Europe’s Joint Institute for VLBI.199 
 
U.S. astronaut Jerry M. Linenger, NASA’s temporary resident aboard Russia’s Mir space station,

partners aboard Mir, took Linenger for a short ride around Mir, to free a docking station for the 
new Soyuz vehicle that Russia would soon launch. In allowing an American astronaut aboard the 
Russian craft, Russia took another step with the United States to foster a cooperative 
postcommunist relationship between the two countries.200 
 
10 February 
The Russian Space Agency launched Soyuz TM-25, carrying a crew of two Russian Space 
Agency cosmonauts, Vasili V. Tsibliyev and Alexander I. Lazutkin, and German astronaut 
Reinhold Ewald to the Mir space station, from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The 
cosmonauts would become Mir’s new, long-term crew, and the German astronaut would return 
with the retiring crew in two weeks. Germany had paid the Russian Space Agency millions of 
dollars to carry Reinhold Ewald aboard the Shuttle to Mir.201 
 
NASA researchers, astronauts, and scholars gathered in Washington, DC, for a conference of the 
National Academy of Sciences, disclosing and discussing details of experiments conducted 
aboard the Shuttle during two 1996 missions. The event commemorated the one-year 
anniversaries of the second U.S. Microgravity Laboratory and the third U.S. Microgravity 
Payload. Scientists predicted that discoveries made aboard the Shuttle flights in 1996 would 
eventually lead to technological advances. Research on numerous topics, from the climate of the 
universe to human biology, could lead to production of cheaper metals and alloys or new 
synthetic drugs. Highlights from the research presentations included the announcement of the 
discovery that space-grown crystals are of much higher quality than those grown on Earth; the 
description of experiments intended to uncover the effect of space on the production of metal and 
alloys; and the presentation of evidence that the microgravity environment of space had enabled 
scientists to make more precise measurements of the physical properties of elemental gas.202 
 
11 February 
Shuttle Discovery, carrying a crew of seven astronauts, launched from Kennedy Space Center 
(KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a mission to service the HST. NASA planned the 10-day 
Shuttle Mission STS-82 to upgrade significantly the scientific capabilities of HST, as well as to 
perform standard maintenance on the US$2 billion instrument. The spaceflight was the second 
servicing mission for HST since its deployment in April 1990 aboard Shuttle Discovery’s 
Mission STS-31. The astronauts planned to conduct at least four spacewalks to install new 
components, such as the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Near Infrared Camera 
and Multi-Object Spectrometer. A NASA scientist described the improvements as “replacing 
1970’s technology with 1990’s technology.” In addition to the work conducted on the HST, 
Discovery’s crew planned to move the telescope a few miles farther into the atmosphere, 
improving its chances for a longer operating life. Astronomers hypothesized that the potential 
gains from refurbishing the HST outweighed the risks of tampering with its already spectacular 
abilities, justifying the US$800 million cost of the mission. The head of the Harvard-

Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics speculated that the refurbished HST could lead to “a whole 
different kind of science.”203 
 
12 February 
The White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, chaired by Vice President 
Albert A. Gore Jr., released its recommendations for reforming the United States’ aviation 
industry. The Commission challenged NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and 
the U.S. Department of Defense to combine their efforts, with the goal of reducing aircraft 
accident rates by 80 percent over the next five years. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
voiced immediate support for the challenge, explaining, “We’re looking for solutions that will 
save lives.” He pledged NASA’s commitment to interagency cooperation and committed 
US$500 million in NASA funds, to achieve a major reduction in aircraft-related fatalities. Both 
NASA and the FAA cited previous successful collaboration efforts between their agencies. The 
Gore Commission’s most controversial recommendation was the use of computerized databases 
to identify potential terrorists. Critics quickly called the plan an exercise in profiling, which 
would foster biased treatment, especially toward Arab Americans and passengers with Arab-
sounding names. Other safety proposals included requiring children under the age of two to sit in 
their own seats, rather than on the lap of an adult, as the airlines had long permitted. The 
Commission further suggested that user fees, rather than ticket taxes, fund air-traffic control; that 
airports deploy a new satellite-based, air-traffic-control system, as soon as possible; and that 
airports make all airmail packages weighing more than 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) subject to 
inspection. In total, the Commission recommended 53 changes to the current system.204 
 
19 February 
Discovery’s crew released the HST from the Shuttle’s cargo bay after nearly a week of 
maintenance and refurbishing work. The astronauts had conducted a fifth spacewalk, one more 
than NASA had originally planned, to place a makeshift patch on the HST’s peeling insulation. 
“It’s not the Hubble Space Telescope. It’s really Hubble Space Telescope II,” remarked NASA’s 
chief Hubble scientist upon releasing the telescope. NASA deemed the mission a complete 
success.205 
 
20 February 
Astronaut and lawmaker U.S. Senator John H. Glenn Jr. (D-OH), on the 35th anniversary of his 
journey as the first American to orbit Earth, announced that he would retire from the U.S. Senate 
at the conclusion of his fourth term. On 20 February 1962, Glenn had orbited Earth three times, 
symbolizing a hard-fought achievement in the United States’ effort to catch up with the Soviet 
Union in the space race. Glenn, first elected to the Senate from Ohio in 1974, made the

21 February 
NASA announced that a plan for collaborative research and development between NASA and 
five other government agencies might result in the creation of an Internet connection a million 
times faster than home computer modems. The Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative 
dedicated US$300 million and three years to developing the NGI, to fulfill the promise President 
William J. Clinton had made in his State of the Union address: “We must build the second 
generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can 
communicate at speeds one thousand times faster than today; to develop new medical treatments, 
new sources of energy, new ways of working together.” NASA sites designated for early trials of 
NGI connections included Ames Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Langley 
Research Center, Lewis Research Center, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory.207 
 
Shuttle Discovery ended Mission STS-82 with a safe landing at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
The early morning landing occurred later than NASA had planned because of cloudy weather in 
Florida. NASA praised Discovery’s crew for its work refurbishing the HST.208 
 
23 February 
A small fire broke out aboard the Mir space station, raising new questions about the fitness of the 
aging station for occupation and research. The six crew members on board quickly extinguished 
the fire, the result of a faulty air purification unit. The astronauts and cosmonauts estimated that 
the fire had burned for about 90 seconds, forcing the crew to don respirator masks. Mir continued 
to function normally after the fire, although the heat had melted several cables.209

Two Russian cosmonauts and a German astronaut returned safely to Russia after tenures aboard 
the Russian space station Mir. The cosmonauts had spent more than six months in space, and 
Reinhold Ewald of Germany had spent two weeks aboard Mir as a paying guest of the Russian 
Space Agency. Ewald conducted geophysical, astrophysical, and medical experiments during his 
stay. The German Space Agency paid about US$60 million for Ewald’s trip, providing a much-
needed infusion of capital for Russia’s space program.210

NASA commemorated the 25th anniversary of the still-orbiting Pioneer 10 space probe. 
Launched 2 March 1972, Pioneer 10 was the functioning probe farthest from Earth, at 
approximately 6 billion miles (9.6 billion kilometers) away. NASA originally had intended the 
probe to orbit for 21 months, but the spacecraft had continued to perform remarkably well and 
efficiently long after its designated mission. The probe completed its planned objective of 
surveying Jupiter in 1972; after that, NASA launched Pioneer 10 into space at 86,000 miles 
(138,000 kilometers) per hour. Since then, scientists had tracked the probe, learning more about 
magnetic fields, solar wind, cosmic particles, and ultraviolet glow. In June 1983, Pioneer 10 
became the first human-made object to leave the solar system. On the day marking Pioneer 10’s 
25th year in space, the probe still broadcast “crystal-clear data” to the NASA control room on 
Earth. NASA did not plan a 26th anniversary for the probe, explaining that Pioneer 10’s pulse 
was finally growing so weak that it could no longer facilitate significant scientific 
experiments.211 
 
Design News honored as its Engineer of the Year, Bernard P. Dagarin, the key design engineer 
behind the Galileo space probe, which had successfully navigated Jupiter’s atmosphere in 1996. 
Dagarin had begun working on prototypes for the Jupiter probe in 1978, when NASA awarded 
Hughes Space and Communications Company the initial Galileo contract. According to Design 
News, “Never before had a spacecraft been asked to survive such a long and difficult mission.” 
Galileo had achieved the near impossible. Not only was Galileo’s Jupiter mission a complete 
success, achieving the desired data, but the mission had also become the capstone of Dagarin’s 
decorated career.212 
 
4 March 
The unpiloted cargo spacecraft Progress M-33 failed in its planned docking with the Mir space 
station, forcing Russian space officials to decide whether to allow the cargo craft to burn up in 
the atmosphere or to try again to connect with Mir. The docking of Progress M-33, which only 
had some surplus fuel aboard, was not of critical importance to Mir, but Russian Space Agency 
scientists had planned to use the craft’s docked mass to adjust the trajectory of Mir. News of the 
failure of the Progress’s docking tempered Russia’s celebration of its first satellite launch from a 
new cosmodrome in Svobody, occurring on the same day. On 6 March, the saga ended, when 
Russian officials decided to let the Progress M-33 drift off to burn up in the atmosphere.213 
 
6 March 
NASA researchers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, announced 
a plan to collaborate with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, to 
explore the potential of the substance Aerogel, which has tremendous insulating capabilities. 
Scientists said that they were optimistic that they could manipulate the material, rendering it 
transparent and, therefore, especially useful in constructing energy-efficient windows for homes 
and automobiles. During the 1930s, a researcher at Stanford University had discovered Aerogel,

often called frozen smoke because of its hazy appearance. NASA engineers had used Aerogel as 
an insulating agent aboard Mars Pathfinder in 1996. Although the substance is the lightest solid 
known⎯only three times the density of air, a block of Aerogel weighing less than 1 pound (0.5 
kilograms) can support 0.5 tons (450 kilograms or 0.45 tonnes). Aerogel’s large internal surface 
area, which disperses heat throughout its structure, causes the material’s extreme insulating 
capability⎯a 1-inch-thick (2.5-centimeter-thick) Aerogel window would offer the same 
insulation value as 15 panes of glass. John M. Horack, Assistant Laboratory Director for Space 
and Science Communications at MSFC, called the development of Aerogel “a great example of 
how NASA space research generates scientific knowledge that can be used to improve the 
quality of life on Earth.”214 
 
A panel of scientists at the National Research Council issued a report warning NASA of the 
slight possibility that a mission to Mars might actually bring microbes back to the United States. 
Although their report clearly stated that the so-called Microbe Peril was unlikely, the panel 
argued, nevertheless, that a probe returning from an exploratory mission to Mars could possibly 
serve as a conduit to bring Martian germs back to Earth. The panel issued its warning because of 
NASA’s plan to send a mission to Mars to obtain samples of substances on the planet, and 
because NASA scientists had recently identified signs of possible microscopic life on a 
meteorite. The panel’s report stated, “If life forms ever existed on Mars, either by having been 
formed in an independent origin or having been transferred there from Earth, it is possible that 
they could have continued to exist up to the present time.”215 
 
NASA announced the selection of four industry partners to study and develop a new Earth-
imaging radar system. The proposed LightSAR system would use advanced technologies to 
reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of radar-based satellites, which gather scientific data 
and provide commercial remote sensing. Project Manager Steven Bard of NASA’s Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) pointed out the unique team approach planned for the project. 
NASA intended to work with industry partners from the start, to assess the potential commercial 
market for LightSAR products and services and to share the cost of developing the expensive 
new technology with private companies. The four primary contractors selected were DBA 
Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Research and Development Laboratories, and 
Vexcel Corporation.216 
 
7 March 
Edward M. Purcell, 1952 Nobel Prize winner in physics and long-time researcher at Harvard 
University, died. Purcell discovered a means to detect the extremely weak magnetism of the 
atomic nucleus, making it possible to “listen to the whisperings of hydrogen through the 
universe.” Purcell had served as President of the American Physical Society. In 1967 Purcell had 
won the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers, and in 1979 he had 
won the National Medal of Science. At Harvard, Purcell held the position of Gerhard Gade

Purcell commented, “We are dealing not merely with a new tool but with a new subject, a 
subject I have called simply nuclear magnetism.”217 
 
9 March 
Professional and amateur astronomers in northern China and in the eastern reaches of Russia 
witnessed the near-simultaneous occurrence of a total solar eclipse and an unimpeded view of 
Comet Hale-Bopp. According to news reports, tens of thousands of people crowded city streets 
and braved freezing temperatures to observe the spectacle, many using pieces of smoked glass to 
protect their eyes. Mohe County in China’s northern tip had banned the use of smoke-producing 
stoves and other heating devices, to keep the air as clear as possible for the view. Chinese 
television stations broadcast the event, only the third time in recorded history when a full eclipse 
and the passing of a nearby comet had occurred simultaneously.218 
 
10 March 
NASA announced an agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) for the European 
construction of two docking nodes for the International Space Station (ISS). In exchange, NASA 
agreed to launch the ESA’s Columbus laboratory module. The “launch-offset barter agreement” 
was typical of the arrangements in progress to bring the ISS closer to fruition. The ESA 
announced immediate plans for the Italian Space Agency to carry out the actual construction of 
the two nodes, slated for mid-2000 launches. In addition to the construction arrangement, the 
ESA agreed to provide a variety of minor hardware, including refrigeration units, for the 
astronauts’ living space and for research areas of the ISS.219 
 
12 March 
NASA announced the completed construction of the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, scheduled for 
launch in September 1997. Engineers had designed the craft to obtain the first compositional and 
gravity maps of the Moon. G. Scott Hubbard, NASA’s Lunar Prospector Mission Manager at 
Ames Research Center, praised contractor Lockheed Martin for its efficient construction and for 
keeping project costs at forecasted levels. NASA projected that the total cost to build Lunar 
Prospector and send it to the Moon would be about US$63 million. Scientists explained the need 
to return to the Moon, even though it was “conquered” decades ago, reminding the public that 
many important questions about the Moon’s history and its fundamental composition remained 
unexplored. Researchers hoped that Lunar Prospector’s planned one-year mission orbiting the 
Moon would create a detailed map of the Moon’s surface composition and gravitational and 
magnetic fields. Lunar Prospector itself was compact⎯only 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) high, 4 feet 
(1.22 meters) in diameter, and weighing 660 pounds (300 kilograms). Even before its launch, 
scientists hailed Lunar Prospector as a new type of pathfinder, which had “made history in terms 
of management style, technical approach, cost management, and focused science.” Prospector 
used a gamma-ray spectrometer to provide maps of the composition of the Moon, thereby 
allowing scientists to understand better the elements present in the surface layer of the Moon.220

13 March 
As the public anticipation of the appearance of Comet Hale-Bopp heightened, NASA announced 
that NASA-supported researchers would use its vast resources⎯including spacecraft and the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)⎯to study the comet. Scientists hoped that studying Hale-Bopp 
would lead to a greater general understanding of comets. Because comets are composed of 
loosely packed dirt and ice, experts consider them the best-preserved remnants of the early solar 
system. NASA disclosed that the Wallops Flight Facility would launch four rockets using 
ultraviolet wavelengths, to study Comet Hale-Bopp. In addition, the Ulysses spacecraft, the joint 
project of NASA and the ESA, which was already in orbit at the time, would chart the effects of 
solar-wind conditions on comets. However, scientists also disclosed that the close proximity of 
Hale-Bopp to the Sun posed a danger to HST’s sensitive detectors; therefore, they had 
determined to wait until a few months after the comet’s approach to Earth before tracking it with 
the telescope. JPL planned to host a public event, called Comet Chasers: On the Trail of a 
Comet, to bring scholars and the public together to discuss the significance of Comet Hale-
Bopp.221 
 
New support emerged for NASA scientists’ claim that a meteorite discovered in August 1996 
held fossil evidence of primitive Martian life. In an article in Science, a group of researchers 
from California Institute of Technology and McGill University used magnetic studies to 
demonstrate that the findings on the meteorite were not, as some critics had contended, the result 
of a high-temperature environment that would have made life impossible. “What we are able to 
show from the magnetic studies is that these things [the fossil remnant that had excited the 
interest of Johnson Space Center geologists] couldn’t have been heated even to the boiling point 
of water.” Although the scientists did not explicitly support NASA’s earlier claim that the 
remnant provided evidence for bacterial life, the team’s discovery opened the intriguing 
possibility that remnants of primitive life could migrate from one planet to another.222 
 
NASA announced that, through its Small Business Innovative Research program, researchers 
had successfully used recycled plastic milk bottles to create a more effective, lightweight 
insulation for clothing and blankets. The material had the same honeycomb structure as that of 
the metal heat barriers used in spacecraft. According to the principal investigator, Steven D. 
Miller of S. D. Miller and Associates, “The blankets are better than wool or fleece because they 
are non-allergenic, and they dry five times faster. The new material is also four times warmer 
than wool in cold and damp conditions.” The research team hypothesized that agencies such as 
the Red Cross, or other emergency medical personnel, eventually would be able to use the new 
material to warm patients more quickly. After developing the product for space and commercial 
uses, NASA planned to allow Miller’s company to pursue further commercialization 
opportunities without NASA funding.223

NASA announced the establishment of a National Microgravity Center, formed in conjunction 
with Case Western Reserve University and the Universities Space Research Association. NASA 
selected Lewis Research Center (LERC) in Cleveland, Ohio, to lead its research efforts in the 
project. Plans for the nation’s first center dedicated exclusively to microgravity research focused 
on five areas: 1) research and technology development; 2) science program outreach and 
development; 3) scientific support; 4) technology transfer to industry; and 5) public education 
initiatives. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced the endeavor, stating, “The 
National Center for Microgravity Research on Fluids and Combustion represents a commitment 
to our goal to strengthen the partnership between NASA and our nation’s research community in 
universities and industry so that together we can increase the scientific and economic payoffs 
from NASA’s Microgravity Science Program.” NASA selected Simon Ostrach, a distinguished 
professor of engineering at Case Western University, as Director of the National Microgravity 
Center. As Director, Ostrach would be responsible for managing the Center’s staff of more than 
30 people and for shaping an agenda of research that would take advantage of opportunities 
aboard the ISS.224 
 
20 March 
Japan’s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) unveiled its key contribution to the ISS, 
two satellites named after stars⎯Orihime and Hikoboshi, which Japan planned to launch aboard 
an H-2 rocket. The satellites would make it easier to perform unpiloted docking experiments on 
the ISS. Japan’s interest in robotic space research fueled the proposal, which complemented 
NASDA’s plan to build an unpiloted space shuttle to ferry Japan’s experiments to the ISS.225 
 
NASA awarded its 1996 Government Invention of the Year to a patented, high-temperature seal 
developed for the National Aerospace Plane project. Bruce M. Steinetz and Paul J. Sirocky of 
NASA’s LERC directed the research. The seal used ceramic and superalloy fibers braided into a 
malleable structure to seal high-temperature joints on airplanes and Shuttles. The seal maintained 
its form in temperatures up to 2,000°F (1,090°C).226 
 
22 March 
NASA marked the one-year anniversary of the United States’ continuous presence in space, a 
tenure that began with the mission of astronaut Shannon W. Lucid aboard the Mir space station. 
Astronauts John E. Blaha and Jerry M. Linenger had followed Lucid’s stay. NASA planned to 
maintain a continuous presence aboard Mir until 1998.227

The famed Comet Hale-Bopp made its closest approach to the Sun, accelerating the comet’s 
process of shedding the gargantuan ice shards that, scientists hypothesized, might contain the 
basic ingredients necessary for life to begin. Based on data gathered by researchers during the 20 
months between the discovery of the comet and its approach to the Sun, scientists theorized that

the outer layers of Comet Hale-Bopp probably contained methanol, formaldehyde, carbon 
monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, and other carbon compounds. Because of its 
proximity to the Sun, many telescopes, most significantly the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), 
had to stop tracking the 25-mile-wide (40-kilometer-wide) comet to avoid damage to their 
sensitive instruments. The approach of the comet was a scientific opportunity occurring once 
“every 200 years or so,” according to Brian G. Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics. Comet sightings thrilled amateur and professional astronomers alike, as well as 
causing some paranoia. In one tragically irrational response to its approach, 39 members of the 
Heaven’s Gate religious community committed suicide, under the delusion that they were about 
to catch a ride on a spaceship hidden behind the comet’s tail.228 
 
NASA announced that the newly refurbished and improved HST had allowed astronomers to 
observe the fading, visible-light counterpart of a gamma-ray burst (GRB), a process that 
researchers called “one of the most energetic and mysterious” in the universe. The scientists 
speculated that the observable counterpart signified the existence of an unobservable, 
catastrophic burst of gamma rays, unleashing as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun does in 
10 billion years. The New Technology Telescope and the W. M. Keck Telescope, added to the 
HST in 1997, had enabled scientists to make the observation. According to Gerald J. Fishman of 
Marshall Space Flight Center, the lead investigator of NASA’s Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory, astronomers could not overestimate the significance of the find, even if the visible-
light phenomenon was only an indicator of another unobservable phenomenon. “This [discovery] 
opens up a whole new era in GRB research,” Fishman explained. “We now know that it is 
possible to see the fading optical emission by rapid follow-up observations with powerful 
telescopes. With several more of these, we should be able to narrow the models of what could be 
causing these gigantic outbursts.”229 
 
4 April 
Shuttle Columbia launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
embarking on a mission primarily to conduct research on microgravity. To understand the effect 
of the space environment on fire, and the potential danger of a fire to the astronauts, the mission 
crew planned to light more than 200 small, controlled fires during the mission. James D. Halsell 
Jr. commanded the Mission STS-83 crew, and Susan L. Still piloted Shuttle Columbia. Still was 
the second American woman to pilot a Space Shuttle. Mission Specialists Michael L. Gernhardt 
and Donald A. Thomas, Payload Commander Janice E. Voss, and Payload Specialists Roger K. 
Crouch and Gregory T. Linteris completed the crew. The Shuttle carried the Microgravity 
Science Laboratory in its payload, and the crew planned dozens of experiments, to “serve as a 
bridge to America’s future in space.” In the course of conducting these experiments, focused on 
processes necessary to carry out the long-duration research planned for the International Space 
Station (ISS), the astronauts hoped to create new research procedures and protocols. The STS-83 
marked the 22nd mission of Columbia. The Shuttle’s launch took place after a one-day delay, so 
that engineers could install thermal insulation on two exposed Shuttle pipes.230

6 April 
Astronauts aboard Columbia, consulting with NASA ground support, decided to cut short their 
planned 16-day mission because of the potential for an explosion in the Shuttle’s electronic 
generator. NASA decided to abort the mission after the crew had attempted for two days to fix 
the balky generator. Despite the fact that the Shuttle’s two other generators could provide enough 
power for the Shuttle, NASA’s procedure required the Shuttle’s return, to prevent subsequent 
problems. Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas W. Holloway clarified that the astronauts 
faced no imminent danger and that terminating the mission was a precaution rather than an 
emergency. “The conservative thing to do is land on Tuesday,” Holloway said at a news 
conference. Columbia’s early return to Earth in Mission STS-83 was only the third time in the 
history of the Shuttle program that NASA had ended a mission early. The astronauts had time to 
complete only a few of the planned 33 experiments on the mission, which cost nearly US$500 
million.231 
 
8 April 
Satellite-based monitoring instruments, owned by NASA and used by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), documented startlingly low levels of ozone over the 
Arctic North Pole. The measurements indicated ozone levels of nearly 40 percent below the 
levels found in 1979 and 1982. Scientists attributed the low ozone levels to a series of unusual 
meteorological conditions, although they did not yet know the principal causes of the change.232 
 
Shuttle Columbia landed safely at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, less than three days after its 
liftoff. The mission, planned for 16 days, ended early, and the Shuttle completed the return flight 
without incident. Columbia weighed more than 236,000 pounds (107,000 kilograms) at landing, 
the heaviest Shuttle ever to land, because of its load of unused supplies for experiments. Almost 
immediately after the safe landing, NASA officials began to consider repeating the flight as soon 
as possible, to allow the Shuttle crew to accomplish its original objectives and to avoid the 
substantial cost of launching an entirely new mission.233 
 
9 April 
Michael H. Carr of the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the Galileo spacecraft had 
captured images revealing iceberg-like structures, suggesting the presence of frozen water on 
Jupiter’s moon Europa. The discovery provided strong support for the theory that an ocean once 
existed on the moon’s surface. Astronomers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory called the 
discovery “mind-blowing” and “the clearest evidence to date that there is liquid water and 
melting close to the surface of Europa.” Ronald Greeley, the Arizona State University geologist 
who managed the Galileo imaging team, described the structures in the Europa images as 
“blocks of ice, similar to those seen on the Earth’s polar seas during springtime thaws.” Greeley 
concluded that a “thin icy layer covering water or slushy ice” might possibly exist on Europa’s 
surface. The images revealed one possible ice formation that spread across Europa’s surface in

patches as wide as 4 miles (6.4 kilometers). Scientists disagreed on exactly how to interpret the 
images and on whether future exploration would be able to prove the presence of an ocean. 
Nevertheless, excitement over the findings spread throughout the research community. In its use 
of the Galileo probe to explore Europa, NASA continued its mission to search the universe for 
other environments suitable for life. The Galileo probe almost lost the images when an antenna 
on the craft jammed, slowing data transmission to Earth. Galileo came within 363 miles (584 
kilometers) of Europa to capture the highly celebrated pictures.234 
 
At a tense hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology, NASA announced 
the necessity of a significant delay in the on-orbit assembly of the ISS. NASA Administrator 
Daniel S. Goldin explained the delay, “We knew from the outset that building the International 
Space Station was going to be tremendously challenging. Space exploration is not easy or 
predictable. We will work through this schedule issue.” NASA had scheduled the on-orbit 
construction to begin in November 1997, after Russia had launched Functional Cargo Block, 
known by its Russian abbreviation FGB. Inadequate funding for the Russian Space Agency, 
however, had delayed the construction of this ISS building block, pushing back the overall 
schedule. Russia had also delayed building the service module, another key component of the 
ISS.235 NASA’s announcement invoked further criticism from members of Congress opposed to 
the ISS initiative. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI), long a vocal opponent of 
the ISS, said simply, “I told you so.” Before the official announcement of the delay, 
Sensenbrenner had argued that NASA needed to consider alternative plans, in case the Russian 
Space Agency proved unable to meet its obligations. NASA Associate Administrator for Space 
Flight Wilbur C. Trafton countered criticism, noting that the international contribution to the 
effort had surpassed US$6 billion and that NASA and its partners still expected to complete the 
overall project on time in 2002. Because the enormous undertaking involved “15 countries, 
dozens of companies, and thousands of workers,” keeping production to preestablished deadlines 
had proven difficult.236 
 
12 April 
The Russian Space Agency celebrated the 36th anniversary of sending the first Russian, Yuri 
Gagarin, into space. At the same time, two cosmonauts and U.S. astronaut Jerry M. Linenger, 
who were on board Mir, reported that they had almost had to abandon the Russian space station 
twice over the past few months. Russia’s successful history of space exploration contrasted with 
the current struggles of the Russian Space Agency to obtain adequate funding for Mir and other 
space initiatives. When Russia launched its first piloted mission in 1961, the Cold War was 
driving an intense space competition between the Soviet Union and United States. In the days 
leading up to the anniversary, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin expressed his support for 
increased funding to the Russian Space Agency in the future.237

NASA and the U.S. Air Force Space Command announced an agreement to collaborate on 
several projects of mutual interest. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin explained that the 
agreement was part of NASA’s ongoing mission to become a more efficient and cost-effective 
agency, and that sharing information would lead to “greater efficiencies in our respective 
missions.” Goldin and U.S. Air Force Space Commander General Howell M. Estes III signed the 
pact, establishing seven teams to explore areas of potential cooperation. The areas of research 
included the feasibility of launching defense satellites from the Shuttle; the use of the Shuttle for 
U.S. Air Force technology payloads; and development of a plan to meet the dual space needs of 
NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The two agencies also planned to examine ways they might share 
their common infrastructure and facilities.238 
 
In the first study to observe directly a change in the growth cycles of a large swath of the 
Northern Hemisphere, scientists reported that spring was arriving a full week earlier in the 
Earth’s coldest regions than only a decade earlier. The report contributed to growing concern 
over the prospect of global warming. Using images obtained from NOAA satellites, a team of 
five scientists from Boston University demonstrated that plants budding in early spring had used 
10 percent more carbon than previously, indicating the spring’s earlier onset. The scientific 
community reacted to the report with interest, although most scientists cautioned that 
understanding climate change would be a long and difficult process.239 
 
23 April 
NASA scientist Addison Bain released a study concluding that the cause of the highly publicized 
explosion of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 was a special paint used to protect the aircraft from 
sunlight⎯not the ignition of inflammable hydrogen as historians had previously thought. Bain 
and a team of researchers used reels of archived film, models, and computer simulations to reach 
the conclusion that the outside of the Hindenburg had caught fire first. Because the Nazi 
government viewed the Hindenburg accident as an embarrassment, Germany had restricted the 
investigation into the explosion, which caused the deaths of the 35 passengers. The cover-up had 
led researchers to propose the scientifically unconvincing theory of a hydrogen fire.240 
 
25 April 
NASA announced that it had rescheduled for July 1997 Space Shuttle Columbia’s Microgravity 
Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, cut short in early April because of a fuel cell problem. The 
quick repair and relaunch plan used the same crew and set the same objectives as the initial 
Mission STS-83. Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas W. Holloway stated, “we are now in 
the position to do everything possible to complete the MSL mission with minimal impact to 
downstream flights.” He also pointed out that the attempt to complete the MSL mission provided 
NASA with a “unique opportunity to demonstrate our ability to respond to challenges.” In its 
decision to insert Columbia’s Mission STS-83 into an already arranged Shuttle docket, NASA

acknowledged that it would have to push back slightly other flights, already staffed and 
planned.241 
 
28 April 
At the fourth Compton Symposium on Gamma Ray Astronomy and Astrophysics, scientists from 
Northwestern University and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory announced the unexpected 
discovery of two clouds of antimatter in the Milky Way Galaxy. The researchers termed the 
material “antimatter annihilation radiation.” The team of researchers used NASA’s Compton 
Gamma Ray Observatory to discover the clouds, which scientists could not fully explain. “The 
origin of this new and unexpected source of antimatter is a mystery,” William R. Purcell of 
Northwestern University explained. The scientists postulated that the clouds might have resulted 
from starbursts, jets of material from a nearby black hole, or from the merger of two neutron 
stars. Attempting to explain the startling nature of the discovery, Charles D. Dermer of the U.S. 
Naval Research Laboratory said, “It is like finding a new room in the house we have lived in 
since childhood. And the room is not empty⎯it has some engine or boiler making hot gas filled 
with annihilating antimatter.”242 
 
29 April 
NASA astronaut, American Jerry M. Linenger, and Russian Space Agency cosmonaut, 
Ukrainian-born Vasili V. Tsibliyev, made the first joint U.S.-Russian spacewalk in the history of 
space exploration. Linenger, more than three months into his four-month stay aboard the Mir 
space station, joined Tsibliyev for nearly 5 hours outside the station. The two men gathered 
cosmic dust samples and installed a radiation meter. It was Linenger’s first spacewalk and 
Tsibliyev’s third. The men both wore Russian spacesuits and spoke in Russian as they 
cooperated to complete the exercise. Scientists planned to use the samples gathered from the 
spacewalk to continue tests to find the materials best suited for long-term space occupation, a 
question of preeminent importance with the ISS nearing fruition. Because of the orbiting position 
of the space station, Russian Mission Control was unable to communicate with Linenger and 
Tsibliyev while they were outside Mir, somewhat heightening tensions during the spacewalk.243 
 
MAY 1997 
2 May 
NASA announced that John C. Mather, a senior astrophysicist at Goddard Space Flight Center, 
had been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, often considered the highest recognition 
possible for scientists and engineers. Mather’s work at NASA had begun in 1974, specifically, 
on the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft. He had served as a project scientist 
when NASA launched the spacecraft in 1989, and in 1992 he had participated in the COBE

project, which effectively mapped primordial hot and cold spots in the cosmic microwave 
background radiation. The map demonstrated that radiation from the Big Bang conformed to 
theoretical predictions, providing new evidence for the long-standing Big Bang theory. Mather 
received his PhD in physics from the University of California at Berkeley in 1974.244 
 
6 May 
NASA announced that it had granted Hitco Technologies exclusive rights to use a NASA-
developed, heat-resistant material to produce high-performance pistons. NASA had developed 
the carbon-carbon composite in the 1960s, for use as a heat shield for missile applications. 
Researchers speculated that pistons composed of carbon-carbon, a material with virtually no 
thermal expansion, would allow engines to perform more efficiently, holding their shape and 
rigidity in temperatures well above 2,500°F (1,370°C). According to G. Burton Northam of 
Langley Research Center, the carbon-carbon composite was “the material of choice for the most 
demanding applications.” Allowing industry to use one of NASA’s patented technologies 
continued the trend of government-industry collaboration that Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
had fostered.245 
 
8 May 
At Baltimore’s Space Telescope Science Institute, NASA scientists described the long-duration-
exposure pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as the “best picture we have yet 
of the early universe,” announcing that, approximately 12 billion years ago, the universe had 
been completely barren of galaxies. Richard S. Ellis of England’s Institute of Astronomy 
emphasized the significance of science’s new ability to use the HST to view “a time before 
galaxy formation.” The HST had opened its lens for many hours of exposure, focusing on a tiny 
wedge of the sky to capture its most probing picture ever, known as the Hubble Deep Field 
Survey. Focusing only on a small speck of the sky had enabled astronomers to look deeper into 
the universe than ever before. Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute estimated 
that the HST had captured a view of the universe at only about 10 percent of its present age.246 
 
12 May 
Hubble scientists released their first reviews of the newly upgraded HST, concluding 
enthusiastically that the refurbished space telescope offered exciting new possibilities. The 
upgrades to the HST significantly improved the range and precision of the instrument. Scientists 
reported peering approximately 50 million light-years away and zeroing in on previously 
undetectable black holes. According to Edward J. Weiler, the head of NASA’s Hubble team, the 
added Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, installed in February 1997, reduced the length of 
time it took to confirm the presence of black holes in the universe. Weiler called the HST a 
“census bureau” for black-hole hunting, allowing researchers to survey these objects as a 
population rather than as individual phenomena. Another new instrument installed in February, 
the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), enabled the HST to 
capture near-infrared wavelengths, beginning to penetrate the “dusty veil” that had prevented 
astronomers from studying the birth and death of stars. NASA engineers also disclosed that an 
early focusing problem with one of the three cameras used by the NICMOS system seemed to be

correcting itself. Although the flaw could limit the life of the system, scientists were confident 
that NICMOS would still be able to gather and preserve all scientific data. During early testing 
of the NICMOS system, scientists had uncovered a region of the universe in which young stars 
eject material into a molecular cloud, a process that researchers had long hypothesized but had 
been unable to observe.247 
 
13 May 
The New York Times reported a soon-to-be released study by Research Policy, providing strong 
evidence that publicly funded scientific research often fueled industrial advancements in the 
United States. According to the study, prepared for the National Science Foundation, 73 percent 
of all American industrial patents filed during the two-year study cited scientific advancements 
made possible by government funding. The report had particular relevance because the Clinton 
administration and its congressional allies, both Democratic and Republican, had considered 
paring down the nation’s science outlays to balance the federal budget. The Council of Scientific 
Society Presidents called the report “a wake-up call for [f]ederal investment policies.” The study 
joined an ongoing debate over exactly what contribution general scientific research made to the 
national economy. The National Science Foundation and NASA were two of the agencies most 
cited in industrial patent requests.248 
 
For the first time, NASA deployed its ER-2 aircraft, a civilian version of the U-2 reconnaissance 
plane, over the North Pole. The vehicle’s flight supported the Photochemistry of Ozone Loss in 
the Arctic Region in Summer (POLARIS) project. The ER-2 flew at 70,000 feet (21,000 meters), 
an ideal height for atmospheric research. Michael J. Kurylo, Manager of NASA’s Upper 
Atmosphere Research Program, emphasized the importance of aircraft such as the ER-2 to fill 
this specific research niche: “It is really critical that we have access to consistent measurements 
at this key altitude, which is an intermediate region between aerosol particle-driven processes 
measured by standard aircraft-based sensors and gas-phase processes monitored by orbiting 
satellites.” Scientists said they were optimistic that the ER-2 would aid significantly the 
POLARIS endeavor to understand why the ozone layer over the North Pole had experienced 
reductions during each Arctic summer.249 
 
14 May 
NASA and Japan’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science announced an agreement to 
combine their efforts to collect and study samples from the surface of the asteroid Nereus. 
According to the plan, a Japanese launch vehicle would carry a NASA-engineered rover onto the 
surface of the asteroid. The planned rover, with a visible-imaging camera and a near-infrared 
point spectrometer, would weigh less than 3 pounds (1.3 kilograms), the smallest spacecraft ever 
sent into space. A recovery capsule would return to Earth the samples the rover gathered from 
Nereus. The project would have a lengthy timeframe, with the return of the samples to Earth 
scheduled for 2006. NASA and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science were hopeful

spacefaring nations to combine their expertise and achieve something truly fantastic,” said 
Jurgen H. Rahe, NASA’s Director of Solar System Exploration.250 
 
15 May 
Space Shuttle Atlantis took off at dawn from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, carrying a crew of seven. Mission STS-84 was the fourth mission of 1997 and the sixth 
of nine planned missions to the Mir space station. Atlantis carried astronaut C. Michael Foale, 
who was to replace Jerry M. Linenger as the United States’ long-term resident aboard Mir. 
Charles J. Precourt served as Commander of Mission STS-84 and Eileen M. Collins as Pilot for 
the Shuttle. In addition, the crew included U.S. astronauts Carlos I. Noriega and Edward T. Lu 
and Mission Specialists Elena V. Kondakova of the Russian Space Agency and Jean-François 
Clervoy of the European Space Agency (ESA). Kondakova was the first Russian woman to fly 
aboard a NASA Space Shuttle. With the recent problems aboard Mir, many viewed the mission 
with special urgency. Concerned about the numerous breakdowns and the fire aboard the Russian 
space station, NASA even considered refusing to allow Foale to take his place aboard Mir. The 
Shuttle carried to Mir a new oxygen generator, which astronauts planned to unload almost 
immediately upon docking. Atlantis took into space more than 7,000 pounds (3,200 kilograms) 
of cargo for Mir and its crew.251 
 
European astronomers unveiled a new, more accurate map of the stars. Scientists immediately 
praised the 17-volume celestial guide as a milestone in astronomy. The ESA’s Hipparcos project 
had produced the map over 17 years, at a cost approaching US$1 billion. Astronomers called the 
release of the Hipparcos data the beginning of a new and fruitful debate. Hipparcos Project 
Scientist Michael Perryman said, “It’s a massive leap forward in our understanding. But the 
science of Hipparcos doesn’t stop here. For the scientific community it is just beginning.” In 
total, the map indicated the positions and motions of more than 118,000 stars.252 
 
19 May 
NASA unveiled a new facility, called the Chemical Crib, at Dryden Flight Research Center 
(DFRC). Officials hoped the new facility would reduce chemical waste by as much as 50 percent 
in three years. Waste disposal had become an increasingly expensive problem for NASA. “For 
every dollar spent to buy chemicals,” NASA’s Hazardous Materials Officer reported, “we spend 
three dollars to dispose of them.” The Chemical Crib would use a variety of techniques and 
technologies to compress waste, such as breaking down photographic-waste chemicals into a 
sludge, possessing as little as 5 percent of the mass of the original waste. NASA planned to 
construct similar facilities at its other sites. Staff of DFRC’s Safety, Health, and Environmental 
Office believed that the new facility would not only benefit the environment, but also the 
Center’s budget.253

Astronaut Shannon W. Lucid, who had spent more than six months aboard Mir in 1996, received 
the Order of Friendship Medal from Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin in a ceremony at the

20 May 
NASA researchers announced the discovery of wildly oscillating weather patterns on Mars. In 
yet another use for the HST images, scientists tracked much colder, cloudier, harsher weather 
conditions than they had expected. R. Todd Clancy of the Space Science Institute attributed 
Mars’s chaotic weather to a combination of factors, including the planet’s thin atmosphere and 
elliptical orbit and the ice and dust clouds surrounding it. When the planet’s orbit places it 
closest to the Sun, large windstorms push dust into the atmosphere; the dust absorbs sunlight, 
causing the air to heat, and Mars’s temperature to rise as high as 30°F (-1°C). HST images 
seemed to demonstrate further that, when the planet is farthest from the Sun, the dust storms 
remain at low altitudes, and ice clouds surround the planet, causing temperatures to plunge 
precipitously. The findings were of particular importance to NASA’s ongoing Mars Pathfinder 
Project, with Pathfinder’s entrance into the Martian atmosphere planned for July 1997.255 
 
A Russian Zenit-2 rocket carrying a military satellite exploded moments after taking off from 
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. According to Russian space officials, the failure occurred 
38 seconds after liftoff, when an engine inexplicably shut off. The Russian Space Agency 
suspended all further launches until an investigation could determine what had caused the 
explosion. NASA believed that the destroyed satellite was a spy satellite intended to replace in 
orbit one of Russia’s many outdated satellites. Russia had not insured the satellite, valued at 
US$17 million.256 
 
21 May 
NASA announced that an American astronaut would be the first commander of the planned 
International Space Station, settling a long-standing disagreement between NASA and the 
Russian Space Agency. NASA selected veteran U.S. astronaut William M. Shepherd to lead the 
three-person crew, which also included Russian cosmonauts Sergei K. Krikalev and Yuri P. 
Gidzenko. Gidzenko said that he had no problem participating in a U.S.-led mission: “It doesn’t 
matter who will be commander, who will be the flight engineer or pilot. They all work together, 
and they will try to do their best.” NASA had selected Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Y. Solovyev 
as a member of the crew, but Solovyev had refused to take part in an American-led expedition, 
opening the door to Gidzenko’s participation.257

The U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall installed a bronze statue of Apollo 13 astronaut John L. Swigert 
Jr., a native of Denver, to represent the state of Colorado. Each state chooses two statues for the 
hall to honor its most prominent citizens. Swigert was, perhaps, most famous for uttering the 
words, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.” Colorado had elected Swigert to the U.S. House of 
Representatives in 1982, but he had died of cancer before his swearing-in. Swigert’s statue took 
its place alongside that of fellow Coloradoan Florence Rena Sabin, who led the crusade for 
women’s admission to medical schools. Astronaut Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II, whom Swigert 
replaced only three days before the Apollo 13 launch, attended the statue dedication, along with 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and other dignitaries.258 
 
24 May 
Astronaut Jerry M. Linenger surprised onlookers at KSC when he bounded off Shuttle Atlantis 
only minutes after its landing. Physicians credited Linenger’s excellent condition after spending 
more than four months aboard the Mir space station to his regimen of orbital exercise. NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin was on hand to greet Linenger and the other astronauts returning 
home on Atlantis. The Shuttle’s safe landing returned Linenger to Earth after 132 days in 
space⎯the second longest stint by an American.259 
 
25 May 
Educators, scientists, and politicians gathered to celebrate a new nationwide observance⎯Space 
Day⎯meant to carry on President John F. Kennedy’s call to the nation for space exploration. On 
25 May 1961, Kennedy had urged the United States to “commit itself to achieving the goal 
before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth,” 
sparking NASA’s successful development of human space travel. Advocates of Space Day 
argued that a day of celebrating previous achievements and calling for further advances would 
inspire future space explorers, particularly children. More than 1,900 schools across the nation 
participated in Space Day activities.260

Lockheed Martin Corporation announced a joint satellite venture with the Moscow-based 
Intersputnik consortium. Financial analysts estimated the pact could produce more than US$1.5 
billion in annual revenue, capitalizing on the increasing demand for satellite transmission 
services for telecommunication signaling. The agreement, which cemented ties between the U.S. 
corporation and Russian space interests, combined Lockheed’s capital resources with 
Intersputnik’s rights to prime satellite positions. Lockheed assumed responsibility for 
constructing and launching the satellites, whereas Intersputnik took the lead in marketing and 
sales. The Intersputnik group represented Russia and 21 other nations. The newly formed 
Lockheed Martin Intersputnik Ltd. Company planned to focus on providing services to South

NASA announced the start of a month-long research endeavor to explore the levels of radiation 
present at high altitudes, using a refitted ER-2 aircraft. The project focused on altitudes between 
52,000 and 70,000 feet (15,900 and 21,300 meters), where radiation typically occurs because of 
cosmic and solar rays. The project had both scientific and public policy applications; researchers 
intended to use the data gathered to assess the safety of public, supersonic travel. The campaign, 
funded by NASA’s High-Speed Research Program, specifically investigated the plausibility of 
the High-Speed Civil Transport, still in the conceptual stage of planning, a commercial jetliner 
that would carry passengers at 2.4 times the speed of sound and at altitudes above 60,000 feet 
(18,300 meters). According to NASA Project Manager Donald L. Maiden, the speed of 
supersonic flight could mitigate any ill effects of high altitudes on passengers, because “Even 
though the exposure levels are higher at the higher cruise altitude, the typical flying public will 
actually receive less radiation exposure than on today’s subsonic transports because of the higher 
speed of the High-Speed Civil Transport.” NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
Environmental Measurements Laboratory, the Boeing Company, and the space agencies of 
Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom collaborated on the project.262

The Los Angeles Times reported that the students of Glassell Park Elementary School had sold an 
astonishing 32,000 candy bars, to pay the way for all 115 of its fifth graders to attend the U.S. 
Space Camp at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. Most of the 
school’s 951 students participated in selling candy to send their older classmates to the 
educational camp. Principal Beatrice LaPisto said proudly of her students, “This is a poor 
neighborhood. Most children here, for example, are on the free lunch program. But these are the 
brightest, best, most motivated students you’ll find anywhere.” This year was the first in which 
the nonprofit U.S. Space Camp Foundation had expanded its operations to the California site.263 
 
5 June 
NASA researchers announced that data from the Galileo probe indicated that Jupiter has distinct 
wet and dry regions similar to the Earth. The finding refuted the previous supposition that Jupiter 
was mostly dry. When it descended to Jupiter in December 1995, Galileo landed in an extremely 
dry and hot portion of the planet⎯an area one member of the team called the Sahara Desert of 
Jupiter. Scientists assumed that the area was representative of the entire planet, until they were 
able to analyze more long-range images taken by the probe. The Galileo team concluded that 
Jupiter was remarkably similar to Earth, with wet, dry, hot, and cold regions, as well as rain, 
snow, and thunderstorms. Before the creation of Galileo, scientists had been unable to observe 
much of the planet because of surface clouds of frozen ammonia. According to Robert W. 
Carlson of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA’s most fundamental conclusion was that

“There is weather on Jupiter.” However, scientists pointed out that, in contrast to Earth, Jupiter 
faces weather developments that are far more extreme and long lasting. Storms on the planet can 
last for years or even centuries.264 
 
An article in Nature confirmed the discovery of a small icy planet orbiting the Sun well beyond 
Pluto. The discovery confirmed the theory that the solar system extends far beyond previously 
verifiable limits. The planet, known as 1996TL66, with a surface area roughly the size of Texas, 
was the brightest solar-system object that astronomers had discovered beyond Neptune since 
1978. Astronomers using a University of Hawaii telescope discovered the planet as its orbit 
passed closest to the Earth, an occurrence that happens every 800 years. In the past, some 
researchers had hypothesized, but had been unable to prove, that planets might exist in the area 
where astronomers discovered 1996TL66.265 
 
9 June 
NASA’s AeroVironment Pathfinder, a remote-controlled, ultra-lightweight aircraft, set a new 
world record for highest altitude for a solar-powered aircraft. AeroVironment Pathfinder reached 
an altitude of 67,350 feet (20,500 meters), shattering the previous record of 50,500 feet (15,400 
meters). The experiment took place at the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, 
Hawaii. Engineers had designed Pathfinder to fly at extremely high altitudes, to supply 
researchers with atmospheric and environmental data that other planes could not gather. In 
traveling to such heights, Pathfinder experienced temperatures as low as -100°F (-73°C). After 
climbing for about 6 hours, the aircraft ascended into record-breaking territory, flying for more 
than 90 minutes at an altitude above 60,000 feet (18,300 meters). A partnership formed under the 
Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology Alliance, involving NASA, aerospace 
companies, and members of the scientific community, was responsible for developing 
AeroVironment Pathfinder.266

Astrophysicists William P. Blair, Robert A. Fesen, and Eric M. Schlegel presented to the 
American Astronomical Society the first images ever recorded of two supernovas colliding. The 
team used the Hubble Space Telescope to capture the images of the supernovas, more than 17 
million light-years from Earth. Astronomers had suspected that collisions occurred between 
exploding stars, but had been unable to capture an image of the process, because it was so short-
lived. Although the scientific community would continue to debate the implications of the image, 
Blair offered this assessment of its significance: “It indicates that not only is there a lot of star 
formation going on, but a lot of those stars are massive. They are evolving quickly, and they are 
exploding as supernovas.”267

The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report detailing the cost overruns for the 
development of the International Space Station (ISS). U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers (D-AK), a 
longtime opponent of the expensive ISS, requested the report. Upon seeing it, Senator Bumpers 
commented, “we don’t need to search outer space for black holes. We have one right here on 
Earth. It’s called the International Space Station.” GAO’s report found that Boeing Company, 
hired by NASA to build the ISS, had already incurred nearly US$300 million in cost overruns. 
The report also found that the cost-effectiveness of the project had deteriorated severely from the 
time of last accounting. In 1995 Boeing had been US$27 million under budget as opposed to the 
severe overages of 1997. GAO Associate Director Thomas J. Schulz recommended in the report 
that Congress should rethink its commitment to the program if the overruns continued to grow. 
The estimate of the cost, just to get the program back on schedule, was US$129 million. 
However, an ongoing debate on a disaster relief bill for the Midwest prevented the scheduled 
congressional hearing on the report.268 
 
NASA announced that Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Company had won the contract to 
develop and deliver solar-imaging instruments for U.S. weather satellites. The US$54 million 
contract provided funding for the creation of a model instrument and two flight instruments. 
Scientists believed that the solar x-ray images captured by the instrument would improve the 
ability of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Air Force to 
forecast special weather events. The proposed imager also had applications for civilian 
companies dependent upon predicting weather patterns.269 
 
Jurgen H. Rahe, NASA’s Science Program Director for Exploration of the Solar System, died 
when a tree collapsed on the car he was driving during a severe storm in Maryland. Rahe, 57 
years old, had enjoyed a distinguished career in the field of astronomy and at NASA. At the time 
of his death, he was responsible for overseeing visionary NASA programs, such as the Galileo 
Mission to Jupiter and the much-anticipated July 1997 landing of Mars Pathfinder. Rahe had 
guided NASA’s efforts to make more frequent and cost-effective exploratory missions of the 
solar system. According to one colleague, Rahe had presided over the planetary exploration 
program’s “unparalleled period of major discoveries.” Before his tenure at NASA, Rahe held 
tenured positions at California Institute of Technology and Germany’s University of Erlangen-
Nuremberg.270

As the 50th anniversary of the alleged alien sighting neared, the U. S. Air Force released a 231-
page report entitled The Roswell Report: Case Closed. The report explained that the U.S. Air 
Force had recovered test dummies from the Roswell, New Mexico, crash site in 1947, rather than 
the bodies of aliens. The U.S. Air Force had issued a report on the Roswell matter in 1994, in 
which researchers argued that the presumed spacecraft that had crashed in 1947 was actually an 
Air Force balloon used in a top-secret program called Project Mogul. When officials discovered

evidence that the tests had used parachute dummies, however, the U.S. Air Force compiled an 
additional report with the new information. Military officials hoped that the Air Force’s 
explanation for the supposed UFO reported in 1994, as well as for the supposed bodies of aliens 
discovered in the crash, would temper the controversy surrounding the issue. U.S. Air Force 
Colonel John Haynes, presiding over the Pentagon news conference at the release of the report, 
showed reporters footage of a NASA test craft that, indeed, resembled a flying saucer. Colonel 
Haynes explained that during testing in the 1950s, Air Force balloons had transported dummies 
to altitudes of 98,000 feet (29,900 meters), releasing them to fall to the ground. Since the testing 
was secret, the sight of falling dummies “easily could have been mistaken for something they 
were not.”271 
 
In the most serious of a string of problems for the Russian Mir space station, the 7-ton (6,400-
kilogram or 6.4-tonne) robotic cargo spacecraft Progress accelerated out of control while 
docking and crashed into Mir, damaging the Spektr module, tearing a solar-power array, and 
crumpling an exposed radiator. When the craft crashed into Mir, U.S. astronaut, British-born C. 
Michael Foale was inside the Spektr module, which he had been using as his sleeping and 
research quarters. Foale immediately abandoned the damaged module and slammed shut a hatch, 
sealing off the leaking Spektr. Spektr depressurized completely, and later the entire space station 
suffered a slight depressurization. When the collision occurred, Mir cosmonaut Vasili V. 
Tsibliyev was controlling the Progress manually, attempting to re-dock the craft, to test the 
updated manual-control system. The Progress had already docked with Mir a few days earlier, 
when the crew had unloaded cargo and filled the craft’s hold with trash. In addition to damaging 
Mir, the collision temporarily jarred the station off its normal flying orbit. Although the crew 
quickly remedied this problem, the three-man team had to work inside a darkened, partially 
powered station. Russian and American space officials estimated that Mir had lost half of its 
operating power from the collision. The collision heightened tensions between Russian and 
American space officials, as questions mounted about the safety of the crew aboard the failing 
space station. U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James 
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) met with NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, urging NASA not to 
send American astronauts to Mir until the station’s safety standards had improved significantly. 
Yuri N. Koptev, Director General of the Russian Space Agency, responded angrily to 
Sensenbrenner’s suggestion.272

turned the space station to face directly toward the Sun, so that Mir would get the jolt of energy 
necessary to boost its solar-power supply.273 
 
27 June 
NASA’s Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft engaged in a high-speed flyby of 
asteroid 253 Mathilde, capturing startlingly clear images of the huge space rock. Scientists had 
discovered Mathilde more than 100 years ago but, until the successful NEAR mission, they had 
been unable to take useful pictures of the 33-mile-around (53-kilometer-around) asteroid. NEAR 
Mission Director Robert W. Farquhar of the Applied Physics Laboratory praised the mission as 
“one of the most successful flybys of all time.” In the color images, the asteroid resembled a 
massive gray potato with deep gashes scarring its surface. Some of the craters on the asteroid 
were large enough to “swallow the District of Columbia,” according to one scientist who viewed 
the images as they were taken. The pictures also revealed that the rock was smaller than 
scientists had previously estimated and that it reflected only 3 percent of the Sun’s light, making 
it twice as dark as a piece of charcoal. Scientists hoped that the new data might reveal why the 
asteroid rotates at the extremely slow rate of one rotation every 17.4 days. NEAR’s multispectral 
imager took the pictures using very little of the spacecraft’s solar-based power, a significant 
accomplishment, since NEAR was approximately 186 million miles (300 million kilometers) 
from the Sun when it captured the images.274 
 
JULY 1997 
1 July 
Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida. Commander James D. Halsell Jr. called Mission STS-94 a “once-in-a-career 
opportunity” for the seven-person crew, the same crew that had embarked upon Mission STS-83 
in April 1997. NASA had cut short Mission STS-83 because of a fuel cell problem. The reflight 
gave NASA officials and the Shuttle crew a chance to undertake the experiments planned for the 
original mission, including testing hardware and procedures planned for the International Space 
Station. NASA was able to launch Columbia just 84 days after bringing the Shuttle home, at a 
cost of about 20 percent of the amount needed to set off a new Shuttle mission. The crew 
planned to carry out the original 33 experiments over the course of the 16-day science mission. 
Mission STS-94, NASA clarified, involved the same vehicle, crew, Microgravity Science 
Laboratory payload, and experiment schedule as the recalled mission. The mission was the first 
in the 36-year history of unpiloted spaceflight in which the same crew flew together in space 
more than once.275

NASA announced its plan to compensate for the failure of Japan’s Advanced Earth Observing 
Satellite (ADEOS) with NASA’s weather instruments aboard, admitting that the loss of the 
spacecraft was “a real blow to NASA’s science program.” Japan’s National Space Development 
Agency (NASDA) had declared the ADEOS lost on 30 June 1997. NASA scientists had been 
using the satellite to gather data about weather patterns and climate change. NASA resolutely 
pledged to continue working with NASDA despite the setback, highlighting plans to send up a 
second scatterometer aboard ADEOS II in 1999. Michael B. Mann, Deputy Associate 
Administrator of the Mission to Planet Earth Strategic Enterprise, qualified the failure saying, 
“The collaboration between NASDA and NASA on this mission has been outstanding . . . space 
operations is a risky business; those of us involved in the business strive to limit the risk but 
sometimes mishaps do occur.”276 
 
4 July 
NASA successfully landed the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft on Mars, exactly seven months after 
its launch from Earth. Project managers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) called the 
landing “near perfect,” celebrating the beginning of the “second era in the exploration of Mars.” 
The Mars Pathfinder Mission was the first to attempt a planetary landing on initial orbit, and 
Pathfinder’s safe landing followed a journey in which the spacecraft traveled at speeds of up to 
16,600 miles (26,800 kilometers) per hour. Although NASA made its first successful flyby of 
Mars in 1965, in recent years it had taken a new approach to exploring the Red Planet. NASA 
achieved the development and deployment of Mars Pathfinder for US$266 million, a bargain 
compared to the US$1 billion cost of the failed Mars Observer. Because of its tightening budget, 
NASA had adopted a course of planning several simple, but targeted excursions, using low-cost 
spacecraft, rather than mounting a few complex and expensive missions. Pathfinder landed 
almost exactly at the point aimed for and immediately transmitted signals back to Earth 
announcing its safe landing. Officials at JPL noticed a slight complication, when early images 
revealed that some of the airbags used to cushion the craft’s landing had bunched up around the 
door that Sojourner⎯the rover set to explore the planet⎯would use to exit Pathfinder. NASA’s 
engineers clarified, however, that the temporary problem would not compromise the rover’s 
planned exploration.277 
 
5 July 
Russia launched Progress M35, a supply spacecraft headed for Mir, filled with repair equipment 
needed to fix problems caused by the crash of another Progress cargo craft and to restore full 
power to the space station. According to Russian space officials, repairs would entail a lengthy 
spacewalk. The repair tasks appeared so daunting that the Russian Space Agency engineers 
pushed back the date of the work, to allow the Mir cosmonauts more time to train. C. Michael 
Foale, the American astronaut aboard Mir, was responsible for operating the Soyuz spacecraft

docked at the station, so that in the event of a problem, the crew would be able to make a safe 
return to Earth.278 
 
6 July 
Sojourner, the roving vehicle carried to Mars aboard Pathfinder, began prospecting the surface of 
the Red Planet approximately two days after Pathfinder’s safe landing. NASA engineers and 
enthralled scientists described the scene of the six-wheeled, microwave-sized Sojourner, slowly 
descending the ramp of Pathfinder, as similar to Neil A. Armstrong’s “giant leap” in 1969. 
Richard A. Cook, managing the mission from JPL, set off a raucous celebration of NASA 
engineers when he announced, “The rover is on the surface of Mars. We’ve got some great 
images back, and all the scientists are in heaven.” Weather reports gathered by the Pathfinder 
reported that Sojourner was working in temperatures as high as 8° below 0°F (-22°C), as well as 
in wind and dust storms. Sojourner, named for black abolitionist Sojourner Truth, headed for a 
dark rock near Pathfinder, as its first object of close study. NASA scientists, who had named the 
rock Barnacle Bill because of its craggy appearance, used similarly whimsical terms to keep 
track of the various geological objects studied by Sojourner. Sojourner’s success, after some 
minor complication upon landing, encouraged mission scientists and drew wide acclaim from the 
media. Scientists began to speculate almost immediately, about whether the mission could 
possibly confirm or deny the existence of life on the planet.279 
 
7 July 
NASA’s AeroVironment Pathfinder⎯distinct from Mars Pathfinder⎯broke the record for 
highest-flying, propeller-powered aircraft in a flight from the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Missile Range 
Facility on Kauai, Hawaii. After climbing for nearly 7 hours, AeroVironment Pathfinder reached 
its record altitude, maintaining its height for about 13 minutes. Even at its peak distance from 
Earth, a span of more than 67 nautical miles (124 kilometers), AeroVironment Pathfinder 
transmitted data without any problems. The successful test was part of the Environmental 
Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology Program at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research 
Center.280 
 
9 July 
NASA reported receiving 265 million hits on its Web site during the four days following Mars 
Pathfinder’s landing. In response to what some observers called the “biggest event in computer 
network history,” NASA buttressed its own computers with donated equipment from corporate 
sponsors, so that the government site could handle the high volume of viewers. The Internet 
statistics validated the widespread popularity of the mission to Mars. The CNN network 
dedicated nearly half of its programming to the Pathfinder story on the day of the Mars landing, 
doubling its network ratings. Entrepreneurs sold a variety of Mars- and Pathfinder-themed 
products, and visitors jammed the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. USA

Today summed up the success of the Mars Pathfinder Mission: “NASA’s successful landing on 
the Red Planet has set off a Marsfest on the blue one.”281 
 
NASA announced the retirement of veteran astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman, who had flown on five 
Shuttle missions. Hoffman planned to continue his NASA service, becoming NASA’s European 
representative in Paris. Hoffman was one of the four astronauts to take part in the spacewalking 
mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1993. In total, Hoffman had spent more 
than 1,200 hours in space and traveled more than 21.5 million miles (35 million kilometers).282 
 
The crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia lit more than 200 small fires, testing the flammability 
of dozens of gases and materials. The experiments took place under the direction of Paul D. 
Ronney, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Southern California. Ronney 
explained that the experiments had as much application for Earth as for space. According to 
Ronney, the weaker the flame in space’s weightless environment, the cleaner its fuel would burn 
on Earth. The astronauts found that, without the effect of gravity, the flames often formed the 
shape of a ball and heat did not rise. The experiments created some attention for Mission STS-
94, largely overshadowed by the success of the Pathfinder mission to Mars.283 
 
14 July 
Routine medical testing of the crew aboard Mir revealed that the Russian commander of the 
space station, Vasili V. Tsibliyev, had an irregular heartbeat and, according to Russian Mission 
Control, a problem with his “cardiovascular system.” The tests, indicating that Tsibliyev was 
overtired and suffering from stress, did not surprise space officials, considering his traumatic 
experience of late June, when a cargo craft had crashed into Mir. Tsibliyev reported that he had 
felt “irregularities” while he was exercising and when he was trying to sleep. The news of crew 
health problems complicated further the arduous repair plan. A day after learning of Tsibliyev’s 
test results, Russian officials proposed that U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale take Tsibliyev’s 
place in the repair spacewalk. NASA subsequently deliberated over the request before granting 
Foale permission to participate. Ultimately, however, Russian Mission Control decided not to 
allow Mir’s exhausted crew to perform the tasks. Instead, Mission Control planned for the 
replacement crew scheduled to arrive in August 1997 to make the repairs. The response to the 
latest of Mir’s challenges demonstrated an increasingly dependent and trusting partnership 
between the Russian and American space agencies. During the Soviet-led race for space, few 
could have imagined Russian officials asking for the aid of an American crew member in a time 
of crisis.284

Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr., U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Rodney E. 
Slater, and NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin joined in leading an aviation safety event at 
Dulles International Airport in Virginia. NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
had invited media representatives and interested spectators to the event, to observe 
demonstrations of the new technologies that the agencies had developed to improve the safety of 
flying aboard commercial, private, and government aircraft. NASA made available one of its 
Boeing B-757 research aircraft, providing hands-on demonstrations of the new techniques and 
technologies produced by NASA’s and the FAA’s Task Force on Aviation Safety.285 
 
16 July 
As Mars Pathfinder and its surveyor Sojourner triumphantly explored the surface of Mars, 
NASA named as Software of the Year the Dynamics Algorithms for Real-Time Simulation 
(DARTS) software⎯a program used on the Pathfinder mission. Abhinandan Jain, Guillermo 
Rodriguez, and Guy K. Man of JPL had created the software to provide real-time simulations to 
test other software and hardware. DARTS allowed NASA mission managers to test procedures in 
a cost-effective manner.286 
 
17 July 
Space Shuttle Columbia landed safely at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, just after sunrise, 
returning its seven-person crew to Earth. The landing marked the conclusion of a successful, 16-
day mission, during which the astronauts completed 33 laboratory experiments. The low-cost 
mission was the first reflight in NASA’s history, concluding the research agenda planned for the 
April 1997 mission that NASA had terminated as a safety precaution. Although the press 
coverage of events on Mars and Mir had overshadowed the Columbia crew’s efforts, NASA 
Mission Manager Teresa B. Vanhooser stated confidently that scientific journals would give the 
mission due respect.287 
 
25 July 
Two Yemeni men filed a lawsuit against NASA, claiming that NASA had committed trespassing 
violations when it landed Pathfinder on Mars. The men claimed that their ancient ancestors had 
deeded the planet to them as an inheritance, requesting that Yemen’s prosecutor-general bring 
U.S. Ambassador David G. Newton to court to stop the violation. Although no legal restitution 
was expected, the lawsuit highlighted the excitement surrounding NASA’s Mars mission and the 
widespread interest in the Red Planet’s exploration.288

researchers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the University of California 
at Santa Cruz. The scientists’ calculations indicated that the distant light they had discovered was 
an infant galaxy, approximately 13 billion light-years from Earth. Formally named Red Arc in 
CL1358-62, the discovery gave astronomers a glimpse into the universe as it had existed when 
only 7 percent of its present age. Lead researcher Garth D. Illingworth described the images as “a 
pathfinder for deciphering what is happening in young galaxies.”289 
 
AUGUST 1997 
1 August 
Frank L. Culbertson Jr., NASA’s Manager for the Space Shuttle–Mir research program, 
announced that in the future NASA would likely require astronauts to have training in 
spacewalking. The announcement coincided with reports in the New York Times and other U.S. 
newspapers that David A. Wolf had replaced astronaut Wendy B. Lawrence as the next NASA 
representative aboard Mir. NASA had replaced Lawrence because of her small stature. At 5 feet, 
3 inches (1.6 meters) tall, she was too small to fit into the bulky Russian Orlan spacesuits worn 
on Mir. In addition, she had received no training in spacewalking. Previously, NASA had 
planned for Wolf to replace Lawrence aboard Mir following her research stint. NASA and the 
Russian Space Agency addressed the sensitive issue of replacing Lawrence because of her size, 
explaining the need for flexibility aboard Mir during significant repairs to the station. Lawrence 
reacted professionally, despite the disappointment of her replacement less than two months 
before her planned once-in-a-career mission.290 
 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin addressed the Experimental Aircraft Association fly-in 
convention, outlining NASA’s vision to “revitalize general aviation.” Goldin boldly predicted 
that the U.S. aviation industry would be able to deliver 10,000 aircraft annually within 10 years, 
and 20,000 annually within 20 years. The fly-in convention, featuring flyovers by NASA’s SR-
71, had the theme, “Boomers Turn 50,” celebrating both the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Air 
Force and that of the first breaking of the sound barrier. The Association announced the winner 
of the National General Aviation Design Competition, sponsored by NASA and the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA), a competition encouraging university engineering students to 
focus on the aviation industry. The conference also featured the unveiling of the new FAA flight-
training curricula, as well as a national aviation safety initiative.291

The Rasmussen Research Group reported that seven out of 10 Americans had seen at least one 
image of Mars obtained through the Mars Pathfinder Mission, denoting a remarkable level of 
public awareness of NASA’s mission to the Red Planet. The researchers also reported that nearly 
half of all Americans believed that an American would land on Mars within 10 years. Despite the

widespread interest and optimism regarding the project, only 41 percent of those polled saw 
merit in the mission.292 
 
5 August 
The Russian Soyuz spacecraft lifted off from Kazakhstan carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Y. 
Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov on a mission to repair the disabled Mir space station. Russian 
space officials tasked the two men with restoring power to Mir after the 25 June collision with a 
cargo craft cut by half the orbiting research center’s energy. Regarding the importance of the 
mission, some observers of Russian space activity went so far as to say that the country’s piloted 
space program depended on Solovyev and Vinogradov’s success.293 
 
During the terminal countdown of a demonstration test of the Titan IV-B rocket designed for the 
Cassini mission to Saturn, engineers noticed liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen leaking from the 
Centaur stage of the rocket. NASA had scheduled Cassini’s launch for early October 1997. 
NASA officials delayed the launch until they could complete further tests, offering no immediate 
estimate of how long that might take. Interested scientists and engineers, however, predicted that 
the problem could postpone the mission by months or even years. Under the mission’s original 
timetable, NASA had expected Cassini to launch in October 1997, reaching Saturn in July 2004. 
Because of the length of the journey from Earth to Saturn, the scientific community expected that 
NASA would find it difficult to reschedule the flight. Moreover, experts warned that the 
alignment of planets providing an ideal launch date, such as that in October 1997, would not 
occur again for 12 to 14 years. At US$3.2 billion, Cassini was one of the last of NASA’s high-
stake, multibillion-dollar missions, drawing considerable attention during the climate of steady 
cost reductions that characterized the 1990s.294 
 
7 August 
A relief crew of two Russian cosmonauts, Anatoly Y. Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov, 
arrived at Mir to begin repair work on the damaged space station. On 25 June 1997, Mir had 
suffered its worst accident, when a robotic supply craft attempting to dock pierced the exterior of 
one of its research modules. The arriving crew, carrying tools and equipment, also had difficulty 
docking. As Soyuz approached Mir, its autonomic docking system failed, forcing Solovyev to 
override the system and pull Soyuz back. Solovyev then successfully docked the relief vehicle 
using manual controls. The crew planned to repair Mir’s failing oxygen-generating system, 
before reconnecting the damaged research module to the rest of the station. Both NASA and the 
Russian Space Agency stressed that Mir had sufficient oxygen reserves in the event that the 
oxygen generator failed altogether. After repairing the oxygen system and the research module, 
the new crew planned to make as many as six spacewalks to repair the external damage caused 
by the June collision. Cosmonaut Solovyev brought significant experience to the mission; he had 
resided on Mir during four earlier missions, spending a total of 456 days in space. NASA

Space Agency was replacing its crew aboard the space station.295 
 
Shuttle Discovery Mission STS-85 launched, carrying Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr., Pilot 
Kent V. Rominger, and astronauts N. Jan Davis, Robert L. Curbeam Jr., Stephen K. Robinson, 
and Canadian Bjarni V. Tryggvason, who planned to conduct studies on Earth’s ozone layer and 
to test a newly engineered robotic arm. The test on the small robotic arm, a prototype of the one 
planned for the International Space Station (ISS), continued NASA’s trend of using Shuttle 
missions to prepare for the much-anticipated space station. Discovery also carried a 7,000-pound 
(3,200-kilogram) German satellite, which would orbit freely for most of the10-day mission, 
gathering data on the declining ozone layer. Brown emphasized the international flavor of the 
crew and cargo saying, “one word for our mission would be diversity.” With this mission, its 23rd 
flight, Discovery tied with Columbia for the most missions by a single vehicle.296 
 
8 August 
After exceeding even the most optimistic predictions made during its primary mission, the Mars 
Pathfinder spacecraft concluded its initial research maneuvers and began extended operations. 
The initial mission had returned to Earth 1.2 gigabits of data and more than 9,000 images of the 
Martian landscape. Project Manager of the Mars Pathfinder Mission Brian Muirhead said that the 
mission had not only had gathered an impressive amount of data, but also validated NASA’s new 
approach to exploring space. “This mission demonstrated a reliable and low-cost system for 
placing science payloads on the surface of Mars,” he stated. “We’ve validated NASA’s 
commitment to low-cost planetary exploration.” After completing the planned 30-day mission 
and traveling 171 feet (52 meters) across Mars’s landscape, the rover Sojourner remained in 
excellent condition. Operators gave Sojourner a two-day rest period to recharge its battery, 
before it began an extended exploration of the planet.297 
 
9 August 
As the two cosmonauts worked to repair the failing Mir space station, President Boris N. Yeltsin 
allowed the Russian government to borrow US$100 million from foreign banks, giving the 
Russian Space Agency an infusion of capital. Yeltsin announced the decision after touring the 
construction facilities where Russia planned to build its contributions to the ISS. The Russian 
Space Agency’s cash-flow problems had resulted in construction delays and failure to meet 
deadlines, postponing the completion of the entire ISS.298 
 
After widespread speculation concerning the possibility of an indefinite delay of the Cassini 
Mission to Saturn, NASA announced that it would be able to repair a fuel leak in the spacecraft

in time to meet an October 1997 launch date. NASA had enlisted U.S. Air Force engineers to 
make the repairs. The spacecraft’s need for repairs increased the tension surrounding the 
ambitious and expensive mission. Lieutenant Ken Hoffman of the U.S. Air Force, who 
supervised the repairs, attempted to reassure the public that the problem was “a correctable 
condition.” Nevertheless, opponents of the mission⎯particularly those opposed to the 
spacecraft’s use of radioactive plutonium⎯worried that the rocket’s launch might release 
hazardous materials. Michio Kaku, a City University of New York physics professor, said that, 
despite NASA’s announcement that it could quickly correct the problem, the leak was “just one 
more indication that NASA does not have things under control.”299 
 
10 August 
Astronauts aboard Shuttle Discovery successfully tested a new robotic arm, considerably smaller 
than Discovery’s massive 50-foot (15-meter) crane, intended for tasks of higher precision. 
Discovery’s crew used the arm to unlock a cargo bay door and lift a small box. NASA had 
engineered the Japanese-made robotic arm for US$100 million, expecting that it would 
eventually serve astronauts aboard the ISS. Of the robotic arm’s test performance, astronaut 
Stephen K. Robinson stated simply, “it operated beautifully.”300 
 
13 August 
NASA and the Boeing Company unveiled a new stitching machine that experts believed would 
change the method of fabricating aircraft wing structures. The demonstration took place at 
Boeing Stitched Composites Development Center in Huntington Beach, California. The project 
team of engineers had replaced the large metal structures used in airplanes with strong, but light, 
composite materials. By reducing the weight of an airplane, engineers hoped to decrease fuel 
usage, with the eventual result of cost savings for consumers. Rather than using rivets to hold 
together an airplane’s wings, the NASA-developed stitching machine sewed together precut 
fabric layers in the shape of a wing. Next, the machine added braided stiffener materials to the 
wing, before setting the wing skeleton with resin. The process created a wing as strong as one 
built with metal structures, but at a fraction of the weight.301 
 
14 August 
Two Russian Space Agency cosmonauts, Vasili V. Tsibliyev and Alexander I. Lazutkin, returned 
to Earth after spending more than six months aboard the Mir space station. The New York Times 
echoed the feelings of many in the space community, calling the six months the Russians had 
spent in space, “six of the least glorious months in the history of manned space flight.” During 
their departure from Mir, Tsibliyev and Lazutkin continued to experience the same type of 
problem that had characterized their tenure on board the space station. The two cosmonauts, 
scheduled to disengage from Mir in the Soyuz spacecraft and then to circle the space station, 
cancelled the exercise because of concern that the two spacecraft would collide. After the 
cosmonauts landed in the desert of Kazakhstan, Tsibliyev recounted to an international press

between the Progress cargo craft and Mir had occurred during the two men’s tenure, and shortly 
thereafter, doctors had diagnosed Tsibliyev’s irregular heartbeat. Space officials planned 
extensive debriefings for the two men. Meanwhile, President Boris N. Yeltsin congratulated the 
cosmonauts for their “persistence, courage, and heroism,” in spite of his having claimed only 
days earlier that the recent problems with Mir were solely the result of human error.302 
 
Abe Silverstein received the Guggenheim Medal, honoring his significant contributions to the 
advancement of flight. Silverstein’s 40-year career at NASA had included a period as the 
Director of Lewis Research Center. The citation praised him for his leadership in the Mercury 
and Gemini programs and for “advancing technology of aircraft and propulsion performance,” as 
well as crediting him with proposing the name “Apollo” for the lunar landing mission. Previous 
winners of the Guggenheim Medal included Orville Wright, William E. Boeing, and Charles A. 
Lindbergh.303 
 
18 August 
Mir’s main computer failed during a cargo craft docking, setting the Russian space station adrift. 
The malfunction postponed a planned spacewalk to begin repairs to Mir, forcing the crew to turn 
its attention to reorienting the space station toward the Sun. The crew shut down most of Mir’s 
operating systems to conserve power.304 
 
19 August 
Shuttle Discovery returned to Earth, landing at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, after a 12-day mission devoted to environmental research. The crew hoped that the 
atmospheric data gathered during the mission would help scientists understand the ozone damage 
and climate change affecting Earth.305 
 
25 August 
NASA launched an unpiloted Delta rocket carrying the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), 
a US$100 million solar-observatory satellite bound on a 1 million-mile (1.6 million-kilometer) 
journey. The launch took place one day later than expected because, on the original launch date, 
a commercial fishing boat had come within range of the launch danger zone. Scientists launched 
ACE toward an imaginary point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth and 92 
million miles (148 million kilometers) from the Sun, a point at which scientists believe that the 
gravity of the Earth and Sun balance each other. NASA planned for ACE to orbit for as long as 
five years, analyzing particles streaming from the Sun. In keeping with NASA’s focus on 
improved efficiency, NASA engineers collaborated with the Boeing Company to build ACE and 
launch the mission, at a cost of US$200 million⎯more than US$30 million under budget.306

SEPTEMBER 1997 
2 September 
Astronaut F. Story Musgrave retired from NASA after 30 years of service and six Shuttle flights. 
During his more than 1,200 hours in space, Musgrave had flown on the first voyage of 
Challenger and had been a member of the first crew to service the Hubble Space Telescope 
(HST). Flying aboard STS-80 in 1996, Musgrave became the oldest person to fly in space. 
NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations David C. Leestma said of Musgrave, “throughout the 
Shuttle program, from its earliest stages to the present, Story has been instrumental in developing 
the techniques crew members use to perform spacewalks.”307 
 
3 September 
The embattled effort to launch the Cassini spacecraft suffered a setback when NASA engineers 
discovered ripped insulation in its Huygens probe, while the craft was sitting on the launchpad in 
Cape Canaveral, Florida. Investigators concluded that a ground-air-conditioner malfunction had 
caused the tears. The possibility of a launch delay, even for only a few days, concerned 
scientists, because Saturn was moving farther and farther from Earth. A longer journey to Saturn 
would require the spacecraft to use more fuel for transport, leaving less for scientific exploration. 
The Cassini Mission to Saturn had received significant public criticism because 72 pounds (33 
kilograms) of plutonium⎯the largest amount of radioactive material ever rocketed into 
space⎯powered the probe.  Although protesters had organized marches and petitioned 
government officials to stop the launch, NASA spokesperson Douglas Isbell had pointed out 
NASA’s perfect record of using nuclear fuel safely. Scientists from the European Space Agency 
and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had planned and engineered the building of the 
23rd nuclear-powered Cassini for the 11-year mission. Experts from both sides of the Atlantic 
were optimistic that engineers would repair the insulation damage quickly.308 
 
4 September 
Using the HST, astronomers from a number of universities and other institutions reported in 
Science that they had discovered a massive crater on the asteroid Vesta. Scientists had long 
suspected that the asteroid might have a large crater, because Vesta is the “parent body” of many 
smaller asteroids, suggesting that a significant collision once occurred on Vesta. However, even 
with hints of such a history, the sheer size of Vesta’s crater surprised the observers. Measuring 
285 miles (469 kilometers) across, the crater was nearly equal to Vesta’s 330-mile (531-
kilometer) diameter. Scientists had waited for the asteroid to move closer to Earth, so that they 
could examine its surface closely. In May 1996, Vesta had moved within 110 million miles (177 
million kilometers) of Earth, its closest approach in a decade. The science team stated further

that unveiling Vesta’s complexion and history had yielded new insights into the effects of “a 
large impact on a small object.”309 
 
6 September 
British-born U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale and Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Y. Solovyev 
conducted a 6-hour spacewalk outside the Mir space station, to investigate further the damage 
caused by the June 1997 collision with a robotic supply craft. However, they were unable to find 
the puncture that space officials believed Mir had sustained. The exercise was only the second 
joint spacewalk of a U.S. astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut. During the excursion, Foale used a 
crane to hoist Solovyev toward the damaged region of the craft. The two crew members endured 
temperatures ranging from 200°F (93°C), when Mir was in the sunlight, to -150°F (-101°C), 
when it passed into the darkness. Although Foale had spent many hours preparing for the 
spacewalk, learning how to maneuver in the heavy Russian spacesuit, he still exercised extreme 
caution to avoid snagging the suit on of Mir’s jagged edges. NASA had approved Foale’s 
participation in the spacewalk only shortly before it occurred.310 
 
9 September 
Mars Global Surveyor passed a critical test on its journey toward the Red Planet, when it 
successfully opened valves allowing high-pressure rocket propellant to enter its fuel lines. The 
same task had thwarted the 1993 Mars Observer at a similar juncture during its trip to Mars. 
Mars Global Surveyor had traveled for 10 months and for more than 435 million miles (700 
million kilometers) to reach Mars. According to Glenn E. Cunningham of NASA’s JPL, the 
process of transforming Global Surveyor from a high-speed-travel spacecraft into a slow-moving 
craft subject to Mars’s gravitational pull was “a nail-biter.” Without the powerful propellant, the 
transition could not occur, which would have ended any hope of the mission’s gathering data. 
With the opening of the valves complete, NASA scientists were optimistic that the US$250 
million probe would descend slowly into a tight orbit of Mars, yielding new information about 
the planet.311 
 
10 September 
Software magnate James W. Benson announced the formation of SpaceDev, a new company 
focused on launching a robotic craft to an asteroid. Benson argued that space “is a place, not a 
government project,” claiming that his company would gather new scientific data for a fraction 
of the money NASA spent annually on space exploration. Specifically, Benson stated that his 
Near Earth Asteroid Prospector would land on an asteroid, gathering images and scientific 
readings. He estimated that his company could complete such a feat for under US$50 million, 
about US$200 million less than NASA’s budget for a comparable mission. Benson and 
SpaceDev entered the realm of space exploration with overtly capitalist intentions. Benson 
planned to sell the data the company gathered to NASA and to universities for profit.

Additionally, SpaceDev consultants estimated that asteroids might contain significant deposits of 
gold and other precious metals, worth US$1–4 trillion, which would become the property of 
whoever succeeded in accessing it. Of his overall theory on space and science, Benson clarified: 
“When we deliver science, we expect to get paid. We expect a profit. We offer more science for 
the dollar.”312 
 
11 September 
NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the Federal Aviation Administration signed a joint 
memorandum of agreement providing guidelines for commercial spaceports. The agreement was 
the culmination of a long debate over how the federal government could encourage private 
companies and state governments to use available federal launch sites. The White House Office 
of Science and Technology initiative had proposed the agreement, which sought to limit the 
regulatory steps a private company would have to take to become a launch-site operator. The 
measure continued the federal government’s trend of encouraging private industry to explore 
space.313 
 
Mars Global Surveyor fired its engine enabling Mars’s gravitational pull to capture it. 
Researchers from NASA’s JPL declared that the spacecraft had behaved exactly as planned 
during the crucial entry to Mars’s gravitational field. Experts predicted that the mission would 
produce 700 million bits of data, more than the amount acquired in all previous Mars missions 
combined. The mapping mission continued a new era of Mars exploration for NASA, involving 
dozens of probes surveying the planet’s surface and atmosphere.314 
 
12 September 
For the first time, NASA turned over control of a satellite project to a group of non-NASA 
scientists, placing the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) under the control of the 
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Harvard University. Harvard scientists had designed 
and built the satellite, but in previous NASA-university collaborations, NASA had always 
maintained control over implementation projects that it had funded. NASA Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin said that NASA hoped the move would embolden non-NASA scientists: “What we 
wanted to do is get the scientists closer to their spacecraft and close to their sources of data.” 
NASA intended the AXAF, which had cost US$1.4 billion to develop, to study black holes and 
collisions between stars and galaxies.315 
 
NASA announced that, in one week, engineers had completed repairs to the damaged insulation 
of the Huygens probe, a part of the Cassini Mission to Saturn. Some scientists had feared that the 
tears to the insulation would set back the ambitious mission indefinitely. NASA engineers, 
however, had worked rapidly to disassemble the probe, completely inspect the damage, and 
make the appropriate repairs. Additionally, during the repair period, the project had received a

welcome voice of support from the National Space Society, an independent space advocacy 
organization. The Society had issued a statement expressing its full confidence in NASA and in 
the mission, offsetting the protests against the mission’s use of nuclear fuel. The National Space 
Society declared, “saying ‘no’ to Cassini would be saying ‘no’ to knowledge,” defending the use 
of nuclear power as the only safe and viable option for such a lengthy mission: “Cassini’s 
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) . . . have proven their safety and capability in 
23 prior missions, including human missions. RTGs are the only realistic option for sending 
probes great distances from the Sun and will certainly play a part in future human missions.”316 
 
15 September 
The Mir space station nearly collided with a U.S. military satellite, forcing Mir’s crew to prepare 
hastily for an emergency exit. When the satellite came within 500 to 1,000 yards (457 to 914 
meters) of Mir, U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale and the two resident Russian cosmonauts sealed 
themselves in the Soyuz spacecraft so that they would be able to leave if the satellite hit the 
station. According to NASA, problems with space debris and close encounters between satellites 
are common, but usually miles, rather than yards, separated the rapidly traveling spacecraft. 
Russian space officials had taken a different approach to the situation than their American 
counterparts would have chosen. Rather than ordering Mir to adjust its position, as NASA had 
instructed Shuttle crews to do when debris approach, Russian officials had ordered Mir’s crew 
back into Soyuz, prepared to take off immediately. The near miss of Mir and the satellite was not 
the first time that Mir had received a collision alert. NASA had begun monitoring Mir’s path 
when American astronauts joined the permanent crew and reported that space debris passed 
within a few kilometers of Mir about once every six weeks.317 
 
Data gathered by the U.S.-French satellite TOPEX/Poseidon confirmed theories that a “full-
blown El Niño condition” existed in the Pacific. Scientists believe that an El Niño forms when 
steady, westward-blowing trade winds weaken or reverse direction, altering typical, atmospheric 
jet-stream patterns around the world. TOPEX/Poseidon measured sea-surface heights and 
atmospheric water vapor to confirm the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s 
earlier prediction. Based on previous El Niño events, scientists predicted heavy rainfall for the 
western United States, mild winters in the east, and extreme droughts in Australia, Africa, and 
Indonesia.318 
 
18 September 
U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-
WI) issued a recommendation that NASA cancel its plan to replace C. Michael Foale aboard Mir 
with another astronaut. Sensenbrenner issued the bipartisan statement with U.S. Representative 
George F. Brown Jr. (D-CA), calling on NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin to alter the plan 
for the next Shuttle mission, retrieving Foale without delivering another American to the station. 
“I don’t think the increased risk is worth the benefit,” Sensenbrenner told reporters after a 4-hour

hearing on Mir’s safety issues. Goldin testified that, despite some setbacks, NASA had no reason 
to suspect that sending an American astronaut to Mir was more dangerous than any other space 
exploration. NASA’s Shuttle–Mir Program Director Frank L. Culbertson Jr. responded to 
Sensenbrenner’s comments, “I take the safety of my friends [the astronauts] very seriously and 
would not send anyone on something that I would not do myself.” The hearing was the first time 
that NASA had formally defended the safety of Mir to Congress.319 
 
22 September 
Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. began talks with officials in Russia, focused primarily on the 
International Space Station (ISS), economic cooperation, and controlling nuclear proliferation. 
The talks occurred in the context of a torrent of problems aboard Russia’s Mir space station and 
in Russia’s failures to meet its commitments to help build the ISS. NASA Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin traveled with the Vice President to participate in the space-related discussions.320 
 
25 September 
NASA’s Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, for 
Mission STS-86. The launch took place only hours after an independent task force chaired by 
astronaut Lieutenant General Thomas P. Stafford II reported that the Mir mission was 
sufficiently safe for the American astronauts. Specifically, the panel had determined that sending 
astronaut David A. Wolf to replace C. Michael Foale aboard the Russian space station would be 
reasonable, as well as important to continuing scientific research. NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin made the last-minute decision for the mission to go forward after weighing the panel’s 
findings against NASA’s risk reports and the opinions of the House Committee on Science and 
Technology. Committee Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) had been particularly 
aggressive in calling for the end of the program to place astronauts aboard Mir for significant 
periods. James D. Wetherbee served as Commander of Space Shuttle Atlantis, embarking on his 
fourth flight to space. The Shuttle also carried Jean-Loup Chrétien of the French Space Agency, 
Vladimir G. Titov of the Russian Space Agency, Pilot Michael J. Bloomfield, and Mission 
Specialists Scott E. Parazynski, Wendy B. Lawrence, and David A. Wolf. The Shuttle carried the 
SPACEHAB module in its payload, with supplies for Mir research and logistical equipment 
aboard.321

1 October 
Cosmonaut Vladimir G. Titov and Mission Specialist Scott E. Parazynski made a 5-hour

Russian-American team ever to conduct a spacewalk from a NASA Shuttle. The joint spacewalk

was also the first in which Mir crew members used NASA spacesuits rather than those provided 
by the Russian Space Agency. On this busy day of operations, two of the Russian crew also 
successfully installed a new guidance computer, which Atlantis had transported to the station.322 
 
NASA announced that the construction schedule for the International Space Station (ISS) 
remained on target to begin delivery launches in December 1998. All 15 nations participating in 
the building of the ISS had traveled to Johnson Space Center (JSC) to finalize the station’s 
construction sequence and compare progress updates. The international consortium agreed on a 
45-flight sequence for delivering the already-assembled portions of the station from Earth to 
their orbiting home. To assemble the colossal station completely, NASA and its partners planned 
five years of steady launch-and-construct missions, expecting to send the U.S.-constructed Node 
1 into space sometime during June 1998.323 
 
3 October 
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy formally approved the mid-October 
launch plan of the controversial plutonium-powered Cassini Mission. Critics had subjected to 
intense scrutiny the exploratory mission to Saturn and its moon Titan, because it used nuclear 
power. The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, among other organizations, had protested the 
mission and attempted to derail it, but had failed to spark widespread public outrage. Activists 
worried that the rocket might release plutonium if the launch failed, despite NASA’s more than a 
dozen safe launches using the hazardous fuel. The mission required nuclear power because 
Saturn has extremely dim sunlight⎯not enough to provide adequate solar power to prevent the 
Cassini spacecraft’s instruments from freezing. NASA’s policy required that the White House 
give final approval of the launch, because the mission used nuclear fuel. NASA had begun work 
on the Cassini Mission in 1989, with cooperation from the European Space Agency and the 
Italian Space Agency. Many regarded the mission⎯the first time a space probe had attempted to 
land on the moon of another planet⎯as NASA’s boldest and most ambitious endeavor. This 
aspect of the mission especially interested scientists, who theorized that Titan has an Earth-like 
atmosphere. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said of the mission: “I fully expect that it 
will return spectacular images and scientific data about Saturn.”324 
 
4 October 
The international scientific community observed the 40th anniversary of Sputnik’s successful 
launch. On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union had sent into orbit Sputnik I, a small sphere-shaped 
satellite, setting off a space race that continued throughout the Cold War. Although the United 
States had initially responded to the Soviet Union’s achievement with fear and apprehension, 
NASA commemorated the event 40 years later with a celebratory symposium. The United States 
had launched NASA itself less than one year after the USSR’s Sputnik success, partly because of 
the American public’s distress over the Soviets beating the United States into space. The son of

Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, Sergei N. Khrushchev, a prominent professor of International 
Studies at Brown University in Rhode Island, spoke at NASA’s Sputnik symposium. With the 
fall of the Soviet Union, Russia had unveiled to the world’s scientists many of the developmental 
plans of the Sputnik program. However, the end of communism had also precipitated enormous 
budget shortfalls for the Russian Space Agency. Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev 
took the opportunity of Sputnik’s widely celebrated anniversary to complain publicly that Russia 
owed more than US$400 million in rent for Baikonur Cosmodrome⎯the site of Sputnik’s launch 
and of ongoing Russian space activity. When the Soviet confederation broke up, Russia had 
agreed to pay US$100 million annually for the right to continue using the launch facilities in 
Kazakhstan.325 
 
6 October 
Shuttle Atlantis touched down at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, safely 
returning British-born U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale to Earth after his 145-day stay aboard 
Mir. Foale’s tenure in space was among the longest in NASA’s history, surpassed only by 
Shannon W. Lucid’s 188-day mission. Although Foale was determined to return to Earth’s 
gravity in good physical condition, NASA doctors planned to keep the astronaut under medical 
supervision for several days.326 
 
7 October 
NASA announced that astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had identified the 
most luminous star ever charted. The “celestial mammoth,” large enough to fill the diameter of 
the Earth’s orbit, reportedly releases up to 10 million times the power of the Sun. The team from 
the University of California at Los Angeles estimated that the star, possibly as old as 3 million 
years, weighs up to 200 times the mass of the Sun. The team nicknamed it the Pistol Star because 
it has a pistol-shaped nebula. Despite the star’s mass and brightness, it was not visible to the 
naked eye because of the interstellar dust clouds between Earth and the center of the Milky Way. 
Therefore, astronomers had used infrared technology to observe the star. Team researcher Mark 
R. Morris argued that the discovery of the massive star near the center of the galaxy would force 
scientists to rethink their conceptions of how stars formed in the first place.327 
 
8 October 
After more than nine days without sending a signal, Mars Pathfinder’s main transmitter 
resiliently delivered a message to Earth. To anxious project managers, the message was a 
welcome relief. The breakdown in the spacecraft’s communication to NASA controllers had 
necessitated NASA’s activating a contingency plan for Sojourner. The rover had stopped 
gathering data and reverted to slowly circling its parent spacecraft, waiting to receive directions, 
a pattern that some scientists feared would be the long-term fate of the rover. The spacecraft’s 
aging batteries had caused the breakdown in communication of data. However, in spite of the 
malfunction, NASA officials reiterated that the mission had fulfilled its objectives, emphasizing

that solving the problem of communicating with the craft while it was resting on the Red Planet 
would benefit future explorations of Mars.328 
 
Mars Pathfinder scientists announced that Mars appeared to have a crust, a mantle, and an iron 
core⎯attributes similar to those of Earth. The researchers suggested that Mars may once have 
been warm and wet, although they remained unable to determine whether Mars had a molten 
core, such as that of Earth or Mercury, or a “dead” core, such as that of the Earth’s Moon. The 
findings contributed to growing evidence that Mars might be more than a solid ball of rock and 
that the planet might once have had water and life. Signs of possible erosion and weathering 
encouraged such hypotheses, as well, although scientists clarified that proof of such theories was 
still probably years away.329 
 
A Russian cargo spacecraft docked without incident at the Mir space station, using the craft’s 
automatic pilot to complete the maneuver. It was the first successful docking after two previous 
failed attempts, one of which had resulted in the crash that seriously damaged Mir. To address 
the earlier problem, the Russian Space Agency had reconfigured the mathematical formula 
guiding the procedure. The Progress M-36 cargo craft carried a backup computer for the space 
station. Mir’s crew planned to unload the more than 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms) of cargo in 
the days following the delightfully uneventful docking.330 
 
10 October 
NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) selected Scientific and Commercial Systems 
Corporation of Falls Church, Virginia, to provide support services for its Huntsville, Alabama, 
facilities. The US$66 million contract included transportation and equipment services, as well as 
publishing, mail, and food support. MSFC arranged the contract as a cost-plus-incentive-fee, 
performance-based contract, to provide NASA with cost savings, as well as with flexibility to 
reorganize services as necessary.331

NASA announced that new smart software, with more realistic landing simulations for Shuttle 
pilots, would become an integral part of astronaut flight training. Hamid Berenji, Ping-Wei 
Chang, and Steven R. Swanson of JSC engineered the software, which used “adaptive fuzzy 
logic,” allowing the program to learn from experience and to function in a manner closer to 
human thinking than that of previous software. The software team predicted that the program 
would help not only Shuttle pilots, but also commercial pilots and even people learning to use 
machinery unrelated to aviation. Berenji predicted that, because the new training system would

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of his most historic achievement, Charles E. “Chuck” 
Yeager broke the speed of sound once again, flying an F-15 fighter jet in California’s Mojave 
Desert. NASA aired the recreation on NASA TV as part of its celebration at Edwards Air Force 
Base. Some historians call Yeager’s 1947 feat “the greatest achievement since the first successful 
flight of the Wright Brothers.” The U.S. Postal Service observed the anniversary by unveiling a 
commemorative stamp, the “50th Anniversary of Supersonic Flight.” The ceremonial jaunt was 
the 74-year old Yeager’s last official U.S. Air Force flight.333 
 
15 October 
The Cassini spacecraft lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, beginning a seven-year, 2.2 
billion-mile (3.5 billion-kilometer) journey to and around Saturn. After several delays, including 
a two-day delay immediately before the launch because of high winds, the takeoff was flawless. 
Before the launch, activists had protested Cassini’s fuel source, 72 pounds (33 kilograms) of 
radioactive plutonium; to calm public anxiety, NASA planned to sample air quality at 25 stations 
surrounding the launchpad, including several samples taken as far as 10 miles (16 kilometers) 
away. Additionally, a U.S. Department of Energy aircraft flew through the trailing gases of the 
rocket booster to make sure that no radioactive material had leaked. The US$3.4 billion mission 
set out to survey the planet Saturn, its rings, and its moon Titan. Engineers had programmed the 
Cassini spacecraft to conduct a number of “gravity-assist swingbys,” flying twice past Venus and 
once past Earth and Jupiter, to build up the speed necessary to make the long journey to Saturn. 
About seven years into the mission, NASA planned for Cassini to release a disc-shaped Huygens 
probe toward Titan. Throughout the mission, Cassini was to make more than 40 close flybys of 
Titan, gathering far more vivid images of the moon than ever before. NASA intended Cassini’s 
camera to take more than 300,000 colored pictures of Saturn and its moons. Scientists hoped that 
the mission would expand considerably the knowledge of the planet gained through the earlier 
Voyager missions.334 
 
President William J. Clinton used his newly bestowed line-item veto power to cut funding for a 
“reusable space plane.” The US$10 million appropriation was a priority of the U.S. Air Force 
Space Command and space officials. In total, Clinton’s line-item vetoes trimmed about US$144 
million from the 1998 U.S. Department of Defense appropriations bill, less than one-tenth of 0.1 
percent of the total bill.335

Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Y. Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov conducted an “internal” 
spacewalk, entering the damaged Spektr module of Mir. Once inside the darkened module 
damaged by the June 1997 cargo craft collision, the men found floating space debris. Seven bags 
and a refrigerator door were among the items banging around inside the Spektr module. After 
securing the debris, the cosmonauts went to work installing new solar-panel cables to restore full 
power to Mir. The cosmonauts, who were wearing bulky spacesuits, performed the 6-hour 
spacewalk inside a cramped module. Although the men became exhausted before they could 
finish the repair work, the arduous exercise had boosted the station’s power supply by 30 
percent. Russian Space Agency officials planned for the cosmonauts to conduct another repair 
operation during the following days.336 
 
21 October 
The Pentagon announced that it had successfully tested its Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical 
Laser (MIRACL), at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The laser, constructed under 
President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative, generated a beam that traveled more 
than 260 miles (418 kilometers) from Earth, hitting an orbiting satellite. According to Pentagon 
representative U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Robert Potter, if turned to its highest setting, 
MIRACL would have destroyed the satellite target. The test, which took place two years after the 
expiration of a 1985 congressional ban on tests of this type, was the first time the United States 
had tested a laser aimed at an orbiting satellite. Representatives of defense-related industries and 
scientists around the world debated the acceptability of such a test and the ethics of deploying the 
instrument.  However, whether or not the test was justifiable, the successful hit had demonstrated 
the vulnerability of satellites to Earth-based weapons.337 
 
23 October 
Representatives of NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services signed an 
agreement to enlist NASA technologies in the fight against breast cancer and other women’s 
illnesses, creating a cooperative framework for the exchange of research information between the 
two agencies. According to Carolyn A. Krebs of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the 
technology allowing HST to map distant galaxies also had the potential to scan human tissue for 
malignant masses.338

NASA announced the retirement of J. Wayne Littles, Director of MSFC. Littles had served as

NOVEMBER 1997 
3 November 
Mir cosmonauts Anatoly Y. Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov engaged in a 6-hour spacewalk, 
successfully dismantling a damaged solar panel so that Mir’s crew could install a replacement 
panel. The Russian Space Agency nearly called off the spacewalk when Solovyev discovered a 
problem with the radio-monitoring system on his spacesuit, just as the men prepared to leave the 
station. Although the crew’s attempts to repair the monitoring system were unsuccessful, Russian 
Mission Control eventually decided to proceed with the spacewalk. The cosmonauts worked 
effectively, communicating with Russian space officials only periodically. This was Solovyev’s 
fourth spacewalk during his tenure on Mir, confirming his status as the world’s most experienced 
spacewalker, with more than a dozen spacewalks to his credit. While the cosmonauts worked 
outside Mir, U.S. astronaut David A. Wolf monitored their progress from inside.340 
 
4 November 
After a four-month mission, NASA officials announced that Mission Control had halted 
communications with Mars Pathfinder and its rover Sojourner. Sojourner’s batteries were nearly 
drained, and many of the rover’s instruments had frozen in Mars’s harsh climate. Mission 
controllers expected the rover simply to come to a halt on Mars’s vast plains, ceasing signal 
transmissions altogether. Nevertheless, NASA considered the US$266 million mission largely 
successful. The mission had lasted much longer than planned, transmitting, from the surface of 
the Red Planet to Earth, nearly 10,000 pictures of the Martian landscape, including images 
showing evidence of erosion, as well as more than 1.2 billion bits of data. Sojourner’s 
remarkable service, even in the midst of harsh dust storms and temperatures reaching 
 -50°F (-6°C), had excited scientists and public alike. Mars Pathfinder Web sites had received 
more than 565 million hits during the mission’s tenure. Using the treasure trove of information 
Pathfinder had gathered, scientists had concluded that Mars’s surface had many similarities to 
that of Earth. Perhaps the most compelling was the evidence compiled during the mission in 
support of the theory that, at one time, Mars had water on its surface. In addition, the mission’s 
research team concluded that water and wind had played crucial roles in shaping the planet’s 
surface. Mission controllers spoke of their gratitude for the data gathered, which would keep 
scientists busy for years, as well as about their excitement at the possibility of building upon 
Mars Pathfinder’s success in future missions.341 
 
5 November 
A team of scientists from the University of California at Riverside announced that NASA’s 
orbiting Compton Gamma Ray Observatory had enabled them to discover a “vast halo” of 
gamma rays surrounding the Milky Way Galaxy. The astronomers clarified that the discovery of 
the halo did not make clear how or why the gamma rays encircled the galaxy. NASA’s orbiting 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory uses gamma rays to expose highly energetic particles that 
would otherwise be invisible because of their absorption in the atmosphere. The scientific 
community greeted the discovery with interest and questions.342

Russian Space Agency spokesperson Sergei Gorbunov announced the agency’s support for a 
film company to shoot a Hollywood-style movie aboard Mir. Russian director Yuri Kara had 
submitted a proposal to bring actors and film crews to Mir to shoot the film, entitled “Space 
Flight Has a Price.” Although the Russian Space Agency had not officially approved the project, 
the cash-strapped agency welcomed the unique opportunity to earn money. The biggest obstacle 
to the project seemed to be finding financial backers willing to pay to send Kara’s crew into 
space. The prospect of filming a movie aboard Mir raised some concerns in the space 
community, but Kara noted that Russian cosmonauts already had acting experience, having 
filmed commercials aboard the space station for products, including Pepsi-Cola, Omega watches, 
and Israeli milk.343 
 
6 November 
A group of astronomers announced that they had used NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer to 
observe a black hole “literally dragging space and time around itself as it rotates.” The discovery 
confirmed the existence of frame dragging, an extrapolation of Albert Einstein’s general theory 
of relativity. According to the findings, the black hole had such a massive gravitational field that 
nothing nearby, not even light, could escape its pull. To make the discovery, the team of 
researchers brought together academic scientists from Italy and the United States, as well as 
NASA personnel. By studying x-ray emissions, the astronomers were able to find a pattern of 
forces that clearly revealed the strength of the black hole’s gravitational pull. Alan N. Bunner, 
Director of the Structure and Evolution of the Universe Program at NASA Headquarters, called 
the discovery “exciting work,” encouraging scientists to test the findings. Before the discovery, 
frame dragging persisted as one of the last unverifiable theories of relativity, which scientists had 
suspected but had been unable to observe. Popular press reports touted the breakthrough as 
another victory for Einstein.344 
 
NASA announced that lighting technology developed to grow plants in space might help treat 
cancerous brain tumors in children. According to a series of trials, some tumor-fighting drugs 
performed more proficiently when illuminated with the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) created for 
NASA’s Shuttle plant experiments. To gauge further the effectiveness of LEDs in assisting 
cancer-fighting drugs, Dr. Harry Whelan of the Medical College of Milwaukee obtained 
permission from the Food and Drug Administration to use the LEDs on a limited number of 
children with cancer. Whelan’s method involved injecting his patient with cancer-fighting drugs 
and then placing an LED probe near the affected area. Whelan believed that the light focused the 
drugs on the dangerous tumors only, leaving the rest of the patient’s brain unaffected. NASA’s 
Small Business Innovation Research program, allowing small businesses to adapt NASA’s 
technologies for extended public uses, initiated the trial of LEDs to fight cancer.345

Following on the heels of Mars Pathfinder’s successful mission to map the surface of Mars, two 
researchers used sonar information and satellite images to create a highly detailed map of the 
global ocean floor, another largely unexplored area. David T. Sandwell of the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography and Walter H. F. Smith of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration improved by 30 times the precision of the world’s most exact ocean maps. Their 
new map, revealing ridges and canyons never before delineated, helped explain ocean currents 
and tides across the world. The new mapping technology interested oil companies, looking for 
clues to the location of fossil fuel deposits, and fishermen seeking likely habitats of fish.346 
 
10 November 
Geochemists from the University of Michigan and the University of Tennessee announced that 
they had arrived at the most accurate and precise estimation of the age and origin of the Moon 
yet calculated. They suggested that a collision between the Earth and another planet, 4.5 to 4.52 
billion years ago, resulted in the creation of the Moon. To reach their conclusion, the researchers 
used a special spectrometry technique to examine 21 lunar samples. The scientists also 
concluded that the collision had set Moon’s orbit.347 
 
13 November 
After altering the spacecraft’s path to move it farther away from Mars’s violent winds, NASA 
launched Mars Global Surveyor from its safe elliptical orbit of the Red Planet, sending the 
spacecraft into the planet’s harsh atmosphere. NASA officials indicated that, because of the 
change in flight plans, Mars Global Surveyor would begin its mapping mission of Mars in 1999, 
one year later than originally planned. The change of plan highlighted both the difficulty of 
exploring Mars and NASA’s ability to adapt to difficult conditions. When Mars’s atmosphere 
had proven more hostile than previously anticipated, mission controllers had proven able to 
readjust Surveyor’s orbit. In effect, the move had placed Surveyor in a holding pattern, keeping it 
from harm. Once conditions had improved, however, NASA would not be able simply to 
proceed as planned. Because Surveyor ran on solar power, the mission planners must wait for 
Mars and the Sun to realign, to provide energy for the craft. However, although NASA would 
have to postpone the mission for one year, the delay would provide an added benefit, allowing 
NASA’s researchers to set Surveyor on a circular orbit that would actually bring Surveyor closer 
to the planet than originally projected.348 
 
NASA announced the retirement of Wilbur C. Trafton, who had guided NASA’s International 
Space Station (ISS) planning for nearly four years. Trafton resigned from his position as Director 
of the Space Station Program one week after a contentious hearing, in which NASA officials 
informed Congress that cost overruns on the ISS had reached nearly US$1 billion. However, at 
Trafton’s departure, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin praised him, stating, “Will Trafton 
has met or exceeded all of the challenges I have placed before him.” During Trafton’s tenure,

Russia had officially joined the ISS effort as a full partner, and the ISS had moved from planning 
stage to construction.349 
 
17 November 
Reaffirming their commitment to the international consortium’s expensive and increasingly 
complicated task of constructing Mir’s replacement, NASA and the Russian Space Agency 
announced appointments to the first four crews that would live and work aboard the ISS. NASA 
chose astronaut William M. Shepherd as the first expedition commander. Russia selected 
cosmonauts Yuri P. Gidzenko and Sergei K. Krikalev to accompany Shepherd on the first 
increment crew. The second crew would have a Russian commander, Yury V. Usachev, 
accompanied by a crew of American astronauts, James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms. Each 
member of the first two crews possessed significant space experience. Moreover, the selection of 
the crews represented careful diplomatic choices meant to support the strong, but still strained, 
space partnership of the United States and Russia.350 
 
18 November 
The Assignation Records Review Board made public more than 1,500 pages of classified 
records, including a memorandum detailing a plan to blame Prime Minister Fidel Castro and the 
government of the Republic of Cuba if astronaut John H. Glenn Jr.’s attempt to orbit Earth in the 
Mercury capsule was unsuccessful. The 2 February 1962 document stated, “by manufacturing 
various pieces of evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the Cubans,” 
the United States could shift the blame to Castro. Glenn’s safe return to Earth rendered any such 
plans unnecessary.351 
 
19 November 
Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from Earth on Mission STS-87 with great fanfare, executing 
an unusual 180° roll 6 minutes into the 8½-minute flight, a maneuver planned to put the Shuttle 
in radio contact with communication satellites. The launch itself took place at the “exact moment 
on the exact day as planned” for the sixth consecutive mission. The six-person crew included 
Takao Doi, a Japanese astronaut who planned to make his country’s first spacewalk; Kalpana 
Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to travel into space; Leonid K. Kadenyuk, the first 
Ukrainian to fly on a U.S. Shuttle; and U.S. astronauts Kevin R. Kregel, Steven W. Lindsey, and 
Winston E. Scott. The crew planned to conduct a spacewalk to test instruments and procedures 
for the ISS. The Shuttle also carried the U.S. Microgravity Payload-4, which the astronauts 
planned to use to test the responses to conditions in space of a variety of materials and liquids.352

Two members of Columbia’s crew, U.S. astronaut Winston E. Scott and Japanese astronaut 
Takao Doi, conducted a spacewalk, successfully recapturing the unresponsive Spartan satellite 
released on 21 November. After the 3,000-pound (1,400-kilogram) satellite had failed to turn 
toward the Sun, Columbia’s robotic arm had bumped it away from the Shuttle. NASA officials 
had cancelled the mission’s originally planned spacewalk to rescue the US$10 million 
spacecraft. Astronauts Scott and Doi later received a telephone call from President William J. 
Clinton congratulating them on grabbing the satellite.353 
 
DECEMBER 1997 
1 December 
The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on the threat of space debris to the 
planned International Space Station (ISS). According to the report, Space Surveillance: DOD 
and NASA Need Consolidated Requirements and a Coordinated Plan, NASA’s surveillance 
capabilities, relying on the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) network of radar and optical 
sensors for information about possible collisions, had not provided enough information to 
prevent collisions in space. GAO surmised that DOD had focused most of its attention on 
military objects, missing many of the smaller pieces of debris that could have caused significant 
damage to NASA’s Shuttles or the ISS. GAO recommended that NASA, DOD, and the CIA 
collaborate to upgrade the space surveillance system. According to estimates, more than 110,000 
pieces of debris, most measuring about 0.5 inches (1.3 centimeters) in diameter, were floating in 
space. With a closing velocity of 35,000 miles (56,000 kilometers) per hour, even such a small 
object would do significant damage to the ISS, when the station was in a prograde orbit. GAO’s 
report noted that the fully completed ISS would be 10 times larger than any Shuttle flying in 
space, and that it would be in orbit for at least 10 years, increasing the chance of a collision 
occurring. Although they acknowledged the possibility of a collision, NASA scientists argued 
that the odds favored the ISS’s avoiding such an occurrence. As NASA’s expert, Chief Scientist 
for Orbital Debris, Nicholas L. Johnson, explained, “The odds are certainly in your favor that 
nothing will happen at all in those 10 years [of planned space station operation].”354

In a once-in-a-century occurrence, eight planets lined up in the sky “like pearls on a string” from 
west to east. Astronomers could view, in one line of sight, Pluto, followed by Mercury, Mars, 
Venus, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter, and Saturn⎯with a crescent Moon visible as well. Jack 
Horkheimer, host of public television’s Star Hustler described the event as “naked-eye 
astronomy at its best,” a boon for amateurs. According to computer calculations, the orbits of the 
planets would not line up in such a pleasing manner for observers on the Earth for at least 
another century.355

Crew aboard Shuttle Columbia successfully released and operated the Autonomous Extra-
vehicular Robotic Camera Sprint (AERCam Sprint). The 35-pound (16-kilogram), spherical 
camera propelled itself around the Shuttle after astronaut Winston E. Scott had released it during 
a spacewalk. The camera used periodic jet thrusts to maneuver, responding to control commands 
made from inside Columbia. The US$3 million camera transmitted images of Columbia and its 
crew back to Earth, providing unique vantage points for observation. The astronauts, who 
retrieved the small robotic device without any complications, concluded that it would be a 
helpful technology for future Shuttle missions and the ISS.356 
 
8 December 
The Astronauts Memorial Foundation recognized Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr. as the first black 
astronaut in NASA history, exactly 30 years after his death during a U.S. Air Force training 
mission. A ceremony adding Lawrence’s name to the Astronauts Memorial Foundation’s Space 
Mirror at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ended a long bureaucratic debate over whether 
Lawrence qualified as an astronaut. Lawrence had never met the Air Force requisite that an 
astronaut must have flown at an altitude of least 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth, because, 
although he had received his appointment to the U.S. Air Force’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory 
Program, he had died before flying in space. Therefore, the Astronauts Memorial Foundation had 
repeatedly refused to include his name on the Space Mirror at KSC. However, in 1996 U.S. 
Representative Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) had persuaded the Air Force to verify Lawrence’s status as 
an astronaut. Thereafter, the Astronauts Memorial Foundation’s board of directors voted, 
immediately and unanimously, to include Lawrence’s name on the Space Mirror.357 
 
At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, scientists unveiled evidence of another cause, 
besides the Sun, of “killer electrons,” which travel at high velocity. When electrons travel from 
Jupiter’s massive magnetic field, their speed approaches the speed of light. Showers of high-
velocity electrons cause many problems, including blackouts on Earth and damage to orbiting 
satellites and global positioning systems. Scientists had previously been unable to determine the 
source of the electrons causing the damage. Presenting the new information on the phenomenon 
of high-velocity electrons, the researchers declared that the ability to forecast “space weather,” 
including the patterns of high-velocity electrons, would become increasingly important during 
the coming age of the ISS.358 
 
9 December 
U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Bill Frist (R-TN) sent a harshly worded letter to NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, decrying NASA’s chronic cost overruns and promising 
investigative hearings before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
Although McCain and Frist both expressed support for NASA, and for space exploration in

general, they wrote that “continual, unabated overruns undermine the public faith” in the space 
program.359 
 
10 December 
NASA dedicated a plaque in memory of Ellison S. Onizuka, celebrating his record of achieving 
the highest altitude for propeller-driven aircraft. Onizuka had been Hawaii’s first astronaut and a 
member of the Shuttle crew aboard Challenger when it exploded in 1986. NASA’s recognition 
of Onizuka’s achievement, more than a decade later, occurred during the same year that the 
remotely controlled AeroVironment Pathfinder broke a distance record for unpiloted space 
travel, topping 71,000 miles (114,000 kilometers) during its 7 July 1997 flight. NASA honored 
Onizuka for his part in “reaching for the heavens and striving for excellence,” noting that his 
achievement had contributed to that of Pathfinder. NASA dedicated the plaque honoring 
Onizuka at the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, where the record-setting 
Pathfinder plane had set flight on its historic mission.360 
 
U.S. Senator D. Robert “Bob” Graham (D-FL) announced a plan to lease room aboard NASA 
Space Shuttles and the ISS to private entities, to offset the costs of space exploration. Graham 
announced his plan during a news conference at a new Cape Canaveral, Florida, air station 
dedicated to commercial launches. Congress had banned the use of the Shuttle for commercial 
purposes after the Challenger accident. Some space experts believed that Graham’s plan would 
take advantage of a strong commercial market for the retrieval of satellites from space. Graham’s 
plan joined a list of other initiatives of the mid-1990s, designed to merge government and private 
space interests to ease costs for the federal government.361 
 
16 December 
The Galileo spacecraft made the closest ever flyby of Jupiter’s moon Europa and earned a place 
in space history by becoming the first spacecraft to orbit an outer planet. Galileo came within 
124 miles (200 kilometers) of Europa, gathering images of what looked liked an icy ocean 
beneath the moon’s frozen crust. The prospect of water on the moon’s surface excited scientists, 
who had identified Europa’s climate as unique among the moons and planets of the galaxy. The 
images of the possible ocean seemed to show signs of “slushy material” pushing up against the 
surface ice, a sign of a heated core. The flyby was the first encounter to occur during Galileo’s 
two-year extension to its original mission. According to press accounts, Galileo, launched in 
1989, had already gathered enough data to force scientists to “rewrite textbooks.”362 
 
17 December 
NASA released images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) revealing more clearly than 
ever the “final blaze of glory” of aging Sun-like stars. Scientists had long hypothesized that stars 
gradually dimmed and died out as they cast off a shell of glowing gas. However, the HST 
revealed instead that dying stars create in space an intricate series of glowing

patterns⎯“pinwheels, lawn sprinkler style jets, elegant goblet shapes, and even some that look 
like a rocket engine’s exhaust.” Astronomers speculated that the new images would lead them to 
reanalyze “stellar evolution.” According to Howard E. Bond of the Space Telescope Science 
Institute of Baltimore, Maryland, the images made old ideas about the death of stars seem 
simplistic. Hubble scientist David S. Leckrone of NASA Headquarters, referring to the eventual 
burning out of the Sun, went so far as to say, “In a very real way, these images show us our own 
destiny.” Scientists believed that the images portrayed a complicated but very organized 
sequence of events, which experts might understand after further study.363 
 
Mir’s crew had to abandon a German-built robotic camera called the Inspector, which Russian 
space officials had hoped would capture precise images of the holes in the Spektr module, made 
when the a cargo craft crashed into Mir in June 1997. The camera had failed immediately after 
its launch, diverting from its planned course. After attempting for several hours to redirect the 
Inspector, the crew made plans to change Mir’s orbit, to avoid a collision with the unruly robot. 
The malfunctioning Inspector was the latest in the long string of accidents and malfunctions that 
had forced the three Russian-American crew members aboard Mir to spend nearly as much time 
on maintenance as on scientific research.364 
 
18 December 
President William J. Clinton awarded Congressional Space Medals of Honor to Edward H. 
White II and Roger B. Chafee, who died in the Apollo 1 fire. Clinton presented the medals to 
members of the men’s families in a ceremony in the Oval Office. White and Chafee were part of 
the three-man crew involved in the tragedy, which had occurred more than 30 years earlier. On 
27 January 1967, the Apollo 1 space capsule had caught fire on the launchpad, killing the three 
men on board the spacecraft. The third member of the crew, Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom, had 
received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. The accident had caused NASA to 
institute aggressive safety procedures, placing a premium on the well-being of its astronauts. 
Clinton noted the contributions of the fallen astronauts, “though they never got there, astronauts 
Chaffee, White, and Grissom’s footprints are on the moon.” Besides Apollo 1’s crew, only nine 
other astronauts had received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.365 
 
21 December 
NASA announced that, because of a US$100 million budget shortfall, it would lay off 600 
workers from its 6,000-person workforce, including 500 workers from KSC. United Space 
Alliance, the joint venture of Lockheed Martin and the Boeing Company, which NASA had 
contracted to take over Shuttle operations, planned to solicit volunteers for early retirement

before resorting to “pink slips.” To ensure the maintenance of safety standards, NASA was to 
maintain the right of final approval of all personnel decisions.366 
 
24 December 
EarthWatch Inc. of Longmont, Colorado, launched into orbit Early Bird 1, the first private spy 
satellite. The launch, which took place in Russia, ended government domination of space spying. 
According to EarthWatch, Early Bird 1 had the capability to track objects on Earth as small as 
10-feet (3-meters) long. The company also reported that “customers were lining up to buy 
images.” Customers for Early Bird 1 services included public interest groups, planning to track 
military movement and arms control measures, and foreign governments, without the resources 
to launch their own satellites. Because Early Bird 1 was an American-produced satellite, the U.S. 
federal government retained the right to switch it off during wartime, as well as the right to filter 
images sold to foreign customers. Experts predicted that the security and privacy questions 
surrounding the first private spy satellite would take years to sort out. However, they also 
surmised that Early Bird 1 was only the first in the wave of satellites that private industry would 
launch during the coming decade.367 
 
25 December 
The Russian Space Agency paid cosmonauts Vasili V. Tsibliyev and Alexander I. Lazutkin 
belated bonuses for their six-month Mir mission, payments that Russia had withheld until 
investigators had determined the two men’s roles during the troubled mission, which included 
the crash of a robotic cargo craft into Mir. S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia 
(RSC Energia), the company that built Mir, had blamed Tsibliyev and Lazutkin, suggesting that 
Russia deny the two cosmonauts their salaries. However, once the Russian government had 
determined that human error had been only one among many causes of the crash, RSC Energia’s 
President Yuri P. Semyonov had retracted the company’s demand that Russia punish the 
cosmonauts and had supported their right to receive payment. Tsibliyev received about 
US$100,000 and Lazutkin about US$80,000. Both men had expressed dismay at the negative 
reception they had received upon returning to Earth after the difficult mission.368

The crew of the Mir space station replaced the malfunctioning computer block, which had failed 
on 2 January, and restarted the station’s orientation system. This common type of malfunction, 
which had occurred seven times in 1997, did not create life-threatening conditions, but it did 
reduce the power supply to the space station, thereby crippling the gyroscope that oriented the 
station’s solar panels. Using the Soyuz escape module engines to control its orientation, Mir 
turned off all nonessential systems, to conserve energy until the crew had completed the 
repair.370 
 
Steve Fossett’s Solo Spirit balloon, carrying NASA’s prototype Aerobot Science Payload, landed 
prematurely when it experienced equipment problems. NASA had been testing the Aerobot 
Science Payload prototype for use on balloons in outer space, to collect information from other 
planets’ atmospheres. On this trip, Aerobot returned accurate data on position, balloon velocity, 
vertical wind velocity, temperature, and humidity, but experienced problems with a pressure 
sensor and a satellite communications link.371 
 
6 January 
An Athena II rocket carrying Lunar Prospector launched from the renovated U.S. Navy test-
launch site, Launch Complex 46, marking the first time that the government-based space 
transportation agency, Spaceport Florida Authority, had managed a launch from the complex. 
The rocket carried aboard some of the ashes of geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker, who had died in 
a car crash in July 1997. Among his many professional accomplishments, the sixty-nine-year-old 
Shoemaker had selected lunar landing sites and trained Apollo astronauts.  On 5 January, NASA 
had cancelled Athena II’s first scheduled launch for safety reasons, after U.S. Air Force radar 
necessary to track the rocket failed. The unpiloted rocket launched at 9:28 p.m. (EST) and, after 
1 hour, propelled the 4-foot (1.2-meter), 650-pound (291-kilogram) Lunar Prospector out of low-
Earth orbit toward the Moon.372 
 
8 January 
Astronomers announced that pictures from a new camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
supported the theory that a new planet was forming around Beta Pictoris. Images focusing on the 
disc (the halo of dust and gas rotating around the star) revealed that, instead of a smooth flow, 
one quadrant has a large bulge, indicating the orbital path of a planet that could be many times 
larger than Jupiter. No actual planet was visible in the images, only the effects of its gravitational 
pull. Nevertheless, this was the strongest evidence to date in visible light, of the presence of a 
possible planet. Beta Pictoris is younger (20 million to 100 million years old compared to the 
Sun’s 4.5 to 5 billion years) and about eight times brighter than the Sun. The formation of 
planets around a young star suggested that planets form very early in the life of a solar system.373

NASA named current Director of Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Joseph H. Rothenberg to 
head its Office of Space Flight, which oversees the Human Exploration and Development of 
Space Enterprise, which includes the Shuttle program and the planned International Space 
Station (ISS). Rothenberg replaced Wilbur C. Trafton, who had announced his resignation in 
November 1997. The Office of Space Flight accounted for about 40 percent of NASA’s US$13.6 
billion annual budget. Rothenberg was the first Director of the Office of Space Flight who had 
no experience in military aviation, the astronaut corps, the Space Shuttle, or management of the 
space station program. However, he had a strong background in engineering and astronomy. 
Rothenberg was closely involved in planning and using the HST and had worked as a space 
engineer at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). NASA named Alphonso V. Diaz to succeed 
Rothenberg at GSFC.374 
 
9 January 
The two Russian crew members of the Mir space station completed a record-breaking spacewalk. 
Commander Anatoly Y. Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov dismantled and retrieved in record 
time the Kristall module’s optical-monitoring equipment made by the United States. The 
scheduled 6-hour spacewalk took only 3 hours and 8 minutes. However, it was unclear whether 
the cosmonauts had been able to repair a leaky hatch. The problem was not with the rubber 
sealing, as Russian ground control had suspected, but rather with a malfunctioning lock that was 
preventing the hatch from sealing hermetically. The cosmonauts activated 10 reserve locks and 
pumped air into the airlock, planning to monitor the hatch for leaks over the next 24 hours. The 
spacewalk was Commander Solovyev’s 16th in five flights over 10 years. He had spent more than 
70 hours in free space, more than any other person had accrued.375 
 
11 January 
Russian Mission Control monitored Mir’s airlock pressure following the repair work of 9 
January. On Friday, 8 January, when the crew entered the airlock without spacesuits to retrieve 
some equipment, the repair was holding, but the pressure had fallen slightly. Russian ground 
control near Moscow, which was analyzing the data, planned to decide on Monday whether 
Mir’s Kvant-2 module was safe.376 
 
At 7:15 a.m. (EST), Lunar Prospector executed the first of three engine bursts needed to settle 
into orbit. In a flawlessly executed maneuver, Prospector fired its engines for 30 minutes to slow 
down, permitting the Moon’s gravity to capture it. The small robotic spacecraft was NASA’s 
first visitor to the Moon since the astronauts from Apollo 17 had walked on its surface in 1972. 
The Lunar Prospector project had cost about US$63 million.377

Pressure in Mir’s Kvant-2 module had been dropping steadily, to about three-quarters of the 
normal atmospheric pressure of Earth, indicating that the hatch was still not closing properly. 
Despite these problems, the team delayed further repairs, scheduling them to take place after 
other planned events, including a spacewalk scheduled for later in the week, the docking with 
Space Shuttle Endeavour planned for 25 January, and the arrival of a Russian-French team on 30 
January.378 
 
13 January 
Lunar Prospector settled into its orbit after three flawless engine burns. The five scientific 
instruments (magnetometer, electron reflectometer, gamma-ray spectrometer, neutron 
spectrometer, alpha particle spectrometer, and Doppler gravity experiment using an S-band 
antenna) began transmitting streams of data. The neutron spectrometer scanned the lunar surface 
for evidence of hydrogen; the gamma-ray spectrometer determined concentrations of elements 
such as uranium and iron; and the alpha-particle spectrometer searched for indications of 
volcanic and tectonic activity.379 
 
The contractor operating the Space Shuttle program, United Space Alliance (USA), announced 
that it would cut 500 jobs at KSC by 30 January, to reduce total workforce by 10 percent. The 
announcement raised concerns in Congress about Shuttle safety.380 
 
Florida state leaders began forming a task force to attract Lockheed Martin’s VentureStarTM 
Reusable Launch Vehicle to the coast’s spaceports. U.S. Representative David Weldon Jr. (R-
FL) confirmed verbal commitments from the Spaceport Florida Authority and from Enterprise 
Florida to help fund the task force. The Florida VentureStarTM Capture Team, the proposed name 
for the task force, estimated that they needed between US$200,000 and US$1 million to carry 
out a successful bid for the VentureStarTM business.381 
 
15 January 
American astronaut David A. Wolf made his first spacewalk, accompanied by veteran 
spacewalker Anatoly Y. Solovyev, Commander of the Mir space station. Solovyev, making his 
18th spacewalk, set the world’s record for the highest number of spacewalks by one individual.382 
The spacewalk began 20 minutes later than scheduled, because of problems opening locks on the 
malfunctioning outer hatch. The scheduled task had been to assess wear and tear on the exterior 
of the station using a photoreflectometer designed in the United States. David A. Wolf worked 
for 2 hours trying to verify whether the device was working properly, but only succeeded in 
taking readings on the shell of the nine-year-old Kvant-2 module, one of the station’s oldest

compartments. Engineers planned to use the data to help make selections for materials and 
protective coatings for the new ISS. Flight Director Vladimir A. Solovyov explained in a news 
conference at Mission Control outside Moscow, “the device proved to be far from mature, so it 
was decided to skip the examination of the core module.” Instead, the two men studied the holes 
in the Spektr module, which had suffered punctures during a collision with a cargo craft on 25 
June 1997.383 
 
16 January 
Mir Commander Anatoly Y. Solovyev celebrated his 50th birthday⎯in space, enjoying a “semi-
officially” sanctioned one-gulp-per-person dose of cognac and a birthday dinner chosen from the 
space station’s supplies. Solovyev had logged an impressive 80 hours of spacewalking during 17 
walks. As of this Mir mission, Solovyev’s fifth, the Russian cosmonaut had spent a cumulative 
total of approximately 20 months on the space station.384 
 
NASA officially named U.S. Senator John H. Glenn Jr. (D-OH), veteran astronaut of the 
Mercury program, as a crew member aboard Space Shuttle Discovery’s Mission STS-95 planned 
for October 1998. At age 77, Glenn would become the oldest person to fly in orbit. In 1962 he 
had been the first American to orbit Earth. NASA described the research planned during Glenn’s 
spaceflight, a joint effort between NASA and the National Institute of Aging of the National 
Institutes of Health. Scientists intended to supplement peer-reviewed research on sleep disorders, 
muscle atrophy, balance, and clinical evaluations of blood and heart function with data collected 
during Discovery’s planned October mission. Senator Glenn had undergone medical tests with 
NASA physicians, as well as with independent consultants, all of whom had determined that 
Glenn was medically qualified for spaceflight, with an excellent fitness level. NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin remarked that Glenn “brings a unique blend of experience to 
NASA. He has flight, operational, and policy experience.”385 
 
18 January 
The Russian Space Agency announced that the first module of the ISS was completed and ready 
to ship to the launchpad. Under a contract with Boeing Company, Khrunichev’s Moscow factory 
had designed and built this first module to hold cargo. The new module was similar to two 
existing modules in the Mir space station. Russia had originally scheduled the module for launch 
in November 1997, but fell behind in the production of the second unit. Despite the delay, 
Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev emphasized the importance of the 
day during a news conference: “This event symbolizes the fact that Russia was, is, and shall be a 
space nation, capable of realizing large-scale projects penetrating into space.” The ISS project, a 
joint effort of Russia, the United States, the European Space Agency (ESA), Canada, and Japan, 
was especially significant to Russia since the ISS would replace Mir as the only piloted element 
of Russia’s space program.386

Following a meeting of the Defence Council, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree giving 
overall control of Russia’s space industry to the civilian Russian Space Agency. Yeltsin’s 
intention was “to extract maximum economic benefit from one of the few manufacturing 
industries in which Russia is a world leader.” With this decree, Yeltsin required the government 
to create a plan for a restructured space industry, giving priority to national security, to economic 
and scientific missions, and to strengthening Russia’s position in the world marketplace.387 
 
21 January 
A NASA Space Shuttle program manager announced that a special safety study would not 
prevent USA, the prime Space Shuttle contractor, from cutting up to 10 percent of its workforce 
at KSC. The safety report, not yet released, called for some changes in the layoff plan, but would 
still permit the private company to cut up to 600 jobs.388 
 
NASA modified its contract with Orbital Sciences Corporation in order to produce a second 
flight vehicle for the X-34 program. The modified contract expanded test objectives, allowing 
US$7.7 million in additional funds for the purchase of hardware and another US$2 million for 
additional testing and analysis, wind tunnel testing, and a second leading-edge thermal protection 
system.389 
 
NASA announced the change in name of one of its four strategic enterprises. NASA’s Mission to 
Planet Earth Strategic Enterprise was renamed Earth Science Enterprise. Mission to Planet Earth 
Strategic Enterprise had originated 10 years ago, based on the concept that NASA should 
observe the Earth in the same way that it studies other planets. NASA said that the new name 
reflected the enterprise’s reformulated goals. NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise would seek to 
answer key questions about land-surface cover, near-term and long-term climate change, natural 
hazards, and atmospheric ozone.390 
 
The Russian Space Agency nominated veteran cosmonaut Valery V. Ryumin to fly as a mission 
specialist aboard Discovery during Mission STS-91 in May. In his last spaceflight in 1980, 
Ryumin was a member of the Soyuz 35 Mission. During that mission, he had spent 185 days in 
space from April through October. Ryumin had spent a total of 362 days in space in the course of 
his three missions.391 
 
22 January 
Space Shuttle Endeavour Mission STS-89 successfully launched from KSC in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, despite forecasted thunderstorms. The crew of STS-89 included Commander Terrence 
W. Wilcutt, Pilot Joe F. Edwards Jr., Payload Commander Bonnie J. Dunbar, and Mission 
Specialists Michael P. Anderson, James F. Reilly, Salizhan S. Sharipov, and Andrew S. W. 
Thomas, who would replace David A. Wolf on Mir. This was the eighth Shuttle–Mir docking,

but the first for an orbiter other than Atlantis and the first overseen by Launch Director David A. 
King. NASA had appointed two new rotational launch directors, David A. King and Ralph R. 
Roe Jr., following the retirement of veteran Launch Director James F. Harrington III.392 
 
NASA Launch Integration Manager Donald R. McMonagle announced that Space Shuttle 
Columbia’s tune-up would take place at the Boeing Company’s facility in Palmdale, California, 
rather than at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA Launch Integration and Shuttle operator 
USA advised Boeing officials “to get ready to map out a plan for Columbia’s work in 
California.” The announcement, following the recent notification about significant job cuts, was 
more bad news for KSC officials. NASA officials had proposed in 1996 that KSC handle much 
of the Shuttle’s maintenance and modification but had decided that the facility was “too busy 
with launches to handle [S]huttle renovation.” Alan Buis, a Boeing representative, suggested 
that, because Columbia would be getting “a complicated internal glass cockpit, Palmdale is ‘a 
logical choice’.”393 
 
24 January 
Shuttle Endeavour docked with Mir at an altitude of 214 nautical miles (2,467 miles or 3,970 
kilometers), bringing the seventh American astronaut to work on board Mir since the program 
began in 1995. Andrew S. W. Thomas, a mechanical engineer, replaced David A. Wolf, a 
physician, who had been on board Mir since September. The hatches opened at 5:25 p.m. (EST), 
and Thomas's transfer occurred at 6:35 p.m. (EST).394 
 
25 January 
Astronaut Andrew S. W. Thomas was unable to fit into his Russian-made emergency spacesuit 
before boarding Mir, but after initial orders that Thomas spend the first night in the Space 
Shuttle, Mission Control granted him permission to board. The suit was necessary only in case of 
emergency evacuation aboard Soyuz. Once aboard Mir, Thomas altered his spacesuit, adjusting 
and removing some straps in the armpit and torso areas. After the alterations, the suit fit exactly 
as it should, ensuring that Thomas would not have to return to Earth with Endeavour on 
Thursday.395 
 
During the Shuttle’s docking at Mir, a sensor aboard Endeavour failed, requiring Mir to take 
control of Endeavour. Mir was to keep the Shuttle pointed in the right direction until Mission 
Control could transmit software to fix the sensor.396 Crews transferred about half of the 7,400 
pounds (3,356 kilograms) of supplies and equipment aboard the Shuttle to the space station.397

26 January 
A Russian Space Agency official insisted that there had been no problem with Andrew S. W. 
Thomas’s spacesuit, describing the U.S. astronaut as bad tempered and expressing concern about 
the implications of Thomas’s attitude for the remainder of the mission. Deputy Flight 
Commander Viktor Blagov indicated that, since major work would take place on Mir, “any fuss 
about the space suit is out of place.” Blagov explained that Thomas would keep both David 
Wolf’s spacesuit and his own.398 
 
Endeavour lost power to its small forward-maneuvering jets for 30 minutes. Because the jets, 
which deliver 25 pounds (11 kilograms) of thrust, keep the complex stabilized as it orbits Earth, 
the loss of power left the Endeavour–Mir complex adrift. During this malfunction, the crew 
continued its main task, to transfer supplies and equipment from the Shuttle to the space station. 
NASA officials explained that the crew had never been in danger. However, if the Shuttle’s 
small maneuvering jets had not regained power, Endeavour would have had to rely on its 
primary jets, which deliver 875 pounds (397 kilograms) of thrust. Using the primary jets would 
have risked damage to Mir upon separation of the two spacecraft.399 
 
NASA announced the discovery of a fast-spinning pulsar, providing evidence of an evolutionary 
link between strong-field, slower-spinning, energetic pulsars and weak-field, millisecond pulsars. 
Frank Marshall, William W. Zhang, and Eric V. Gotthelf of GSFC found the pulsar by 
examining x-ray emissions that NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer spacecraft had recorded in 
1996. Observations of the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics spacecraft, a 
satellite jointly owned by Japan and the United States, confirmed the discovery. The scientists 
reported that the pulsar was spinning at a rate of 60 times per second, and that it could have been 
spinning as fast as 150 times per second when it formed 4,000 years ago. An astrophysicist at the 
U.S. Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory remarked, “this is the fastest 
high-energy pulsar of its type we know about.” The research team reported that the pulsar is 
“likely associated with the remnant of a supernova (N157B) that exploded in the Large 
Magellanic Cloud about 4,000 years ago.” Comparing the pulsar found in N157B to the high-
energy pulsar in the Crab Nebula, the scientists reported that the central source of x-ray light 
from N157B is this fast-spinning pulsar associated with a supernova remnant, proving the 
hypothesis that the weaker the magnetic field, the faster the pulsar spins at birth.400 
 
27 January 
Engineers at KSC made corrections to Endeavour’s software, completely repairing the Shuttle’s 
jets overnight. After the transmittal of the corrected software to the computers on board the 
Shuttle, the problem was resolved. NASA believed that a malfunctioning relay latch, an 
electrical connection on the spacecraft, had caused the problem.401

The crew closed the hatches used to transfer equipment between Endeavour and Mir at 5:34 p.m. 
(EST) in preparation for Endeavour’s return flight to Earth. The closure of the hatches concluded 
five days of Endeavour’s continuous link-up with Mir, during which time the astronauts and 
cosmonauts had transferred 9,600 pounds (4,350 kilograms) of materials. In addition to 
equipment exchanges, the crew exchanged American astronaut David A. Wolf for Andrew S. W. 
Thomas, a U.S. astronaut born in Australia, who was to remain aboard Mir for a planned four-
and-one-half-month mission.402 
 
NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded a US$423 million 
contract to Hughes Space and Communications of El Segundo, California, to manufacture and 
launch up to four weather-monitoring Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites 
(GOES). The basic contract covered the manufacture and launch of two spacecraft. Separate 
fixed-price options for two additional spacecraft would cost US$190 million and US$185 
million. The spacecraft would carry instruments to provide regular measurements of the Earth’s 
atmosphere, cloud cover, and land surfaces. Two spacecraft would also carry the Solar X-ray 
Imager and Space Environment Monitor instruments. These four spacecraft, known as GOES-N, 
-O, -P, and -Q were to continue, enhancing the services of the current GOES-I through -M series, 
a “mainstay of modern weather forecasting.” The GOES series provided meteorologists and 
hydrologists with “visible and infrared images of weather systems, and precise atmospheric 
soundings.” The positions of the spacecraft in orbit would allow scientists to monitor storms 
when they were first forming in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.403 
 
29 January 
An Atlas rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 1:37 p.m. (EST), 
after NASA had scrubbed the flight three days in a row. The Lockheed Martin rocket, which 
carried a classified spacecraft for the Pentagon’s National Reconnaissance Office, separated from 
its passenger 1½ hours after launching, with the satellite successfully placed in orbit. The 
satellite, viewing two-thirds of the globe, was to circle the Earth in an egg-shaped orbit, taking it 
from 24,000 miles (39,000 kilometers) above the northern latitudes to just 200 miles (322 
kilometers) above Antarctica.404 
 
Endeavour separated from Mir to head home at 11:57 a.m. (EST), returning David A. Wolf to 
Earth and leaving Andrew S. W. Thomas at the Mir station for a four-and-one-half-month stay. 
Wolf was returning to Earth aboard Endeavour after completing a 119-day stay on Mir. The new 
crew of Mir, two cosmonauts, Kazakh Talgat A. Musabayev and Russian Nikolai M. Budarin, 
and a French astronaut Léopold Eyharts, lifted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 
Soyuz TM-27, 23 minutes before Endeavour undocked from Mir.405

Fourteen nations and space agencies participated in a ceremony, signing final accords to build 
and manage the future ISS. Participating countries were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States. Acting Secretary of State Strobe Talbott signed, on behalf of 
the United States, the 1998 Intergovernmental Agreement on Space Station Cooperation, and 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin signed separate bilateral memoranda of understanding 
with heads of the Russian Space Agency, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency. The new 
agreements superseded previous agreements concerning the ISS, which Canada, Europe, Japan, 
and the United States had signed in 1988.406 
 
30 January 
Raytheon Systems Company’s training unit, formerly known as Hughes Training, appointed 
former astronaut Henry W. Hartsfield Jr. as Managing Director for the company’s NASA 
support business. In this position, Hartsfield was to manage the development of simulators for 
the ISS program.407 
 
31 January 
Just hours before Endeavour touched down in Florida, a new crew from Russia docked at Mir to 
begin a three-week transition from Mir 24 to Mir 25. Mir 25 Commander Talgat A. Musabayev 
replaced Anatoly Y. Solovyev, Flight Engineer Nikolai M. Budarin replaced Pavel V. 
Vinogradov, and Researcher Léopold Eyharts, a 40-year old French air force pilot on his first 
spaceflight, joined the crew.408 
 
The U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Museum in Cape Canaveral, Florida, celebrated the 40th 
anniversary of the successful launch of the modified Redstone rocket, which had carried into 
orbit Explorer I, the United States’ first satellite. The launch occurred four months after the 
Soviet Union had placed Sputnik I in orbit. In addition to achieving orbit, the 31-pound (14-
kilogram) Explorer I had discovered the Van Allen Radiation Belt. The museum at the Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station held an open house and a space fair and launched a model rocket to 
celebrate the anniversary of this milestone and to educate the public about the United States’ 40 
years in space.409

One thousand Puerto Ricans protested against NASA’s plans to launch, from a nature preserve in 
Puerto Rico, suborbital rockets filled with chemicals. The Coqui Dos program planned the 
launch to measure high-level winds and turbulence in the upper atmosphere. Coqui Dos 
continued the El Coqui program of 1992, part of NASA’s Suborbital Sounding Rocket program, 
which launched 25 sounding rockets annually from locations worldwide. Because the rockets

NASA produce studies proving that the launch would not damage the environment. The mayor 
of Vega Baja led the protest outside the entrance to the Tortuguero Recreation Area, the section 
of the nature preserve where the rocket launches would take place, threatening to sue NASA to 
force it to release environmental impact studies from the 1992 launch.410 
 
2 February 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced that NASA planned to reserve an additional US$750 
million of federal funds over the next two years, enabling Lockheed Martin to continue work on 
a replacement vehicle for the Space Shuttle. Lockheed Martin and NASA had signed an 
agreement in 1996 to develop the X-33 suborbital test craft. At that time, the federal government 
had pledged to dedicate US$900 million to develop the craft and fund 15 suborbital test flights, 
beginning in the spring of 1999. Goldin explained that if the test program exceeded the original 
ceiling of US$900 million, the US$750 million funding pool would be available, beginning in 
the year 2000, to develop the X-33 replacement vehicle.411 
 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced the selection of Ghassem R. Asrar as the new 
Associate Administrator for Earth Science Enterprise. Before this appointment, Asrar had served 
as Chief Scientist for the Earth Observing System in the Office of Earth Science Enterprise at 
NASA Headquarters. He led an international team in developing scientific priorities and 
measurements “to be obtained from a series of advanced Earth-orbiting satellites that promise 
fundamental new insights into the connections between Earth’s land, oceans, atmosphere, ice, 
and life.”412 
 
4 February 
A West European Ariane 4LP rocket blasted off from French Guiana, carrying two 
communications satellites, Brasilsat-3 and Inmarsat-3. Twenty-one minutes after takeoff, the 
first satellite, belonging to Brazil, separated from the rocket. Five minutes later, the second 
satellite, a 2-ton (1,800-kilogram or 1.8-tonne) worldwide mobile communications satellite, 
separated from the rocket. The launch successfully placed both satellites in orbit.413

Shuttle operator United Space Alliance (USA) cut 363 jobs at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), one 
of the largest cutbacks in decades. Combining the layoffs with 194 voluntary resignations, USA 
eliminated 557 jobs at KSC. In implementing the cutbacks, the company hoped to “trim $100 
million from the current [S]huttle budget,” thereby reducing costs, improving efficiency, and 
attracting new payload customers without compromising safety.414

At a news conference at NASA in Washington, DC, Robert P. Kirshner, astronomer at the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and other astronomers discussed new Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST) images, showing a “shock wave lighting a knot of gas some 100 billion 
miles [161 billion kilometers] wide.” In 1987, when a telescope in Chile detected the first light of 
an exploding star, the supernova designated SN1987A, astronomers had observed a glowing ring 
of gas around the remnant of the star. Although the gas ring had cooled and faded, the new HST 
images showed the shock wave of energy colliding with and lighting up the edges of the ring. 
The astronomers had been studying the images closely to learn more about how stars evolve and 
become supernovas. Anne L. Kinney of the Space Telescope Science Institute explained that 
studying stellar evolution and the inner workings of supernovas is important, because the 
explosions that create supernovas “fertilize the galaxies” with the enriched material of heavy 
elements.415 
 
The National Research Council released a report entitled “Space Technology for the New 
Century,” finalizing two years of independent study by an expert panel, conducted at the request 
of NASA. The report’s key finding stated that, because of its “faster, better, cheaper” short-term 
goals, NASA “may be neglecting key technologies needed for longer-term advances in space.” 
The panel identified six technologies that NASA ought to “spur with annual investments of $3 
million to $5 million each.” The technologies, all with broad-based applications, include: 1) 
high-volume, planet-to-planet video and data communications based on laser technologies 
instead of radio frequencies; 2) precisely controlled space structures (space telescopes with more 
sophisticated and sensitive steering and pointing); 3) micro-machines; 4) safer and more efficient 
nuclear power systems; 5) radiation-resistant computers and electronics; and 6) advanced space 
mining and manufacturing technologies.416

The Commercial Aviation Safety Strategy Team (CASST) announced a campaign to focus 
attention on “the most pressing aviation safety problems.” CASST was composed of the Air 
Transport Association, Boeing Company, Airbus Industrie, the Air Line Pilots Association, and 
the Aerospace Industries Association, as well as major jet engine manufacturers, General Electric 
Company, Pratt & Whitney of United Technologies Corporation, and Rolls-Royce. CASST 
identified the top safety issues needing improvement worldwide, including controlled-flight-into-
terrain accidents, engine failures, runway incursions, and maintenance errors. CASST 
recommended working to reduce these safety hazards, as well as implementing technologies to 
detect in-flight turbulence.417

press briefing at JPL. The researchers announced that the Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(AIRSAR), developed by JPL to produce radar maps, had helped them to detect and locate a 
distribution of prehistoric mounds and undocumented temples to the northwest of Angkor. The 
three-dimensional maps, created using radar interferometry, revealed evidence of temples and 
earlier civilization that were absent or incorrectly marked on modern topographic maps and early 
twentieth-century archaeological reports. These discoveries brought into question long-standing 
ideas about the urban evolution of Angkor. The 1996 AIRSAR Pacific Rim Deployment on 
board a NASA DC-8 jet was a follow-up to a 1994 study of Angkor that used Spaceborne 
Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on board Space Shuttle 
Endeavour during Mission STS-59, producing the radar images used to create the three-
dimensional maps. Unlike SIR-C/X-SAR, AIRSAR had P-band with a longer wavelength, able 
to penetrate the forest canopy. AIRSAR also flew in a mode that allowed it to measure 
topography and create three-dimensional images of the surface.418 
 
As part of the Small Business Innovation Research Program, NASA officials chose more than 
300 research proposals to share US$23 million in funding. Out of 28 award categories, 21 
focused on space-based applications, such as achieving routine space travel, exploring and 
settling the solar system, and developing new technologies in astrobiology. The range of topics 
indicated that research associated with high-profile space transportation and exploration efforts, 
curtailed because of cuts in NASA’s 1999 budget, would continue on a smaller scale.419 
 
The Voyager 1 spacecraft became the most distant human-made object in space, at 6.5 billion 
miles (11 billion kilometers) from Earth. At 2:10 p.m. (PST), the Voyager 1 spacecraft surpassed 
the distance of the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which was traveling in the opposite direction. 
Voyager’s signal took 9.5 hours to reach Earth. The spacecraft had to rely on radioisotope 
thermal electric generators, because at the far edge of the solar system, very little solar power 
was able to reach it—at that distance, the Sun is only 1/5,000th as bright as it is on Earth. Edward 
C. Stone, a Voyager scientist and Director of NASA’s JPL, remarked, “the fact that the 
spacecraft is still returning data is a remarkable technical achievement.” NASA had launched 
Voyager 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 5 September 1977.420 
 
Wesley T. Huntress Jr. announced that he would resign from NASA in the near future. As 
NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Science, Huntress had been responsible for programs 
in astrophysics, planetary exploration, and space physics. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
credited him with the revitalization of NASA’s Space Science Enterprise, in particular, with 
overseeing critical components of the program such as the HST and Mars Pathfinder. Huntress 
had joined NASA’s JPL in the 1960s, a research scientist specializing in ion chemistry and 
planetary atmospheres, and NASA had appointed Huntress to head the Office of Space Science 
in March 1993. In his retirement announcement, Huntress stated, “I have served in this position 
for more than five years now and it is simply time to move on.”421

The Soyuz landing capsule, carrying two Russian cosmonauts and a French astronaut returning 
from Mir, landed safely in the snow and bitter cold (-22°F or -30°C) about 20 miles (32 
kilometers) from the northern Kazakhstan village of Arkalyk. Only one of eight rescue 
helicopters was able to meet the crew because of wind, clouds, and thick snow, limiting visibility 
to less than 160 feet (49 meters). Anatoly Y. Solovyev and Pavel V. Vinogradov returned to 
Earth after a six-month mission on Mir. During their stay on Mir, the cosmonauts had focused on 
repairing the aging space station. Léopold Eyharts returned to Earth with six salamanders. The 
two cosmonauts who had replaced Solovyev and Vinogradov had flown the salamanders to Mir, 
carrying them on board the space station in January. While in space, Eyharts had conducted 
experiments on the salamanders, including monitoring the effects of antigravity on the reptiles’ 
egg-laying capabilities.422 
 
20 February 
This date marked Mir’s 12th birthday. Russian Space Agency cosmonauts, Kazakh Talgat A. 
Musabayev and Russian Nikolai M. Budarin, and U.S. astronaut, Australian-born Andrew S. W. 
Thomas, took a 45-minute trip outside the space station, moving the escape capsule to the other 
side of Mir to make space for the next cargo craft to dock. Ground controllers briefly lost contact 
with the crew when Mir lost its connection to a communications satellite. For the first time, 
Thomas wore the Russian-made spacesuit that had been too small when he first arrived at the 
space station.423 
 
21 February 
After two delays, one because of mechanical problems, the other because of strong winds, a 
Japanese H-2 rocket blasted off from Tanegashima Space Center, carrying a US$370 million 
communications satellite intended to conduct a three-year series of communications and 
broadcast tests. However, an engine breakdown prevented the satellite from entering a 
geostationary orbit; instead, the launch left the satellite floating in space, useless for its intended 
mission. Engineers were looking for ways to rescue the mission.424 
 
The Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame inducted into its roll of honors James B. Odom, an 
engineer at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) who had served NASA for 33 years 
in the International Space Station, Space Shuttle, and HST programs. The Hall of Fame also 
honored Marshall’s X-ray Calibration Facility, which had tested and calibrated x-ray telescopes 
since the 1970s. MSFC’s X-ray Calibration Facility supported the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics 
Facility in achieving a resolving power 10 times greater than any previous x-ray telescope.425

A US$35,000 study commissioned by the Florida Space Business Roundtable revealed that 
commercial satellite companies did not favor Cape Canaveral as a launch site. The Florida Space 
Business Roundtable presented its findings at the Florida Space Launch Symposium in 
Melbourne, Florida. In the survey, executives from satellite manufacturing companies rated 
spaceports, evaluating them in 11 categories, such as their launch base facilities, flight 
scheduling, governmental red tape, and on-site technical services. The executives’ favorite 
launch site was Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California, and they selected Xichang 
Satellite Launch Center in China as the worst place to launch. Florida’s spaceports did well in 
two categories, but business executives considered red tape at those facilities a problem.426 
 
25 February 
NASA partially cancelled the Clark satellite program, keeping only the US$13 million launch 
vehicle service portion of the contract with Lockheed Martin. As reasons for the cancellation, 
NASA cited cost overruns, an uncertain launch schedule, and questions concerning the 
effectiveness of Clark’s instruments in orbit, because its primary instrument had been “sitting on 
the ground two years longer than planned.” The intended mission of the program was to take 
black-and-white stereo images, showing detail as small as 10 feet (3 meters) across, for NASA’s 
Office of Earth Science Enterprise (formerly the Office of Mission to Planet Earth), as well as 
for commercial customers. NASA had paired the Clark satellite with the Lewis satellite. 
However, after its August 1997 launch, the Lewis satellite had gone into a spin, which controllers 
were unable to repair. Consequently, the Lewis satellite plunged into the atmosphere where it 
burned up.427 
 
26 February 
A valve in an air purifier on Mir overheated, spreading smoke aboard the station. Although the 
incident caused elevated carbon monoxide, the levels continued to drop steadily. The crew was 
not in danger, but the incident was a reminder of the terrifying fire that had occurred last year, 
when an oxygen generator burned for 14 minutes, filling Mir with smoke and nearly causing the 
crew to abandon the station.428

Russian space officials cancelled a spacewalk after cosmonauts broke three wrenches on the last 
of 10 locks, while trying to open a hatch. The cosmonauts had intended to repair a damaged solar 
panel. NASA rescheduled the spacewalk for April. The incident further increased concerns about 
the safety of Mir.429

At a news conference at Ames Research Center (ARC), NASA scientists announced that the 
Lunar Prospector spacecraft had found “evidence of ice crystals sprinkled throughout the Moon’s 
shadowy north and south poles.” Alan B. Binder, a Lunar Prospector scientist, stated that the 
team believed they had detected anywhere from 10 million to several 100 million tons of water 
over areas of 3,600 to 18,000 square miles (9,300 to 47,000 square kilometers) at the northern 
pole and 1,800 to 7,200 square miles (4,700 to 19,000 square kilometers) at the southern pole. 
However, the ice, detected using a neutron spectrometer that scans the lunar surface for signs of 
hydrogen, was not in the form of ice sheets, but “present in small crystals mixed in with the 
moon’s rocky soil, scattered across thousands of square miles in lunar polar regions.” Although 
evidence of ice was quite strong, the water signal was relatively weak. Because the Moon is very 
dry, scientists theorized that comets or asteroids colliding with the Moon’s surface had carried 
the ice to the Moon.430 
 
NASA named astronaut Eileen M. Collins to command Space Shuttle Columbia on the upcoming 
Mission STS-93 in December 2008. Collins was the first woman to command a Space Shuttle 
mission. NASA had selected her as an astronaut candidate in 1990, and she had become an 
astronaut in July 1991. She flew her first mission aboard Shuttle Discovery in February 1995. On 
that mission, Discovery came within 30 feet (9 meters) of Mir during a practice run for docking 
with the space station. Collins was also the first woman ever to pilot a Space Shuttle, flying 
Shuttle Atlantis in May 1997, to deliver British-born U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale to Mir and 
to return astronaut Jerry M. Linenger to Earth.431 
 
Russian cosmonauts aboard Mir located a lost wrench among 12 years’ worth of accumulated 
spare parts. They used the wrench to loosen the bolt that had broken three wrenches earlier in the 
week, preventing the two cosmonauts from undertaking a planned spacewalk.432 
 
10 March 
NASA officially declared Mars Pathfinder “dead” six months after its mission ended, after 
getting no response to one last set of commands. Pathfinder’s mission had ended on 27 
September 1997, when NASA lost communication with the craft. Pathfinder and its rover 
Sojourner had landed on Mars on 4 July 1997, and NASA had expected the two craft to “live” on 
Mars for only 30 days. However, Pathfinder had exceeded its mission by eight weeks, and 
Sojourner had roamed the Martian terrain 10 weeks longer than the originally planned one-week 
operation.433 
 
12 March 
The X-38 atmospheric vehicle completed its first unpiloted test flight successfully. Project 
Manager John F. Muratore commented that the successful test was “the culmination of two years 
of hard work by a team from the Johnson Space Center and the Dryden Flight Research Center.”

NASA had created the X-38, which could hold up to seven passengers, as an escape vehicle for 
the International Space Station (ISS). Described as a “whale-shaped, wingless vehicle with fins 
that look as if they were inspired by a 1956 Cadillac,” the X-38 was the first new spacecraft in 
more than 20 years to reach the flight-testing stage. Engineers had designed a fully automated 
craft, “so that even badly injured crew members could climb in, [the vehicle would] separate 
from the station, and the vehicle would then serve as an ambulance, using satellite-based 
navigation aids” to carry passengers directly back to a designated landing field on Earth.434 
 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin publicly acknowledged for the first time that the ISS 
would cost more than originally proposed, with a revised cost of US$21.3 billion, and would take 
longer to assemble than was initially planned, with a revised completion date of December 2003. 
Since 1993, NASA had consistently reported that the cost of the ISS would be US$17.4 billion, 
and had targeted a 2002 completion date. The revised cost was 200 percent more than the 
original US$8 billion estimate in President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 proposal.435 
 
13 March 
New data from NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor Mission provided insights into the planet’s 
deeply layered terrain, its strong, localized magnetic fields, and the genesis and evolution of a 
Martian dust storm. Scientists analyzed data collected in October and November 1997, 
publishing the first set of formal results in the 13 March 1998 issue of Science. Mars Global 
Surveyor had used a variety of instruments to collect data. The thermal emission spectrometer 
had mapped the temperature and opacity of the Martian atmosphere during the sandstorm, and a 
camera had returned visual images of the storm’s effects. The spectrometer had also obtained 
some infrared emission spectra of Mars’s surface, indicating “the presence of pyroxene and 
plagioclase, minerals which are common in volcanic rocks, with a variable amount of dust 
component.” Surveyor’s magnetometer and electron reflectometer had measured strong localized 
magnetic fields on Mars. A laser altimeter had collected data from Mars’s northern hemisphere, 
revealing a flat surface, becoming increasingly rough toward the equator. Scientists had 
interpreted a variety of landforms in the Mars images, including the northern polar cap and 
gigantic canyons, ridges, craters, and shield volcanoes.436 
 
14 March 
Progress M-38 launched on a Soyuz-V rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, 
carrying a 900-kilogram (2,000-pound) propulsion unit. Mir’s crew planned to attach the unit to 
the Quantum module of the space station. The cargo craft also carried 1,500 kilograms (3,300 
pounds) of repair tools, replacement parts, food, and water.437 
 
Minnie, the last living astro-chimp, died of old age at forty-one-years-old. Minnie had lived out 
her retirement at Holloman Air Force Base under the care of the Coulston Foundation. Minnie, 
an understudy for chimps Ham and Enos, was the only female chimpanzee to train for the

chimpanzee in space when he had made a 15-minute suborbital flight in 1961, before Alan B. 
Shepard Jr.’s flight that May. Enos’s orbital flight had been a precursor to John H. Glenn Jr.’s 
flight in February 1962.438 
 
17 March 
At the request of the United States, Israeli officials arrested Ehud Tenenbaum, the eighteen-year-
old computer hacker who called himself The Analyzer, along with two other Israeli teenagers. 
Tenenbaum was ringleader of a group called Israeli Internet Underground. Prosecutors accused 
the teenage hackers of breaking into U.S. government and military computer systems, including 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), as well as into Israeli government computers and 
commercial and educational computer systems in the United States. The FBI said that all three 
had admitted their involvement, stating that they had worked in tandem with two juveniles in 
Cloverdale, California.439 
 
A Progress cargo spacecraft delivering supplies to Mir veered off course while in automatic 
mode, forcing the space station’s crew to perform a manual docking. Mission Control ordered 
Commander Talgat A. Musabayev to perform the docking when the two craft were only 65 feet 
(20 meters) apart. Musabayev steered the cargo craft smoothly and avoided repeating last June’s 
collision.440 
 
Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev responded to U.S. criticism of 
Russian delays in constructing components of the ISS, “NASA [is] trying to ‘concentrate 
attention entirely on Russia’s difficulties’ even though [NASA is] ‘three months behind’ in 
constructing a laboratory module.” Koptev stated that the Russian Space Agency had only 
received one-fifth of the US$100 million President Boris N. Yeltsin had allocated for 
construction of the service module, leading to a seven-month delay in the program. In an effort to 
improve the Russian Space Agency’s financial situation, Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. and 
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin discussed the possibility of Russia’s launching more 
foreign commercial satellites, with the condition that Russia would “keep its promise to stop 
assisting Iran’s weapons program.”441 
 
18 March 
NASA announced the arrest of “the suspected leader of a group of computer hackers who broke 
into the network of a NASA laboratory.” Law enforcement agents accused twenty-year-old 
Calldan Levi Coffman of Carson, Washington, suspected leader of a group called ViRii, of 
infiltrating the networks of various corporations, universities, and other government agencies, in 
addition to breaching the security of computer systems at NASA’s JPL last June. NASA’s 
Computer Crimes Division had worked with other government agencies, including the U.S. 
Naval Intelligence Service, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and the FBI, to

Analyzer. Law enforcement officials suspected Tenenbaum of organizing a confederation of 
hacker groups, including his own group and Coffman’s group.442 
 
19 March 
NASA’s Office of Earth Science Enterprise selected the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in 
Washington, DC, and the University of Colorado’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space 
Physics to conduct “parallel six-month definition studies of a new small satellite to monitor 
variations in the amount of radiant solar energy that reaches Earth,” as part of the preparations 
for the Total Solar Irradiance Mission.443 
 
NASA officials appeared before a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Science and 
Technology to explain the increasing price tag of the ISS. The anticipated cost of the ISS had 
increased to US$4 billion more than originally projected, drawing ire from supporters and 
opponents alike. NASA’s new Associate Administrator for Space Flight Joseph H. Rothenberg 
led the lawmakers through the reasons for the increasing budget, explaining the series of revised 
out-year estimates. He attributed part of the problem to cost overruns related to “recurring 
schedule and budget problems with the Russian [S]pace [A]gency,” and part to the fact that 
NASA’s primary contractor, the Boeing Company, was already US$600 million to US$817 
million over budget. However, Rothenberg stated, “only a fraction of these revised out-year 
estimates are tied to actual overruns.”444 
 
At a NASA Advisory Council meeting at Marshall Space Flight Center, Jay Chabrow, an 
aerospace industry consultant, presented findings of a study conducted to determine the true 
costs of assembling and maintaining the future ISS. U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and other 
concerned lawmakers had tasked Chabrow and his seven-member team of private and 
government analysts with undertaking this investigation, conducted over five months. The 
analysts’ findings showed that the ISS could cost as much as US$6 billion more than NASA 
officials had estimated, reaching a total of US$24 billion, and that the outpost likely would not 
be ready to house a full crew until 2006. The report also provided estimates regarding the total 
cost of the space station over its entire lifetime. The analysts projected that Space Shuttle 
missions to assemble the station, resupply flights, and staff operating the Shuttle from the 
ground, would cost NASA US$94 billion. The study also found that planned caps on 
congressional spending were unrealistic, and that NASA and Boeing officials had been overly 
optimistic in their cost and schedule estimates. Factors driving costs higher included Russian 
nonperformance, software development and integration, construction of a crew return vehicle, 
and Boeing cost overruns. The report did not account for further cost increases in the event of a 
total Russian pullout.445

Boeing Company announced plans to cut an additional 8,200 jobs by the end of the year 2000, to 
streamline facilities, to focus on manufacturing and assembly operations, and to eliminate 
redundant laboratories. The job cuts, affecting work sites in Arkansas, California, and Texas, 
included planned product phaseouts of the MD-80 and MD-90, and brought into question the 
future of the MD-11. As it shut down selected facilities, including an electronic manufacturing 
facility and the Site 9 modification center, Boeing planned to transfer thousands of employees 
involved with aircraft and missile systems, reusable-space-systems support, and satellites.446 
 
22 March 
NASA marked its second full year of “continuous human presence in Earth orbit” aboard 
Russia’s Mir space station. Shuttle Atlantis had launched on 22 March 1996, with U.S. astronaut 
Shannon W. Lucid aboard. Lucid then spent 188 days in space, an American record. She was the 
second NASA astronaut to live aboard Mir. Following her tenure, an unbroken succession of 
astronauts, John E. Blaha, Jerry M. Linenger, C. Michael Foale, David A. Wolf, and Andrew S. 
W. Thomas, had spent time on Mir. Norman E. Thagard, the first American astronaut to live on 
Mir, had arrived in March 1995, spending 115 days on Mir before Lucid’s stay. Nine months 
separated Thagard’s mission and Lucid’s. Frank L. Culbertson Jr., head of NASA’s cooperative 
human spaceflight program with Russia, commented, “an unbroken presence has been extremely 
valuable to our having an awareness of what it takes to fly a space station, to maintain an outpost 
on the frontier.”447 
 
25 March 
The Boeing Company appointed Michael T. Kennedy to a newly created position, Vice President 
for the Boeing Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and Delta IV Programs. Since 1996, 
Kennedy had been Vice President of Delta III and had shown “his ability to manage launch 
vehicle development effectively by bringing Delta III on line for its first launch this summer.” As 
Kennedy moved into his new position, Boeing promoted Daniel J. Collins to Program Director 
for Delta III, and Jay L. Witzling became Vice President of Delta II and Titan Programs. 
Kennedy had joined Boeing in 1970, working on the Skylab, Saturn SIVB, Titan, Delta, 
SPACEHAB, and ISS programs.448 
 
26 March 
An international team of researchers announced that observations of U.S. satellites orbiting Earth 
had proven one of physicist Albert Einstein’s theories correct. In his general theory of relativity, 
Einstein had predicted that a spinning body could curve space, because the “spin of a body must 
change the geometry of the universe by generating space-time curvature.” Einstein had called the 
phenomenon frame dragging, but scientists came to refer to it as the Lense-Thirring effect, 
naming it for two Austrian physicists who wrote that rotating celestial bodies, such as the Sun, 
“create a force that pulls space toward them.” Ignazio Ciufolini, a physicist at Sapienza 
University of Rome, and his colleagues used lasers to measure changes in the orbits of the Laser 
Geodynamics Satellite I, or LAGEOS, a NASA spacecraft, and LAGEOS II, a satellite belonging 
to NASA and the Italian Space Agency. The research team observed changes that they could not

account for by the laws of gravity or tidal forces, concluding that the Lense-Thirring effect 
exists. The satellites, launched in 1976 and 1992, were passive satellites dedicated exclusively to 
laser ranging. In this process, scientists had send laser pulses to the satellite from ranging 
stations on Earth, measuring the round-trip travel time of the pulses. The research team had 
analyzed data collected over a four-year period beginning in 1993.449 
 
27 March 
NASA awarded a contract worth US$148 million to Raytheon STX Corporation. The five-year 
award included a one-year base period followed by four one-year options. Contract services for 
providing federal information processing services at NASA’s ARC included software 
development and maintenance, engineering operations and maintenance, network services, 
analysis, quality assurance, and reviews.450 
 
France’s Aérospatiale, British Aerospace, Germany’s Daimler-Benz Aerospace, and Spain’s 
CASA, partners in the Airbus Industrie airplane-manufacturing consortium, announced their 
intention to merge into a “unified civilian and military aerospace conglomerate that would 
compete in the world market with U.S. aerospace giants Lockheed Martin Corp[oration] and 
Boeing Co[mpany]” The partners provided no details regarding how the merger would take 
place, but the public statement represented “another move toward a unified European aerospace 
industry,” an idea that had been elusive “because of the competing national interests of the 
various countries.”451 
 
30 March 
Astronomers at the University of Manchester in England and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
announced that six radio telescopes, in concert with the HST, had “captured the first image ever 
recorded of an unbroken ‘Einstein ring’,” a “circle of light created by the gravitational warping 
of space between a very distant galaxy and the earth.” Physicist Albert Einstein’s general theory 
of relativity had predicted that “light from a distant object would travel a curving path if it passed 
close to a massive object along the line of sight from Earth.” The radio image showed a 
fragmented group of bright arcs, but the HST showed that the galaxy’s infrared emission region 
was perfectly in line with the gravitational lens and Earth, confirming the existence of the 
Einstein ring.452

In a spacewalk lasting nearly 7 hours, Mir cosmonauts failed to stabilize the solar panel damaged 
in a collision in 1997. Russian space officials had postponed this spacewalk from 3 March, when 
the crew had been unable to unlock the hatch, breaking three wrenches in their attempts. Russian 
Space Agency cosmonauts, Kazakh Talgat A. Musabayev and Russian Nikolai M. Budarin, spent 
most of the spacewalk setting up a handrail, left outside the space station by the previous crew.

After struggling to unfold and assemble the handrail, the pair only had enough time to install one 
of two footrests. The cosmonauts returned to Mir after the elapse of 6 hours and 40 minutes; their 
oxygen tanks only held approximately 7 hours of air. Russian Mission Control had intentionally 
turned off the audio system during most of the spacewalk. Officials said that Mission Control 
would no longer allow journalists to listen to radio traffic between Mission Control and 
spacewalkers, because reporters had become overly critical. Russian officials accused reporters 
of exaggerating problems on the space station, despite the fact that Mir had been operating 
relatively trouble free for several months before this spacewalk.453

in California, carrying a NASA satellite to study solar events that could endanger astronauts and

Eberhard R. M. Rees, deputy and later successor to Wernher von Braun as “chief of American 
rocketry efforts,” died at age 89, after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Rees, born in 
Germany, had graduated from the Dresden Institute of Technology in 1934 with an advanced 
degree in mechanical engineering. He had worked as a technical plant manager with the German 
Guided Missile Center beginning in 1940, but after Germany’s defeat in World War II, Rees 
became one of 118 scientists who surrendered to the West under the so-called Project Paperclip, 
becoming a U.S. citizen in 1954. In the United States, he had first worked at White Sands 
Proving Ground in New Mexico, “where he shared his expertise on the V-2, a German rocket-
propelled bomb, and on guided missile projects.” In 1950 Rees had moved to Huntsville, 
Alabama, to serve as Deputy Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division at Redstone 
Arsenal. Among the projects Rees had managed were the Hermes II Project, the Redstone and 
Jupiter missile programs, the Explorer satellite project, and the Saturn program. Between 1956 
and 1960, Rees had been Deputy Director of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency’s 
Development Operations Division. He had received a Distinguished Service Medal from NASA 
for his role in the Apollo 11 Mission. Rees had succeeded Wernher von Braun as Director of 
NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in 1970, retiring in 1973.455

NASA released images recorded by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, showing the Cydonia 
region of Mars in 10 times more detail than that provided in the images recorded more than 20 
years ago by one of the U.S. Viking space probes. In the new images, the Sun was shining from 
the opposite direction than in the images recorded by the Viking probe. Viking’s images had 
revealed a surface formation in the hilly desert area, Cydonia, which some members of the public 
believed to be a monumental sculpture of a humanoid face, in spite of NASA scientists’ 
insistence that the “face” was only a common geological formation called a mesa. Some of those 
people who believed the structure to be a sculpture had accused NASA of manipulating data in a 
conspiracy to keep the origins of the face a secret. Surveyor’s new images confirmed NASA’s 
previous analysis of the formation. However, in an effort to counteract the conspiracy rumors, 
NASA posted on the Internet the raw data sent by Mars Global Surveyor and took no official 
position regarding what the images did or did not reveal. Several planetary scientists remarked 
that “the new image contained no surprises and no evidence of artificial origin.”457 
 
Cosmonauts Talgat A. Musabayev and Nikolai M. Budarin, trying for a third time, successfully 
stabilized a bent solar panel during a spacewalk of 4 hours and 15 minutes. The solar panel was 
only one of 10 nonfunctioning panels. The crew had not intended to repair the damaged panel 
fully, but only to stabilize it, so that it would not break loose and hit the space station. The 
cosmonauts cut short the spacewalk, scheduled to take 5½ hours, when the thruster engine 
aligning Mir with the Sun ran out of fuel. Forced to return to the space station early, the 
cosmonauts were unable to remove some scientific equipment attached to the outside of the 
station.458 
 
7 April 
The European Space Agency (ESA) announced that Europe’s Infrared Space Observatory, which 
had been orbiting Earth for two and one-half years, had located water in unexpected places. The 
most intriguing of these was the water vapor detected in the atmosphere of Saturn’s largest 
moon, Titan. ESA Director of Science Roger M. Bonnet remarked, “the moon may duplicate the 
conditions that led to the creation of life on Earth  . . . and the only thing you need is a little heat 
to heat up Titan, maybe [the] birth of life may be seen.” Chairperson of ESA’s Astronomy 
Working Group Reinhard Genzel said that the Observatory had “enabled scientists to see water 
throughout the universe,” and that the water was likely brought “to the icy outer planets by 
comets.” He explained further that comets might have deposited the water on Earth during the 
early formation of the solar system, when many comets constantly collided with the Earth.459

NASA announced the selection of nine researchers to form the Science Team for the Mars 
Microprobes, “a technology validation mission that will hitchhike to the [R]ed [P]lanet aboard 
NASA’s 1998 Mars Polar Lander mission.” NASA intended the probes to collect data measuring 
thermal and physical properties of the soil while searching for the presence of water ice. The 
nine selected scientists were David C. Catling, Julio A. Magalhaes, Jeffrey E. Moersch, James R. 
Murphy, and Aaron Zent of NASA’s Ames Research Center; Ralph D. Lorenz of the University 
of Arizona; Paul Morgan of Northern Arizona University; Bruce C. Murray of California 
Institute of Technology; and Marsha Presley of Arizona State University.460 
 
9 April 
U.S. astronomers studying star formation reported that a body resembling a pinkish star, at the 
center of the sword in the constellation Orion, was “a hotbed of star formation called the Orion 
Nebula,” the site of a gas cloud generating enough water “to fill the Earth’s oceans 60 times a 
day.” The team of astronomers, led by Martin O. Harwit of Cornell University, used the Infrared 
Space Observatory to observe the Orion Nebula, detecting “large amounts of water vapor within 
clouds of gas on their way to becoming stars in the nebula.” The discovery, which demonstrated 
for the first time “the vital role that water plays in star formation,” may “provide an important 
clue about the source of water in the [s]olar [s]ystem.” Michael Werner of NASA’s Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) emphasized the significance of the discovery, saying that the data 
confirmed, “that water is prevalent in space” and “plays a vital role in the chemistry and physics 
of interstellar clouds.”461 
 
15 April 
At a Kennedy Space Center (KSC) news conference, Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas 
W. Holloway announced that an astronaut’s error had caused a US$10 million solar satellite to 
malfunction after Space Shuttle Columbia released the satellite in November 1997 during 
Mission STS-87. An investigation revealed that astronaut Kalpana Chawla had not sent the 
Spartan satellite a key signal to activate itself. Chawla’s efforts to recapture Spartan with the 
Shuttle’s robotic arm had sent the satellite spinning, and two astronauts had to undertake a 
spacewalk to retrieve it. The review panel, comprising both external experts and NASA staff, 
found that Chawla’s crewmates “could have helped her verify the command” but did not do so 
“because such vigilance was not part of the plan.” The panel made nine major recommendations 
intended to help both the Shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) programs. Holloway 
announced that, in response to the board’s findings, NASA would make numerous changes to 
training, computers, and procedures.462

Twin Otter airplane, with a scanning laser system and a global-positioning-satellite receiver, to 
make precise measurements of the West Coast, mapping the changes El Niño had caused along 
the coastline. The goal of the survey was to create “the most highly detailed map yet of the West 
Coast,” increasing scientists’ ability to predict erosion over the next decade.463 
 
Jeremy Lin of Taiwan’s Academia Sinica Institute and colleagues at the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico, reported in the journal Nature that 
measurements taken with the world’s largest radio telescopes—the Very Large Array (VLA)—
had detected “peculiar bulges in the atmosphere of a giant star.” Huge plumes of gas thrust from 
beneath the surface of the red supergiant star, Betelgeuse, had likely caused the bulges. 
Betelgeuse is located in the shoulder of the constellation Orion, about 430 light-years from Earth. 
The research team used the Y-shaped, 22-mile-wide (35-kilometer-wide) cluster of 27 huge 
antennas of the VLA telescopes to capture the most detailed radio image ever taken of a star 
other than the Sun. The team discovered that some of the gas in the star’s atmosphere was much 
cooler than previously believed—about 5,750°F (3,200°C). The discovery of the lower 
temperatures enabled astronomers to understand “how huge amounts of dust are constantly 
blown away from the star.” Before the lower temperatures were identified, scientists had not 
been able to explain how the stellar dust formed, because at “higher temperatures the dust could 
not condense from the hot gas expelled from the star’s interior.” Astronomers believe that dust 
created and expelled by stars like Betelgeuse “is distributed throughout the universe and 
provide[s] the raw materials that gave rise to life on Earth.”464

After problems with one of two network-signal processors caused a 24-hour delay, Space Shuttle 
Columbia (STS-90) blasted off on the Shuttle program’s final Neurolab mission, carrying 26 
experiments for basic research in neurosciences to “expand understanding of how the nervous 
system develops and functions in space.” Test subjects aboard the Shuttle included crew 
members, rats, mice, crickets, snails, and two kinds of fish. The Neurolab mission was the joint 
effort of NASA, several U.S. partners, the space agencies of Canada, France, and Germany, the 
ESA, and the National Space Development Agency of Japan. Crew members included 
Commander Richard A. Searfoss; Pilot Scott D. Altman; Mission Specialists Richard M. 
Linnehan, Dafydd Rhys “Dave” Williams, and Kathryn P. Hire; and Payload Specialists Jay C. 
Buckey Jr. and James A. Pawelczyk. Mission Specialist Hire was the first KSC employee that 
NASA had selected as an astronaut candidate. Mission STS-90 was Columbia’s 25th flight.465

Two scientific teams, independently studying HR 4796, a star in the southern constellation

of the extinct Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii, and the National Science Foundation’s 4-meter

(13-foot) Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Using both 
of these sensitive new instruments, the research teams believed they could see clearly, through 
the glare of the star, a planet-forming disc of gas and dust. A third international team of British 
and American astronomers released the first images of the huge discs, which appeared to be 
forming around two other stars, Fomalhaut and Vega, the star made famous in the novel and 
movie Contact. The third team used the 15-meter (49-foot) James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, also 
atop Mauna Kea. Scientists considered the discoveries of the discs around the stars a missing link 
in the study of planetary system formation, offering them clues about the formation of rocky 
planets like Earth.466 
 
22 April 
An international group of computer hackers, calling itself Masters of Downloading or MOD, 
announced that it had stolen key software programs from NASA. The same group had previously 
broken into the Pentagon’s Defense Information Systems Network, claiming to have stolen 
enough information to “‘take control’ of military satellites and other systems.” Although U.S. 
Department of Defense officials said that MOD had downloaded an application for management 
and record keeping, not for “anything that could perform a control function,” the group claimed 
that its cyber attack on NASA had “stripped the U.S. space agency of its chief defense against 
computer intrusion.” MOD had sent the stolen samples of NASA software to a computer expert 
who maintained a Web site devoted to information-security issues. The group, which included at 
least two Russian members, asserted that it had broken into NASA’s system through JPL to 
obtain the software samples and threatened to sell the information to international terrorist 
groups or foreign governments.467 
 
23 April 
The Cost Assessment and Validation Task Force, an independent task force convened at the 
request of NASA and charged with analyzing the cost and schedule of constructing and 
maintaining the ISS, released its official report. The task force concluded that “program size, 
complexity, and ambitious schedule goals were beyond that which could be reasonably achieved 
within the [US]$2.1 billion annual cap or [US]$17.4 billion total cap.” The task force concluded 
that “the International Space Station will be delayed by up to three years and cost as much as 
[US]$250 million more per year relative to the FY 1999 budget submission,” recommending that 
NASA “revise the current [s]tation plan so that it is achievable with the funds available.” NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, who had appointed Jay Chabrow to lead the task force, told 
members of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and 
Urban Development, and Independent Agencies that he would not accept the task force’s 
conclusions, because he had not yet fully reviewed the report. Goldin told the panel that 
everyone involved in the space station program was very concerned about cost overruns and 
schedule slips, but that if Congress imposed a cap on ISS funding, it could affect the schedule 
significantly, delaying the project up to two years. Goldin warned, “such a funding shortfall 
would hurt relations with the international partners.” The report also placed much of the blame 
for the budget and schedule issues on Russia. In 1993 the Clinton administration and top officials 
at NASA had advised Congress that, were Russia not involved in the project, NASA would

“save an estimated [US]$2 billion, expand the station’s capabilities and enable the research

assumptions were faulty.”468 
 
29 April 
Astronauts and physicians Jay C. Buckey Jr. and Dafydd Rhys “Dave” Williams performed the 
first surgeries ever conducted on living specimens while in orbit. The two doctors injected 
chemical markers into the hind legs of six of the surviving baby rats to determine the role of 
gravity in the development of muscles. The crew anesthetized the baby rats before injecting them 
with the pink florescent chemical, the first time scientists had performed such a procedure in 
zero-gravity conditions. In addition to studying how muscles and nerves develop in space, the 
crew studied whether anesthesia really works without the help of gravity, whether patients have 
more difficulty recovering from anesthesia in space, and how wounds heal in space. Two other 
astronauts successfully completed “the most difficult medical procedure ever attempted on 
someone in space.” The astronauts guided tiny needles into the nerves behind their knees, in an 
experiment aimed at understanding and easing the blood pressure problems and dizziness that 
astronauts suffer after returning to Earth. An estimated 500,000 Americans experience the same 
symptoms every day when they stand up. The needle enabled the astronauts to “listen” to 
electrical impulses, as the brain sent messages to the nerve.469

At the 13th annual NASA Continual Improvement and Reinvention Conference on Quality 
Management, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin presented five aerospace companies with 
the 1998 George M. Low Award, NASA’s highest “quality and excellence” award for 
contractors and subcontractors. The companies, representing both large and small businesses, 
were ILC Dover Inc. of Frederica, Delaware; Allied Signal Technical Services Corporation of 
Lanham, Maryland; DynCorp, Johnson Support Division of Houston, Texas; BST Systems Inc. 
of Plainfield, Connecticut; and Advanced Technology Company of Pasadena, California. 
Administrator Goldin said, “these companies exemplify excellence and outstanding

Returning from the Neurolab mission, Space Shuttle Columbia landed smoothly, despite a 
malfunctioning hydraulic unit. Most of Columbia’s 1-hour-long descent relied on two hydraulic 
units, because the cooling system for the third unit had failed. To prevent the third unit from 
overheating, the crew turned it on just minutes before landing. After the landing, Mission 
Control congratulated the Neurolab astronauts on “a historic mission that elevated neuroscience 
research to record heights.” During the 16-day Neurolab flight, the team had accomplished a 
number of experiments never before performed in space, including the first direct nerve 
recordings, the first joint recording of sleep and breathing, the first embalming of animals, and 
the first surgery on animals. Because only the rodents aboard Columbia were accessible during 
the flight, astronauts and scientists did not immediately know how the other animals, including 
fish, snails, and crickets, had fared. A quick inspection after landing, however, “revealed that 
only 25 of 225 baby swordtail fish survived the mission, a much higher mortality rate than 
expected.” The baby rats also had a higher mortality rate than expected; 52 of the 96 baby rats 
had died in orbit after their mothers refused to nurse them. NASA veterinarians had expected a 
dozen deaths from natural causes. Animal rights groups criticized the experiments.472 
 
6 May 
At a NASA news conference, astronomers discussed the discovery of the largest explosion ever 
sighted in space. The journal Nature published three papers about the event, detected on 14 
December 1997. The explosion, a gamma-ray burst (GRB) designated GRB971214, had 
occurred 12 billion years ago and had “apparently outshone all the rest of the universe” for about 
40 seconds. The Italian-Dutch orbiting gamma-ray observatory BeppoSAX had measured the 
sharp pulse of gamma rays and “pinpointed the position of the rays’ source.” The United States’ 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite had also detected the gamma-ray pulse, and 
scientific institutions around the world had monitored the after-effects of the explosion. Twelve 
hours afterward, John R. Thorstensen of Dartmouth College had used a 94-inch-diameter (49-
centimeter-diameter) telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona to detect a visible afterglow, 
which lasted for about two weeks. After the glow had faded, the scientists had discovered a faint 
galaxy in the same location. A team of American, Italian, and Indian astronomers, led by two 
California Institute of Technology scientists, used the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii to measure 
the distance from Earth to the source of the burst. No theorists were able to explain the 
explosion, and no existing models explaining GRBs could explain the amount of energy emitted 
from GRB971214. The scientists suggested the possibility that a superdense neutron star had

7 May 
The U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology held a hearing about the International 
Space Station (ISS) project, focusing on the independent Cost Assessment and Validation Task 
Force, headed by Jay Chabrow. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had selected Chabrow to 
lead the investigation into the cost of the ISS. The task force’s findings concluded that the space 
station may cost US$7 billion more than the original estimate and may take two years longer 
than anticipated to complete. Congressional supporters and opponents of the program questioned 
NASA officials about the project’s cost and slipping timetable, but officials indicated that they 
needed a few more weeks to study Chabrow’s report and were unable to say whether they agreed 
with his team’s figures. However, Goldin acknowledged that Russia’s participation in the 
program was not working. He also promised to provide Congress with a new assessment of costs 
and with assembly schedules by 15 June, including estimates for continuing the project without 
critical Russian equipment. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James 
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) seemed mollified after Goldin had spoken. However, Sensenbrenner 
“chastised the Clinton administration,” remarking that its failure to send a representative from 
the Office of Management and Budget to the hearing reflected “the low priority” the 
administration placed on solving the problems facing the ISS program.474 
 
A U.S. Air Force Titan IV rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying a spy 
satellite. Civilian observers speculated that the spacecraft's name was Orion, and that it would 
“play an important role in listening in on foes of the United States.” With a wire mesh antenna 
the size of a football field, the satellite was so sensitive that it could “detect transmissions from a 
radio the size of a wristwatch or a very small cell phone.” The satellite could also monitor 
electronic transmissions between military bases. At the time of the launch, the Titan was the 
most powerful American booster in use.475 
 
Launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, a Proton-K Russian booster carried into orbit an 
American EchoStar IV communications satellite, to relay broadcast signals to the central and 
western United States. Lockheed Martin Corporation had built the satellite and, under a 
partnership agreement between Lockheed and the Russian Khrunichev company, International 
Launch Services launched the spacecraft.476

NASA dedicated as a U.S. Air Force conference center the newly renovated, historic control 
center, Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, the site of the Mercury 
program launches. The domed blockhouse with 10-foot-thick (3-meter-thick), reinforced 
concrete walls had protected launch controllers from possible explosions of Atlas rockets

launched only 1,000 feet (305 meters) away. The renovation preserved the periscopes that 
controllers had used to safely view launches. The control center was at the launch site of the first 
piloted orbital flight of astronaut John H. Glenn Jr.477 
 
13 May 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched into orbit, from 
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, a new weather satellite, the NOAA-K, aboard a 34-
year old converted Titan II nuclear missile. The satellite was an Advanced Television Infrared 
Observation Satellite (TIROS-N) weather satellite, able to see inside clouds, a feature that 
scientists expected would greatly increase our knowledge of how hurricanes develop and move. 
The TIROS-N was the latest model of TIROS satellite in four generations. Lockheed Martin had 
last built a TIROS satellite for NASA and NOAA in 1960. After the launch of the TIROS-N, the 
satellite would undergo a series of tests by NASA, followed by a round of tests by NOAA, 
before becoming fully available in time for next year’s hurricane season.478 
 
14 May 
At a NASA press conference, Ethan J. Schreier of the Space Telescope Science Institute in 
Baltimore and his colleagues discussed new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The new 
images showed in greater clarity an old galaxy’s black hole “feeding on a smaller, younger 
galaxy that collided with it.” The scientists explained that the new images revealed young stars in 
the midst of an “obviously old galaxy,” suggesting that a collision had occurred. The merged 
galaxy complex, known as Centaurus A, was about 10 million light-years away from the Milky 
Way. The images, taken with HST’s newest infrared camera, also showed gas and dust feeding 
an apparent large black hole. An inner disc of gas, swirling around the black hole, was behaving 
in a manner opposite to scientists expectations, based upon the behavior of other galaxies. Hans-
Walter Rix of the University of Arizona theorized that the collision could explain the difference, 
postulating that the HST “may have caught Centaurus A in the midst of trying to realign itself 
after its spiral companion plowed into it.” Schreier offered an alternative explanation—that the 
mass of the merged galaxies was greater than the mass of the black hole, causing the 
gravitational pull to warp the inner disc.479 
 
The Iridium World Communications system global, digital wireless communications network 
completed a series of deployment missions, with the launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California of five Iridium satellites aboard a Boeing Delta II launch vehicle. The successful 
launch had completed the entire Iridium constellation “in just twelve months.” The world’s first 
global, wireless telephone company scheduled its commercial service to begin four months 
following this last launch, once it had completed integrating and testing the Iridium system.480

NASA successfully tested a fuel tank made of a new metal mixture, aluminum lithium, never 
before used in major U.S. manufacturing. The tank made of the new alloy was 30 percent 
stronger and 5 percent lighter than the aluminum magnesium tanks in use since the days of the 
Apollo program. The tank showed no leaks, pressure bulges, or other problems, when loaded 
with 537,000 gallons (2,033,000 liters) of liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel. Lockheed Martin 
had developed the new fuel tank to help ensure that NASA would be able to haul large sections 
of the ISS into orbit.481 
 
19 May 
NASA astronauts presented four employees of Boeing Reusable Space Systems with the Silver 
Snoopy, one of the most prestigious honors available to people working on NASA’s Space 
Shuttle program. Mark Brewer of the orbiter electrical-avionics team, Jeffrey Lewis of the mid-
module-major assembly team, Michael Argent of the external-tank, umbilical and payload latch-
assembly programs, and Larry Echaves of the configuration-management team each received a 
letter of commendation, a poster, a certificate, and a Silver Snoopy pin that had flown in 
space.482 
 
The PanAmSat-owned Galaxy IV, a five-year old communications satellite, “lost its bearings” so 
that its antennas were not directed toward Earth, causing the “worst outage in 37 years since 
communications satellites first entered service.” Most of the 45 million pagers in the United 
States were unable to function during the outage, which “severed electronic links vital to 
thousands of retailers, news organizations, and broadcasters.” PanAmSat officials said that an 
attitude-control mechanism failed for an unknown reason and a backup processor failed to turn 
on, causing the satellite to rotate. At that point, hundreds of thousands of satellite dishes in the 
United States lost contact with Galaxy IV.483 
 
21 May 
Chryssa Kouveliotou of the Universities Space Research Association led a team of astronomers 
at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in confirming the existence of magnetars, a special 
class of neutron stars with a magnetic field one thousand trillion times the strength of Earth’s. 
The team calculated the strength of SGR1806-20, first discovered in 1979, by combining data 
from NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite and the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology 
and Astrophysics.484 
 
John S. Lewis, Codirector of the Space Engineering Research Center at the University of 
Arizona in Tucson, testified before the House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics 
concerning the potential danger of nearby asteroids. His testimony supported the idea that any 
asteroid colliding with Earth in the next 100 years could only be an asteroid not yet known to 
scientists. Lewis argued that, since an international scientific effort could identify such an

asteroid easily, he advocated “a systematic, globally-coordinated search and characterization 
program that costs less than a single small space mission.” Such a search, he argued, would “give 
us adequate warning of a threatened asteroid impact,” so that we would “have ample time to 
design, build, test, and deploy an effective defense against the threat.”485 
 
The U.S. House of Representatives approved Representative David Weldon Jr.’s (R-FL) 
amendment to the US$271 billion defense authorization bill, to protect funding for launch 
ranges. In the past six years, the U.S. Department of Defense had diverted money, which would 
have modernized U.S. Air Force–controlled launch ranges, to cover costs associated with 
overseas deployments, such as ongoing operations in Bosnia. Weldon stated that diverting funds 
away from the launch ranges was a “national security issue as well as a critical issue for NASA 
and commercial space.” Weldon’s amendment reserved US$273.3 million for the Cape 
Canaveral Range in Florida and US$109.1 million for the Western Launch Range at Vandenberg 
Air Force Base in California.486 
 
Scientists published a study in the journal Science, using images from the Galileo probe as 
evidence that an ocean beneath the surface of Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, was once warm 
and salty. James K. Crowley of the U.S. Geological Survey stated that Galileo data showed that 
“salt absorption patterns on Europa were similar to those on Earth.” Gary B. Hansen, a 
University of Hawaii geophysicist, added the observation that “the size of the salt bands on 
Europa’s surface are continuous and stretch across much of the moon,” evidence of a salty ocean 
beneath the moon’s icy surface. Jeffrey S. Kargel, also of the U.S. Geological Survey, 
commented on his colleague’s study in Science, saying that salt is an important “piece in the 
puzzle,” but in the absence of other evidence, does not prove that a salty ocean lies beneath 
Europa’s surface. Scientists seek other evidence, such as shifting ice plates, cracks in the frozen 
surface, and a magnetic field.487 
 
27 May 
Images released at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Boston showed what scientists 
believed was the first evidence of ice on Mars outside of the planet’s polar ice caps. The images 
showed a 30-mile-wide (48-kilometer-wide) crater containing a discolored area measuring about 
12 to 18 miles (19 to 29 kilometers) across the bottom of the crater. Some scientists thought the 
discoloration indicated the presence of some sort of deposit, possibly frozen mud or sand, 
evidence that ice is present, or was present in the past. Others offered a different theory about the 
contents of the images: volcanic activity could explain the apparent deposit in the crater. The 
images, from Mars Global Surveyor, had 10 to 12 times better resolution than any previous 
image of the crater. Arizona State University researchers made another announcement regarding 
Surveyor’s data; the Arizona researchers believed that a “concentration of a rust-colored mineral 
along the Mars equator indicates it once had boiling hydrothermal vents and perhaps huge 
lakes.” The mineral, hematite, was the first clear evidence of widespread thermal activity on

surface and that Mars had a thicker atmosphere in its early history, probably 4 billion to 6 billion 
years ago.”488 
 
28 May 
At the American Geophysical Union meeting in Boston, astrophysicists Alexander G. 
Kosovichev of Stanford University and Valentina V. Zharkova of the University of Glasgow in 
Scotland presented evidence confirming their “solar-bomb theory.” Using sequential images that 
the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft had captured, the two scientists 
explained that, 20 minutes following the rupture of a solar flare from the surface of the Sun, “a 
seismic wave front surges across the [S]un’s face like ripples from a stone thrown into a pond.” 
The SOHO images proved that solar flares not only release energy into the Sun’s atmosphere, 
but also “trigger huge waves of seismic energy that ripple through the [S]un like earthquakes.”489 
 
At a NASA press conference, a team of NASA and university astronomers presented an image 
captured with the HST, discussing their conclusion that the image provides the first direct 
evidence of a planet in another solar system. Previously, scientists had been able to infer the 
existence of such planets by observing their gravitational effect on suns, but were unable to see 
them with telescopes. Located 450 light-years away in the Taurus constellation, a binary star 
system, the planet appeared to be at least twice the size of Jupiter. Designated TMR-1C, the 
planet orbited 130 billion miles (210 billion kilometers) from its parent stars. Scientists 
considered TMR-1C, young by planetary standards, to be forming still.490 
 
Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev announced that Russia had found 
the funds needed to continue participating in the ISS project. Although the Russian Cabinet had 
rejected Koptev’s request for additional funds, a meeting with Finance Minister Mikhail M. 
Zadornov and Deputy Prime Minister Boris E. Nemtsov had led to an agreement that funding for 
the ISS would come from a “special budget section.” However, the Russian Space Agency 
provided no details of the funding plan. Koptev also announced that the Russian Space Agency 
might scrap the Mir space station in the fall, a year ahead of schedule, to make more cash 
available for the ISS. Koptev suggested that the space agency would look for revenue sources 
outside of the government.491 
 
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) successfully tested the first of four linked, identical 
telescopes of 8.2-meter (27-foot) diameters, comprising the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The 
VLT is the world’s largest and most advanced Earth-based telescope, with a collective diameter 
equal to16 meters (52 feet). The telescope’s “first light” images (its first astronomically useful 
images) met the design goals. Exposures lasting up to 10 minutes confirmed that the telescope’s 
tracking was very accurate and stable. The ESO had built the new telescope in the Atacama

A computer failure aboard Mir partially affected the space station’s solar panels, causing the 
panel to fail to generate sufficient electricity and requiring the crew to use the Soyuz capsule 
thrusters for steering. To conserve energy, the crew turned off nonessential equipment, including 
the air conditioner and lights. Although they replaced the computer with a new one, the crew was 
unable to load the necessary software. The crew feared the failure might delay Space Shuttle 
Discovery’s launch to Mir, planned for 2 June.493 
 
31 May 
NASA’s Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft captured a video of a 
“short-lived but extremely bright explosion in the atmosphere of the sun.” The explosion was 
55,000 miles (89,000 kilometers) long, 200 miles (322 kilometers) wide, and traveled at a rate of 
2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) per hour. The explosions overlapped each other and 
“snapped,” releasing “vast amounts of energy” as solar flares. Solar flares cause magnetic 
disturbances that disrupt satellites and power supplies if directed at Earth. In April, NASA had 
launched the TRACE spacecraft, with a telescope 10 times more powerful than any other 
telescope focused on the Sun. The telescope studied the transitional region of the Sun’s 
atmosphere, between the relatively cool surface of the lower atmosphere, with temperatures of 
6,000°C (11,000°F), and the corona or upper atmosphere, where temperatures reach 1.7 
million°C (35 million°F). The telescope was able to photograph ultraviolet light and to show 
temperature variations using false colors.494

The 16 countries involved in the International Space Station (ISS) agreed, for the second year in 
a row, to delay construction, naming 2004 as the new target date for completion. The delay was 
primarily the result of Russia’s inability to pay its share of the program’s costs. NASA Associate 
Administrator for Space Flight Joseph H. Rothenberg said that the new five-year schedule was 
“extremely tight and allows for few, if any, launch delays.” NASA estimated that the space 
station would require 43 flights for its assembly, two fewer flights than previously scheduled. 
Under the revised schedule, Russia planned to launch nine flights, three fewer than originally 
scheduled, and NASA intended to launch 34 Shuttle flights to transport parts, one more than 
originally planned. To save money, Russia canceled construction of two life-support modules 
and a stowage chamber.495

Space Shuttle Discovery Mission STS-91 launched on schedule from Kennedy Space Center 
(KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, despite problems with the automatic steering system on Mir. 
The Shuttle’s mission was to retrieve the seventh and last American to live aboard Mir. The 
day’s temperature reached 97ºF (36ºC) during the countdown, making it the “hottest launch day 
anyone could remember.” The mood of the launch was tense, because NASA had never tested 
the new lightweight fuel tank during flight. According to NASA officials, the new tank worked 
well. Among the crew members aboard Discovery was Valery V. Ryumin, veteran cosmonaut 
and chief of the Russian operations in the Shuttle–Mir program. The Russian Space Agency had 
selected Ryumin to inspect Mir, so that Russian officials could make an informed decision 
regarding how long cosmonauts could safely continue to inhabit the space station. Other crew 
members included Commander Charles J. Precourt; Pilot Dominic L. P. Gorie; and Mission 
Specialists Wendy B. Lawrence, Franklin R. Chang-Dìaz, and Janet L. Kavandi. For the first 
time, the Shuttle carried the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), designed to search for dark 
and missing matter (antimatter) in the universe.496 
 
3 June 
At the request of U.S. Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Bill Frist (R-TN), the U.S. General 
Accounting Office (GAO) released a report, analyzing the United States’ role in the ISS and the 
cost of the program. GAO estimated that life-cycle costs could reach US$96 billion, US$2 billion 
more than the 1995 estimate, and that these costs could increase further because of the potential 
for changes in the program. According to the report, “at the current estimated spending rate, the 
program would incur additional costs of more than [US]$100 million for every month of 
schedule slippage.” The report cited, as reasons for the cost increases, schedule slippage, delays 
in production of components, the need for additional flights to and from the space station, and 
NASA’s decision to change its tracking requirement for space debris. GAO’s report added as 
much as US$1 billion to the estimate overall, including crew-return-vehicle testing and resupply 
flights not part of the original NASA estimate. Although the report cited U.S. Department of 
Defense as the only agency with appropriate tracking equipment, its equipment would need as 
much as US$5 billion in upgrades to handle the new NASA requirements. The report also 
highlighted other issues including insufficient staff at KSC to handle nine Shuttle launches per 
year.497

new subsidiary, stated that the goal of Boeing Space Operations was to make Boeing “the global 
provider of low-cost, reliable, commercially based space operations services.”498 
 
Space Shuttle Discovery encountered its first malfunction during Mission STS-91, when the KU-
band system failed to switch on after Discovery’s crew deployed its antenna upon reaching orbit. 
The KU-band downlink carries broadcasts with a high rate of data. The system failure prevented 
the Shuttle crew from sending televised images or high rates of information to Mission Control. 
This problem had never occurred before. NASA spokesperson James Hartsfield stated that it was 
unclear whether the trouble originated with the antenna, transmitter, or other associated 
equipment. Hartsfield also mentioned that the failure would “prevent immediate analysis of data 
from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.” The S-band antennas worked normally, and the crew 
was able to talk with ground controllers as usual.499 
 
4 June 
Space Shuttle Discovery docked successfully with Mir. Upon the opening of the hatches, 
astronaut Andrew S. W. Thomas officially ended his 130-day mission aboard Mir and became a 
crew member of Discovery. The transfer also marked the completion of a total of 907 days of 
U.S. astronaut presence aboard the space station. Because of the Ku-band failure, Russian 
cameras on Mir recorded the docking, while Russian ground stations televised live the meeting 
of the two crews.500 
 
During a meeting at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin directed MSFC officials to draw up a new plan for meeting the goals of the Bantam 
Program. The program’s original goal had been to develop, by 2001, a rocket capable of 
launching 150-kilogram or 0.15-tonne (331-pound or 0.2-ton) payloads, at a cost of no more than 
US$1.5 million. None of the rockets developed with NASA funding would have met that cost 
target. Bantam Program Manager Sherry Buschmann reiterated NASA’s commitment to 
“achieving a capability to launch small payloads frequently at an affordable cost,” saying that the 
plan would meet a “legitimate need within the science community.”501 
 
NASA announced the astronaut candidate class of 1998, including 8 pilot candidates and 17 
mission specialist candidates, and composed of 21 male and 4 female candidates. Among the 
candidate class was teacher Barbara R. Morgan, the former understudy to Christa McAuliffe. 
NASA had designated Morgan as Educator Mission Specialist in January 1998.502

Mark H. Thiemens, professor of chemistry at the University of California at San Diego, and a 
team of researchers published a study in the journal Science disputing NASA’s theory that a rock 
from Mars contained evidence of life. NASA scientists had studied the rock, found in the Allen 
Hills ice field in Antarctica, concluding that some carbonate mineral structures in the rock were 
evidence that microbes had lived in the rock before it “blasted away from Mars,” during the 
collision of Mars with an asteroid millions of years ago. By contrast, Thiemens’s researchers 
concluded that the chemical characteristics of oxygen inside the rock originated from the carbon 
dioxide and ozone of the Martian atmosphere. The team explained that, if a microbe had 
deposited the oxygen, “the chemical signature of the minerals would have matched that of 
oxygen in water, not oxygen in the atmosphere.” According to the team, this finding did not 
provide final proof that the rock had never contained life. However, it provided a significant 
argument against NASA’s theory, controversial since its first proposal in August 1996.503 
 
Astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Discovery attempted, but failed, to fix the spacecraft’s high-
speed data-transmission system. NASA believed the source of the problem was in an electronics 
box in the cargo bay, but stated that only a spacewalk would enable the crew to reach the box. 
NASA Mission Operations representative Robert E. Castle Jr. remarked that, even with a 
spacewalk, the astronauts would probably not be able to repair the malfunction. Because of the 
lack of the high-speed data transmission system, scientists could not view the data that the AMS 
had collected. Although the Shuttle had stored the data on board, NASA was unable to determine 
whether the data was useful, or whether the instrument’s adjustment was correct.504

Cosmonauts working aboard Mir conducted the first of two tests, using green fluorescent gas 
made from combining nitrogen, acetone, and biacetyl gases, to search for leaks in the Spektr 
laboratory module damaged in a collision in June 1997. However, they were unable to pinpoint 
the sources of any seepage. Because Mir was nearing its decommission stage, Russia planned no 
repairs, in the event that the cosmonauts were able to locate the leaks precisely. Instead, the tests 
were intended as practice for finding leaks on the future ISS.505 
 
8 June 
Space Shuttle Discovery undocked from Mir, carrying back to Earth Australian-born Andrew S. 
W. Thomas, the last of seven U.S. astronauts to live aboard the station, and marking the 
completion of Phase I of the ISS program. Before closing the hatches, Mir Commander Talgat A. 
Musabayev presented Shuttle Commander Charles J. Precourt with a huge wrench that had been 
used in spacewalks and would be flown to the future ISS.506 
 
NASA officials announced that the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, 
which had operated the science program for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) since 1983,

would also manage the science operations for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). As 
one of the cornerstone missions of the Astronomical Search for Origins and Planetary Systems, a 
major project within its space science program, NASA expected the NGST “to provide a critical 
follow-on to the Hubble Space Telescope.” With capabilities unavailable in existing ground-
based or space telescopes, the NGST’s purpose was to observe the first stars and galaxies in the 
universe, to understand better how the universe formed after the Big Bang. After consulting 
advisory committees, Wesley T. Huntress Jr., Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of 
Space Science, had decided that the “most cost-effective and scientifically sound way to 
proceed” would be “to expand the [Space Telescope Science] Institute’s responsibilities to 
include the management” of the new telescope.507 
 
Michael I. Mott, NASA Associate Deputy Administrator (Technical), one of NASA’s top three 
managers, announced his decision to leave NASA to join Boeing Space Transportation in Seal 
Beach, California, as Vice President of Business Development. Mott had served as NASA 
Associate Deputy Administrator since January 1994.508 
 
9 June 
The U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban 
Development, and Related Agencies, responsible for allocating space funding, voted to back 
funding for NASA’s ISS obligations but “cautioned the space agency to control costs and ensure 
Russia’s commitment to the expansive project.” The subcommittee voted for a US$13.6 billion 
budget for NASA for the fiscal year, including US$2.3 billion for the space station. Senate 
Subcommittee Chairperson Christopher Bond (R-MO) said that, although the budget was 
US$150 million more than President William J. Clinton had requested, it was US$33 million less 
than NASA’s 1998 spending level.509 
 
Research scientists working on a US$33 million experiment to search for antimatter in space, 
spoke at a news conference, announcing that the communication-system breakdown on Space 
Shuttle Discovery had ruined their tests. The astronauts had been unable to repair Discovery’s 
main antenna system, which had broken shortly after launch, rendering the Shuttle unable to 
transmit high-speed data or video back to Earth. Scientists working on the project needed 
continuous, high-speed data to calibrate the AMS, which was searching space for rare subatomic 
particles known as antimatter. However, using a patchwork system, they had only been able to 
receive a few minutes of data each hour, which meant that, although they could see that the AMS 
was working, the spectrometer was not providing them with enough data to fine tune the magnet. 
According to Project Manager James Bates, the scientists had failed to accomplish their 
objectives because of the malfunction.510

Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 2 p.m. (EDT), 
returning the U.S. astronaut, Australian-born Andrew S. W. Thomas, to Earth after four and one-
half months in space. Thomas, unlike some of his predecessors, took the medical advice typically 
given to astronauts returning from a lengthy stay in space and allowed medical personnel to carry 
him off the Shuttle, rather than attempting to walk on his own.512 
 
17 June 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin submitted a 29-page report to lawmakers of the U.S. 
House of Representatives, officially responding to “an independent review panel’s damning 
assessment that the [ISS] could cost US$7.3 billion more than NASA estimated.” The panel had 
also reported that NASA would likely complete the ISS more than four years behind schedule. 
Goldin acknowledged significant budget and schedule problems but maintained that NASA’s 
plan remained manageable, despite its shortcomings.513 
 
19 June 
The U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee responsible for allocating funding for the 
space program voted on a US$13.3 billion budget for NASA, US$138 million less than President 
William J. Clinton had requested and US$300 million less than the U.S. Senate subcommittee 
had approved. Subcommittee Chairperson Jerry Lewis (R-CA) stated that the House had reduced 
the budget allocation because NASA planned to fly fewer Shuttle missions in the next fiscal 
years and because of the delays in assembling the ISS. Unlike the Senate, the House did not vote 
to monitor the budget of the program by creating a separate account for space station funding.514 
 
Hughes Global Services Inc. announced the success of its salvage mission to a stranded Asia 
Satellite Telecommunications Company Ltd. communications satellite. The 3.8-ton (3,500-
kilogram or 3.5-tonne) AsiaSat 3 had remained stranded in a useless orbit since its December 
1997 launch. Asia Satellite Telecommunications had received US$200 million from insurers. 
The insurers had told Hughes Global Services to find a new customer, if the salvage mission was 
successful. Asia Satellite Telecommunications had originally intended AsiaSat 3 to provide 
television and telephone service in Asia, but the Russian-built launcher had malfunctioned, and 
the satellite’s orbit had gone awry, rendering it useless. Hughes Global Services had taken 
possession of the satellite, implementing a “seemingly improbable” mission to salvage the 
spacecraft. Hughes had sent the satellite around the Moon twice, using the Moon’s gravity to 
help correct the satellite’s orbit around the Earth, and declared the salvage mission a success,

Eighteen members of the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology submitted a letter 
to President William J. Clinton, urging him to “abandon plans to reach an agreement in China on 
expanding space cooperation because of Beijing’s weapons transfers and human rights abuses.” 
The letter was the House’s response to a 29 April report in the Washington Times, disclosing a 
plan to conclude a space cooperation agreement at the Beijing summit. The article discussed a 
draft agreement calling for the free and unrestricted exchange of scientific data between NASA 
and the State Science and Technology Commission of China, a key developer of weapons-related 
technology. The lawmakers, warning that the pact would increase the likelihood of China’s 
sharing technology with rogue states, referred to a CIA report stating that China had aimed 13 of 
its 18 long-range strategic missiles at the United States. These comments emphasized the 
concern of members of Congress that China constituted a direct threat to the United States. Many 
opponents of the agreement insisted that the United States should not share with China 
technologies or applications that enemies of the United States might use against the American 
people or U.S. interests.516 
 
James B. Willet, a nuclear astrophysicist who had worked for NASA, died of cancer at his 
Maryland home. Willet had worked for 20 years on the scientific staff of NASA’s JPL in 
Pasadena, California, and for three years as JPL’s liaison to NASA Headquarters before joining 
the Space Research Association in 1993. At JPL, Willet had acted as a science coordinator and 
team chief for the Galileo Mission. Galileo was orbiting Jupiter at the time of his death. Willet 
was also a field operations team leader for the Mars balloon-testing program and had conducted 
research in gamma-ray astronomy. Willet’s duties as liaison officer involved him in the Voyager, 
Ulysses, and Pioneer programs.517 
 
NASA officials at Lewis Research Center (LERC) in Cleveland, Ohio, announced the new five-
year collaborative program of LERC and Case Western Reserve University. The program’s 
name, the Glennan Microsystems Initiative, honored the late T. Keith Glennan, the first NASA 
Administrator, who had served from 1958 to 1961. Glennan was also President Emeritus of Case 
Institute of Technology, forerunner of Case Western Reserve University. Backed with US$16 
million in federal funds and US$4.5 million in state funds, the initiative planned to “develop and 
apply the technology known as microelectricomechanical systems for industry and for NASA.” 
LERC planned to develop systems for use a decade into the future, including power systems for 
the next space station.518

society attempted to use a hot-air balloon from a NASA barge in the Gulf of Mexico to launch its 
rocket, a launch concept known as a rockoon. According to the rockoon concept, a small rocket 
may “obtain very high altitude because there is little air to slow it down during launch.” James 
A. Van Allen had been the first to fly rockoons in the 1950s, as part of a joint U.S. Navy-
University of Iowa project. The U.S. Navy had abandoned the technique after large, ground-
based, sounding rockets became available. NASA’s MSFC signed a cooperative agreement with 
HAL5 in 1996, continuing the relationship for the High Altitude Lift-Off mission. MSFC had 
supplied HAL5 with the barge, helium for the balloon, nitrous oxide for the rocket, and some 
funds for materials. HAL5 sought to “make space more affordable for students, amateurs, 
experimenters, and researchers.” NASA was examining alternate launch sites and methods in an 
effort to find ways of reducing the cost of rocket launches.519 
 
23 June 
The Lewis Spacecraft Mission Failure Investigation Board, convened by NASA, released its 
report explaining the reason for the spacecraft’s failure, which had cost NASA more than US$70 
million. NASA had developed the Earth-orbiting spacecraft to test advanced scientific equipment 
and technology for measuring land surface changes. The spacecraft, launched on 23 August 
1997, had failed to achieve stable orbit. According to the board’s findings, faulty attitude-control 
equipment, together with inadequate monitoring, had caused the craft’s destruction upon reentry 
on 28 September. The investigation board reported that the attitude-control system had not been 
tested or developed sufficiently. NASA had adapted the system from an earlier design, which 
had not taken into account the Lewis spacecraft’s spin axis. The small project crew had been 
unable to monitor and control the craft adequately during the crucial early flight stage. 
According to the investigation board’s report, this was the primary cause of the mission’s 
failure.520 
 
24 June 
U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-
WI) and ranking Representative George F. Brown Jr. (D-CA) submitted a letter to President 
William J. Clinton requesting that he supply a plan within 30 days, “detailing how the 
[a]dministration expects to resolve the dire problems surrounding the International Space 
Station.” The two members of Congress asked President Clinton to intervene with President 
Boris N. Yeltsin to “ensure full Russian compliance with its stated commitments to the space 
station.” In the aftermath of the announcement of the independent Cost Assessment and 
Validation Task Force’s findings on the ISS, the members of Congress were attempting to rectify 
the inadequate budget submission.  They asked the President to “direct the Office of 
Management and Budget to deliver a workable plan to Congress . . . so that the relevant

At a hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology, NASA Administrator 
Daniel S. Goldin defended NASA’s purpose and role in the ISS project. Representative Nicholas 
V. Lampson (D-TX) advised Goldin that cost overruns and Russia’s failure to meet its agreement 
had caused some lawmakers to propose cancelling the space station. Goldin responded that 
canceling the ISS would cancel human spaceflight, relegate the United States to second-class 
power status, and have international repercussions. Lawmakers at the hearing asked Goldin to 
furnish NASA’s proposal to overcome the problems associated with the ISS, providing estimates 
of the amount necessary to complete the project. Goldin refused to give specifics until NASA 
had evaluated several plans and calculated the cost of the alternative plans, including 
contingency plans in the event Russia could not meet its commitment.522 
 
Controllers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) sent routine commands to the Solar 
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to maneuver the satellite. Instead of responding correctly, 
SOHO suddenly went into emergency Sun reacquisition mode (ESR), “activated when an 
anomaly occurs and the spacecraft loses its orientation toward the Sun.” Consequently, NASA 
lost all communication with the satellite, along with the ability to track it. SOHO’s mission was 
to track “major solar activity that may induce power outages and interfere with radio, TV, and 
other signals from space.” The mission was particularly important because of the anticipated 
solar maximum, expected to occur during the year 2000. During the solar maximum, a 
phenomenon that peaks every 11 years, the Sun emits intense radiation capable of scrambling 
signals from communications satellites and causing power failures, as well as brilliant auroras. 
The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA had launched SOHO in December 1995, as a 
joint mission. In April 1998, the spacecraft had successfully completed its initial two-year 
mission to study the Sun’s atmosphere, surface, and interior.523 
 
25 June 
James L. Elliot, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his colleagues, 
together with Lowell Observatory and Williams College, published findings in the journal 
Nature based on data obtained from NASA’s HST. The data indicated that Neptune’s largest 
moon, Triton, had warmed up significantly since the Voyager spacecraft’s visit in 1989. Triton’s 
temperature had risen from 37 K (-393°F or -236°C) to 39 K (-389°F or -234°C), a 5 percent 
increase. The astronomers traced the warming trend to seasonal changes in Triton’s polar ice 
caps attributed to “an extreme southern summer,” a cyclical phenomenon occurring every few 
hundred years. Other possible explanations included a changing frost pattern on Triton’s surface, 
which could have caused the surface to absorb more of the Sun’s warmth; or changes in the 
reflectivity of Triton’s ice, which could have caused it to absorb more heat. Because of the 
warming, Triton’s frozen nitrogen surface was turning into gas, making its thin atmosphere

denser. The scientists hoped their study of the changes on Triton would provide insight into 
global warming on Earth, which has a more complicated environment than Triton. HST’s 
“detection of an increase in the moon’s atmospheric pressure,” measured with one of the space 
telescope’s three fine guidance sensors, had provided the clue to the increased surface 
temperature.524 
 
30 June 
NASA announced that experts from the ESA and Matra Marconi Space, the prime contractor for 
the SOHO spacecraft, had met at GSFC in Greenbelt, Maryland, to assess the situation of the 
noncommunicating spacecraft and to analyze the satellite’s status in the event that ground 
controllers reestablished contact with it. Participants at the meeting named as cochairs of a joint 
inquiry board to investigate the incident, Professor Massimo Trella, the ESA’s Inspector 
General, and Michael A. Greenfield, Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety 
and Mission Assurance at NASA Headquarters.525 
 
The European Science Foundation and the U.S. National Research Council published a joint 
study analyzing 13 projects in astrophysics, planetary science, space physics, earth science, and 
microgravity research. The report advised the United States and its international partners to “set 
aside a specific part of their annual space budgets to plan for future critical joint exploration 
projects,” highlighting factors hampering cooperation within the projects analyzed. Hampering 
factors included cultural differences, poorly defined objectives, and “lukewarm support from the 
scientific community for projects undertaken more for political than research reasons.” The 
report set forth recommendations for successfully pursuing cooperative space projects within 
tight budget constraints.526

PanAmSat Corporation announced the impairment of a critical subsystem of its Galaxy VII 
spacecraft. A spokesperson for the company said that engineers had not yet determined whether 
the problem was the same as that which caused the failure of the Galaxy IV spacecraft on 19 
May. Both the primary and backup systems keeping the Galaxy IV correctly pointed toward 
Earth-bound controllers had failed, but although the Galaxy VII had lost its primary system, its 
backup system had continued to function properly. Hughes Electronics Corporation’s Space and 
Communications Company, the manufacturer of the two satellites, was investigating the failures. 
Both satellites were HS601 models, the world’s “best-selling large communications satellite,”

SPACEHAB Inc., a Virginia-based, commercial space company with a staff of 85, purchased the 
Johnson Engineering Corporation, a 400-person firm contracted to support NASA’s Johnson 
Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. SPACEHAB’s chairperson said the company would 
“expand the use of Johnson Engineering’s larger technical staff to support its plans for expansion 
into the commercial space arena.” Investors had incorporated SPACEHAB in 1984, to “develop 
a commercial research module that could accommodate small, private, as well as government-
financed science experiments and engineering tests during [S]pace [S]huttle mission[s].” 
However, when the anticipated commercial market had failed to develop, SPACEHAB “changed 
its strategy,” winning NASA contracts. NASA used SPACEHAB modules, stored in the 
Shuttle’s payload bays, as cargo containers for storing “tons of food, clothing, and other gear that 
was ferried to Russia’s Mir space station aboard a series of recently concluded U.S. [S]huttle 
flights.”528 
 
Russia announced it would retire the Mir space station during the summer of 1999, six months 
earlier than originally planned. The decision resulted from a meeting between Russian Space 
Agency Director General Yuri N. Koptev and Deputy Prime Minister Boris E. Nemtsov, who 
agreed that Russia had insufficient funds to continue to fly the station. The agreement allocated 
approximately US$100 million for Mir’s final year, including funds for “a series of rockets to 
direct Mir to an unpopulated area of the Pacific Ocean.” Nemtsov also agreed to pay the Russian 
Space Agency the US$600 million owed for Mir’s operations in 1997, using “unspecified 
‘nonbudgetary sources’.”529

Due to arrive at Mars in October 1999 after a period of orbiting Earth, Japan’s Planet B 
spacecraft launched from Kagoshima Space Center on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. 
The Japanese Education Ministry’s Institute of Space and Aerospace Science developed the 
probe, nicknamed Nozomi, or Hope. The probe carried 14 scientific instruments developed by 
Canada, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. NASA provided two instruments for 
the probe: the Neutral Mass Spectrometer, designed to measure the gas composition of Mars’s 
upper atmosphere for the first time; and the Ultra Stable Oscillator, deployed to support a radio 
science experiment, also involving analysis of the Martian atmosphere, and to guide the 
spacecraft in its orbit around Mars.530

“compete for Air Force and commercial contracts for satellite launches,” while Senator Lott and 
U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairperson Richard Shelby (R-AL) would 
continue to investigate whether launching U.S.-made satellites on Chinese rockets was 
compromising U.S. security. Rod Bitz, the director of corporate communications for Alliant, 
said, “Iuka was chosen in part because the large structures can be easily shipped by barge to 
Decatur.” Engineers at the new Boeing plant in Decatur, Alabama, would assemble the rocket.531 
 
7 July 
In a vote of 66 to 33, the U.S. Senate defeated Senator Dale Bumpers’s (D-AK) amendment to 
the appropriations bill for the Veterans Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and 
Independent Agencies. The amendment would have cut the United States’ US$2.3 billion share 
of the FY 1999 budget for the International Space Station (ISS), cancelling the ISS program. 
During floor debate preceding the vote, Senator Bumpers, who had been trying to eliminate U.S. 
funding for the space station for the past eight years, referred to the previous month’s U.S. 
General Accounting Office report. The report had projected that the cost to develop, assemble, 
and operate the space station over several years would reach US$100 billion, in part because of 
recurring cost overruns. Senator John H. Glenn Jr. (D-OH) countered Senator Bumpers’s 
arguments against the space station, citing the “incredible scientific possibilities” that could 
result from research on the ISS, in such areas as neurology, sleep disorders, and balance.532 
 
Rocket engineer Max E. Nowak died of natural causes at the age of 89. An original member of 
Wernher von Braun’s German rocket team, which developed the V-1 and V-2 rockets during 
World War II, Nowak had been among the first of the team members to move to the United 
States after the war. He had been the assistant to the director of the manufacturing engineering 
lab during the Apollo program and had directed the assembly of systems for the Saturn I nose 
cones and Saturn V launch systems.533 
 
Japan’s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) docked the two satellites⎯Orihime and 
Hikoboshi⎯in outer space, marking the first time two robotic spacecraft had docked using 
remote control. U.S. and Russian space programs had used remote control to dock pilotless cargo 
craft with the piloted Mir space station, but had never maneuvered two robotic spacecraft 
together. NASA spokesperson Brian D. Welch called the accomplishment “an impressive feat.” 
NASDA timed the rendezvous of the two satellites to coincide with Japan’s Tanabata, or star 
festival, on 7 July, celebrating “a mythical meeting between the princess Orihime and her lover 
Hikoboshi,” associated with the stars Altair and Vega. According to the legend, the pair may 
meet only once a year on 7 July.534 
 
NASA announced that JSC had modified its contract with United Space Alliance, awarding the 
contractor more Shuttle work. Three other NASA contractors had previously performed the more

than US$900 million of work on the Space Shuttle’s solid rocket booster and other elements. 
USBI Company at Kennedy Space Center had worked on the boosters; Lockheed Martin 
Corporation in Houston, Texas, had designed and produced the primary Shuttle avionics 
software; and Boeing Aerospace Operations in Houston had processed flight equipment.535 
 
8 July 
S. George Djorgovski, an astronomer at California Institute of Technology; Dale A. Frail, an 
astronomer with the Very Large Array (VLA) Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico; and their 
colleagues issued a notice to fellow astronomers regarding a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected on 
2 July. Frail and Djorgovski had combined the resources of the VLA and the W. M. Keck 
Observatory in Hawaii to pinpoint the source of the burst, which they calculated to be a galaxy, 
“alive with new-forming stars,” billions of light-years away from Earth. Although scientists did 
not yet know the cause of GRBs, Frail remarked, “the fact that this burst happened in a hot 
galaxy where new stars are being rapidly formed is probably the death knell for the theory that 
collisions between old, dying neutron stars are responsible for the gamma-ray bursts.”536 
 
9 July 
Heinrich K. Paetz, an original member of Wernher von Braun’s German rocket team, died of 
natural causes at the age of 88, the second team member to die within the week. Before retiring 
from NASA in 1970, Paetz had participated in the Redstone, Jupiter, Saturn I, and Saturn V 
programs as a member of the test branch.537 
 
A month after its launch, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began 
activating the weather satellite, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-10 (GOES-
10), a backup to the failing GOES-9 satellite. The momentum wheels on GOES-9, similar to a 
gyroscope, which maintain the satellite’s stability, were “showing signs of impending failure.” 
GOES-9 was responsible for monitoring weather on the west coast of the United States. GOES-
10, placed in storage mode above the center of the country, would need about 30 days, moving 
approximately 1º of longitude each day, to move to the west coast location. GOES-10’s well-
timed placement in storage mode would ensure data continuity, saving NOAA a 12- to 15-month 
wait for a time slot for launch, following the imminent failure of GOES-9.538 
 
10 July 
Rocket scientist Albert E. Schuler died of natural causes at the age of 83, the third original 
member of Wernher von Braun’s rocket team to die in the same week. Schuler had retired from 
NASA in 1969, after a career overseeing measurement of instrumentation on test stands and 
rockets during static firings and overseeing flight instrumentation, guidance, and control on 
rocket flights.539

NASA announced the establishment of a Near-Earth Object Program Office at its Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL), responsible for coordinating “NASA-sponsored efforts to detect, track, and 
characterize potentially hazardous asteroids and comets that could approach Earth,” and with 
facilitating communication between scientists and the public, were NASA to discover any 
potentially hazardous objects. NASA selected JPL to host the new program, because of “its 
expertise in tracking precisely the positions and predicted paths of asteroids and comets.”540 
 
15 July 
NASA released “unusually detailed” images of Jupiter’s moon Ganymede taken by the Galileo 
probe in June 1996 and June 1997. Although the images did not indicate the existence of any 
form of life, they showed that life had been possible in Ganymede’s oceans billions of years ago. 
At that time, the moon had water, heat, and organic material, brought by comets from outer 
space. The images also revealed geological formations, including mountain-like ridges and a 
valley system of volcanoes. Early in the moon’s history, the volcanoes had supplied water for 
Ganymede’s oceans, which are now frozen.541 
 
NASA’s Inventions and Contributions Board announced the winners of its 1998 Software of the 
Year Award. The first winner, Tempest, a breakthrough technology “originally developed to 
support the science experiments on the ISS,” had “spawned new markets,” and NASA predicted 
that the technology would continue to do so. NASA’s Ames Research Center had designed the 
second winner, Center TRACON Automation System Software, a set of three software tools for 
managing air-traffic–control systems at major airports, to optimize flight operations. Analyzing 
and predicting aircraft paths, the software created visual representations of arriving traffic flow, 
providing controllers with “up-to-the-second advisories of information” for pilots, thus reducing 
time between landings to a minimum. The Federal Aviation Administration had chosen the 
software for immediate implementation at all major airports.542 
 
NASA officially opened its new communications terminal on Guam, to provide “global, full-
time and real-time communications support for NASA’s Space Network customers.” The Guam 
ground station replaced the interim ground terminal in Canberra, Australia, established to 
provide continuous, full-time, real-time communications support for NASA’s Compton Gamma 
Ray Observatory, after it had “suffered an on-board tape recorder failure in March 1992.”543 
 
16 July 
The joint committee of NASA and the European Space Agency investigating the Solar and 
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) incident issued a preliminary report. The committee found 
that several errors had led to the loss of the satellite’s signal. First, Mission Control had 
“unknowingly activated” two preprogrammed sequences, which lacked commands to reorient the 
spacecraft properly. The resulting anomalies had caused SOHO to enter into emergency Sun 
reacquisition mode (ESR). A “rapid decision” to turn off one of the craft’s gyroscopes had

ultimately triggered two more ESRs, sending the spacecraft “flailing out of control.” Controllers 
also discovered that “undetected failures,” which had occurred sometime earlier in the year, “had 
taken out three of the four batteries.”544 
 
17 July 
U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) offered an amendment to the Subcommittee on Veterans 
Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies’ FY 1999 
appropriations bill, adding US$33 million to the US$150 million budget for NASA already 
approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Senate defeated the amendment by a 
vote of 58 to 37. President William J. Clinton’s proposed budget had requested a US$183 million 
reduction in NASA’s budget.545 
 
20 July 
The data transmission system of Galileo malfunctioned during its fifth flyby of Jupiter’s moon 
Europa when it went into safe mode. Although NASA engineers activated a backup system, the 
transmission system had lost all data collected when the craft passed within 1,141 miles (1,835 
kilometers) of the moon. NASA was investigating the malfunction. NASA had launched Galileo 
in 1989, and the probe had entered Jupiter’s orbit in 1995, collecting data from moons Io, 
Europa, and Callisto during its initial two-year mission, completed in December 1997. NASA 
had extended the mission for two additional years.546 
 
21 July 
Alan B. Shepard Jr., the first American in space, died in his sleep at the age of 74 after a two-
year battle with leukemia. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin remembered him for being 
“one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, for being the first American to fly in space, and 
for being one of only 12 Americans to step on the Moon.” A former U.S. Navy pilot, Shepard 
had first traveled to space on 5 May 1961, just 23 days after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin 
became the first human to orbit Earth. Shepard, the lone astronaut in the small space capsule, 
Freedom 7, rocketed 116 miles (187 kilometers) above Earth, as millions of people watched him 
live on television. Shepard’s spaceflight proved a significant morale-boosting moment for 
Americans, in the midst of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which until then had appeared to 
be winning the space race. After the flight, President John F. Kennedy presented Shepard with 
the Distinguished Service Medal, challenging the nation to put a man on the Moon by the end of 
the decade. Shepard made history again in 1971, when he commanded Apollo 14 on its nine-day 
mission to the Moon. He delighted Americans watching the expedition on television, when, 
taking a break from collecting Moon rocks, he hit two golf balls with an improvised club. 
Shepard, who had retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy in 1974, received the Congressional 
Space Medal of Honor in 1979. Shepard also engaged in philanthropic pursuits, such as investing

in the establishment of the Astronaut Foundation, which provides scholarships. The Astronaut 
Foundation had also founded the Space Camp program for young people.547 
 
22 July 
NASA named astronaut Terrence W. Wilcutt to replace James D. Halsell Jr. as NASA’s 
Manager of Operational Activities at Star City, Russia. Wilcutt was the 10th astronaut to serve in 
the rotational position, supporting the training and preparation of NASA astronauts at Gagarin 
Cosmonaut Training Center and acting as a liaison between NASA and Russian management. 
Wilcutt had flown on three missions: the first, in 1994, as the pilot on Mission STS-68, to study 
the Earth’s surface; the second, in 1996, as the pilot for the fourth Shuttle–Mir docking mission, 
STS-79; and the third, in 1998, as the commander of Mission STS-89, the eighth docking 
mission.548 
 
23 July 
NASA announced that the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had found the youngest cluster of 
stars ever observed in a galaxy near the Milky Way. The baby stars were “enveloped in a cloud 
of luminous gases,” in the galaxy known as the Small Magellanic Cloud, about 200,000 light-
years from Earth. The HST had discovered the 50 new stars, each 300,000 times as bright as the 
Sun, “concentrated in a region only 10 light-years across in a cloud known as N81.” Before the 
capture of the HST’s high-resolution images, astronomers had referred to the area as The 
Blob.549 
 
NASA announced that engineers had repaired the malfunctioning data transmission systems 
aboard Galileo. Although both subsystems were “working redundantly, as they had been 
designed to do,” it would be up to a week before the probe could resume transmitting scientific 
data to Earth. Project engineers believed that debris had short-circuited a signal line, causing 
computer resets.550 
 
Two competing teams using NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) discovered the first 
known accretion-powered millisecond pulsar. The scientists believed the pulsar to be the missing 
link between two known types of stars: 1) “old, accreting neutron stars, which are powerful 
sources of [x]-rays generated from the material they are gobbling up from their companions,” 
and 2) even older “radiowave emitting pulsars that are rotating very rapidly and slowing down 
gradually.” Because the new star, designated SAX J1808.4-3658, was both emitting x-rays and 
spinning rapidly, scientists believed it was the link between the accreting and the radiowave-

emitting neutron stars. Michiel van der Klis and Rudy Wijnands of the University of Amsterdam 
found the new pulsar—called the “Holy Grail of X-ray astronomy”—and measured the time 
between its rapid x-ray pulses, to derive its rotation rate. Van der Klis explained that, based on 
the fact of accretion, astrophysicists had long theorized that millisecond pulsars existed, but this 
was the first time that one had been “caught in the act.” Accretion, the process of drawing gas 
from a nearby “companion” star, causes pulsars to heat up, emitting x-rays. After accretion ends, 
high-velocity beams of subatomic particles continue to “blow material off the companion,” 
eventually causing the companion to vanish. Deepto Chakrabarty and Edward H. Morgan of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology led the team that found the pulsar’s 2-hour orbital period, 
measured the orbit, and inferred the presence of the companion star. Tod E. Strohmayer, a 
member of the RXTE team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, suggested, “[x]-ray and 
particle beam ablation may explain why millisecond pulsars are often found alone, despite the 
fact that they required a companion star to speed up.” Pulsars “vaporize” their companions, thus 
hiding the evidence, which is, as Strohmayer described it, the “stellar version of the perfect 
crime.”551 
 
27 July 
NASA announced that astronomers had located the “wayward” SOHO satellite after losing radio 
contact on 24 June, when a programming error on the ground caused its solar panels to switch 
positions. Two U.S. radio telescopes had located the satellite rotating slowly near its original 
position, approximately 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth. Engineers had 
calculated its exact location after NASA’s Deep Space Network in Goldstone, California, 
“intercepted the echo of a radio signal transmitted by the giant radio telescope of the National 
Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.” The spacecraft’s slow rotation on 
its axis indicated that it had incurred only minor damage and that its solar panels would soon 
face the Sun again.552 
 
29 July 
Aaron A. Crayford and Cody Grosskopf, the two Cloverdale, California, teenagers accused of 
hacking into military and government computers in January and February 1998, pled guilty to 
federal hacking charges. The U.S. Attorney’s Office recommended probation and strict 
restrictions on the boys’ computer use and modem access. Crayford and Grosskopf had 
reportedly hacked into U.S government Web sites, including the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Naval Postgraduate School, NOAA, NASA, 
the U.S. Air Force, and Pearl Harbor naval base; Web sites of foreign governments, Taiwan and 
the United Arab Emirates; and Web sites of a number of universities, including the University of 
California at Berkeley, the University of California at Santa Barbara, the University of California 
at Los Angeles, the University of California at Davis, California Polytechnic Institute, Columbia 
University, and Harvard University.553

The U.S. House of Representatives voted 323 to 109 against an amendment, sponsored by 
Representative Timothy J. Roemer (D-IN), which would have eliminated the ISS program before 
the launch of the first pieces of the laboratory into orbit. Commenting on the hundreds of 
thousands of pounds of hardware already constructed, Representative David Weldon Jr. (R-FL) 
remarked that “to pull the plug now seemed inappropriate to a lot of people.” Despite bad news 
throughout the past year, requiring NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin to visit Capitol Hill 
repeatedly to discuss cost overruns and delays, the vote was the “strongest endorsement ever for 
the station.” The station had survived by only one vote in 1993, the year President William J. 
Clinton had “reorganized the project and invited Russia to join the international consortium” and 
to build the laboratory.554 
 
NASA announced completion of qualification tests of the first wing assembly for its X-34 
technology demonstrator, explaining that the prime contractor, Orbital Sciences Corporation, had 
integrated the wing assembly with the test article’s fuselage, marking a major milestone in the 
program.555

NASA announced the selection of veteran cosmonaut Sergei K. Krikalev for the crew of Mission 
STS-88, the first American ISS assembly mission. In December 1998, Krikalev would join 
aboard Endeavour Commander Robert D. Cabana, Pilot Frederick W. “Rick” Sturckow, and 
Mission Specialists Nancy J. Currie, Jerry L. Ross, and James H. Newman. NASA had assigned 
Mission STS-88 the task of attaching the U.S.-built Unity module to the Russian-built Zarya 
control module, scheduled to launch in November 1998. Krikalev had been a member of two Mir 
space station crews and had flown aboard the Space Shuttle as a member of the Mission STS-60 
crew in February 1994. During Mission STS-60, Krikalev had operated the robotic arm and 
supported a variety of experiments in materials science.556

Director of Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) in Edwards, California. Szalai had directed 
DFRC since December 1990. Before becoming the Center’s director, Szalai had been head of the 
research engineering division at DFRC for eight years. NASA had awarded Szalai, an 
internationally recognized expert on flight control and flight systems, the Exceptional Service 
Medal in recognition of his work on the first Digital Fly-by-Wire aircraft. He had also received 
NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal during his NASA tenure. NASA Administrator Daniel

NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration announced the winners of the 1998 National 
General Aviation Design Competition, in which undergraduate and graduate students, enrolled at 
U.S. engineering schools “participating in a major national effort to rebuild the U.S. general 
aviation sector,” compete individually or as teams. A 27-member undergraduate team from 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute won first place for its design, called VicTor, a single-engine, four-
seat, high-performance aircraft. VicTor’s special design elements included an ergonomic cockpit 
with adjustable, side-control sticks and dual airbags; a choice between two high-performance 
engines; and advanced technology instrument displays. The design also included an upgrade 
option, “to allow autonomous flight if it becomes a reality.” A 15-member, Pennsylvania State 
University team won second place for their high-performance, two-person, single-engine, 
composite-fuselage, tractor-prop light airplane. Third place went to 13 undergraduate students 
from the University of Virginia for their computer program predicting drag in the design of new 
small passenger airplanes.558 
 
3 August 
The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite, out of contact with ground controllers 
since 25 June, responded to signals sent by NASA’s Deep Space Tracking Network antennas in 
Canberra, Australia. Although the signals contained no data, SOHO transmitted a series of short 
radio bursts, indicating to space scientists that the craft was still able to receive ground 
commands and, therefore, that they might still have a chance of salvaging it.559 
 
7 August 
NASA announced that Boeing Company’s cost overruns for the International Space Station (ISS) 
had increased by about 30 percent to US$783 million, and that NASA intended to “further cut 
the company’s bonus fees.” In reporting to NASA the latest cost overruns, Boeing had explained 
that “continued production and testing and the need to set aside money for contingencies” had 
caused the latest increase, US$183 million more than the US$600 million previously estimated. 
Under the terms of NASA’s cost-plus-fee contract, Boeing would lose an additional US$27.5 
million in bonus fees, besides the US$78 million reduction that NASA had imposed.560 
 
8 August 
Following ground control efforts during recent weeks to partially recharge the spacecraft’s 
batteries, SOHO successfully transmitted telemetry data to NASA’s Deep Space Tracking 
Station at Goldstone, California. The 1-minute burst of data contained information about 
SOHO’s temperature and the state of some of its electrical systems, damaged by the extreme 
cold. The data also indicated that ground control had successfully recharged one of the two 
batteries. The spacecraft remained in the L-1 Langrangian point in space, which is a point 1 
million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away from Earth, where gravity forces are stable and “an 
object will not change its position relative to the Earth.”561

11 August 
Hughes Electronics Corporation concluded its investigation into the 19 May failure of 
PanAmSat’s Galaxy IV satellite and the similar problems that later had affected two other 
satellites. Metallic crystals growing in space, “less than the width of a human hair,” had caused 
tin-plated electrical switches to short, disabling navigational devices that kept the satellites 
oriented toward Earth-based controllers. However, the investigation had failed to uncover the 
source of the failure of Galaxy IV’s backup system, which led to the widespread blackout on 19 
May.562 
 
12 August 
A U.S. Air Force Titan IV rocket, carrying a classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance 
Office of the Pentagon, exploded 1 minute after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. More than 
20 stories high and weighing nearly 2 million pounds (907,000 kilograms), the Lockheed 
Martin–built Titan IV was the largest crewless rocket used in the United States. The rocket used 
solid-fuel boosters similar to those used to launch NASA’s Space Shuttle. The explosion 
destroyed about US$1.3 billion worth of hardware, making it one of the worst American rocket-
launch failures to date. The rocket was about 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) above the Atlantic when 
it exploded, and the ocean carried the debris and toxic substances away from land. This was the 
second time a Titan IV had exploded during launch; the first explosion occurred in 1993.563 
 
13 August 
A Soyuz TM-28 spacecraft blasted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying the 
penultimate crew of the Russian space station Mir. The three-member crew was composed of 
former presidential defense adviser Yuri M. Baturin, Flight Commander Sergei V. Avdeyev, and 
Engineer Gennady I. Padalka.564 Baturin was the first Russian bureaucrat to travel into space, 
and his inclusion in the mission attracted “unusually heavy Russian media coverage.” The former 
Kremlin adviser had trained alongside professional cosmonauts, passing all examinations. Earlier 
in the year, President Boris N. Yeltsin had fired space physicist Baturin without an explanation, 
and Baturin had focused since then on training for the mission to Mir.565 
 
As part of an overall restructuring, the Boeing Company announced plans to reduce its 
workforce by 12 percent over the next 18 months, through the layoffs of as many as 28,000 
workers. Much of the restructuring plan focused on the company’s commercial airplane business, 
affecting those workers who were once part of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which Boeing 
had purchased in 1997. In contrast, the company reported it was making strides in its defense and 
space work.566

NASA awarded Aerojet, a GenCorp Inc. company, a US$16.4 million contract to provide a de-
orbit propulsion stage for the X-38 technology demonstrator vehicle. The contract for design, 
development, manufacture, test, and delivery of one propulsion stage for the first X-38 
spaceflight test included a second option for five operational propulsion units for the crew return 
vehicle (CRV), if NASA selected the X-38 design for the CRV. Engineers at Dryden Flight 
Research Center were flight-testing the X-38, a prototype spacecraft intended to lead to the 
development and construction of a CRV for the ISS.567 
 
20 August 
A fire that started in a shed containing an air compressor spread to another building of NASA’s 
Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), causing extensive damage. No one was injured, and 
firefighters were able to stop the blaze before it reached laboratories containing hazardous and 
flammable materials. Fire investigators had not determined the cause of the fire. NASA did not 
permit the investigators to survey the damage immediately, because of sensitive material housed 
in the affected building.568 
 
21 August 
Phillip Z. Tapper, emergency coordinator for NASA’s GSFC, announced that exposure to smoke 
and water during the previous day’s fire had damaged parts of two spacecraft. Tapper said that 
engineers had not yet determined the exact damage to the heat protection panels, which they 
were planning to install in the Hubble Space Telescope and another spacecraft.569 
 
NASA and U.S. Air Force officials announced the hiring of Space Gateway Support of Herndon, 
Virginia, to run base operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Patrick Air Force Base, and 
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Johnson Controls and EG&G Florida at KSC had 
previously held base-operations contracts at the military bases. The new joint base-operations-
support contract was worth US$1 billion for five years, with the option to renew for another five 
years. In consolidating the contracts, the agencies intended to cut costs. According to officials, 
continuing separate base-operations contracts would have cost 30 percent more. Other primary 
customers under the contract included government contractors for NASA and U.S. Air Force 
spaceflight operations, payload ground operations, life sciences, expendable vehicles, and launch 
operations and support.570 
 
Fritz Haber, a German engineer recruited after World War II to work on the American space 
program, died at the age of 86 in Connecticut. An aeronautical engineer, Haber developed a way 
to simulate a gravity-free environment by flying a plane in a roller-coaster pattern. NASA first 
used this simulation to train the astronauts in the Apollo program. Before coming to the United 
States, Haber had developed a way to transport missiles by piggybacking them on another 
aircraft. Engineers had never used his piggyback design during World War II, but NASA had

implemented his idea, carrying the Space Shuttle on a modified Boeing 747 from its landing site 
in California back to its launch site in Florida.571 
 
25 August 
Cosmonauts Talgat A. Musabayev and Nikolai M. Budarin returned to Earth from a 207-day 
sojourn aboard Mir, along with former Kremlin aide Yuri M. Baturin, who had accompanied the 
cosmonauts’ replacements to the space station, spending 12 days in space. The two cosmonauts 
arrived in Russia to find a devalued ruble and the return of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Acting 
Prime Minister. Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin had not yet fired Chernomyrdin’s 
government at the time Musabayev and Budarin left for Mir, and the two cosmonauts had missed 
the entire four-month term of Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko. Yeltsin had dissolved 
Kiriyenko’s government the week before the cosmonauts’ return flight to Earth. Because Yeltsin 
had devalued the ruble, the two cosmonauts also found that their pay had diminished.572 
 
26 August 
The newly developed Delta III rocket exploded during liftoff, destroying the Galaxy X 
communications satellite it was carrying into orbit. The launch was the maiden flight of Boeing’s 
newest version of the Delta rocket, designed to carry 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms), twice the 
payload of the previous version.573 
 
27 August 
NASA announced the arrival of international astronaut candidates at Johnson Space Center, 
where they began training as members of the 1998 astronaut class. The international candidates, 
from Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy, were Léopold Eyharts, Paolo A. Nespoli, Hans 
W. Schlegel, and Roberto Vittori of the European Space Agency; Bjarni V. Tryggvason of the 
Canadian Space Agency; and Marco C. Pontes of the Brazilian Space Agency.574 
 
SEPTEMBER 1998 
2 September 
Pentagon officials announced that, on 12 August, a split-second power outage had caused a Titan 
IV rocket to explode while launching a secret spy satellite into space. A battery powering the 
guidance system had failed, interrupting the flow of electricity for a fraction of a second. After 
the restoration of battery power, the guidance control system had sent a command causing the 
rocket to pitch down and to the right, while traveling at 675 miles (1,100 kilometers) per hour at 
17,000 feet (5,200 meters). The rocket had begun to break up, and the malfunction had triggered 
the automatic destruct system. In addition, when it had begun to explode, range safety officers 
had sent the rocket destruct commands, to ensure it would not threaten the coastal population.575

The investigation board of engineers and officials from NASA and the European Space Agency 
released their final report, determining how controllers had lost communication with the Solar 
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite on 24 June. The board’s findings, presented at a 
joint news conference held in Washington, DC, and Paris, concluded that no anomalies existed 
on the spacecraft; the loss of SOHO “was a direct result of operational errors, a failure to monitor 
the status of the spacecraft adequately, and the use of insufficiently tested rescue procedures.” 
However, the board emphasized that no single cause or particular person was responsible for the 
incident.576 
 
NASA announced that Lunar Prospector’s gamma-ray spectrometer had returned data about the 
Moon’s elemental composition. Scientists had used the data to develop the first global maps 
delineating compositional variations of thorium, potassium, and iron ore over the lunar surface. 
The maps provided insights into how the Moon’s crust had developed. Prospector’s 
magnetometer and electron-reflectometer data indicated that the Moon contained magnetized 
rocks on its upper surface, which had created the two smallest known magnetospheres in the 
solar system. The craft’s Doppler gravity experiment had enabled scientists to develop the “first 
precise gravity map of the entire lunar surface,” showing seven previously unknown lava-filled 
craters, which cause gravitational anomalies. NASA also announced that Lunar Prospector had 
supplied additional evidence of water-ice deposits on both poles of the Moon.577 
 
4 September 
NASA awarded contracts to Boeing Information, Space, and Defense Systems; Kelly Space and 
Technology; Lockheed Martin Astronautics; and Orbital Sciences Corporation Space Access. 
The five contracting companies would study ways that NASA could meet its requirements for 
human spaceflight at a lower cost. The studies would examine three scenarios: 1) keeping the 
Shuttle operational until 2020, 2) replacing the Shuttle when it was cost-effective to do so, and 3) 
developing an alternative plan in case NASA’s funding remained at FY 1999 levels.578 
 
The journal Science published data gathered from NASA’s Lunar Prospector, indicating the 
presence of hydrogen, often bundled as water molecules, on the north and south poles of the 
Moon. Alan B. Binder, Chief Scientist for the Lunar Prospector mission, explained that the 
spacecraft had detected an abundance of hydrogen, and that the science team had interpreted the 
data to mean that the Moon has 1–10 billion tons (910–9,100 kilograms or 0.9–9.1 billion 
tonnes) of water. In a previous mission to the Moon to collect data, the spacecraft Clementine 
had found radar indications of water on the Moon’s south pole. Paul D. Spudis, a member of the 
Clementine science team, remarked that Prospector’s discovery was significant because “the 
presence of lunar water has been confirmed by two different research methods.”579

8 September 
Boeing successfully launched, from a California launch site, five satellites for the Iridium World 
Communications network, aboard a Delta II rocket. The Delta II launched two weeks after the 
“disastrous maiden flight” of the new Delta III rocket, which had exploded during liftoff. 
Officials announced on 5 September that a problem with the rocket’s control system had caused 
the explosion, but that they had not yet determined the exact chain of events. The five satellites 
launched aboard the Delta II rocket replaced satellites that had malfunctioned and could not be 
included in the Iridium telecommunications constellation.580 
 
9 September 
A Zenit rocket, launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, failed when a computer 
error caused a premature engine shutdown during the second-stage burn. The rocket fell, 
crashing in Siberia. The rocket’s failure destroyed 12 of Globalstar Inc.’s communications 
satellites.581 
 
10 September 
Ghassem R. Asrar, NASA Associate Administrator for Earth Science Enterprise, testified before 
the U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics about budget concerns and 
delays associated with the Earth Observing System program. House Subcommittee Chairperson 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) had called the hearing to discuss numerous delays in NASA’s Earth 
Science Enterprise missions. Asrar explained the reasons for the delays, indicating that NASA 
would work with Raytheon Systems to deliver a scaled-back data system within budget, in time 
to support two delayed missions. Subcommittee member, Representative David Weldon Jr. (R-
FL), “questioned the legitimacy of NASA’s ownership of the Earth Science program,” 
suggesting that a different agency, such as the National Academy of Sciences or the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), should manage the program. Weldon also 
questioned whether scientists would be able to make use of the vast amount of data they 
expected the program to generate. Robert S. Winokur, NOAA’s Assistant Administrator for 
Satellite and Information Services, assured subcommittee members that scientists would be able 
to use the information. Winokur was responsible for coordinating NOAA’s joint efforts with 
NASA to archive and retrieve environmental data.582 
 
NASA announced that Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had selected Lockheed Martin Missiles 
and Space of Sunnyvale, California, and TRW Inc. Space and Electronics Group of Redondo 
Beach, California, as industry team members for the Space Interferometry Mission. The 
Interferometry Mission would measure the precise location of stars and search for planets 
orbiting nearby stars. The two contracts, which together exceeded US$200 million, included 
mission formulation and implementation.583

11 September 
NASA researchers released images and temperature readings collected by Mars Global Surveyor. 
The images revealed that the Martian moon Phobos is covered in a layer of dust at least 3 feet 
(0.9 meters) deep, the result of the impact of meteoroids, occurring over millions of years. 
Surveyor’s thermal emission spectrometer revealed that, on Phobos, the temperature changes 
from -170ºF to -25ºF (-112ºC to -32ºC) between night and day. Scientists explained that dust 
accounts for some of the moon’s drastic temperature change, because Phobos does not have an 
atmosphere enabling it to trap heat. Therefore, the surface’s small particles have only 7 hours to 
absorb heat from the Sun, losing heat rapidly after sunset. Images of landslides on steep crater 
slopes indicated that Phobos’s gravity, even at just 1/1,000th of that of Earth, is sufficient to pull 
objects downward.584 
 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin appointed Arthur G. Stephenson, President of 
Oceaneering Advanced Technologies, as the new Director of Marshall Space Flight Center 
(MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. MSFC’s previous director had retired in January, and at that 
time, NASA had appointed MSFC’s Deputy Director Carolyn S. Griner as Acting Director of the 
Center. Before his tenure at Oceaneering Advanced Technologies, Stephenson had worked 28 
years for TRW Inc. of California. His last position was as Director of TRW Inc.’s Space 
Transportation and Servicing Advanced Programs. During his 34-year career, Stephenson had 
worked on various projects related to MSFC, including the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle, during 
the 1970s and 1980s; the Gamma Ray Observatory; automated rendezvous and docking; and the 
space-welding inspection, extravehicular-activity tool. He had also directed the International 
Space Station (ISS) robotic-system engineering support to the Boeing Company.585 
 
Associate Administrator for the Office of Space Science Wesley T. Huntress Jr. announced the 
selection of two small spacecraft to undertake the first missions of NASA’s University-class 
Explorers program, designed to “provide frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and 
relatively inexpensive science missions.” NASA had selected the Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma 
Spectrometer spacecraft to study the “Local Bubble,” a cloud of hot gas surrounding the solar 
system and extending approximately 300 light-years from the Sun. NASA selected the Inner 
Magnetosphere Explorer to study how Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts respond to variations in 
the solar wind. NASA had scheduled both missions for 2001.586

At a ceremony marking its official opening, Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore III announced 
that Reston-based DynCorp was the first major investor in the Commercial Spaceport Launch 
Pad at Virginia Space Flight Center on Wallops Island, the nation’s third commercial spaceport. 
The Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority, a collaborative effort of the state, the Center 
for Innovative Technology at Old Dominion University in Virginia, NASA, and private industry, 
had developed the communications facility, located at one end of NASA’s Wallops Flight 
Facility. The spaceport was one of 18 sites competing to launch the VentureStarTM, a privately

16 September 
NASA regained control over SOHO and, after successfully thawing the craft’s fuel, determined 
that its rocket thrusters were useable. NASA spokesperson William A. Steigerwald of Goddard 
Space Flight Center (GSFC) explained that flight controllers would check each individual system 
and instrument next, and would then reestablish full automatic gyroscopic control.588 
 
Scientists studying images taken by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft announced, in a joint 
teleconference with Cornell University and NASA’s JPL, that Jupiter’s rings appeared to consist 
of dust, created in the course of millions of years, as asteroids and comets crashed into the four 
small moons nearest the planet’s surface⎯Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. The images, 
captured during several hours in November 1996, when Galileo was able to observe the rings lit 
up by the Sun, had provided “unprecedented details of the tiny dust particles.” Furthermore, 
scientists observed that, in the images, “the three rings stopped abruptly at different moons.” 
Images from a second flyby in September 1997 had confirmed that “the depths of the three rings 
matched the depths of the moons’ orbits,” and that material in the rings “matched the dark red 
dust on the moons’ surface.” The scientists said that more moons than rings exist, because some 
of the moons supply dust to more than one ring.589 
 
21 September 
NASA announced that California Institute of Technology would continue to manage and operate 
NASA’s JPL under a new five-year contract valued at US$6.25 billion. The contract would 
support such programs as the Mars Global Surveyor robotic exploration program; the Cassini 
mission to Saturn; NASA Origins Program missions, including the Space Infrared Telescope 
Facility; Earth-Observing spacecraft; and the Deep Space Network of communications 
antennas.590

NASA awarded its combined space operations contract to Lockheed Martin, covering operations 
at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; Johnson Space Center in Houston, 
Texas; Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Alabama; and Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The contract, worth 
US$1.9 billion for the first five years, with a five-year renewal worth an additional US$1.5 
billion, covered the cost of directing, monitoring, and downloading data from spacecraft. NASA

29 September 
NASA announced that an intense wave of gamma rays, emanating from a magnetar 20,000 light-
years away from Earth, had struck Earth’s atmosphere on 27 August. Stanford University 
professor Umran Inan remarked that the occurrence, which had a measurable effect on Earth, 
was extremely rare, since the event occurred outside the solar system. The radiation wave was 
“so powerful that it blasted sensitive detectors to maximum or off scale on at least seven 
scientific spacecraft in Earth-orbit and around the solar system.”592 
 
OCTOBER 1998 
1 October 
On NASA’s 40th anniversary, President of the Space Frontier Foundation Richard N. Tumlinson 
and NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin spoke before the U.S. House Science Subcommittee 
on Space and Aeronautics about space exploration and the possibility of privatizing space 
ventures. Tumlinson’s organization advocated limiting NASA’s role to supporting technology 
and research programs. He proposed commercializing the Shuttle fleet and privatizing NASA 
field centers, to reduce the costs of space exploration and eventual colonization. Goldin 
advocated reducing costs as well, but did not respond to Tumlinson’s proposals. He also outlined 
new technologies that NASA was developing, to cut the cost of rockets and satellites. Goldin 
remarked that NASA “would form partnerships with industry for ‘cutting-edge research 
development’,” also emphasizing NASA’s support of government loans to fuel the growth of the 
space industry in the United States.593 
 
2 October 
NASA and Russian Space Agency officials announced that Russia had agreed to sell research 
time aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for US$60 million, with payment dependent on 
the Russian agency’s completion of critical milestones. The ISS collaborators, including 
representatives of the 16 countries participating in the ISS program, had reached the agreement 
during a week of meetings in Moscow. Russia had missed three target dates because of 
insufficient funds. The deal, part of NASA’s efforts to bail out its partner and to “prevent costly 
new delays” in the construction and launch of the ISS, did not release Russia from its obligations 
to build the service module. As the Moscow meeting concluded, NASA officials also announced 
that the launches of the first ISS components, the Zarya and Unity modules, remained on

Administration the authority to issue licenses to private companies for the launch of reusable 
space vehicles like NASA’s Shuttle. Supporters of the measure stressed that enactment of the 
law would “better enable American companies to compete in an increasingly competitive 
international marketplace,” warning that, without this law, the United States would risk losing 
the space industry to overseas markets. The legislation also required NASA to submit a report 
and an independently conducted market study to Congress, identifying commercial opportunities 
and evaluating commercial interest in the development of the ISS.596 
 
George W. Lewis Jr., NASA aeronautical engineer and son of George W. Lewis, former research 
director of NASA’s predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, died 
at his home at the age of 81. He had worked for 30 years in Cleveland, Ohio, at Lewis Research 
Center, which NASA had named for his father.597 
 
6 October 
The Russian government agreed to pay a US$44.5 million debt to the Russian Space Agency, to 
ensure that the agency would be able to complete a long-delayed component of the new space 
station. Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev said that the government 
had agreed to pay the debt in three installments, in October, November, and December.598 
 
7 October 
U.S. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) convened a hearing before the House 
Committee on Science and Technology to discuss NASA’s request for an additional US$60 
million to purchase hardware from Russia for the ISS, over and above the US$1.2 billion in 
space-related funds already paid to Russia. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin indicated that 
the additional funding was essential and that, without it, the program would risk termination. 
Sensenbrenner refused to support approval of the funding without a detailed explanation from 
U.S. Department of State and White House officials of why the program needed additional 
funds. Sensenbrenner had asked Jacob Lew of the Office of Management and Budget and 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to speak at the hearing, but both failed to appear. 
Sensenbrenner said he could not “go along with NASA’s request to start bailing out the Russian

House, or Russia, “would make good use of the money.”599 
 
8 October 
NASA announced that a long-exposure, infrared image, taken with a camera on the Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST), had uncovered the most distant galaxies ever seen. HST’s Near Infrared 
Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) had detected galaxies that might be over 12 
billion light-years away, depending on which cosmological models scientists used. NASA’s 
Acting Associate Administrator for Space Science, Edward J. Weiler, deemed the discovery a 
major step toward fulfilling one of HST’s key objectives: to search for the “faintest and farthest 
objects in the universe.”600 
 
13 October 
NASA announced that two of its research pilots had been the first Americans to fly a modified 
Russian Tu-144 supersonic jetliner, participating in three evaluation flights over a two-week 
period during mid-to-late September, at Zhukovsky Air Development Center near Moscow. 
Pilots Robert Rivers of Langley Research Center and C. Gordon Fullerton of Dryden Flight 
Research Center had flown the jetliner as part of a jointly funded activity under the auspices of 
NASA’s High-Speed Research Program and the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The 
purpose of the test flights was to gain operational experience and experimental flight data to 
develop an “environmentally friendly, second-generation, supersonic transport” in the United 
States.601 
 
14 October 
NASA announced that it had restructured and renamed its Office of Aeronautics and Space 
Transportation Technology, known as Code R, appointing retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant 
General Spence M. Armstrong to head the newly reorganized Office of Aero-Space Technology. 
NASA’s spokesperson said that NASA’s management had created three new divisions within the 
Office⎯Goals, Programs, and Institutions⎯to help NASA achieve its goals. Major goals 
included accessing space more cheaply, with reusable launch vehicle programs; creating greater 
synergy between aeronautics and space transportation technology; decreasing aircraft accident 
rates, while tripling the nation’s aviation-system capacity; diminishing aircraft noise and 
emissions; and reducing the cost of air travel and the cost of placing payloads in orbit. The role 
of the Goals Division would be to implement the challenging development of new technologies; 
that of the Programs Division would be to manage the various programs within the Office, and 
the Institutions Division would oversee “institutional problems at the field centers.”602

principal investigator, Charles A. Czeisler of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston said that 
Glenn had failed to meet one of the medical criteria for the study. Czeisler did not specify the 
reason, and Glenn declined to elaborate. Researchers had rated the melatonin experiment as one 
of two top priorities among the human studies to take place during Glenn’s Shuttle flight. Four 
members of the Shuttle flight for the Neurolab mission, which occurred earlier in 1998, had 
participated in the melatonin study, and Chiaki Mukai, a member of Glenn’s crew, would be a 
fifth participant. However, Glenn’s disqualification meant that the scientists would be unable to 
test two of their four hypotheses.603 
 
21 October 
After experiencing two disastrous launch failures in 1996 and 1997, the European Space Agency 
(ESA) successfully launched its French-made Ariane 5 rocket and recoverable space capsule 
from Korou, French Guiana. The 1.6 million-pound (800-ton, 726,000-kilogram, or 726-tonne) 
rocket carried a 2.6-tonne (2.9-ton, 5,700-pound, or 2,600-kilogram) mock-up of a 
telecommunications satellite and a 2.8-tonne (3.1-ton, 6,200-pound, or 2,800-kilogram) 
recoverable capsule. With the successful recovery of the capsule from the Pacific Ocean, France 
became the fourth country to develop such technology, following the United States, Russia, and 
China. French scientists had designed the Ariane 5 rocket to carry payloads of 5.9−6.8 tonnes 
(6.5−7.5 tons, 13,000−15,000 pounds, or 5,900−6,800 kilograms) into geostationary orbit, using 
twice the power of the Ariane 4; to provide launches for low-altitude orbits and interplanetary 
space probes; and to lift the cargo vehicle that would be the ESA’s contribution to the ISS.604 
 
22 October 
Scientists studying Galileo data published findings in the journal Nature describing the likely 
presence of a subsurface, liquid, salty ocean on Callisto, Jupiter’s second largest moon. Margaret 
G. Kivelson, space physics professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and NASA’s 
Principal Investigator for Galileo’s magnetometer instrument, explained that data showed 
variability in Callisto’s magnetic field similar to that of another Jupiter moon, Europa. However, 
neither Callisto’s atmosphere, which lacks charged particles, nor Callisto’s icy crust, is a good 
conductor for generating a magnetic field. Kivelson explained that a layer of salty melted ice 
could carry “sufficient electrical currents to produce the magnetic field.” In addition, she noted 
that Galileo data indicated electrical currents flowing in opposite directions at different times, a 
“key signature consistent with the idea of a salty ocean.” However, scientists had concluded that, 
unlike Europa, Callisto was unlikely ever to support life, even if it had an ocean, because of its 
insufficient energy sources. Callisto’s only apparent source of heat is radioactive elements, 
whereas Europa’s closer position to Jupiter means it possesses tidal energy.605

NASA successfully launched Deep Space 1, a spacecraft that could “think for itself.” Driven by 
ion propulsion, Deep Space 1 was the first craft to rely on this technology for its primary 
propulsion. The craft’s destination was an asteroid 120 million miles (193 million kilometers) 
away from Earth. Although tracking stations encountered initial difficulties receiving signals 
from the spacecraft, Deep Space 1 communicated 2 hours after liftoff that it was on “the right 
course” and “in good shape.” NASA scientists expected the spacecraft to travel 450 million 
miles (724 million kilometers) to catch up with the moving asteroid. Without the ion-propulsion 
technology, it would have required 10 times more fuel to reach its target. The craft was also 
flying with 10 other “futuristic technologies,” such as lens-covered solar arrays to generate 
additional power, and a radio beacon to communicate with ground controllers without their 
prompting the probe from Earth.606 
 
27 October 
The third and final Progress cargo spacecraft of the year, Progress M-40, arrived at Mir, docking 
smoothly and delivering food, water, fuel, a giant space mirror, and other scientific equipment. 
NASA had delayed the cargo craft’s launch several times since its originally scheduled launch 
date in August 1998.607 
 
Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that they had 
placed GOES-8, the weather satellite responsible for monitoring the East Coast, in a “safe hold 
shutdown,” after it had developed problems with its attitude sensors. GOES-10 was then required 
to watch the entire country, although it could provide images only every 30 minutes, instead of 
every 15 minutes, as it did when each of the two satellites was able to monitor half of the United 
States. NASA officials were especially concerned about monitoring East Coast weather, because 
of worry that winds from Hurricane Mitch, located over the coast of Central America, could 
interfere with the upcoming launch of the Space Shuttle carrying veteran astronaut, U.S. Senator 
John H. Glenn Jr.608 
 
NASA’s Ames Research Center awarded a five-year, US$99.3 million contract to Sverdrup 
Technology Inc. of Tullahoma, Tennessee, to provide testing and facility operation, including 
wind tunnels and arc-jet testing.609 
 
28 October 
NASA awarded KSC Small Expendable Launch Vehicle Services (SELVS-KSC) contracts to 
Coleman Research Corporation of Orlando, Florida, and Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, 
Virginia, to provide launch services for NASA and for NASA-sponsored small-class payloads. 
These indefinite delivery–indefinite quantity contracts, ranging in value from US$100,000 to 
US$400,000, were part of NASA’s effort to fulfill the goals and objectives of its Human

Space Shuttle Discovery Mission STS-95 launched from KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
carrying Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr.; Pilot Steven W. Lindsey; Mission Specialists Scott E. 
Parazynski, Stephen K. Robinson, and Pedro Duque; and Payload Specialists Chiaki Mukai and 
John H. Glenn Jr. The primary objectives of STS-95 included conveying a variety of science 
experiments inside the SPACEHAB module; deploying and retrieving the Spartan free-flyer 
payload; performing operations with the HST Orbiting Systems Test; and transporting the 
International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payloads. The historic mission also returned veteran 
astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. to space. Thirty-six years after Glenn had first orbited Earth, the 
seventy-seven-year-old astronaut became the oldest person to fly in orbit. As a veteran of 
NASA’s early Mercury program, Glenn had been the first American to orbit Earth. On 20 
February 1962, in a flight lasting 5 hours, Glenn had orbited Earth three times in a tiny capsule. 
After he had passed a battery of medical tests and participated in astronaut training, NASA had 
selected U.S. Senator John H. Glenn Jr. as a crew member of STS-95, so that scientists could 
study “how space travel affects an aging astronaut’s body.”611 
 
NOVEMBER 1998 
2 November 
NASA’s Ames Research Center awarded a six-year, US$90 million contract to Logicon Syscon 
Inc. of Falls Church, Virginia, to provide operations, development, maintenance, and 
modification of the Center’s aeronautical simulation facilities. The contract included the 
operation and maintenance of the world’s largest motion-base simulator, the Vertical Motion 
Simulator, designed to aid in the study of helicopter and vertical short takeoff and landing issues, 
as well as the Crew-Vehicle Systems Research Facility, designed for the study of human factors 
in aviation safety.612 
 
3 November 
Astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Discovery successfully retrieved the Spartan spacecraft, thus 
completing a priority project of the nine-day mission. The crew had deployed the satellite on 1 
November, to record observations of the Sun’s outer atmosphere and the solar wind. Spartan had 
lagged 40 miles (64 kilometers) behind the Shuttle, in free flight, as it recorded the data. The 
flight was the last in a series of four flights begun in 1993 to “gather observations at different 
points in the [S]un’s 11-year cycle of magnetic activity.” NASA had originally scheduled the 
mission for November 1997, but astronauts had “failed to send a crucial command” before

releasing the satellite, so Spartan had gathered no data. The crew had also tested an experimental 
laser range-finding device mounted in the Shuttle, aiming at targets on Spartan.613 
 
7 November 
Astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. and his crewmates returned to Earth aboard Space Shuttle 
Discovery. Despite concern that the landing might be rough, because of a missing door on 
Discovery’s drag chute, the craft landed safely at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida. The door had fallen off during the 29 October launch. Mission Control had warned Pilot 
Steven W. Lindsey that a braking chute might deploy unexpectedly, but it remained safely in 
place throughout the landing process.614 
 
10 November 
The ion-propulsion engine on NASA’s Deep Space 1 probe shut down suddenly after running for 
4½ minutes, the first time the probe had turned on its engine since the spacecraft’s launch three 
weeks before. Ground controllers did not know the cause of the shutdown and made several 
unsuccessful attempts to restart the engine.615 
 
11 November 
Ground controllers in Madrid, Spain, lost contact with the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it approached 
the edge of the solar system but were able to reestablish communication. The probe was 
“powering down to conserve its plutonium energy source” when controllers lost contact. NASA 
had launched Voyager 2 in 1977. After the craft had toured Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, 
NASA located it traveling toward the edge of the solar system, at about 5.2 billion miles (8.4 
billion kilometers) from Earth. Scientists did not know why controllers had temporarily lost 
communication with the craft.616 
 
15 November 
Dr. William K. Douglas, the physician who had overseen the care of the seven Mercury 
astronauts, died of a viral infection at the age of 76. As part of his assignment to NASA’s 
Manned Spacecraft Center at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, Dr. Douglas had been 
“personally responsible for the medical care and flight preparation of the seven Mercury 
astronauts.” He had cared for Alan B. Shepard Jr., Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom, John H. Glenn Jr., 
and M. Scott Carpenter when they undertook the nation’s first four human spaceflights. After 
retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1977, Dr. Douglas had joined the McDonnell Douglas 
Corporation, where he had helped design an orbiting space station before retiring in 1988. In

16 November 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin appointed Edward J. Weiler Acting Associate 
Administrator for NASA’s Office of Space Science, effective immediately. Weiler had acted in 
the position since Wesley T. Huntress Jr.’s departure on 28 September. Since March 1996, 
Weiler had served as Science Director of the Astronomical Search for Origins and Planetary 
Systems within the Office of Space Science. He had been a program scientist for the Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST) since 1979.618 
 
17 November 
Satellites survived the annual Leonid meteor storm with no major damage. Astronomers had 
predicted the storm would be the most intense in three decades, because Comet Tempel-Tuttle 
had swung closer to the Sun in February, as it does every 33 years, creating a greater-than-
average amount of comet dust. Scientists had feared that particles traveling at 43 miles (69 
kilometers) per second could shred satellites’ solar arrays, damage sensitive instruments, or 
cause circuits to short.619 
 
19 November 
NASA’s ER-2 aircraft, a “close relative” of the U-2 spy plane, officially broke the altitude record 
for medium-weight planes when it flew to 68,700 feet (20,900 meters), nearly twice the cruising 
altitude of commercial airliners, during a mission to measure components of the atmosphere. A 
Canadian P-42 aircraft had set the previous record of 62,500 feet (19,050 meters) in 1988. NASA 
officials said the craft had flown at such altitudes in the past, but this flight was the first time that 
scientists had documented its altitude and made it public.620 
 
20 November 
After a delay of more than a year, a Russian Proton booster rocket launched from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying into orbit the first module of the International Space 
Station (ISS), the 41.2-foot (12.6-meter) Zarya. The role of Zarya, translated as Sunrise, would 
be to act as a “space tugboat” in the early stages of construction, providing propulsion, power, 
and communications.621 
 
22 November 
Russia’s first privately owned satellite, a Bonum-1 communications satellite, launched 
successfully from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a Delta rocket. NASA had canceled the first

time an American company had built a satellite for a Russian company. Hughes Space and 
Communications had built the Bonum-1 for Moscow-based Media Most, owner of Russia’s 
largest television network. The chairperson of the board of Media Most, Vladimir A. 
Goussinsky, described the event as a “revolution,” because the satellite would provide up to 50 
television channels for 200 million viewers in Russia, western Siberia, and Eastern Europe.622 
 
23 November 
NASA released results from the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S) to the worldwide astronomy 
community for research, as well as to the public. HDF-S was a 10-day observation that had taken 
place in October 1998. With all of its new cameras and other instruments trained simultaneously 
down the same 12 billion–light-year–long “corridor,” the team of astronomers at the Space 
Telescope Science Institute and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center had captured a “core 
sample” of the universe, doubling the number of far-flung galaxies available for astronomers to 
study. The astronomers had studied a region in the constellation Tucana, near the south celestial 
pole, complementing a previous deep-field study carried out in late 1995, when scientists aimed 
the HST at a “small patch of space near the Big Dipper.”623 
 
25 November 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that the ion engine responsible for the Deep 
Space 1 probe’s primary propulsion was back in operation after its unexpected shutdown two 
weeks earlier. Scientists believed that metallic grit or another type of contaminant located 
between two high-voltage grids had caused the engine to shut down after running for 4½ 
minutes.624 
 
Russian Space Agency officials reported, for the first time since Zarya’s launch, that the module 
had experienced malfunctions. At a press conference, Director General of the Russian Space 
Agency Yuri N. Koptev explained that none of the module’s three minor malfunctions had any 
impact on the module’s overall operations. Koptev reported that one of the eight batteries storing 
energy collected from the module’s solar panels had not performed properly, but he emphasized 
that Zarya needed only four of the eight batteries to operate. Mission Control had detected an 
“unexpected abundance of humidity” inside the module, but engineers did not yet know its 
cause. The third problem involved a malfunctioning antenna in the craft’s automatic docking 
system, a device that the first ISS crew would not need until after their arrival in January 2000.625

and US$211.8 million, included two three-year options worth up to an additional US$572.5 
million. Goddard Space Flight Center’s (GSFC’s) Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, 
Virginia, was to provide services, including design, fabrication, integration, testing, and 
performance of mission operations for sounding rocket missions. NASA considered the contract 
an integral part of the Wallops 2000 strategic plan, initiated in 1997 to ensure the facility’s future 
“stability and vitality.”626

Applications. To those investigators awarded the 40 grants for ground-based research, NASA 
provided access to its microgravity research facilities, including aircraft flying parabolic 
trajectories and sounding rockets. NASA awarded eight grants to flight-definition investigators, 
to prepare for experiments on the International Space Station (ISS).627 
 
2 December 
NASA modified a contract with Boeing Information, Space and Defense Systems, increasing by 
US$163.4 million the company’s contract for work on the ISS. Under the modified contract, 
Boeing would supply additional engineering support and prelaunch testing for the ISS. The 
original eight-year prime contract, effective since 1995, had a value of US$7.1 billion and 
covered the construction and integration of the ISS. The modification covered sustained 
engineering for station elements, engineering support following a component’s delivery to 
NASA, and support of multielement integrated testing.628 
 
NASA announced that Raytheon STX Corporation of Lanham, Maryland, would provide routine 
data operations, research, and development support for the Space Science Data Operations Office 
and the National Space Science Data Center at GSFC, under a two-year contract with three one-
year options. Valued at more than US$33 million, the contract covered the processing of space-
science data and the acquisition, modeling, analysis, archiving, and dissemination of NASA’s 
archival data to the scientific community, educators, and the public.629 
 
4 December 
After a one-day delay, Space Shuttle Endeavour launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 
Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying Commander Robert D. Cabana, Pilot Frederick W. “Rick” 
Sturckow, and Mission Specialists Nancy J. Currie, Jerry L. Ross, James H. Newman, and Sergei 
K. Krikalev. The purpose of STS-88 was to connect the U.S.-built Unity module of the ISS to the 
first ISS component, Zarya. The Russian Space Agency had placed Zarya in orbit in November. 
Launch controllers had scrubbed the liftoff of Endeavour planned for 3 December, after the 
master alarm sounded in the cockpit with only 4½ minutes remaining in the 10-minute 
countdown window. Engineers had determined that the alarm indicated momentary low pressure

in the hydraulics system. The crew experienced no problems with the second launch, until 
another alarm sounded shortly after they had reached orbit, indicating that one of three hydraulic 
power units had overheated. The crew then switched to a backup controller to allow the 
overheated unit to cool before shutting down each unit as planned.630 
 
5 December 
A modified L-1011 jetliner flying at 40,000 feet (12,000 meters) dropped a Pegasus XL rocket 
carrying the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS), designed to study the formation 
of stars and planets. The launch marked the beginning of a two-year, US$64 million mission to 
learn more about the “composition of interstellar clouds and monitor how they cool as they 
collapse to form stars and planets.” The 397-pound (179-kilogram) SWAS would study water, 
molecular oxygen, atomic carbon, and isotopic carbon monoxide, by means of submillimeter 
wave radiation, which scientists cannot observe from the ground. NASA’s GSFC managed the 
mission.631 
 
6 December 
Using precision flying, Space Shuttle Endeavour’s robotic arm, cameras, and a computerized 
vision system, the U.S.-Russian crew of Endeavour successfully joined the U.S. module Unity to 
the Russian module Zarya. With a weight of 21 tons (19,100 kilograms or 19.1 tonnes), Zarya 
was the “most massive object” that the robotic arm had ever lifted. Because Unity blocked the 
astronauts’ view from the Shuttle’s window, they relied on a system of cameras, as well as on the 
new Canadian Space Vision System, to provide visual cues concerning the two units’ exact 
positions.632 
 
At an American Geophysical Union meeting, a team of research scientists led by David E. Smith 
of GSFC discussed new research findings based on data collected in the spring and summer by 
the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). The data indicated that the ice cap on Mars’s north 
pole, although definitely water ice, is much smaller than previously thought. The scientists 
concluded that the amount of water in the ice cap is not voluminous enough to have created the 
“deep gullies that scar the surface of the planet,” nor could it have filled an ancient ocean. 
MOLA images showed the ice cap resting in a deep basin, possibly created by an asteroid 
impact. Scientists described this formation as unique in the solar system. The team of researchers 
remarked that their findings raised more questions about Mars’s formation and conditions than 
they answered.633

7 December 
Astronauts Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman undertook a 4½-hour-long spacewalk, to install 
40 electrical and data connectors linking the U.S.-built connecting module Unity with the 
Russian-built power module Zarya. The pair also bolted handrails to the side of Unity and 
photographed two of Zarya’s backup docking antennas, which had failed to deploy. Russian 
ground controllers sent commands to power up Zarya, jump-starting Unity’s electrical systems. 
Ross and Newman then removed thermal covers from Unity’s outside computers to prevent 
overheating.634 
 
8 December 
Intel Corporation agreed to grant NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, Sandia National 
Laboratory, and the U.S. Armed Forces a royalty-free license to adapt the Pentium chip to 
withstand extreme radiation, so that other agencies could use it in spacecraft and military 
equipment.635 
 
9 December 
Astronauts Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman undertook their second spacewalk, lasting 7 
hours, to install two 100-pound (45.4-kilogram) communications antennas on each side of the 
Unity module. They hooked one of the antennas to a video cable running from the Zarya module. 
Then the two astronauts erected a folding sunshade over a computer outside of Unity, bundling 
loose cables that ran along the exterior of the module. Ross and Newman also removed the 
restraints that had stabilized the four Unity hatchways during the launch. Finally, Newman 
successfully tapped free one of Zarya’s stuck antennas, using a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long), 
extendable grappling hook.636 
 
11 December 
Endeavour’s Commander Robert D. Cabana and Russian cosmonaut Sergei K. Krikalev, leading 
the four other crew members, entered the Unity module for the first time, via an airlock attached 
to the Shuttle. The crew checked air pressure and quality, turned on lights and systems, detached 
components that were stored in the modules, and set up a communications system, connecting 
internal components with the two antennas outside Unity. Astronauts Jerry L. Ross and James H. 
Newman had installed the two antennas on 9 December. The Shuttle crew spent 28 hours inside 
the modules before turning off the lights and closing the station.637 
 
After a one-day delay to correct a software problem, Mars Climate Orbiter launched from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, atop a Delta II rocket. NASA had scheduled the 1,400-pound (635-kilogram) 
robotic craft, paired with Mars Polar Lander, to launch on 3 January 1999. Mars Climate Orbiter 
and Mars Polar Lander, the second pair headed to study Mars following Mars Pathfinder and 
Mars Global Surveyor, were part of NASA’s “long-term strategy for Mars exploration,” calling 
for small robotic craft “to leave Earth two at a time,” about every two years. According to

NASA’s plan, Climate Orbiter’s first task would be to provide a two-way communications relay 
between ground controllers and Polar Lander after Lander’s arrival and during its planned 60–90 
day mission. Thereafter, Orbiter would generate weather maps and profile the Martian 
atmosphere for a full Martian year, or 687 days.638 
 
12 December 
Jerry L. Ross and James H. Newman made their final spacewalk to free the second Russian 
docking antenna on Zarya, which had failed to unfurl. The pair also finished outfitting the 
station. The astronauts had required a total of 21 hours over three spacewalks to complete the 
work.639 
 
15 December 
Ending one of NASA’s “most successful and historic missions” with a rare night landing, Space 
Shuttle Endeavour landed at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, after its weeklong linkup with the 
new ISS. Before departing the ISS on 13 December, Pilot Frederick W. “Rick” Sturckow flew 
around the station slowly, while the crew photographed the ISS, permitting ground controllers to 
see the station for the first time. NASA’s Deputy Station Chief Frank L. Culbertson Jr. remarked 
that the mission was as historically significant as that of Apollo 8, the first piloted mission to the 
Moon, and that the hardware of ISS was the foundation of “what will put humanity in space 
forever.”640 
 
17 December 
NASA’s tailless, single-engine, 18-foot-long (5.5-meter-long) X-36 airplane resumed flight-
testing a system to help a damaged airplane continue its flight. Over a 20-minute period, a pilot 
used remote control from the ground to fly the plane, sending signals to simulate damage. The 
first in a series of five to 10 flights, the test was part of Reconfigurable Control for Tailless 
Fighter Aircraft (RESTORE). RESTORE was testing neural-network software that permitted a 
plane to reconfigure flight-control surfaces automatically. The software would have both civil 
and military applications.641 
 
18 December 
KSC officials broke ground on a complex for testing a NASA experimental rocket, the X-34. 
Engineers had designed the vehicle⎯a small, winged rocket⎯to launch into orbit from an 
airplane and to return to Earth, landing like an airplane. Planning flight tests to begin in 2000, 
KSC hoped the new facility would attract commercial space enterprises, such as Lockheed’s 
VentureStarTM, still under development. Facilities anywhere in the country would be able to

launch the VentureStarTM, once completed, because it would not use boosters or fuel tanks and, 
therefore, would not require a coastal launch site.642 
 
21 December 
NASA announced it had renamed the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory, in honor of the late Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. NASA chose 
the name Chandra because it was the late scientist’s preferred name among friends and 
colleagues, and because it means moon or luminous in Sanskrit. NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin commented that Chandrasekhar had made “fundamental contributions to the theory of 
black holes and other phenomena,” which the Chandra X-ray Observatory would study. NASA 
also announced that it had set a new launch date for the observatory⎯no earlier than 8 April 
1999.643 
 
29 December 
NASA announced that Colorado State University would lead a US$145 million study of clouds, 
to better understand global warming and to “dramatically improve” weather forecasts. The five-
year project would use a satellite named CloudSat to capture three-dimensional global images of 
clouds.644 
 
JANUARY 1999 
3 January 
NASA launched Mars Polar Lander from Cape Canaveral, Florida, atop a Boeing Delta II rocket, 
three weeks after the launch of its companion craft, Mars Climate Orbiter. The craft’s main 
purpose was to search Mars for signs of water. Lander carried machinery and two microprobes, 
as well as a microphone to record the sounds of Martian wind. Mars Polar Lander and Mars 
Climate Orbiter formed a pair, the second launched in a 12-year series of dual missions to 
explore Mars, with the ultimate goal of collecting a sample of Martian soil to bring to Earth by 
2008.645 
 
6 January 
An independent study group commissioned by the U.S. Air Force announced the findings of its 
investigation into the loss of business at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Retired 
U.S. Air Force General Richard C. Henry had headed the group, comprising 11 government 
agencies and 19 aerospace firms. After surveying commercial launch companies and satellite 
manufacturers, the group had measured the cost and ease of doing business at Cape Canaveral 
against three prime competitors: the European Space Agency’s Kourou Space Center in French 
Guiana, South America; Kazakhstan’s Baikonur Cosmodrome, primarily used by Russia; and 
China’s Xichang Space Center. General Richard Henry summarized the crux of the group’s 
findings: “companies regard Canaveral as superb in location and facilities, but rank it second

primarily because of the perception that the commercial customer is second to the government 
customer.” Companies had sought launch services elsewhere to avoid the bureaucratic red tape 
associated with Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, operated by the U.S. Air Force. With 
increasing demand, spaceports in South America, Russia, and China had been doing more 
business during the previous two decades, at Florida’s expense. The group issued three 
recommendations to correct the situation and to attract business to Florida: 1) boost the number 
of launches staged from Cape Canaveral, 2) shift to customer-friendly operations, and 3) 
modernize launch-support systems at the spaceport, many of which the United States had first 
implemented in the late 1950s and early 1960s.646 
 
7 January 
NASA Inspector General Roberta L. Gross released a report estimating that NASA had “spent 
[US]$3 million in ‘excessive costs’” on its Houston-to-Moscow air-charter program. The 
investigators criticized the program, saying it was more expensive than commercial travel. An 
investigation had revealed that the flights, which typically used Boeing 727s seating 143 
travelers, sometimes carried as few as nine people. The charter flights originated in Houston and 
usually stopped in Huntsville, Alabama, and Washington, DC, before continuing on to Moscow. 
A few weeks before the release of the report, NASA’s Office of Space Flight had rejected a 
recommendation from the Inspector General to terminate the service, arguing that the program 
“provided ‘tangible and intangible’ benefits to workers on the International Space Station [ISS].” 
NASA had developed the program as a cost-saving measure and as an alternative to contracting 
with the U.S. Department of Defense to transport employees involved with the multibillion-
dollar space station program. The Inspector General found that the chartered flights averaged 
around 50 people; NASA had estimated a 90-passenger threshold for the program to realize 
savings. In response to the demand of U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs 
Chairperson Fred Thompson (R-TN) that NASA “halt this waste immediately,” Administrator 
Daniel S. Goldin announced that NASA would terminate the program “as soon as practical.”647 
 
11 January 
Mario Dario Grossi, radio physicist and engineer, died at the age of 74 in Boston, Massachusetts. 
Grossi developed the concept of tethered satellites and the hardware to make them possible. 
Together with a colleague, Grossi had conducted most of his work at the Harvard-Smithsonian 
Center for Astrophysics. Grossi had first approached NASA with his concept in 1972, and in 
1982 NASA had issued a contract to build a system. In July 1992, NASA had tested the tether in 
space when astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-46 “reeled out a half-ton [450-
kilogram or 0.45-tonne] satellite of the Italian Space Agency dangling on a spaghetti-thin cord 
12 miles [19 kilometers] long.” The successful test had provided data that would assist engineers 
in applying the tether satellite technology to build space stations or in “operating instrument-
laden satellites far from the [S]huttle.”648 
 
12 January 
The National Research Council Committee on Space Shuttle Upgrades released a report 
cautioning NASA “not to wait too long to choose between keeping the Shuttle until 2020 or

scrapping it after 2012 in favor of a new vehicle like Lockheed Martin’s proposed VentureStar.” 
The committee, led by former astronaut and former head of the Space Shuttle Program Bryan D. 
O’Connor, advised NASA to make a timely decision to either phase out the Shuttle upgrade 
program or make the major investments necessary for the Shuttle to carry out reliably its long-
term mission. The panel specifically addressed the Liquid Fly Back Booster (LFBB), the most 
expensive Shuttle upgrade under consideration, with development costs estimated at between 
US$2 billion and US$7 billion. The panel’s report revealed that NASA had not investigated 
enough alternatives to the LFBB to ensure that it was “the most appropriate way to meet the 
needs of the Shuttle and other programs.”649 
 
13 January 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) announced that the plutonium-powered Cassini 
spacecraft, en route to Saturn, had entered safe mode on 11 January. The craft, NASA’s largest 
and most complex interplanetary probe, had detected a possible error in its orientation, which 
prompted it to halt all “non-critical” activity, while maintaining its communications link with 
Earth.650 
 
JPL appointed Glenn E. Cunningham, Manager of NASA’s Mars Surveyor Operations Project, 
as the new Deputy Director of JPL’s Mars Exploration Directorate. In the newly created position, 
JPL tasked Cunningham with overseeing the implementation and operations of all Mars missions 
through 2013. As Cunningham’s successor, JPL appointed Richard A. Cook, former Flight 
Operations Manager for the 1997 Mars Pathfinder Lander and Rover Mission, to manage the 
Mars Surveyor Operations Project.651 
 
15 January 
At a Boeing Company awards ceremony, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and U. S. 
Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) recognized “members of the Delta launch team who 
were instrumental in sending NASA spacecraft to Mars,” awarding Jay L. Witzling, Vice 
President of Delta Programs, with NASA’s Public Service Medal. Other critical leaders in the 
program also received awards for their dedication and participation. In his remarks, Goldin 
commented on the characteristics that made Boeing’s Delta rocket “more and more the launch 
vehicle of choice.” Goldin explained that the Delta rocket was the least expensive launch vehicle, 
had the fastest turnaround, and had demonstrated the highest degree of reliability. Goldin also 
commented that the four launches to Mars aboard Delta rockets had “changed the face of the 
space program.”652 
 
NASA announced that NASA scientists and other weather researchers had “gained intriguing 
new information about upper-level winds that drive hurricanes and about the storms’ devastating 
impact as they collide with mountains.” The research findings were the result of a seven-week 
study conducted by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and several

universities during the previous summer, as part of the Third Convection and Moisture 
Experiment (CAMEX-3). The study’s purpose was to gauge the strength of Atlantic hurricane 
winds and rainfall. CAMEX-3 researchers had used data collected with special laser instruments 
aboard NASA’s DC-8 aircraft, which flew through hurricanes Bonnie, Danielle, Earl, and 
Georges; data collected from NASA’s ER-2 high-altitude aircraft, which flew above the 
hurricanes to collect “first-of its-kind data”; and data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring 
Mission satellite. Edward J. Zipser of Texas A&M University remarked, “the multi-aircraft 
datasets obtained by NASA aircraft in these hurricanes are unprecedented in their 
comprehensiveness.”653 
 
22 January 
After having agreed in June 1998 to abandon the space station within a year, Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov issued a decree to keep Mir in space for three more years, using 
private funds, so that Russia could dedicate its insufficient space budget to its ISS commitments. 
The decree reportedly mentioned that Russian and foreign contractors and investors would 
develop a plan allowing Mir to remain in orbit without using ISS-allocated funds.654 
 
23 January 
Astronomers captured for the first time optical images of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) as it was 
occurring. Detectors of the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on NASA’s 
orbiting Compton Gamma Ray Observatory detected the GRB as it began and radioed its 
position to the Gamma Ray Burst Coordinates Network (GCN) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight 
Center (GSFC).  GSFC immediately forwarded the position to astronomers around the world. In 
response to this signal, the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) team in Los 
Alamos, New Mexico, photographed the patch of sky where the GRB was occurring. Using 
precise information from instruments aboard the Italian-Dutch BeppoSAX satellite, the ROTSE 
team was able to locate the GRB within the images they had captured. Astronomer Scott D. 
Barthelmy of GSFC remarked that capturing a burst as it unfolded was the “holy grail” of GCN, 
and that, previously, optical telescopes had only seen the afterglow of a burst, never the burst 
itself.655  
 
25 January 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named Lori B. Garver as Associate Administrator for 
NASA’s Office of Policy and Plans, effective immediately. Garver had served as Acting 
Associate Administrator since September 1998. She had begun working for NASA in 1996 as 
Special Assistant to the Administrator. Before joining NASA, she had been Executive Director 
of the National Space Society, since 1987, and a president of Women in Aerospace. Goldin 
remarked that Garver’s experience inside and outside NASA had “proven invaluable,” and that 
she had demonstrated the management skills and policy leadership that her new position 
required.656

26 January 
NASA announced that it had selected, from among 35 proposals, five candidates for 
participation in its Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) program. Each of the candidates received 
US$350,000 to conduct a four-month implementation feasibility study. NASA planned to study 
these proposals rigorously over the following five months, before choosing the two MIDEX 
program participants. The five proposals selected for further study were 1) the Swift Gamma Ray 
Burst Explorer, a three-telescope space observatory for studying the position, brightness, and 
physical properties of GRBs; 2) the NGSS or Next Generation Sky Survey, a four-channel, 
supercooled, infrared telescope designed to survey the entire sky with 1,000 times more 
sensitivity than previous missions; 3) FAME, the Full-Sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer, a 
space telescope designed to obtain highly precise position and brightness measurements of 40 
million stars; 4) the AMM or Auroral Multiscale MIDEX Mission, a formation of four 
identically instrumented small satellites in a near-polar, highly elliptical orbit; and 5) ASCE, 
Advanced Solar Coronal Explorer, a powerful solar telescope, which would reveal the physical 
processes in the Sun that lead to the solar wind and explosive coronal mass ejections. NASA had 
also selected instruments from two proposed MIDEX missions for technology-development 
funding. NASA awarded US$700,000 each to Richard E. Rothschild of the University of 
California at San Diego, to develop an x-ray detector for studying black holes of all sizes, and to 
Gary R. Swenson of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to develop detectors for 
studying waves in Earth’s upper atmosphere.657 
 
FEBRUARY 1999 
2 February 
McDermott International Inc., a worldwide energy services company, announced the election to 
its board of directors of Kathryn D. Sullivan, President and CEO of the Ohio Center for Science 
and Industry since 1996. Before serving in that position, Sullivan had been a chief scientist at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and before that, she had been an astronaut 
and mission specialist at NASA. In 1978 NASA had selected Sullivan as a mission specialist for 
the first class of Space Shuttle astronauts. In 1984, while serving on a mission aboard Space 
Shuttle Challenger, she had become the first American woman to walk in space. Sullivan had 
also flown aboard Space Shuttle Discovery on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) deployment 
mission in 1990 and aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis with the ATLAS-1 Spacelab flight in 1992.658 
 
4 February 
The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, established by Congress after the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire 
on 27 January 1967, submitted its annual report to NASA. The panel found Shuttle safety 
satisfactory, but cautioned that cutbacks, such as hiring freezes and budgetary restrictions, had 
created a “looming crisis” of future shortfalls in the workforce. The panel warned that NASA 
was at risk of “losing the core competencies needed to conduct the nation’s spaceflight and 
aerospace programs in a safe and effective manner.” Budgetary constraints had also caused 
NASA to postpone planned improvements to the Shuttle fleet and the International Space Station 
(ISS). The panel’s chairperson remarked that both programs were operating at an “acceptable

level of risk,” but that updating Shuttle computers and refurbishing the supply of spare parts 
would make the programs safer.659 
 
NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor successfully completed the aerobraking phase of its mission, 
raising its orbit completely out of the Martian atmosphere and preparing the craft to begin its 
primary mapping mission. Glenn E. Cunningham, Deputy Director of the Mars Exploration 
Program at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), described the Mars spacecraft’s 
“pioneering operation” of aerobraking as a long and arduous task, which had become a valuable 
learning experience for all involved—engineers and scientists alike. The technique required the 
spacecraft to use frictional drag “as it skim[med] through the planet’s thin atmosphere,” altering 
the shape of the craft’s orbit and providing an innovative method to change the orbit using less 
on-board fuel. NASA had first tested aerobraking in 1994, during the final days of the Magellan 
mission to Venus. A structural problem with Mars Global Surveyor’s solar panel had delayed the 
final burn of aerobraking by approximately one year, so that the flight team could ensure that the 
process would not overstress the weakened panel. The extended aerobraking phase had enabled 
Global Surveyor to acquire bonus science data, yielding “some spectacular new findings about 
Mars,” such as a “profile of the planet’s northern polar cap and information about the unique 
nature of its remnant magnetic fields.”660 
 
5 February 
An international team of scientists published findings based on research using data from NASA’s 
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. The team had sought to locate the origin 
of solar wind, which interacts with Earth’s magnetic field, creating auroral displays like the 
Northern Lights, as well as disrupting satellites and communications equipment. The SOHO 
team believed that the solar wind originated from honeycomb-shaped areas called convection 
cells, located beneath the coronal holes. Using data from the spectrometer, the scientists had 
measured for the first time the structure and motion of gases inside the coronal holes. The team 
reported that, in some places above coronal holes, magnetic field lines do not loop back to the 
Sun’s surface, but rather, the magnetic lines shoot upward without returning to the Sun, thereby 
originating the solar wind.661 
 
The Russian Space Agency’s “space mirror” failed to unfurl properly at the Mir space station, 
and Russia officially terminated the experiment. Crew attached the mirror to a cargo spacecraft 
filled with trash, sending it to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. Engineers had intended the 83-foot 
(25-meter) mirror to “work like an artificial [M]oon,” acting as a prototype for larger mirrors that 
“could illuminate [S]un-starved northern cities through the long Arctic nights and spotlight 
disaster areas.” The experiment’s failure was a “big disappointment” for the Russian Space 
Agency, which had hoped to display “its ability to conduct pioneering, ambitious projects despite 
a lack of funds.”662

After a one-day delay, a Delta II rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying the 
US$128 million Stardust spacecraft. Stardust launched on a mission described as NASA’s first 
attempt to “return to Earth solid extraterrestrial material from beyond our [M]oon’s orbit.” 
Astronomers expected that, after traveling for about five years, the craft would rendezvous with a 
medium-sized comet. A device aboard the Stardust would collect tiny particles from the comet 
before returning to Earth on 15 January 2006.663 
 
8 February 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named Kevin L. Petersen, who had been serving in an 
acting capacity since August 1998, as Director of NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center 
(DFRC) in Edwards, California. Petersen had joined Dryden as an aerospace engineer in 1974 
and had worked on flight-research projects, including the F-8 Digital Fly-by-Wire, the HiMAT 
(the Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology), and the X-29 forward-swept wing projects. He 
had served as Chief of the Vehicle Technology Branch, Chief of the National Aerospace Plane 
Projects Office, and, since January 1996, as DFRC’s Deputy Director.664 
 
NASA released findings from its Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft’s flyby of 
asteroid 433, known as Eros. The flyby had occurred on 23 December 1998. The NEAR 
spacecraft’s instruments had collected data revealing that the asteroid was slightly smaller than 
previously thought, with at least two medium-sized craters and a density comparable to that of 
the Earth’s crust.665

An Israeli court indicted Israeli teenager Ehud Tenenbaum and four accomplices⎯Guy Fleisher, 
Ariel Rosenfeld, Barak Abutbul, and Rafael Ohana⎯for illegal entry of computers in the United 
States and Israel. The group allegedly hacked into the computer systems of the Pentagon and 
NASA, as well as those of academic institutions in Israel and Israel’s Knesset.666 
 
NASA released images taken with cameras aboard the HST, revealing the infancy of planets. 
NASA described the images as a “glimpse of what our solar system looked like 4.5 billion years 
ago when the Earth and other planets began to condense.” The images did not show actual 
planets, but rather the discs of dust that surround young stars. The HST images of six young 
stars, located 450 light-years away in the constellation Taurus, showed important details never 
before revealed in infrared or radio observations, such as the size, shape, thickness, and 
orientation of the discs.667 
 
NASA announced the selection of Italian astronaut Umberto Guidoni to fly aboard Shuttle 
Mission STS-102. Guidoni was the first astronaut named to Mission STS-102 and the first 
European astronaut selected for an ISS mission. The primary purpose of STS-102 would be to

the ISS. The Italian Space Agency and NASA had constructed Leonardo under a bilateral 
agreement that included a flight opportunity for an Italian astronaut. Before his assignment on 
STS-102, Guidoni had flown in 1996 as a payload specialist aboard Mission STS-75. That 16-
day mission had included working with the U. S. Microgravity Payload and testing the NASA-
Italian Space Agency Tethered Satellite System.668 
 
11 February 
NASA announced its selection of a team of industry partners to develop a “highway in the sky 
system,” allowing the average person to travel in small, easy-to-fly, personal aircraft at four 
times the speed of a car. NASA selected Avidyne Corporation of Lexington, Massachusetts; 
AvroTec Inc. of Portland, Oregon; Lancair of Redmond, Oregon; Raytheon Aircraft of Wichita, 
Kansas; Rockwell Collins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Seagull Technologies of Los Gatos, 
California; and Allied Signal of Olathe, Kansas, as the industry partners. NASA tasked the team 
with completing hardware and software development of an entirely new concept for a cockpit 
display system, intended to guide the pilot to a preprogrammed destination.669 
 
12 February 
NASA officials announced that the Galileo spacecraft was operating normally again after 
entering safe mode on 31 January. Galileo’s computer had become confused while flying past 
Jupiter’s moon Europa. David A. Senske, a member of the Galileo imaging team at NASA’s 
JPL, explained that the unusual angle Galileo required for studying Europa had caused the 
computer to malfunction.670

Scientists studying images obtained by NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor published two reports in 
the journal Nature about Martian volcanic activity. One study reported that the images contained 
evidence that “ten times more lava” than previously thought had erupted onto Mars’s surface. 
The other study suggested that at least one of Mars’s volcanoes was still active.671

Boeing launched a Delta II rocket from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base, carrying the 
first science satellites from Denmark and South Africa and the U.S. Air Force’s Advanced 
Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS). The Air Force intended the Boeing-built 
ARGOS to spend three years in space, “collecting data on the Earth’s global environment and 
performing technology demonstrations for top-priority military space programs,” as well as 
testing advanced space technologies for use on the ISS. The launches of Denmark’s Orsted and 
South Africa’s SUNSAT (Stellenbosch University, South Africa, satellite) were critical 
milestones for both countries’ space programs. SUNSAT carried remote-sensing experiments to 
produce images from space at lower cost than larger systems, and Denmark deployed Orsted to 
study Earth’s magnetic fields and electrical properties.673 
 
25 February 
The Russian Space Agency signed a cooperative agreement with Russian arms exporter 
Rosvooruzheniye, “intended to raise Russia’s earnings on the world market and help it develop 
space hardware.” Russia had earned only US$800 million, compared to the United States’ 
US$50 billion, in commercial satellite launches during 1998. Rosvooruzheniye hoped the deal 
would help Russia break into the international space markets.674 
 
26 February 
A European Ariane 4 rocket launched, carrying two communication satellites from French 
Guiana. The rocket placed into orbit an Arabsat 3A satellite, providing television broadcasting 
and telephone communications to the Middle East, North Africa, and Southern Europe, as well 
as the Skynet 4E satellite, a British armed forces strategic and tactical communications satellite. 
Both craft would move into geostationary orbits.675 
 
MARCH 1999 
1 March 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin officially announced the change of the name of Lewis 
Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, to “John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field.” George 
W. Lewis had been the research director for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 
(NACA), NASA’s predecessor agency, which built the research facility in 1941. Shortly after 
Lewis’s death in 1948, NACA had named the facility “Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory” to 
commemorate him. NASA had modified its name to “Lewis Research Center” in 1958, when the 
facility became part of the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration. U.S. 
Senator R. Michael DeWine (R-OH) had proposed the most recent name change for the facility 
in the FY 1999 appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban 
Development, and Independent Agencies. Congress had enacted the bill into law on 21 October 
1998 (Pub. L. No. 105-276). Goldin remarked that naming the Center for both George W. Lewis 
and John H. Glenn Jr. was an appropriate tribute to “two of Ohio’s famous names⎯one an 
aeronautic researcher and the other an astronaut legend and lawmaker.”676

Medialink Worldwide Inc., a New York–based company specializing in audio-video production 
and satellite-distribution services, announced it had signed a contract with the European Space 
Agency (ESA) to help the agency broadcast its news worldwide, via television. The two-year 
contract required Medialink to “establish and improve the space organization’s relations with 
broadcast media across Europe,” as well as to produce video news releases and other products 
“intended to raise the profile of the multinational agency.”677 
 
4 March 
The Federal Laboratory Consortium appointed Donald J. Campbell, Director of Glenn Research 
Center (GRC), as the 1998 Laboratory Director of the Year for Technology Transfer. The 
Consortium honored Campbell, NASA’s first African American center director, for his 
“exemplary contributions to the overall enhancement of technology transfer for economic 
development.” Industries had created at least 20 new products from GRC-developed 
technologies in the previous five years. Campbell had also led the Center in establishing the 
Lewis Incubator for Technology, to help entrepreneurs and start-up companies commercialize 
NASA-developed technologies, as well as the Garrett Morgan Commercialization Initiative, to 
help small businesses in Ohio and the Great Lakes region use NASA technologies to become 
more competitive.678 
 
NASA launched its Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) aboard the three-stage Pegasus-XL 
rocket. Orbital Sciences Corporation’s L-1011 jet carried the rocket to an altitude of 40,000 feet 
(12,200 meters) before releasing it. Shortly after WIRE’s release into orbit, it encountered 
difficulties maintaining its stability, and NASA immediately began to investigate the 
malfunction. The satellite’s scientific instrument was a “cryogenically cooled telescope designed 
to shed light on the history of star formation in the universe,” as part of NASA’s Origins 
program. The 12.5-inch-aperture (31.8-centimeter-aperture) telescope aboard WIRE had no 
moving parts and was enclosed in a cooling system to keep its mirrors below -436°F (-260°C), to 
prevent its own heat emission from overwhelming the light it would detect from space.679 
 
5 March 
The NASA WIRE team declared a spacecraft emergency, as ground controllers worked to 
recover the spacecraft. The satellite continued to spin, instead of maintaining a stable position in 
orbit, and had a higher temperature than expected. NASA formed a spacecraft-recovery team 
headed by David F. Everett of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), as well as an 
anomaly-investigation board.680

NASA announced the end of the scientific mission of its WIRE satellite, after the craft released 
into space its entire supply of frozen hydrogen, a critical element of the mission. Preliminary 
reports indicated that the satellite had released the primary telescope cover three days earlier than 
planned, exposing the telescope’s cryostat to sunlight. The sunlight had warmed the frozen 
hydrogen in the cryostat, which was supposed to maintain the telescope’s temperature, causing 
the hydrogen to vent into space at a much higher rate than planned. Ground controllers believed 
the fast venting of the hydrogen had caused the satellite to spin, but they did not yet know what 
had caused the release of the telescope cover.681 
 
9 March 
At a briefing at NASA Headquarters, scientists explained how sigmoids⎯fiery S-shapes on the 
Sun’s surface⎯would help them “predict when potentially dangerous and disruptive blasts of 
electrically charged gas will come hurtling toward Earth.” These solar explosions, or coronal 
mass ejections (CMEs), have the power to disable power grids, damage satellites, and scramble 
communications networks. Previously, scientists could detect solar explosions once they had 
occurred, providing two or three days for Earth to prepare for potential problems, but they were 
unable to predict the CMEs. With the Japanese Yohkoh spacecraft’s discovery of sigmoids, 
scientists would be able to issue a warning five or six days in advance of a solar explosion. Sarah 
E. Gibson of Cambridge University in England described the sigmoids as slinky-like structures, 
related to the Sun’s underlying magnetic field. Alphonse Sterling of the Institute of Space and 
Astronautical Science of Japan likened the structures to “loaded guns,” with a high probability of 
discharging. Scientists explained further that “not every CME is presaged by a sigmoid, but most 
sigmoids signal very large CMEs.” The Yohkoh images showed that the sigmoid’s S-shape is the 
precursor to a CME, confirmed by the appearance of an arch shape following the blast.682 
 
Joseph G. Beerer of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory stated that all of the instruments aboard 
Mars Global Surveyor were operating, and that the craft had begun mapping Mars, 
approximately one year later than originally planned. NASA had launched the craft in November 
1996, and Surveyor had entered orbit around Mars in September 1997. NASA had delayed the 
mapping portion of the mission when scientists detected a structural problem with one of the 
craft’s solar panels. To avoid placing excessive stress on the panel, the flight team had opted to 
proceed cautiously in aerobraking. Aerobraking, a pioneering operation, was necessary to 
position the spacecraft for its Mars mapping mission.683

NASA selected winners of its Government Inventor of the Year and Commercial Invention of

Branch at GSFC, won the Government Inventor of the Year Award for his Apparatus for 
Providing Torque and for Storing Momentum Energy. Clagett had developed the apparatus, 
known more commonly as the SMEX Reaction/Momentum Wheel, for NASA’s Small Explorer 
program. NASA had used the apparatus successfully in the Transition Region and Coronal 
Explorer and the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite. Paul M. Hergenrother, Joseph G.

PETI-5, which is a type of glue that holds fibers together. The Langley team had developed 
PETI-5 as an adhesive for use in various aerospace and commercial applications. Used in high-
speed, high-temperature aircraft, PETI-5 had netted US$10 million in sales since becoming 
commercially available.684

After assessing its safety aspects, officials from the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) 
commercial space office approved the first space launch from a platform in the sea. The FAA 
issued the launch license to an international launch consortium known as Sea Launch. The 
Boeing Company, based in the United States, was a 40 percent partner in the consortium. The 
Sea Launch Company planned a demonstration launch for 27 March 1999, from a converted, 
self-propelled, oil-drilling platform in the Pacific Ocean. The consortium’s initiative, to launch 
communications satellites from a mid-ocean location at the equator, offered several advantages, 
such as the capability to lift heavier-than-normal payloads.685 
 
26 March 
Lockheed Martin and its Russian business partners announced the appointment of Wilbur C. 
Trafton as President of International Launch Services (ILS); Trafton had been Acting President 
since the previous December. Lockheed Martin, Russia’s Khrunichev State Research and 
Production Space Center, and S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia had 
established ILS in 1995, as a joint venture to market commercial launch services on Russian 
Proton rockets and Lockheed Martin Atlas rockets. Before joining ILS, Trafton had been 
Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of Space Flight. In that position, he had headed 
NASA’s Human Exploration and Development of Space Enterprise. Ray Colloday, President of 
Lockheed Martin Astronautics, remarked that Trafton had brought to ILS “years of experience 
working on joint space programs with Russia.” Colladay said that Trafton’s background, together 
with his knowledge of the Atlas product line, made him “particularly well suited to lead ILS.”686 
 
Researchers reported in the journal Science that NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had detected 
hydrogen peroxide on Jupiter’s moon Europa. Hydrogen peroxide does not occur naturally on 
Earth. A scientific instrument aboard the craft⎯the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer 
(NIMS)⎯had aided scientists in their study of Europa’s surface. Working like a prism, the 
instrument had broken up infrared light, detecting dark areas of hydrogen peroxide. The 
scientists reported that the chemical was forming constantly on Europa, through the process of 
radiolysis; in this case, the process involved “intense particle radiation” emanating from Jupiter. 
Principal Investigator for NIMS Robert W. Carlson explained that hydrogen peroxide begins 
breaking down almost as soon as it forms and, therefore, its life on Europa spans no more than a

few months. The short lifespan of the chemical limited the scientists’ ability to study the long-
term chemical history of Europa. However, scientists would be able to apply their observations 
of short-term chemical changes on Jupiter to the study of how the moons of Jupiter interact with 
the planet, as well as to the study of similar processes elsewhere in the solar system.687 
 
29 March 
A dummy satellite reached its orbit, 23,000 miles (37,000 kilometers) above Earth, signaling an 
important success for the Sea Launch Company. The international consortium, which had 
invested US$500 million to develop the first commercial, marine-based launch system, launched 
the dummy satellite from the Odyssey, a converted oil rig located 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) 
south of Hawaii. A Zenit-3SL rocket, built jointly by Ukraine and Russia, carried the satellite 
aloft. One hour after launch, the satellite separated from the third stage of the rocket at an 
altitude of 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers), to continue to its ultimate position.688 
 
31 March 
The ESA signed a 60 million Euro contract with Matra Marconi Space, to design and build the 
Mars Express spacecraft, with a planned launch date of June 2003. The agency chose that target 
date because the planets would be in optimal alignment, allowing for minimum travel time to 
Mars with maximum payload capacity. Major space missions can require upwards of 11 years 
from concept to launch, and only six years remained before the 2003 date, so the ESA selected a 
contractor with the means to develop missions quickly and inexpensively. Matra Marconi 
demonstrated that it would be able to streamline the development of Mars Express, building and 
launching the mission for about half the budget required for similar efforts.689

5 April 
Advanced Communication Systems Inc. announced that the Naval Air Systems Command had 
awarded its Aerospace Division a five-year contract with option years. The Naval Air Systems 
Command intended the US$46 million Aircraft Structural Life Surveillance contract to assist the 
U.S. Navy in developing, verifying, executing, and enhancing methods and processes for 
monitoring aircraft structural fatigue. Advanced Communication’s Aerospace Division Vice 
President Thomas M. Brennan remarked that the contract covered air vehicle technology that 
would “have application across all military services, as well as NASA and the FAA [Federal 
Aviation Administration].”690 
 
6 April 
NASA appointed Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas W. Holloway as Manager of the 
International Space Station (ISS) Program, effective 19 April. Holloway replaced Randolph H.

Brinkley, who departed NASA for the private sector. NASA named Ronald D. Dittemore to 
replace Holloway as Manager of the Space Shuttle Program. Holloway had begun his NASA 
career in 1963, working in the Mission Control Center, where he planned activities for Gemini 
and Apollo flights. He had served as a flight director in Mission Control early in the Space 
Shuttle Program, becoming Chief of the Flight Director Office in 1985. In the 1990s, he had 
served as Deputy Manager for Program Integration with the Space Shuttle Program, followed by 
an appointment as Director of the Phase I Program of Shuttle–Mir dockings. Holloway had 
begun managing the Space Shuttle Program in 1995.691 
 
8 April 
NASA announced the departure of Gretchen W. McClain, a senior space station official at 
NASA Headquarters, naming as her replacement in an acting capacity, W. Michael Hawes, 
NASA’s Chief Engineer for the ISS. In 1997 NASA had appointed McClain as Deputy Associate 
Administrator for Space Development (Space Station). In that position, she was responsible for 
directing the space station budget, establishing and implementing station policy, coordinating 
external communications, and undertaking liaison activities with the executive branch, Congress, 
industry, and international partners. McClain left NASA to return to private industry.692 
 
10 April 
U.S. Air Force officials announced that, despite initial media reports of a successful launch, the 
previous day’s launch of the USA 142 aboard a Titan IVB rocket had failed. The USA 142, also 
called the DSP 19, an American geosynchronous military satellite, had launched from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida. The failed launch had placed the Defense Support Program satellite in a 
useless orbit after an attached rocket engine failed. This was the first launch attempt since the 
explosion of a Titan IVA in August 1998. Engineers had designed the Titan IVB, an improved 
version of the Titan IV, to survive the electrical malfunction that had led to its predecessor’s 
demise. Because of a policy of secrecy concerning military spy satellites, the U.S. Air Force had 
delayed informing its public affairs office about the launch failure. Although senior Air Force 
officials knew of the loss of the satellite, they were unable to make the event public until they 
were certain that the failure had not entailed the release of classified information. The Air Force 
had designed the satellite, a highly sensitive, 2-ton (1,800-kilogram or 1.8-tonne), infrared 
telescope, to detect missile launches and nuclear detonations.693

Celebrating the anniversary of the flight of Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961, Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin presented state medals to several dozen cosmonauts and space officials during a 
Cosmonaut’s Day ceremony. Yeltsin briefly praised Mir’s achievements in his remarks at the 
Kremlin, but when Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev presented him 
with a model of the new ISS, Yeltsin asked Koptev whether Mir would stay aloft. Koptev

responded in the affirmative, but explained during a press conference afterward that private 
investors had not yet produced funds for Mir’s continued operation. Vitaly I. Sevastyanov, a 
lawmaker and former cosmonaut, called on Russians to contribute money to a charity formed to 
keep Mir in orbit.694 
 
13 April 
NASA announced the discovery of a “mysterious class of ‘middleweight’ black holes.” Two 
teams of astronomers studying x-ray light at NASA and Carnegie Mellon University had 
independently found evidence of this new class of black hole. Astronomers did not know what 
process had formed the newly discovered black holes, 100 to 10,000 times as massive as the Sun 
and located in spiral-shaped galaxies throughout the universe. Before this discovery, astronomers 
had known of only two types of black holes: 1) stellar black holes, formed from the “remains of 
dead stars several times heavier than the Sun” and compressed to a “diameter of a few miles or 
less”; and 2) supermassive black holes, which have masses equal to 1 million to 1 billion Suns 
and likely formed in the “early universe from giant gas clouds or from the collapse of clusters of 
immense numbers of stars.” Edward H. Colbert and Richard F. Mushotzky of NASA’s Goddard 
Space Flight Center (GSFC) had observed hints of the black holes while studying x-rays from 39 
nearby galaxies. Andrew Ptak and Richard Griffiths of Carnegie Mellon University had studied 
x-ray light in galaxy M82, which was not one of the set of galaxies that the Goddard team had 
studied. Both teams had identified unique x-ray light indicative of a class of black holes that was 
neither stellar nor supermassive.695 
 
15 April 
Landsat-7 launched successfully from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Although Lockheed Martin, 
Missiles and Space, had built Landsat-7, the newest land-surface observation satellite, with a 
design life of five years, the company’s spokesperson remarked that 15 years after its 1984 
launch, Landsat-5 continued in operation. The upper stage of the rocket that launched the 
commercially built Landsat-6 in October 1993 had failed to fire the satellite into orbit, 
destroying the craft and prompting NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey to resume control of 
the Landsat program in 1994. The latest model in the satellite series carried “a new generation of 
remote-sensing devices far more sophisticated than the equipment on satellites mapping Earth 
over the past decade.” Raytheon Remote Sensing of Santa Barbara, California, had built the 
craft’s enhanced thematic mapper to measure solar radiation reflected off the Earth’s surface. 
The device was capable of capturing images of Earth’s surface in 114-mile-wide (183-kilometer-
wide) swaths and could resolve images as small as 50 feet (15 meters) across.696 
 
16 April 
Mir Commander Viktor M. Afanasyev and French cosmonaut Jean-Pierre Haigneré replaced 
scientific equipment on Mir’s exterior during a planned 5-hour spacewalk that went overtime. 
The pair overcame “numerous technical blips,” to complete the French portion of the tasks and 
most of the Russian portion. Malfunctions in their spacesuits’ ventilation systems delayed both 
men in leaving the station. Other problems included equipment failure during a simulated repair 
to an imaginary hole on Mir’s superstructure; an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve data from a

pollution study in process around the station; and the failure to install a new Russian-sponsored 
experiment to measure cosmic rays. Cosmonauts succeeded in other tasks during the spacewalk, 
including the recuperation of a French-sponsored test and the installation on the station’s hull of 
comet technology designed to gather space dust for analysis. Haigneré was on his second 
mission to Mir, but this was his first spacewalk.697 
 
22 April 
At the 14th Annual NASA Continual Improvement and Reinvention Conference on Quality 
Management, Administrator Daniel S. Goldin presented the George M. Low Award, NASA’s 
highest honor for quality and technical performance, to four U.S. companies: 1) Barrios 
Technology Inc. of Houston, Texas, for its small-business product; 2) Kay and Associates of 
Edwards, California, for small-business service; 3) Raytheon Support Services Company of 
Annapolis Junction, Maryland, for the large-business service category; and, 4) Thiokol Space 
Operations of Brigham City, Utah, for the large-business product category. NASA had evaluated 
the recipients for performance, delivery according to agreed cost and schedule, innovation, 
management leadership, alignment of organizational goals with NASA’s strategic plans, 
customer orientation, and adherence to the Total Quality Management philosophy. Thiokol 
Corporation, which had won the Low Award in 1991 and Marshall Space Flight Center’s 
Contractor Excellence Award in March 1999, had manufactured the reusable solid rocket motor 
for the Space Shuttle, as well as providing launch support and refurbishment services for the 
motor. Over the past seven years, Thiokol had never delayed its delivery of hardware. Its cost 
reduction efforts had saved NASA US$152 million.698 
 
23 April 
Scientists Peter Smith of the University of Arizona and Justin Maki of NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory published a report in the Journal of Geophysical Research summarizing the results of 
the Mars Pathfinder Mission. After an exhaustive review of more than 17,000 images from the 
Pathfinder’s 1997 mission, the report had concluded that Mars’s air and dirt are yellowish-brown 
in color, not red. Viking probes of the 1970s had likewise indicated that Mars is not red, but 
rather yellowish-brown. However, Mars appears red to the naked eye from Earth, and the Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST) data had indicated that Mars is red. The scientists reported that the 
detailed analysis using Pathfinder data had revealed that the HST, not Pathfinder, needed to be 
recalibrated.699 
 
27 April 
Lockheed Martin launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base an Athena II rocket, carrying the 
Ikonos I satellite, a civilian satellite capable of capturing the detailed images that only spy 
satellites could produce in the past. Launch officials had planned to cease communications with 
the craft 8 minutes after liftoff and to reestablish contact later in the flight, but had not been able 
to reestablish contact once initial communications ended. Officials were unable to determine

whether the craft had remained in orbit. Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems had built 
the satellite; Raytheon had built the communications, image processing, and other elements of 
the system; and Eastman Kodak had built the digital camera system. The camera on board Ikonos 
I was capable of resolving objects as small as 1 square meter (11 square feet), enabling the 
satellite to distinguish between a car and a truck. Before the manufacture of Ikonos, only military 
satellites had possessed the ability to photograph Earth in such detail.700 
 
28 April 
NASA announced it had completed negotiations on a US$625.6 million contract with Lockheed 
Martin Michoud Space Systems to purchase the last set of materials required to build 60 new 
Space Shuttle external fuel tanks. Although it was the sixth and last in a series of purchases of 
fuel tanks, this was the first purchase NASA had made consisting entirely of super lightweight 
tanks. The tank’s design was the same as that of the lightweight tank design NASA had 
previously used, but the new tanks were 7,500 pounds (3,400 kilograms) lighter, and used a new 
aluminum lithium alloy. NASA and industry partners had developed the lighter alloy, 30 percent 
stronger than the material used to manufacture the lightweight tank, to enable the Shuttle to 
deliver ISS components into the proper orbit.701 
 
29 April 
NASA announced that the magnetometer on board Mars Global Surveyor had revealed “banded 
patterns of magnetic fields on the Martian surface,” bearing a “striking similarity to patterns seen 
in the crust of the Earth’s sea floors.” Scientists interpreted the patterns as evidence that the 
Martian crust had shifted in the past. The discovery of banded patterns on the floor of Earth’s 
oceans had provided a record of Earth’s magnetic history, validating the theory of plate tectonics. 
Jack Connerney of NASA’s GSFC, a member of Global Surveyor’s magnetometer team, 
explained, “if the bands on Mars are an imprint of crustal spreading, they are a relic of an early 
era of plate tectonics on Mars.” He added that such tectonic activity on Mars is likely extinct, 
unlike on Earth. The spacecraft’s magnetometer had been able to capture the magnetic field 
observations because of the extended aerobraking phase, devised to protect against further 
damage to one of the spacecraft’s solar panels. The period of aerobraking had permitted the 
magnetometer to “obtain better-than-planned regional measurements of Mars.” Each time it 
reached the lowest point of its elliptically shaped orbit, below the planet’s ionosphere, the probe 
encountered minimal magnetic interference and enabling it to obtain additional data.702 
 
30 April 
In its third consecutive failure, the second loss within one month, the U.S. Air Force launch of a 
Titan IV rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, placed a geosynchronous military 
communications satellite, the USA 143, also known as Milstar 2, in a useless low-Earth orbit. 703

After a search of nearly two weeks, a team of salvagers funded by the Discovery Channel located 
the Liberty Bell 7, the Mercury space capsule flown by astronaut Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom, which 
had been lost at sea on 21 July 1961. Grissom had survived the splashdown and had been rescued 
from the Atlantic Ocean. He had maintained until his death in the 1967 Apollo I launchpad fire 
that he had done nothing that could have caused the hatch to blow out following the splashdown. 
The cause of the accident remained a mystery and “forever marred” Grissom’s otherwise 
successful 15-minute suborbital flight, the nation’s second piloted spaceflight. The salvagers’ 
remotely operated submersible had located and recorded video of the capsule about 300 miles 
(480 kilometers) southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) beneath the 
surface of the ocean. Expedition leader Curt Newport said the video showed that the capsule was 
in “amazingly good condition.” It was “still shiny in spots,” the window and parachute liner were 
intact, its periscope was extended, and the words “United States” and “Liberty Bell” were 
“plainly visible.” Newport explained the difficulty of locating the capsule, comparing the attempt 
to find it to searching for the Titanic⎯the Liberty Bell’s capsule, smaller than one of the 
Titanic’s boilers, was hidden in water 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) deeper than the doomed ocean 
liner. Although the submersible located two cameras and a tape recorder with the capsule, which 
might possibly help to explain why the hatch blew open prematurely, it was doubtful that the 
film from those items would be salvageable after 38 years underwater. Although the discovery of 
the hatch itself would more likely provide an answer, Newport estimated that the hatch could be 
a mile from the capsule. The capsule remained in the ocean, for recovery at a later unspecified 
date.704 
 
4 May 
A Boeing Delta III rocket, carrying an Orion satellite for Loral Space and Communications, 
malfunctioned shortly after launch, leaving the satellite in the wrong orbit. In the inaugural 
launch in August 1998 of a Boeing Delta III, a rocket designed to carry twice the payload of the 
Delta II, the rocket had exploded in midair. In this second attempt at flight, the rocket had 
survived the initial launch, but malfunctioned when the second stage failed to ignite properly, 
leaving Orion in an orbit lower than planned. Engineers were uncertain whether it would be 
possible to boost the satellite using on-board fuel and thrusters.705 
 
Lockheed Martin Corporation named former Martin Marietta President and Chief Operating 
Officer A. Thomas Young to lead an independent review of the management, engineering, 
manufacturing, and quality control processes of its space and missile business, specifically 
Astronautics, Missiles and Space, and Michoud Space Systems. The company had experienced a 
“series of expensive and well-publicized failures of its rockets and satellites,” including two in 
the previous week, when a Titan IV placed one military satellite in the wrong orbit and when

another satellite, the remote-sensing Ikonos, lost contact with the ground. The company 
instructed the panel to submit a report to senior Lockheed management by 1 September.706 
 
The U.S. Air Force officially declared the US$1.2 billion launch of a communications satellite 
on 30 April a “mission failure.” A malfunction in the upper stage booster of the Titan IVB rocket 
had stranded the Milstar satellite in the wrong orbit. The Air Force established an investigation 
into the failure, which was its “third costly space failure in nine months.”707 
 
11 May 
Following a series of launch failures, Lockheed Martin Corporation announced management 
changes in three of its business sectors. Raymond S. Colloday, President of Lockheed Martin 
Astronautics, retired, effective immediately, and G. Thomas Marsh, Executive Vice President of 
Missiles and Space, succeeded him. Lockheed named the President of Missiles and Space, K. 
Michael Henshaw, as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Environment 
Sector, effective 1 June. In that position, Henshaw succeeded Robert J. Stevens, who had served 
in dual positions but was directed to “devote his full attention” to his role as Corporate Vice 
President of Strategic Development. Albert E. Smith, President of Aerospace Electronics 
Systems and of Sanders, a Lockheed Martin company in Nashua, New Hampshire, succeeded 
Henshaw as President of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space of Sunnyvale, California. 
Lockheed named Walter P. Havenstein President of Sanders and Acting President of Aerospace 
Electronics System, a promotion from his former position as Executive Vice President. In 
addition to the recent launch failures, Lockheed had been “bedeviled” by problems in its space 
business, including a 10 percent reduction in sales in its Space and Strategic Missiles Sector and 
a 17 percent decline in operating profit, after inadequate preparation and cancellations had 
caused the delay of commercial satellite launches.708 
 
12 May 
The U.S. Air Force “officially declared dead” its US$800 million Milstar communications 
satellite. Launched atop a Titan IV rocket on 30 April and placed in the wrong orbit, the Milstar 
would “never reach its intended 22,300-mile-high [35,900-kilometer-high] orbit.” U.S. Air Force 
representative Aaron Renenger stated that the useless satellite “could remain in orbit for 
hundreds of years,” but posed no threat to other spacecraft.709

Force spokesperson did not state the reasons for the change. Starbuck was to report on 3 June as 
Director of the Expeditionary Forces Management Team at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. 
His replacement, Brigadier General Kevin P. Chilton, a former Space Shuttle Commander, was 
to report on 3 June to Patrick Air Force Base, to replace Starbuck as Commander of the 45th 
Space Wing.710 
 
18 May 
NASA announced the appointment of Baruch S. Blumberg, winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize for 
Physiology or Medicine, as Director of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute, effective immediately. 
NASA had created the Astrobiology Institute in July 1998, a “virtual organization” comprising 
NASA’s centers, universities, and other scientific entities for the study of “the origin, evolution, 
distribution, and destiny of life in the universe.” The Institute, with a multidisciplinary focus, 
sought to bring together astronomers, biologists, chemists, exobiologists, geologists, and 
physicists, to search for the origins of life. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin made the 
announcement of Blumberg’s appointment at Ames Research Center in Mountain View, 
California, the site of the Institute’s headquarters. Goldin stated that NASA had tasked the 
Astrobiology Institute with “providing the ‘intellectual underpinnings’ for building new types of 
instruments and space probes for finding life in the solar system and beyond.”711 
 
20 May 
President of the Aerospace Industries Association John W. Douglass testified before the U.S. 
Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space that the nation needed an 
“enlightened” national space program, combining “public and private investment in synergistic 
ways.” Douglass stated that the government needed to “remove barriers to the growth of 
commercial space.” He said that the most critical action needed for the industry’s growth was 
renewal of the indemnification provisions of the Commercial Space Launch Act, because 
without such provisions, U.S. companies are unable to compete with the government-backed 
programs of foreign competitors. Douglass also testified that U.S. launch ranges lacked modern 
facilities, causing launch delays. Such delays “wreak havoc” in the commercial world, because 
launch sites require more time to reconfigure a launch than convenient for commercial 
enterprises. He cited the export licensing process as a serious problem, because it was causing 
the U.S. commercial space industry to lose market share in both satellite and launch services. 
Additionally, Douglass called the “dramatic drop” in funding for aerospace research and 
development over the last two decades a “serious structural problem,” which the United States 
should correct, to remain competitive in the world market.712 
 
U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs Chairperson Fred Thompson (R-TN) 
announced the findings of a U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation into NASA’s 
computer security. Thompson had requested the study, which found that government specialists 
were able to penetrate several mission-critical systems and could have stolen, modified, or 
destroyed system software and data. GAO had found that 135 of the 155 mission-critical systems

reviewed did not meet all of NASA’s requirements for risk assessment. Specifically, NASA had 
not conducted an Agency-wide review of information-technology security since 1991; 60 percent 
of reviewed systems had not been independently audited for security or weaknesses; NASA had 
no security training program; and NASA field centers did not report security incidents to a 
central location. GAO had also found that NASA had no policy for determining what type of 
information its staff could post on public Web sites, rendering it vulnerable to Internet attacks. 
NASA also had no policy for protecting mission-critical systems from well-known Internet 
threats.713 
 
The U.S. Air Force announced that Brigadier General Kevin P. Chilton would not replace 
Brigadier General F. Randall Starbuck as Commander of the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air 
Force Base, but would lead the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base near 
Sacramento, California. Starbuck was to remain in command of the 45th Space Wing indefinitely 
until the Air Force had chosen another successor. The change followed “the U.S. launch 
industry’s worst string of accidents in more than a decade,” including “three consecutive failures 
of Air Force Titan rockets” launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Air Force also reported 
that, earlier in May, a military navigation spacecraft had sustained US$51 million in damage 
during a thunderstorm. The Air Force announced that it had opened a formal investigation into 
that incident, in addition to the investigation President William J. Clinton had ordered into the 
string of launch failures. The President had appointed the CIA, the U.S. Department of Defense, 
and NASA to carry out that investigation.714 
 
25 May 
An international team of astronomers, led by Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories, 
held a news conference to announce their findings regarding the age of the universe. Freedman’s 
team had concluded that the universe was between 12 billion and 13.4 billion years old, at least 1 
billion years younger than predicted. Freedman’s international team had studied eight years of 
calculations, made observations using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and used a range 
of celestial measurements to recalculate the age of the universe. Among those measurements was 
the “Hubble constant,” used in mathematical equations to “gauge the speed at which galaxies are 
accelerating away from each other.” Named for Edwin Hubble, who had discovered 70 years ago 
that the universe is expanding, the Hubble constant is an essential piece of the equation 
determining the age and size of the universe. The team’s findings drew criticism from other 
astronomers. Although the Australian physicist Charles H. Lineweaver had conducted separate 
research with the same result as that of Freedman’s team, some astronomers associated with the 
Carnegie Observatories and Harvard University did not agree with the Freedman team’s 
conclusions. Allan Sandage of the Carnegie Observatories stated that he believed that the team’s 
methodology contained systematic errors and that the final number was not correct. Harvard 
University astronomer Robert P. Kirshner had led a third team, using the Hubble constant to 
study the age of the universe, but although he calculated a different age than the other teams,

26 May 
India’s government-run space agency began commercial operations with the launch, from an 
island in the Bay of Bengal, of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle C-2 (PSLV), carrying Indian, 
German, and South Korean satellites. PSLV carried into orbit Oceansat-1, India’s remote-
sensing satellite, intended to carry out oceanographic research; KITSAT-3 of South Korea’s 
Satellite Technology Research Center; and the German Aerospace Center’s Tubsat. Chairperson 
of Indian Space Research Organization Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan stated that India could 
“offer to launch satellites at a much cheaper rate than other countries with launch facilities.” 
Without naming how much India was charging for its newly inaugurated launch services, 
Kasturirangan said that in the international market it would cost US$1 million to piggyback a 
satellite.716 
 
27 May 
Space Shuttle Discovery launched successfully from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, after a one-week delay and a six-month “launch drought.” NASA had delayed the launch 
of Mission STS-96, scheduled for 20 May, after a violent thunderstorm earlier in the month 
damaged the Shuttle’s external fuel tank, requiring repairs. The previous six months had been the 
longest period in NASA’s history without any launches since the Challenger disaster, which 
grounded the Shuttle fleet for two and one-half years. However, problems with the Shuttle fleet 
had not caused the delay during recent months. Delays in the construction of a critical Russian-
built component for the International Space Station (ISS), as well as ongoing problems with a 
grounded NASA x-ray telescope, had disrupted the launch schedule. Discovery’s crew included 
Commander Kent V. Rominger, Pilot Rick D. Husband, and Mission Specialists Ellen Ochoa, 
Tamara E. Jernigan, Daniel T. Barry, Julie Payette, and Valery I. Tokarev. During the 10-day 
ISS Assembly Mission 2A.1, the crew planned to deliver supplies to the ISS; to repair U.S. and 
Russian equipment; to install mufflers that would reduce the noise of the Russian fans; and to 
conduct a spacewalk, attaching one crane and part of another to the outside of the station. STS-
96 (ISS 2A.1) was the first mission to dock with the new ISS.717 
 
NASA released its first three-dimensional global map of Mars. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter 
(MOLA), an instrument aboard NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor, had generated the data for the 
high-resolution map, created from measurements gathered in 1998 and 1999. David E. Smith of 
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Principal Investigator for MOLA and the lead author of a 
study published in the journal Science, said that, according to the new topographic map, Mars is 
slightly lopsided⎯the northern hemisphere is low and smooth, but the southern hemisphere had

many craters and an elevation of about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) higher than that in the north. 
Additionally, Smith noted that the depression in Mars’s northern hemisphere is “distinctly not 
circular,” indicating that it formed from internal geologic processes rather than an external 
impact. Carl B. Pilcher, NASA’s Science Director for Solar System Exploration, commented that 
the data MOLA had collected enabled scientists to know “the topography of Mars better than 
many continental regions on Earth.” Pilcher said that the data would “serve as a basic reference 
book for Mars scientists for many years,” inspiring “new insights about the planet’s geologic 
history.”718

3 June 
NASA announced that spacecraft engineers who had worked on NASA’s new Quick 
Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) had won an American Electronics Association Technical 
Achievement Award for the “development of a spacecraft at a record-setting pace of one year.” 
Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation of Boulder, Colorado, had built the satellite for 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), assembling the QuikSCAT faster than any 
construction of a spacecraft since the 1958 Explorer I satellite. To accomplish this fast pace, 
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center had developed a new procurement system called the 
Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition process, to accelerate NASA’s purchase procedure. The new 
acquisition process had enabled NASA to take advantage of “low-cost commercial technology 
from the burgeoning spacecraft industry,” to develop satellite systems such as the QuikSCAT. 
NASA had been able to reduce the time needed to select a contractor and to initiate spacecraft 
development, from one year to 30 days. Chip Barnes, a QuikSCAT spacecraft system engineer at 
Ball Aerospace commented that the production had involved a “remarkable effort to get the 
spacecraft built, integrated, and tested in an 11-month time frame.”719 
 
6 June 
Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
Shortly before returning to Earth, astronauts aboard Discovery had completed their last 
assignment, releasing Starshine, an educational satellite that 25,000 students worldwide would 
track over the following seven to eight months, to calculate the atmosphere’s density. The US$1 
million Starshine, a 19-inch (48.3-centimeter) sphere, “covered with 878 small, circular mirrors” 
that schoolchildren had polished, had become visible from the ground once it had “popped” from 
its canister in the Shuttle’s cargo bay. In addition, the astronauts had spent six of their 10 days in 
orbit at the new International Space Station (ISS), where the crew had performed maintenance 
tasks. Discovery’s crew had delivered 2 tons (1,800 kilograms or 1.8 tonnes) of tools, water, and 
other supplies for the first permanent crew of the ISS, scheduled to arrive in the spring of 
2000.720

7 June 
AlliedSignal Inc. agreed to acquire Honeywell Inc., in a stock deal worth US$13.8 billion. 
Aerospace business, with revenues totaling about 40 percent of the enterprise, was the 
centerpiece of the agreement, in which AlliedSignal added Honeywell’s business in cockpit 
electronics (avionics) and global-positioning equipment to its own market in aircraft engines and 
collision-avoidance systems. An analyst with Frost and Sullivan, a California-based, market-
research firm, remarked that the merger put the combined company ahead of Rockwell Collins as 
“the no. 1 player in avionics.” The new company would retain the name of Honeywell and 
maintain its headquarters at AlliedSignal’s base in New Jersey.721 
 
8 June 
Following a series of recent launch failures, Boeing Company announced the convening of an 
independent panel of experts to examine its rocket programs, specifically Boeing’s Delta, Sea 
Launch, and Inertial Upper Stage programs. To head the panel, Boeing had selected Sheila E. 
Widnall, former Secretary of the U.S. Air Force and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. The panel was tasked with examining organizational roles and responsibilities 
within Boeing; recent launch failure investigation findings; processes used for government, civil, 
and commercial launches; acceptance processes for major subsystems and complex assemblies 
from suppliers; and manufacturing, assembly, transportation, and storage activities of Boeing 
launch programs.722 
 
10 June 
A Boeing Delta II rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, carrying 
four Globalstar cellular telephone satellites. Counting this launch, Globalstar Inc. had placed in 
orbit 24 of the 32 satellites the company needed to begin regional cellular phone service. The 
company had planned to begin offering global cellular service in the latter part of 1998, but in 
September 1998, a failed launch destroyed a dozen satellites aboard a Ukrainian Zenit II rocket. 
Globalstar had launched its first eight satellites on Delta II rockets, during February and April 
1998, and 12 more satellites, early in 1999, on three Russian Soyuz rockets. Globalstar was 
competing with its industry rival Iridium World Communications Inc., which had placed a 
complete constellation of 66 satellites in orbit and had begun offering global cellular service 
before the end of 1998. To meet Globalstar’s launch demands over the summer of 1999, Boeing 
had increased the pace of manufacturing at its Pueblo, Colorado, rocket factory. In addition, 
Boeing brought 50 to 70 workers from its Delta launch team at Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California to join its Cape Canaveral workforce in Florida.723 
 
11 June 
Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in China’s Shanxi Province launched two Iridium World 
Communications satellites into orbit aboard a Chinese Long March 2C rocket, replenishing the 
66-satellite Iridium constellation, which provides telephone, paging, and fax communication 
services worldwide. The satellite was the 57th launched from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center

and the 15th consecutive successful launch since October 1996 for the Long March rocket 
series.724 
 
15 June 
The Boeing Company named former cosmonaut Vladimir G. Titov as the company’s director for 
Space and Communications, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, located in 
Boeing’s Moscow office. With the appointment, Titov became responsible for initiating new 
business opportunities, working closely with Boeing’s ISS program members and with Russian 
and Ukrainian partners on the Sea Launch program. A cosmonaut since 1976, Titov had 
commanded several Soyuz missions, served as a mission specialist on two Space Shuttle 
missions, and lived aboard Russia’s Mir space station, logging 387 days in space, including 
nearly 19 hours of extravehicular activity.725 
 
Keith R. Hall, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Air Force for Space and Director of the National 
Reconnaissance Office, and Edward C. “Pete” Aldridge Jr., Chief Executive Officer of the 
Aerospace Corporation, which provides technical analysis for the United States and international 
space programs, testified before the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s 
Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, regarding three rocket-launch failures. All 
of the launch failures⎯an explosion after launch in August 1998, a missile-warning satellite 
launched into the wrong orbit on 9 April 1999, and a military communications satellite launched 
into the wrong orbit on 30 April 1999⎯had involved Lockheed Martin Titan IV rockets. The 
three mission failures had cost taxpayers “at least [US]$3 billion.” Hall explained that the U.S. 
Air Force had traced the three launch failures to human error. The investigators had traced the 
most recent failure specifically to a misplaced decimal point. Aldridge, whose company had been 
responsible for checking U.S. Air Force rockets for defects prior to launch, explained that the 
mistake “got through,” despite the system in place to prevent such occurrences. Aldridge 
remarked that his company’s workforce of engineers, scientists, and support personnel had 
decreased by 30 percent since 1993, and that the recent launch failures had caused further delays, 
resulting in increased costs for the Titan program. Both Aldridge and Hall requested federal 
funding. House Subcommittee Chairperson Michael N. Castle (R-DE) asked whether the military 
rocket program, which receives less supervision than NASA, needed greater congressional 
oversight. Castle announced that the subcommittee would hold further public hearings on the 
failures.726 
 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) detached the Geostationary 
Operational Environmental Satellite-L (GOES-L) from an Atlas IIA rocket, returning the satellite 
to the integration facility Astrotech, where engineers planned to recondition its batteries and 
purge it of gaseous nitrogen, to prevent degradation. NOAA had planned to store the satellite in 
orbit, ready to replace one of the weather satellites, GOES-8 or GOES-10, but GOES-L had been 
on the launchpad since 6 May. On 15 May, NASA and NOAA had decided to delay the launch

16 June 
NASA Associate Administrator for Space Flight Joseph H. Rothenberg announced several 
immediate management changes in the Office of Space Flight. NASA appointed William F. 
Readdy, former Director for Space Shuttle Requirements, as Deputy Associate Administrator, 
with primary responsibility for daily management of personnel and program activities. Having 
participated in Shuttle missions in 1992, 1993, and 1996, Readdy was an astronaut on flight 
status, eligible for future Shuttle missions. NASA appointed W. Michael Hawes, a former chief 
engineer for the ISS, as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Development (Space Station), 
responsible for directing the space station budget, establishing and implementing station policy, 
coordinating external communications, and serving as a liaison to the executive branch, 
Congress, industry, and NASA’s international partners. Norman B. Starkey replaced Readdy as 
Director for Space Shuttle Requirements, assuming responsibilities that included directing the 
Space Shuttle budget, establishing and implementing Shuttle policy, coordinating external 
communications, and serving as a liaison to the executive branch, Congress, industry, and 
NASA’s international partners.728 
 
17 June 
NASA disclosed that a sequence of computer commands issued by flight controllers on the 
ground had failed to fire the ISS’s engines, placing the uninhabited space station in potential 
danger. The cause of the failure was human error. Flight controllers had sent commands directing 
the new space station to move out of the path of a piece of space junk, which posed a danger to 
the craft. A U.S. military organization tracking such objects had predicted that the “fairly large” 
piece of space junk of Russian origin would pass within 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) of the space 
station on 13 June. However, the debris came no closer to the new ISS than 4.5 miles (7.2 
kilometers). A collision could have destroyed the uninhabited space station. NASA’s Deputy 
Program Manager for Space Station Operations, Frank L. Culbertson Jr., explained that, because 
the space station’s computers had rejected the flight controllers’ faulty commands, the station 
had no motion control for an entire orbit.729 
 
19 June 
A Lockheed Martin Titan II rocket launched successfully, carrying JPL’s QuikSCAT satellite. 
Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation had built QuikSCAT in 11 months, setting an 
industry record. JPL stated that the satellite had “opened its solar arrays as planned an hour after 
launch, and a tracking station in Norway acquired the first signal from the spacecraft 18 minutes 
later.” NASA had originally scheduled the satellite’s launch for November 1998, but delayed it 
when a Titan IVA exploded after launch, carrying a payload for the National Reconnaissance 
Office. NASA had postponed the QuikSCAT launch until engineers could determine whether 
Titan II used any of the hardware that had caused the explosion on the Titan IVA. Following the

launch of a Titan IVB rocket that placed a Milstar satellite in a faulty orbit, NASA had again 
delayed the QuikSCAT’s launch, pending investigation of the failure. The successfully launched 
QuikSCAT satellite was on a two-year mission with the option of a third year, to “gather about 
400,000 detailed measurements of the speed and direction of winds over the ocean’s surface.” 
NASA intended the US$98 million mission to “improve weather forecasting and detect the onset 
of conditions like El Niño.” Engineers had designed the QuikSCAT to radiate microwave pulses 
over wide areas and to listen for the pulses’ echo. Those return signals would “allow scientists to 
determine wind speeds and directions at the surface of the oceans. Understanding the interaction 
[of wind and ocean circulation] is important for weather prediction.” Under the terms of NASA’s 
first contract using the Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition process, Ball Aerospace had provided the 
QuikSCAT spacecraft bus, launch interface, system integration, test, launch support, and two 
years of mission operations.730 
 
21 June 
NASA announced the appointment of N. Jan Davis, Director of the Human Exploration and 
Development of Space Independent Assurance Office, as Deputy Director of the new Flight 
Projects Directorate at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, 
effective July 1999. NASA had tasked the Directorate with overseeing “development of crucial 
parts of the ISS,” such as connecting Nodes 2 and 3, the Multi-purpose Logistics Modules, 
commercial EXPRESS (EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station) racks, 
the environmental and life support systems, and the Payload Operations Integration Center. 
Davis had begun her NASA career at MSFC in 1979, leading a team “responsible for structural 
analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope, the telescope-servicing mission, and the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory.” She had also served as “lead engineer for the redesign of the Shuttle Solid Rocket 
Booster External Tank attach ring” before becoming an astronaut in 1987. Davis had flown on 
three Shuttle missions, logging more than 670 hours in space.731 
 
22 June 
NASA’s JPL announced that Discover Magazine had awarded NASA’s Solar Electric Propulsion 
Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) program team its Award for Technological

NASA successfully launched its Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) telescope aboard 
a Delta II rocket. FUSE’s three-year mission was to measure the abundance of deuterium, or 
heavy hydrogen, which stars consume every day and convert to helium. Astronomers hoped that 
the study of deuterium would help them understand better “what the universe was like moments 
after creation.” The FUSE scientists sought to determine how much deuterium still exists and 
how much of it stars consume regularly, thereby calculating “the original makeup of the 
universe.” NASA had nearly cancelled the FUSE project in the early 1990s, because of cost 
overruns and missed deadlines, but in 1994 NASA had asked Johns Hopkins University to 
manage the project. Project managers at Johns Hopkins had scaled down the scientific instrument 
and used existing equipment instead of developing new technologies. The Canadian Space 
Agency had provided the camera, the French Space Agency had provided the spectrograph, and 
other U.S. universities had provided various parts for the telescope. Orbital Sciences Corporation 
had built the spacecraft using an existing design to reduce costs further. NASA considered the 
spacecraft and its launch a success; NASA’s Science Director Edward J. Weiler remarked, “We 
have never had a satellite as sensitive as FUSE.”733 
 
25 June 
NASA announced that the WIRE Mishap Investigation Board had concluded that NASA’s Wide-
Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) satellite had failed after its 4 March 1999 launch, “because of an 
incorrectly designed electronics box.” The premature firing of explosive devices⎯the 
pyrotechnics⎯had caused the instrument’s telescope cover to eject too early in the mission, thus 
exposing the instrument’s frozen hydrogen to the Sun. The frozen hydrogen was necessary to 
cool the telescope’s infrared detectors. The satellite had lost the frozen hydrogen within 48 hours 
of its launch, rendering the instrument incapable of carrying out its scientific mission. Darrell R. 
Branscome, Deputy Associate Administrator (Enterprise Development) for NASA’s Office of 
Space Flight and chairperson of the eight-member investigation team, emphasized that there had 
been no component failure, but “simply a case of a design error that allowed power to get to the 
explosive charges before it should have.” The board’s report also concluded that engineers had 
failed to identify the design errors in the circuitry controlling the pyrotechnical functions. Unlike 
the other systems in the satellite, the electronics box design had received no peer review.734 
 
28 June 
NASA announced its decision to end a US$240 million project to land a small spacecraft on a 
comet, so that scientists could learn how to destroy a comet if it were on course to collide with 
Earth. NASA had planned to launch the probe in 2003 and to land it on the surface of Comet 
Tempel 1 in 2005. After landing, the probe was to drill into the nucleus of the comet, helping 
scientists understand the comet’s composition. Manager of the Space Technology 4 project Brian 
Muirhead remarked, “we know very, very little about how comets are formed and what their 
constituency is,” adding that anyone serious about planetary protection must learn more about 
comets. NASA’s JPL was in the early stages of developing the Space Technology 4/Champollion 
project and had only spent US$10 million. NASA had also considered canceling Mars Surveyor 
2001, but had already spent US$100 million on that project. Other projects were experiencing

cost overruns also, such as the US$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, which needed an

The Russian Defense Ministry launched Raduga-1, an early-warning-system satellite for 
detecting missile launches, aboard a Proton-K booster rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in 
Kazakhstan. Ground controllers lost communication with the satellite minutes after its launch, 
and just as it reached its preliminary orbit, both the satellite and the second stage of the rocket 
crashed in a remote region of Kazakhstan. Russian space officials initially stated that the satellite 
had crashed in an uninhabited area, but a Russian television network reported that a large piece 
of the Proton rocket had fallen onto farmland in the Karaganda region of Kazakhstan, nearly 
hitting a house. Nobody was injured in the crash.736 
 
6 July 
Pending the outcome of an investigation into the crash of a Russian Proton rocket the previous 
day, the Kazakhstan government banned Russian launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome, causing 
a potentially significant disruption to Russia’s commercial satellite launch program. 
Kazakhstan’s foreign ministry informed the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that launches 
from the facility would cease until investigators had identified the causes of the crash and 
evaluated the damage sustained. The ministry did not indicate how long the ban would remain in 
effect. Kazakhstan investigators collected soil and water samples to test for possible hazardous 
material dispersed in the crash.737 
 
8 July 
Astronaut Charles P. “Pete” Conrad Jr. died at age 69 of injuries sustained in a motorcycle 
accident. George W. S. Abbey, Director of Johnson Space Center, described Conrad, the third 
man to walk on the Moon, as a person who “combined skill and ability with wit and humor to 
become one of the courageous pioneers who took humankind beyond the bounds of our planet.” 
As an example of Conrad’s wit, Abbey quoted his parody of the famous words Neil A. 
Armstrong had uttered when taking his first steps on the Moon. Upon leaving the lunar module 
Intrepid on 19 November 1969 for his own moonwalk, Conrad had quipped, “Whoopee! Man, 
that may have been a small one for Neil, but that’s a long one for me.” Conrad had been a 
member of NASA’s second candidate class of astronauts in 1962 and had flown on the Gemini 5 
mission with L. Gordon Cooper Jr. The pair had spent a record eight days in orbit in August 
1965, perfecting techniques for later lunar missions. In September 1966, Conrad had commanded 
the Gemini 11 mission; during that mission, he and Richard F. Gordon Jr. had linked their 
Gemini spacecraft with an Agena target vehicle, establishing a record for the fastest space 
rendezvous and docking in history. Conrad had also served as Commander of the Apollo 12 
mission in November 1969, with Alan Bean and Richard Gordon as crewmates. During his final

spaceflight in 1973, Conrad had been the first Commander of Skylab, the first American space 
station. The Skylab crew had spent 28 days in space, establishing another endurance record. 
Conrad had won the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, two NASA Distinguished Service 
Medals, two NASA Exceptional Service Medals, two Navy Distinguished Service Medals, and 
two Distinguished Flying Crosses.738 
 
Ukraine’s Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko appealed to Kazakhstan’s Premier Nurlan 
Balgimbayev to permit the launch of the Okean-O research satellite aboard a Ukrainian Zenit 
rocket, despite the launch ban following the 5 July crash of a Russian rocket. Ukrainian officials 
expressed concern that a delay beyond 15 July, with the rocket’s lengthy stay on the launchpad, 
would endanger the prospect of a successful launch. The Ukrainian space program, seeking to 
compete in the lucrative commercial space market, was under pressure to make a successful 
launch after the crash in September 1998 of a Zenit rocket, destroying 12 of Globalstar Inc.’s 
communications satellites.739 
 
10 July 
After a two-day delay because of high-altitude winds, the Boeing Company successfully 
launched a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, carrying four 
Globalstar communications satellites. An hour after launch, the rocket deployed the 988-pound 
(448-kilogram) satellites in pairs, bringing the total number of satellites in Globalstar Inc.’s 
constellation to 28, 4 less than the 32 needed to begin network service.740 
 
13 July 
Donald D. Engen, Director of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum, and 
William Ivans, an internationally known, award-winning pilot from La Jolla, California, died 
when the motorized glider that Ivans was piloting broke apart and crashed. Investigators were 
attempting to determine the cause of the accident. Larry Sanderson, President of the Soaring 
Society of America, remarked that “both victims were top pilots in ‘an extremely well-built 
aircraft. So it had to be a very unusual set of circumstances that stressed the craft’.” Both Engen 
and Ivans were officers of the Soaring Society, and Ivans, a pioneer in the field, had won many 
awards for high-altitude soaring. Engen had retired from the U.S. Navy in 1978, with the rank of 
vice admiral and had been a test pilot for many years. After retiring from the Navy, he had 
served for two years on the National Transportation Safety Board and as administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration between 1984 and 1987. He became Director of the National 
Air and Space Museum in 1996, following the resignation of Martin O. Harwit.741 
 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev set Kazakhstan’s conditions for permitting Russia to launch a 
Progress cargo craft carrying supplies to the Mir space station, scheduled to lift off from 
Baikonur Cosmodrome on 14 July. Kazakhstan had suspended all Russian launches from the 
facility, following the crash of a Russian Proton-K rocket on 5 July. Nazarbayev’s terms for

permitting the launch of the Progress craft included Russia’s payment of its US$300 million debt 
for the lease of Baikonur Cosmodrome and a visit of high-level Russian officials to the Proton-K 
rocket’s crash site.742 
 
Kenneth R. Timmerman, President of Middle East Data Project Inc., testified before the U.S. 
House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics that Iran was designing a new missile 
named Kosar, capable of reaching the continental United States. Timmerman stated that NASA 
had given Russian aerospace entities millions of dollars for the Russian space program, but that 
Russia had diverted those funds to support Iran’s missile program. House Committee on Science 
and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) remarked that each new report 
of Russian proliferation activities raised the possibility that NASA was inadvertently subsidizing 
Russian industries, which the United States believed were helping Iran to threaten the United 
States’ friends and allies in the Middle East and in Europe. Henry D. Sokolski, Executive 
Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, testified that legislation sponsored by 
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman (R-NY) was critical to ensuring Russia’s cooperation with 
the nonproliferation efforts of the United States. Gilman’s legislation would require the President 
of the United States to determine whether Russia was “assisting Iran’s programs to develop 
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.” If the President determined that Russia was 
furnishing such aid to Iran, the federal government would prohibit NASA from “transferring 
U.S. tax dollars to the [Russian Space Agency] or any enterprise under the [Russian Space 
Agency] jurisdiction.” An unnamed NASA official testified that to replace the operational 
capabilities that Russia provided to the International Space Program would cost as much as US$5 
billion.743 
 
14 July 
The Boeing Company announced that it had completed negotiations on a cooperative agreement 
with NASA to develop an experimental space plane. The US$173 million contract stipulated that 
Boeing and the federal government share costs equally. Boeing and NASA hoped that the X-37 
space plane, previously called the Future-X Pathfinder, would “serve as a test bed for new 
reusable launch technologies,” helping to achieve the “goal of reducing the cost of placing space 
vehicles and cargo into orbit.” Boeing envisioned a vehicle that would be “unpiloted, 
autonomously operated, and capable of speeds up to Mach 25, while demonstrating aircraft-like 
operations.” NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center led the X-37 government team, comprising 
the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base and NASA facilities, including 
Ames Research Center, Kennedy Space Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Langley Research 
Center, and Dryden Flight Research Center.744 
 
Kazakhstan partially lifted its ban on launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome, permitting a 
Russian Progress cargo spacecraft to deliver supplies to the Mir space station. Kazakhstan had 
agreed to permit the Progress launch after receiving Russia’s promise to pay a US$115 million

fee for the use of the launch facility. Russia had agreed to pay US$50 million in cash by 
November 1999 and US$65 million in goods by 2000. Kazakhstan’s launch ban on Proton-K 
rockets remained in effect.745 
 
16 July 
A Russian Progress M42 cargo spacecraft launched with a Soyuz-U rocket to deliver supplies to 
the Mir space station. Supplies included equipment necessary to keep an uninhabited station 
operational and equipment for conducting a controlled reentry, in the event that Russia could not 
obtain the resources necessary to continue operation. The launch was the first since Kazakhstan’s 
partial relaxation of a launch ban at Baikonur Cosmodrome.746 
 
17 July 
A Russian rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, carrying a scientific satellite into orbit. 
It was the second launch from the facility since Kazakhstan partially lifted the launch ban 
imposed following the crash of a Proton-K rocket on 5 July.747 
 
19 July 
The United Nations opened a conference, scheduled to run through 30 July, on space technology 
and exploration, the first such conference held in 17 years. The primary goals of the Unispace III 
conference included 1) adopting the Vienna Declaration, which provided “international 
guidelines for the use and environmental protection of outer space”; 2) addressing the cleanup of 
debris in space, including satellites or parts of spacecraft no longer in use, but continuing to 
orbit; and 3) ensuring the accessibility of information from outer space to all people, regardless 
of a country’s ability to support costly space exploration programs. In his opening remarks, UN 
Secretary General Kofi Annan “urged the peaceful use of outer space,” suggesting the necessity 
of a legal instrument, such as the Vienna Declaration, to prevent space from “becoming another 
arena of military confrontation.” Because joint development programs between the UN and 
private industries were necessary to achieve the conference’s goals, businesses involved in space 
technology participated in Unispace for the first time. 
 
20 July 
The salvage team lifted astronaut Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom’s Mercury capsule to the surface of the 
Atlantic Ocean just one day before the 38th anniversary of the astronaut’s historic suborbital 
flight. The second American in space, Grissom had flown in his Liberty Bell 7 Mercury capsule 
on 21 July 1961. After its ocean landing, the capsule’s hatch had blown open prematurely, nearly 
drowning him. Both the location of the capsule and the cause of the accident had remained a 
mystery until 1 May 1999, when a salvage team led by Curt Newport and funded by the 
Discovery Channel had discovered the spacecraft 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) beneath the ocean. 
Even after the team had retrieved the capsule, the cause of the accident remained a mystery. The

salvage team had yet to locate the capsule’s hatch, which Newport believed had the greatest 
potential for determining what had caused the malfunction at the end of Grissom’s flight.748 
 
23 July 
During a spacewalk lasting nearly 6 hours, cosmonauts Viktor M. Afanasyev and Sergei V. 
Avdeyev searched for the source of a leak that was slowly causing pressure loss in Mir; they also 
attempted to install an antenna needed for an experiment. Both efforts failed. The leak, first 
detected in late June 1999, was “above the allowable limit.” Although it posed no immediate 
threat to the space station, if the leak continued for three more months, the station would become 
uninhabitable.749 
 
After two delays, Space Shuttle Columbia launched on Mission STS-93 from Kennedy Space 
Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, under the command of Eileen M. Collins, NASA’s 
first female Shuttle commander in 38 years of human spaceflight. Commander Collins’s crew 
comprised Pilot Jeffrey S. Ashby and Mission Specialists Steven A. Hawley, Catherine G. 
Coleman, and Michel Tognini. Columbia carried on board the US$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray 
Observatory, previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), as well as 
secondary payloads and experiments⎯the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System to capture 
ultraviolet imagery of the Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter; plant growth experiments; 
biological cell-culture studies; and the Treadmill Vibration Information System and High 
Definition Television System, which the crew planned to test. NASA had scrubbed both of the 
Shuttle’s earlier launch attempts late in the countdown, halting the 20 July launch 6 seconds 
before blastoff because of a technical malfunction and the 22 July launch because of stormy 
weather. The U.S. Air Force and the Boeing Company postponed a commercial launch to permit 
NASA a third chance to deliver Chandra into orbit. However, the Shuttle continued to have 
problems. During the 8-minute climb into outer space, a 0.5-second-long short circuit shut down 
computers controlling two of the Shuttle’s three main engines. Furthermore, Columbia was 4,000 
pounds (1,800 kilograms) short of liquid oxygen fuel in its external fuel tank, leaving the craft in 
orbit 7 miles (11 kilometers) lower than planned. Fuel carried aboard the orbiter made up the 
shortfall. Seven hours into the flight, the crew deployed Chandra into orbit, accomplishing its 
primary mission.750 
 
27 July 
Commander Eileen M. Collins became the first woman to “land a spaceship of any kind, 
anywhere,” when she guided Space Shuttle Columbia to a safe late night landing at KSC in Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, the 12th nighttime touchdown in the Shuttle program’s 95-flight history. A 
few hours after the landing, NASA confirmed that hydrogen fuel had leaked from one of the

craft’s main engines during liftoff on 23 July. Columbia’s mission, lasting just five days, was the 
shortest planned flight in nine years.751 
 
28 July 
Two Russian cosmonauts carried out a successful 5½-hour spacewalk outside Mir, installing 
equipment and opening the antenna that they had failed to unfold properly in a previous 
spacewalk. Russian space officials said that the spacewalk was most likely the last to occur at 
Mir. This was the seventh spacewalk for Mir Commander Viktor M. Afanasyev and the eighth 
spacewalk for Flight Engineer Sergei V. Avdeyev, who had spent a record-making, cumulative 
total of 717 days in space.752 
 
NASA announced that, after Space Shuttle Columbia’s return to Earth on the night of 27 July, 
engineers had found “three little holes” in its right engine nozzle, confirming that the Shuttle had 
leaked hydrogen fuel during liftoff. The holes, 0.25 inches (0.64 centimeters) in size, had caused 
the craft to lose up to 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of fuel during each second of its 8½-minute 
climb to orbit.753 
 
29 July 
NASA scientists announced that, because the Deep Space 1 spacecraft had aimed its camera 
incorrectly when it flew within 15 miles (24 kilometers) of a small asteroid named Braille, the 
craft had failed to capture an image. However, the craft had succeeded in its primary mission to 
test 12 new technologies during the flyby, thereby validating the instruments’ future use in solar-
system probes. Deep Space 1 was equipped with “a mind of its own,” enabling it to navigate 
through space without much assistance from ground control. The craft had traveled at 35,000 
miles (56,000 kilometers) per hour relative to the asteroid, which was 117 million miles (188 
million kilometers) from Earth. The flyby of the Braille asteroid, the final test of Deep Space 1’s 
Autonomous Navigation System, had been the closest any spacecraft had come to an object in 
our solar system without landing.754 
 
31 July 
NASA’s Lunar Prospector crashed into a frozen crater on the Moon, but detected no water upon 
impact. Scientists, believing that the crater held frozen water, had hoped that the “fire and 
violence of the collision would vaporize ice,” sending a “wet plume, detectable by special 
instruments, spiraling into the lunar sky.” Telescopes equipped with ultraviolet detectors 
recorded hours of data after the impact, searching for the “chemical signature” of water. The 
Prospector mission, which had lasted 18 months following its 6 January 1998 launch, had used 
five instruments to “map the magnetic, chemical and gravitational character of the [M]oon.”755

2 August 
NASA announced the student winners of the 1998–1999 National General Aviation Design 
Competition, sponsored by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A team of 33 
students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, had produced the 
winning design, “aimed at attracting customers who want to move from propeller-driven craft to 
jets without needing a significant increase in pilot skill.” A 13-member team from Pennsylvania 
State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, won second place for their “Baracuda,” an 
acronym for Boldly Advanced and Refined Aircraft Concept Under Development for AGATE, a 
national, general aviation revitalization program. The team’s “conventional-layout, modern-
composite airplane featuring advanced aerodynamics, systems, and avionics” was a four-place, 
single-engine, jet-powered aircraft. A three-university team⎯the University of Virginia, Old 
Dominion University in Hampton, Virginia, and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York⎯won 
third place for a “highly innovative design known as the ‘Yeah Man’,” a craft with two tail 
booms, each with vertical tails. The aircraft, which NASA scientists had tested in the Full Scale 
Wind Tunnel at Langley Research Center, showed good aerodynamic characteristics.756 
 
5 August 
NASA selected two software programs for the 1999 NASA Software of the Year award from 50 
entries representing more than 150 corporations, universities, and government laboratories. In the 
1970s, NASA’s Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field (GRC)⎯at that time, the Lewis Research 
Center⎯had begun to develop the first award-winning program, the Genoa/Progressive Failure 
Analysis Software System, to simulate and predict “aging and failure in all sorts of structural 
materials, including high-tech alloys and ceramics used in airplanes, cars, engines, and bridges.” 
In 1998 NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research program had commercialized the 
software, primarily for the use of aircraft manufacturers. Ames Research Center and Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had developed the other winning software, the Remote Agent 
program, a “precursor to self-aware, self-controlled robots, exploring rovers and intelligent 
machines.” NASA had used the Remote Agent software to plan three days of activities for Deep 
Space 1, and the spacecraft had “carried out the plan without ground intervention.”757

CSA had committed to commercializing half of its allocated space aboard the space station, a 
global first in space commercialization.758

NASA and the National Research Council of Canada signed a protocol at the Aerospace North 
America conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, founding the Aircraft Icing Research 
Alliance and drafting the Aircraft Icing Research Strategic Plan, to “provide a framework for 
collaboration to develop critical aircraft icing technologies.” The Alliance planned to add more 
partners, such as the United States’ FAA, Environment Canada, Transport Canada, and other 
government agencies, universities, industrial firms, and organizations interested in aviation-icing 
research.759 
 
11 August 
Robert Thomas “R.T.” Jones, who had “led the development of the swept-back jet wing design 
that revolutionized air travel and enabled planes to break the sound barrier,” died at the age of 
89. Jones had begun designing the swept-back wings in 1944, when airplane wings were 
perpendicular to the fuselage, while working at NACA (National Advisory Committee on 
Aeronautics), NASA’s predecessor agency. In 1945 Jones had conducted airflow studies, 
showing that a cone-shaped shock wave cut across the tips of straight wings, causing 
deterioration at Mach 1, the speed of sound. Jones had concluded that a swept-back design would 
preserve the wings and reduce drag. Although his idea was initially ignored, “virtually every 
commercial and military jet uses the design today.” Jones’s later research had included work on 
the oblique wing, “mounted on a pivot on top of the fuselage.” The oblique wing maintained a 
right angle to the fuselage for maximum lift during takeoff, but the pilot could manipulate it so 
that, at cruising altitude, one wing tip pointed forward and one backward, saving fuel, generating 
less engine noise, and eliminating the sonic boom. Although Jones’s oblique wing design had 
never advanced beyond the testing stage, some aeronautical designers continued to study its 
possibilities.760 
 
NASA’s largest balloon⎯39 million cubic feet (1.1 million cubic meters) in volume and 60 
stories high⎯lifted off from Lynn Lake in Manitoba, Canada, to carry out a 38-hour flight more 
than 20 miles (32 kilometers) above Earth. The balloon carried a Japanese-built instrument, the 
Superconducting Solenoidal Magnet, to collect particles of antimatter. Shuji Orito of the 
University of Tokyo led the project, called BESS (Balloon Borne Experiment with a 
Superconducting Solenoidal Magnet); NASA sponsored the United States’ portion of the mission 
and Monbusho sponsored the Japanese portion.761 
 
Kazakhstan’s Finance Minister, Uraz Dzhandosov, announced that Russia had paid US$12.5 
million as a first installment of its debt to Kazakhstan, fulfilling a condition of the agreement 
between the two countries. Kazakhstan had demanded the payment as part of the terms of lifting 
the launch ban it had imposed on Russia when a Russian Proton rocket exploded after liftoff 
from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.762

intercontinental, strategic ballistic missile. The Chinese Guangzhou Daily reported that the

the western territory of Xinjiang.” Jane’s Defence Weekly estimated that the DF-31 had an 
8,000-kilometer (5,000-mile) range and was capable of carrying a 700-kilogram (1,500-pound) 
nuclear warhead. Robert Karniol, a foreign correspondent covering Asia for the defense industry 
publication Jane’s, remarked that “the DF-31 should be operationally deployed by China in 
2000,” and that the country expected to build 10 to 20 of the missiles, some replacing 1960s-era 
missiles with half the range of the DF-31. The Guangzhou Daily also reported that China had 
developed the technology for piloted spaceflight. Wang Xinqing, head of the China Carrier-
Rocket Research Institute, which designs military- and civilian-use rockets, stated that the core 
of the program was the development of a new series of carrier rockets, Long March 5. Wang 
Xinqing also refuted a report by the U.S. Congress alleging that China had stolen the United 
States’ missile and nuclear warhead technology, insisting that China had perfected the rocketry 
before the United States had achieved it.763 
 
The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) published a report critical of the X-33 program 
jointly sponsored by NASA and Lockheed Martin, concluding that the program was unlikely to 
meet its original cost, schedule, and performance goals because of increased costs, delayed 
testing, and revised objectives. However, NASA and Lockheed Martin responded that they 
expected the program to “achieve technical requirements, such as demonstrating the feasibility of 
building large liquid hydrogen fuel tanks made of graphite composite material.” The purpose of 
the X-33 Program was to develop and demonstrate advanced technologies for use on future 
reusable launch vehicles, such as the company’s VentureStar TM.764 
 
12 August 
NASA’s GRC announced that, for the first time, researchers had suspended particles of frozen 
hydrogen in liquid helium, the first step toward creating new rocket fuels that could revolutionize 
rocket-propulsion technology. Researchers had poured small amounts of liquid hydrogen at a 
temperature of 14 K (-435°F or -259°C), just above freezing point, onto the surface of liquid 
helium of a temperature just above absolute zero, at 4 K (-452°F or -269°C).  The liquid 
hydrogen had formed small, solid hydrogen particles, which floated on the surface of the helium. 
Scientists planned to use the suspension to create “futuristic atomic fuels,” making it possible to 
develop rockets with “liftoff weights one-fifth that of today’s [rockets] or with payloads three to 
four times more massive.” In addition, the suspension could “reduce or eliminate on-orbit 
assembly of large space vehicles,” thereby contributing to the exploration of the entire solar 
system.765

A burst of radiation from Jupiter hit NASA’s Galileo spacecraft as it gathered data about 
Jupiter’s moon Callisto, causing computer malfunctions. However, NASA reported, “recently 
loaded software automatically restarted command sequences, minimizing the loss of science 
data.” James K. Erickson of NASA’s JPL, Project Manager of the Galileo Program, remarked on 
the highly variable nature of the radiation, explaining that, previously, the spacecraft had entered 
safe modes during radiation bursts, resulting in the loss of data. Galileo’s instruments had only 
lost about 1 hour of data during the radiation burst, successfully recording data about magnetic 
fields and particles. Project scientists expected that the data would help them study the event. To 
emphasize the value of the software, Erickson stated, “If we didn’t have the automatic restart 
software, we wouldn’t be getting any data at the encounters.”766 
 
16 August 
A team of astrophysicists at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center announced that they had 
found the first direct evidence of a black hole pulling in matter. Using the Advanced Satellite for 
Cosmology and Astrophysics, an x-ray satellite belonging to Japan and the United States and 
launched in 1993, the team observed superheated gas in the accretion disc of the black hole. 
Previously, scientists had only “seen” the phenomenon by observing these accretion discs, or 
“the swirling matter circling around as it is being pulled into the black hole.” However, this time, 
the Goddard team had observed a “strange feature” buried in the x-rays that the gas emitted. 
Energy had been redshifted, an occurrence described as an “astronomical Doppler effect,” 
because, just as the compression of sound waves, for example, causes the sound of a siren to rise 
and fall as it passes an observer, light stretches as it speeds away from Earth. The team observed 
light that was being stretched⎯redshifted⎯moving at about 6.5 million miles (10.5 million 
kilometers) per hour, toward a black hole in galaxy NGC 3516.767 
 
Swedish state prosecutors charged Charlie Malm and Joel Soederberg of Stockholm, who had 
broken into NASA computer systems between October and December 1996, with violating 
Sweden’s computer laws and with buying stolen equipment. In the trial, scheduled for sometime 
in the fall, NASA intended to demonstrate that the pair had “caused NASA great economic loss.” 
Malm and Soederberg had also broken into the computer systems of the U.S. Air Force, U.S. 
Army, and U.S. Marines, as well as the system of a British Internet company.768 
 
19 August 
NASA announced its selection of three very small satellites, each about 16 inches (41 
centimeters) across and 8 inches (20 centimeters) high, to conduct the Nanosat Constellation 
Trailblazer mission, the fifth mission in NASA’s New Millennium program. NASA had 
developed the New Millennium program to test technology for future missions, with the goal of 
dramatically reducing the weight, size, and costs of missions, while simultaneously increasing 
science capabilities. NASA scheduled the US$28 million Nanosat Constellation mission to 
launch in 2003 as a secondary payload on an expendable launch vehicle.769

24 August 
NASA announced that it had completed negotiations for a contract worth up to US$1.73 billion, 
to purchase 73 Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motors from the Thiokol Propulsion company. 
Each Shuttle flight used two of these motors as the primary component of the Shuttle solid rocket 
boosters, providing 6.6 million pounds (2.9 million kilograms) of thrust, 71.4 percent of the 
thrust needed for liftoff. The contract covered the manufacture and delivery of the new motor 
components through September 2004, as well as postflight review of the last motors flown 
through 2005.770 
 
SPACEHAB Inc., the first company to “commercially develop, own, and operate habitable 
modules that provide laboratory facilities and logistics re-supply aboard NASA’s Space 
Shuttles,” and leading global provider of commercial payload-processing services, participated in 
a Brazilian industry conference. Brazsat, a Brazilian commercial space company, hosted the 
Third Commercial Space Workshop, in Rio de Janeiro on 23 and 24 August. North American, 
South American, and European industry and government leaders attended the workshop, where 
SPACEHAB’s Chief Executive Officer Shelley A. Harrison delivered one of two keynote 
addresses. Participants at the workshop, which had the theme “Commercial Space Technologies 
and its Benefits in the New Millenium,” presented “state-of-the-art space technologies, research 
spin-offs and applications in areas of microgravity research, remote sensing, telecommunications 
satellites, distance learning, telemedicine and other disciplines” of human spaceflight.771 
 
25 August 
Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation announced that NASA had selected the company 
to build two spacecraft for the Space Technology 3 (ST-3) Mission, part of NASA’s New 
Millenium Program. The contract, valued at US$50 million, covered the development and 
manufacture of the two spacecraft as well as the integration and testing of completed systems. 
NASA planned for the two spacecraft, flying 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) apart, to demonstrate 
interferometry, simulating a single large telescope. NASA’s JPL was responsible for developing 
the interferometer and formation-flying sensing technologies, as well as for managing the 
mission.772 
 
26 August 
NASA released two initial images from its Chandra X-ray Observatory. One image traced “the 
aftermath of a gigantic stellar explosion in such stunning detail” that scientists believed they had 
detected evidence of a neutron star or black hole near the center. The second image showed “a 
powerful x-ray jet blasting 200,000 light-years into intergalactic space from a distant quasar.”

confirming that the observatory was performing up to expectations.773 
 
27 August 
Cosmonauts Viktor M. Afanasyev and Sergei V. Avdeyev departed Mir with their French 
colleague Jean-Pierre Haigneré, leaving the station empty for the first time in 13½ years. On 2 
August, in preparation for the departure, the crew had installed a new computer, which provided 
orientation and docking management systems to keep the station in orbit during the absence of a 
crew. The crew had also installed a ground-controlled backup system, which would prevent the 
station from crashing to Earth if a malfunction occurred on board the station.774 
 
30 August 
Lockheed Martin cleared its Atlas II rocket to resume the 1999 launch schedule, after having 
placed its schedule on hold when a Delta III launch failed in early May. Delta’s RL10B-2, upper-
stage engine was similar to the RL10A-4 used on Atlas’s Centaur upper stage. The Boeing 
Company and Pratt & Whitney had led the investigation of the Delta III launch failure, with the 
support of Lockheed Martin. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin Astronautics had formed two panels 
“to ensure that no aspects of commonality between the RL10 engine versions were overlooked.” 
The Senior Engineering Review Panel and the Senior Management Review Team had addressed 
potential causes of launch failure identified in the Delta III investigation, ruling out those factors 
that did not apply to Atlas flights. When the investigators had determined that “an engine-
brazing process that left voids in combustion chamber structural jacket splice joints” was 
common to all RL10 engines, Lockheed Martin had instituted a new set of inspection and 
analysis measures for accepting or rejecting each engine. Lockheed Martin intended to use the 
inspection techniques on new production chambers; Pratt & Whitney planned to continue using 
its standard procedure, with its Flight Certification Board certifying each set of RL10 engines for 
all Atlas missions.775 
 
GAO published a report, “Space Station: Russian Commitment and Cost Control Problems,” 
reiterating its previous recommendation to NASA to plan for a scenario in which Russia was 
unable to fulfill its commitments to the ISS. Although the report recognized that NASA was in 
the process of drafting such a plan, GAO’s sole recommendation to NASA was to ensure the 
contingency plan’s completion before the launch of the Russian-built Service Module.776

The Independent Assessment Team on Mission Success, which Lockheed Martin had 
commissioned in May 1999 after a series of Titan IV launch failures, met its 1 September 
deadline, reporting its findings and recommendations to Lockheed’s senior management. 
Lockheed Martin had tasked the investigating team with assessing program management, 
engineering and manufacturing processes, and quality-control procedures within the company’s 
Space and Strategic Missiles Sector. Having discovered problems in accountability, quality, 
subcontract and supplier management, and cost emphasis, the Team recommended that the 
company develop a “fly-out plan” for Titan IV’s remaining missions, improve its quality control, 
and improve its management of suppliers and subcontractors. Chairperson of the review panel A. 
Thomas Young remarked that regardless of the problems the team had uncovered, the panel had 
also found “enormous fundamental technical strengths” throughout the sector, as well as “highly 
capable and dedicated” staff. Young also commented that the new leadership team was “off to a 
positive start.” Vance D. Coffman, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer for Lockheed 
Martin, “endorsed the panel’s findings and pledged Lockheed Martin to implementing its 
recommendations.”777 
 
31 August 
Kazakhstan lifted its ban on launches of Russian Proton rockets after Moscow paid US$270,000 
in compensation for the 5 July crash of one of the booster rockets and completed an agreed-upon 
joint investigation. The lifting of the ban cleared the way for two Russian Yamal-100 
communications satellites to launch aboard a Proton rocket on 6 September. Although initially 
the country had banned all launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome, which Russia had rented since 
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan had modified the ban to bar only Proton rocket 
launches, pending a joint investigation of the accident.778 
 
SEPTEMBER 1999 
3 September 
NASA announced its decision to ground the entire Space Shuttle fleet while technicians 
continued detailed inspections of the fleet’s wiring. During the first month of inspections, 
following the discovery that faulty wiring had caused a short circuit during Columbia’s 23 July 
launch, technicians had located dozens of nicked or exposed wires. Shuttle managers had 
decided to extend the inspections to allow technicians to examine additional parts of each 
Shuttle. Technicians had replaced damaged wiring, encased some wires in plastic tubing, added 
Teflon wrapping to others, and replaced some connectors, to protect the wiring systems against 
future damage. Manager of the Space Shuttle Program Ronald D. Dittemore explained that the 
wiring problems “appeared to have been caused by work-related mechanical damage”⎯from 
being rubbed or stepped on or from having “heavy objects set down on them.” The age of the 
wiring, normal wear, or vibrations from Shuttle operations did not appear to have caused the 
damage.779

NASA announced that its new orbiting SeaWinds radar instrument, flying aboard the QuikSCAT 
satellite, was successfully tracking Iceberg B10A, which had broken off the Thwaites glacier of 
Antarctica in 1992, drifting into a shipping lane. Earlier in 1999, Iceberg B10A had disappeared 
when conventional methods of tracking sea-surface ice⎯ships’ radar, shipping reports, optical 
images from satellites, and microwave sensor data⎯were unable to track it. David G. Long of 
the SeaWinds science team at Utah’s Brigham Young University remarked that, although “a ship 
was dispatched to the iceberg’s last known position, we were unable to find it until we started 
receiving data from the SeaWinds instrument in July.” During its first pass over Antarctica, 
SeaWinds had spotted the iceberg, and the National Ice Center in Suitland, Maryland, had 
confirmed that the iceberg was B10A. Scientists had continued to track it as it moved through the 
Drake Passage and headed northeast between Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South 
America, and the Antarctic Peninsula. At that time, the National Ice Center had issued an iceberg 
navigation warning to Argentina.780 
 
8 September 
NASA announced that scientists at Ames Research Center (ARC), who were developing an 
autonomous robot called the Personal Satellite Assistant (PSA), had completed a key test of the 
robot’s components. NASA planned to use the robot to support future space missions, equipping 
it with a variety of sensors to monitor environmental conditions inside a spacecraft, such as the 
amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases in the air; the amount of bacterial growth in 
the environment; the air temperature; and the air pressure. The development of the PSA was the 
next phase in developing advanced information technologies, following the success of the 
Wireless Network Experiment, which NASA’s ARC had conducted for the International Space 
Station (ISS) in 1995. Atlantis astronauts had discovered that wireless computer network systems 
worked well in a space environment during Mission STS-76, when they tested these networks 
and found that radio signals from wireless computers did not interfere with the electronic 
equipment of the Shuttle or of Mir. The experiment’s success had prompted the astronauts to 
recommend using handheld, wireless, portable data assistants to support mission operations on 
the future ISS. ARC scientists had taken the idea a step further, designing autonomous intelligent 
robots that would free the astronauts’ hands. ARC scientists had also designed the PSA to handle 
routine “housekeeping chores,” such as monitoring inventory and performing environmental 
sensor-calibration checks, so that astronauts would have more time to focus on research tasks.781 
 
9 September 
A Russian Soyuz booster launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome 450 miles (724 kilometers) north 
of Moscow, carrying German, French, and Swedish research devices. In selecting the launch 
location, Russia was attempting to increase its use of the Plesetsk launch facility because of its 
problems continuing to launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, Russia had rented the Baikonur launch facility from Kazakhstan.782

NASA’s Inspector General Roberta L. Gross published findings and recommendations on behalf 
of NASA’s Office of Inspector General, regarding Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr.’s proposed 
Triana satellite project, named for Rodrigo de Triana, the sailor on Christopher Columbus’s 
1492 voyage who had first spotted North America. The Triana project would call on NASA to 
provide “continuous, satellite-generated images of the Earth for posting on the Internet.” Gross 
suggested that it was “ill-advised for the financially strapped [A]gency to fund a new system to 
collect pictures of Earth when many images” were already widely available. Gross said the 
Triana project would cost four times as much as the Vice President’s US$50 million estimate, 
noting that NASA had already spent US$41 million on the project, even though Congress had 
not yet endorsed it. She criticized NASA for “pressing forward with the project without fully 
assessing the scientific value of photographing the Earth.” NASA had scheduled the satellite for 
launch aboard a Space Shuttle in December 2000.783 
 
20 September 
AlliedSignal Technical Services, based in Columbia, Maryland, named as its president former 
astronaut and Space Shuttle Program Office executive James C. Adamson, who had logged 334 
hours in orbit during Missions STS-28 and STS-43. AlliedSignal Technical Services had a staff 
of 1,800 in Maryland and responsibility for oversight of most of the “spacecraft ground and 
flight control at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt [Maryland].” In accepting 
the appointment, Adamson was leaving his position as Chief Operating Officer of United Space 
Alliance (USA), which operated the Shuttle program for NASA.784 
 
Lockheed Martin announced a “sweeping reorganization” of key leadership positions, in 
response to recommendations of the review panel chaired by A. Thomas Young. The Young 
Panel had urged the company to make structural changes to correct quality-control problems at 
Astronautics, the unit responsible for Atlas, Titan, and Athena rocket development. In response 
to the panel’s recommendation to divide the two tasks of product assurance and mission success, 
Astronautics President G. Thomas Marsh appointed John P. Mari as Vice President of Product 
Assurance and Roman Matherne as Vice President for Mission Success. Marsh named John 
Parker, President of the former Mission Success and Product Assurance Section, to head the 
operations post in Lockheed Martin’s VentureStar TM Program, which the company hoped to 
develop into a future reusable launch vehicle with the potential to replace the Space Shuttle. 
Marsh appointed Joel S. Porter as Vice President for Business Development and Advanced 
Programs for Astronautics, succeeding Matthew B. Foster, who resigned. Other changes at 
Astronautics included the appointment of Claude McAnally as Vice President of Operations; the 
appointment of Grover W. Hall Jr. as Vice President of Technical Operations; and the separation 
of Technical Operations from Manufacturing Operations to better delineate responsibility and 
accountability, according to the recommendations of the Young Panel. Lockheed tasked Gareth 
D. Flora, under Marsh’s supervision, with developing, managing, and improving subcontract 
management. In addition, Flora became responsible for ensuring that the company properly

NASA announced the establishment of a review panel to examine the overall safety of Shuttle 
maintenance and refurbishment practices following the discovery of maintenance-related damage 
to the Shuttle fleet’s electrical wiring. NASA had named Director of ARC Henry McDonald to 
chair the panel. NASA Associate Administrator for Space Flight Joseph H. Rothenberg indicated 
that the other team members, not yet named, would include top maintenance experts from 
NASA, the military, the commercial aerospace industry, and the commercial aircraft industry. 
NASA required the team to assess NASA’s standard practices and recommend improvements, 
with preliminary findings due in October.786

Space.com, an Internet site devoted to covering the news and science of space, appointed Sally 
K. Ride as its President. Lou Dobbs had begun Space.com in July 1999, after resigning as

closely with Dobbs as he launched the site. The position was her “first foray into the cyberspace 
after a long career in space research, policy, and education.787 
 
23 September 
Former astronauts Michael J. McCulley, Vice President and Deputy Program Manager for USA, 
and William F. Readdy, NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight, testified 
before the U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics regarding wiring 
damage found in Space Shuttles Columbia, Discovery, Endeavour, and Atlantis. In its first 
official report since discovering that frayed wires had caused the short circuit 5 seconds into 
Columbia’s launch on 23 July, NASA informed committee members that wiring inspections and 
maintenance had cost US$350,000. NASA had not yet calculated the cost of the ongoing safety 
“stand down.” NASA also indicated that it did not intend to pay USA the US$2.5 million the 
company would have earned if it had punctually delivered the next Shuttle scheduled for launch. 
McCulley had indicated that his company accepted “full responsibility for wiring damage” found 
in all four Shuttles, despite the fact that the wiring problems might have stemmed from 
maintenance conducted before USA took over operational responsibility. Committee members 
expressed their concern that NASA planned to request more money for the repairs, but Readdy 
replied that such a scenario was unlikely, because USA would be responsible for making the 
repairs. Committee members also were worried about whether Shuttle launches and flights could 
maintain adequate safety levels when the Shuttle team had only a few opportunities to practice 
their skills. NASA Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance Frederick D. 
Gregory responded that simulation launches, in combination with a flight rate of two launches 
per year, were sufficient to keep a launch team’s skills sharp.788

NASA scientists lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft as it entered its Martian 
orbit and disappeared behind the planet, a little less than a year after the launch of its Mars 
mission in December 1998. Mars Surveyor Project Manager John B. McNamee said that the 
orbit-insertion burn, a 16-minute-long burn to slow the spacecraft down as it enters orbit, had 
begun on time. The team of NASA scientists observed 5 minutes of the burn before the craft 
went behind Mars. At that point, the craft stopped communicating. Communication did not 
resume at the time the team expected the craft to reappear from the far side of the planet. 
McNamee reported that the latest navigation results showed that the craft had entered its orbit 
lower than his team had planned, indicating that NASA’s navigation predictions at the tracking 
station may have been incorrect. Carl B. Pilcher, Science Director for Solar System Exploration 
at NASA Headquarters, commented that, although losing the spacecraft was very serious, the 
loss was “not devastating to the Mars Surveyor Program as a whole,” because the mission of 
Mars Polar Lander, scheduled to arrive at Mars two months after Mars Climate Orbiter, was 
independent of that of Orbiter.789 
 
25 September 
Space Shuttle Columbia, the oldest of NASA’s four orbiters, landed at a U.S. Air Force plant in 
California for a “long-overdue tune-up.” The orbiter’s overhaul, expected to last until July 2000, 
came months late because of delays related to the launch of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. 
Columbia astronauts had deployed Chandra during a mission in July 1999. The inspection and 
overhaul was Columbia’s fourth since entering service in 1981.790 
 
28 September 
NASA announced that after just two months in space, the Chandra X-ray Observatory had taken 
“a stunning image of the Crab Nebula,” revealing for the first time “a brilliant ring about the 
nebula’s heart.” The Crab Nebula, located 6,000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation 
Taurus, is the remnant of a star that Chinese astronomers had observed exploding in 1054 A.D., 
when it “appeared suddenly and remained visible for weeks, even during daytime.” Astronomers 
had used “virtually every astronomical instrument” to study the Crab’s area of the sky, 
discovering that unlocking its mysteries led to “insight after insight” into how the universe 
works. Astronomers had linked the origin of pulsars to supernovas and confirmed the cosmic 
origin of chemical elements through the study of the “expanding cloud of filaments” in the Crab. 
The new image showed the Crab pulsar “accelerating particles up to the speed of light and 
flinging them out into interstellar space at an incredible rate.” Using Chandra’s “exceptional 
resolution,” scientists had traced the jet all the way to the neutron star, where the ring pattern 
clearly appeared. Previously, Hubble Space Telescope images had revealed “moving knots and 
wisps around the neutron star,” and other x-ray images had shown the outer portions of the jet, 
only hinting at the ring structure.791

30 September 
NASA released preliminary findings of an internal peer review conducted at Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) after the apparent loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft as it entered its 
orbit on 23 September. The results of the review indicated that “a failure to recognize and correct 
an error in a transfer of information between the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft team in 
Colorado and the mission navigation team in California led to the loss of the spacecraft.” The 
peer review discovered that “one team had used English units while the other used metric units 
for a key spacecraft operation.” NASA’s systems engineers had failed to detect the error. In 
addition to the JPL committee, NASA had formed a separate review committee of experts from 
within and outside of JPL and planned to establish an independent failure-review board 
shortly.792 
 
NASA announced that new findings from the Galileo spacecraft indicated the presence of 
sulfuric acid on the frozen surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa. Sulfuric acid is a corrosive 
chemical found in car batteries. Robert W. Carlson of NASA’s JPL, the lead author of a paper 
published in the journal Science, was Principal Investigator for Galileo’s Near Infrared Mapping 
Spectrometer, which located the chemical. The new findings corroborated Galileo’s earlier 
spectrometer data analyses, suggesting the presence of sulfate salts on Europa. Despite 
indications that a liquid ocean may exist under Europa’s crust, Carlson had initially thought the 
presence of sulfuric acid would end debate over whether it was possible for Europa to contain 
biological life. However, his colleague Kenneth H. Nealson suggested the opposite, remarking 
that sulfur and sulfuric acid are oxidants⎯energy sources known to us on Earth. Therefore, 
Nealson proposed that the findings should encourage scientists to search for “any possible links 
between the sulfur oxidants on Europa’s surface and natural fuels produced from Europa’s hot 
interior.”793 
 
OCTOBER 1999 
1 October 
V. Philip Rasmussen Jr., Head of the Department of Plants, Soils, and Biometeorology at Utah 
State University, began work as NASA’s first and only agricultural extension agent, with the task 
of disseminating to American farmers satellite data that could increase their productivity. In 1917 
Congress had established the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Cooperative Extension Service, 
operating out of land-grant universities and serving every county in the country. Through this 
program, the federal government had made research-based agricultural information available to 
the public in exchange for federal resource support at the universities. Initially, Cooperative 
Extension Service agents had focused on farm and ranch questions, but the program had evolved 
to assist home gardeners, greenhouse users, and businesses as well. After studying the land-grant 
university system, NASA had decided to create a space-grant consortium system to provide the 
public with access to space science, such as the sciences of remote sensing and crop 
management. These scientific fields had developed significantly since the 1970s, when

Rasmussen had used Landsat data strategically to predict Russian crop yields. At that time, the 
U.S. government was not using Landsat data to assist American farmers, but under NASA’s new 
space-grant program, Rasmussen’s primary task would be to make such satellite data available, 
through the existing county extension service, so that county agents could teach farmers how to 
use the data to improve crop yield. Rasmussen described his extension work⎯using the global 
positioning satellite (GPS) program in tandem with the geographic information system⎯as 
“precision agriculture,” because farmers could use the data to make informed adjustments 
concerning methods of watering and fertilizing fields of various soil types.794 
 
The Perseus B research aircraft, built by Aurora Flight Sciences Inc., sustained moderate damage 
when it crashed on a California highway during a flight from NASA’s Dryden Flight Research 
Center (DFRC) in Edwards, California. The craft was a “developmental vehicle designed to 
operate at high altitudes for extended periods on scientific sampling missions,” one of several 
aircraft that NASA was evaluating as part of its Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor 
Technology program. Controllers could operate the craft remotely from a ground station, or the 
Perseus B could navigate autonomously along a preprogrammed flight path. At the time of the 
accident, ground-based Aurora Flight Sciences mission controllers at Edwards Air Force Base 
were guiding the Perseus B. DFRC flight safety officials, with assistance from Aurora Flight 
Sciences operations staff, formed an accident investigation team to determine the exact cause of 
the crash.795 
 
NASA announced that scientists studying high-resolution images from Mars Global Surveyor 
had detected no evidence that ocean shorelines once existed on Mars. Previously, researchers had 
interpreted features in images from NASA’s Viking missions of the 1970s as remnants of ancient 
coastlines. However, Surveyor images taken in 1998, with a resolution 5 to 10 times sharper than 
images that Viking had produced had not provided evidence that water in a coastal environment 
had formed those features. Michael C. Malin of Malin Space Science Systems, Principal 
Investigator for the Mars Orbiter Camera aboard Surveyor, remarked that although scientists 
could not rule out the presence of oceans on Mars at one time, the evidence in the new images 
appeared to undermine the “foundation for the ‘ocean hypothesis’ developed in the 1980s on the 
basis of suspected shorelines.” Nevertheless, Malin acknowledged “significant other evidence of 
water on Mars in the past,” suggesting that as the Mars Orbiter Camera continued to acquire new 
high-resolution images, scientists might have new clues to the role of water in the evolution of 
Mars.796 
 
2 October 
The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) successfully conducted the first of a series of tests of a 
proposed missile defense system. An unarmed Minuteman missile, carrying a dummy warhead 
and decoy balloon, launched over the Pacific Ocean from Vandenberg Air Force Base; 20 
minutes later an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, a 55-inch-long (1.4-meter-long), 120-pound 
(54.4-kilogram) device built by Raytheon Corporation, launched aboard a booster rocket from 
the Marshall Islands. The two missiles collided 10 minutes later, 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers)

DOD conducted the test, North Korea, Iran, and Syria were developing long-range missiles that 
could hit the United States.797 
 
4 October 
NASA announced its selection of three graduate students to receive Michelson fellowships 
offered by NASA’s Origins Program and its Space Interferometry Mission. NASA awarded a 
fellowship to Philip M. Hinz of the University of Arizona for his work building a new type of 
nulling interferometer designed to null the glare from nearby stars, thereby enabling scientists to 
observe, in infrared wavelengths, dust and giant planets orbiting the stars. NASA chose Erin M. 
Sabatke, also of the University of Arizona, to work on creating models of large, stretched, flat, 
plastic membranes, for collecting light from several telescopes placed on separate spacecraft 
flying in formation. Sabatke planned to explore the use of this technique to photograph planets 
around other stars. NASA selected Benjamin F. Lane, a student at California Institute of 
Technology, for his work advancing the “technique of using two stars with a narrow angle 
separating them to measure relative motion of one with respect to the other, utilizing a ground-
based interferometer.” NASA had named the fellowship program for the first American to win a 
Nobel Prize in physics, Albert Michelson, known as the father of interferometry. Interferometry 
is a technique of combing and processing light from multiple telescopes to obtain a clear image 
of distant objects. The fellowship covered tuition, a student stipend, and a small budget for travel 
and other research expenses, for three years of graduate research at the student’s host 
institution.798 
 
Vladimir Petrovsky, a member of the Russian Academy of Military Sciences, condemned the 
United States’ 2 October testing of its proposed missile defense system, noting that testing could 
“aggravate relations not only between the United States and the Asian-Pacific region, but also 
between Japan⎯a U.S. ally in the development of the system⎯and other countries.” Russia had 
refused to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would have permitted the United 
States to develop a full-fledged missile defense system. Preventing either country from 
developing missile defense systems, the Cold War–era treaty acted as a deterrent by keeping 
both the Soviet Union and the United States vulnerable to attack. Officials in Washington, DC, 
stated that DOD was testing a missile defense system intended to destroy lone missiles launched 
by rogue states or terrorists, not a system meant to protect against a multi-missile attack from a 
major nuclear power.799 
 
5 October 
Analyzing data from NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft, 
researchers proved for the first time that smoke from forest fires inhibits rainfall. TRMM, a 
mission of the United States and Japan and part of NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise, had been 
producing continuous data since December 1997. Daniel Rosenfeld of the Institute of Earth 
Sciences at Hebrew University in Jerusalem had studied the data, finding that clouds polluted 
with heavy smoke significantly inhibit warm rain processes. When smoke pollutes them, cloud

tops must “grow considerably above the freezing level” to produce rain through a different 
process. Rosenfeld remarked that the results of his research had validated earlier studies, which 
showed that urban air pollution inhibits rainfall. Christian D. Kummerow, a TRMM scientist at 
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) commented that such findings were “making the 
first inroads into the difficult problem of understanding humanity’s impacts on global 
precipitation.”800 
 
6 October 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named Arthur G. Stephenson, Director of NASA’s 
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, to head the Mars Climate Orbiter 
Mission Failure Investigation Board. Mars Climate Orbiter had disappeared on 23 September as 
it entered orbit around Mars. Goldin tasked the board with independently reviewing all aspects of 
the mission’s failure, to verify whether it had been the result of an inadequacy in NASA’s 
interplanetary navigation systems. Preliminary findings from an internal peer review at NASA’s 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory indicated that “a failure to recognize and correct an error in a transfer 
of information between the spacecraft team in Colorado and the mission navigation team in 
California” had caused the loss of the spacecraft. Goldin instructed the board to report its initial 
findings by 3 November.801 
 
NASA researchers at MSFC unveiled an experimental 50-foot (15-meter) track using magnetic 
levitation (maglev) technology to propel a 30-pound (13.6-kilogram) model of a spacecraft, at a 
speed of 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour, in 0.5 seconds. MSFC researchers had sought to 
reduce launch costs, as well as to reduce space-vehicle size with the development of a maglev 
launch-assist system. The maglev track was theoretically capable of propelling and releasing a 
spacecraft at 600 miles (965 kilometers) per hour; wing design would then lift the craft and “give 
it a kick start” before the ignition of the rocket’s engines. MSFC Manager of Launch 
Technologies Sherry Buschmann commented that the researchers believed the use of maglev 
technology could cut launch vehicle size by 20 percent. NASA’s industry partner in the 
experimental technology was PRT Advanced Maglev Systems Inc. of Park Forest, Illinois.802 
 
NASA released new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the cores of spiral galaxies like 
the Milky Way, and astronomers studying the images for clues about galactic development 
discussed their findings at a briefing at NASA Headquarters. Two complementary surveys by 
independent research teams had concluded that the Hubble images confirmed the evolutionary 
link between a disc-like cloud of dust and gas at the center of a galaxy and a bulge of millions of 
stars at the center of the disc-like cloud. The central bulge stabilizes a galaxy’s development, 
controls the birth of stars in the galaxy’s core, and “holds secrets as to how and when a galaxy 
formed.” Reynier F. Peletier of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom confirmed 
that central bulges of “more tightly wound spirals” formed at approximately the same time in the 
early universe. C. Marcello Carollo of Columbia University, who had led a team studying

galaxies with small bulges and “bar-like structures that bisect the nucleus,” had discovered that 
such galaxies developed more recently. Both teams had used HST’s visible-light and infrared 
cameras to determine the stars’ true colors, a measure of the age of the stars inside the galaxies’ 
core.803 
 
7 October 
A Delta II rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying a NAVSTAR Block 2R GPS 
satellite, the third in a new series of GPS spacecraft; Lockheed Martin was under contract with 
the U.S. Air Force to launch 21 GPS craft. The NAVSTAR Block 2R military navigational 
satellite became the 28th operational spacecraft in the GPS constellation, to replace an older 
satellite in the network after completing a one-month test period. The U.S. Air Force had 
originally planned to launch the replacement craft in May 1999, but after a rainstorm had 
damaged the satellite while it was sitting on the launchpad, the Air Force had returned it to 
Lockheed Martin Missile and Space for repairs. Two hurricanes, a tropical storm, and other 
rainstorms had caused additional weather delays, preventing the launch of an alternate 
replacement satellite.804 
 
10 October 
NASA’s Galileo probe survived intense radiation emanating from Jupiter during a “do-or-die 
effort,” when the spacecraft came within 380 miles (611 kilometers) of Jupiter’s volcanic moon 
Io. The craft experienced computer problems when passing through the densest part of Jupiter’s 
radiation belt, but 1 hour after Galileo’s closest encounter with Io, all of its systems had resumed 
normal functioning. Duane Bindschadler, Manager of Science Operations for the Galileo 
Program, explained that close-up study of Io could help scientists learn about the behavior of 
volcanoes, thereby helping them predict the behavior of volcanoes on Earth. However, because 
Jupiter’s radiation field could damage or destroy the spacecraft, NASA had planned the close 
flyby for the end of the two-year extended mission, following Galileo’s original two-year 
mission.805 
 
12 October 
Space Imaging Inc., a private company owned by Lockheed Martin and based in Thornton, 
Colorado, released a photograph taken from space of the intersection of 14th Street, NW, and 
Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC. President William J. Clinton had approved the 
development of private space cameras in 1994, but Space Imaging had been the first company to 
successfully build and launch a spacecraft with such a camera, launching its Eastman Kodak–
built camera on 24 September and testing it on 30 September. The commercial image rivaled the 
products of military spy technology, showing objects as small as 3 feet (0.9 meter) wide. Space 
Imaging’s test image showed the Washington Monument, part of the Ellipse, and the buildings of 
the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Museum of American History.806

13 October 
At the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Sciences, 
research group leaders from the University of Texas at Austin announced that scientists had 
sifted through the data from Earth-based observatories and from spacecraft such as the HST, 
obtained from the controlled crash of NASA’s Lunar Prospector into a crater near the south pole 
of the Moon on 31 July. The researchers reported that they had identified “no observable 
signature of water” in the Moon’s crater. The announcement confirmed the conclusion reached at 
the time of the crash. The Lunar Prospector spacecraft had launched on 6 January 1998. In 
March 1998, mission scientists had announced the first tentative findings of the presence of 
water ice on both of the Moon’s poles. The controlled crash, proposed by engineers and 
astronomers at the University of Texas, was “a low-budget attempt to wring one last bit of 
productivity from the low-cost” mission. NASA had accepted the proposal because of the 
successful peer review of the idea, and because the craft’s useful life was nearing its end.807 
 
14 October 
NASA announced its selection of the next two missions of its Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) 
Program. The first mission, headed by Neil Gehrels of NASA’s GSFC and planned for launch in 
2003, was the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer, a three-telescope space observatory designed 
with the “unique ability to rotate in orbit and point its gamma-ray telescope, x-ray telescope, and 
ultraviolet/optical telescope at gamma-ray bursts [GRBs] within minutes of the burst’s first 
appearance.” The second mission, led by Kenneth J. Johnston of the U.S. Naval Observatory, 
was the Full-Sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer (FAME), scheduled to launch in 2004, a space 
telescope designed to “obtain highly precise position and brightness measurements of 40 million 
stars.” From a group of five missions selected in January 1999, NASA had chosen these two 
missions for detailed four-month feasibility studies, examining cost, management, and technical 
plans, such as small business involvement and educational outreach. NASA had originally 
received 31 full proposals in August 1998. Associate Administrator for Space Science Edward J. 
Weiler remarked that the selection of the two missions had been the most difficult he had made 
during his 21 years at NASA, because, over the years, the space science community had been 
submitting to NASA a steadily increasing number of first-class concepts for smaller missions.808 
 
Two satellites, the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-1), sometimes called ZY-1 in 
Chinese reports, and the Brazilian Saci-1 satellite, launched atop a Chinese Long March 3B 
rocket from Taiyuan Launch Center in central China. Brazil and China had jointly financed the 
1,500-kilogram (3,307-pound) CBERS-1, which carried three high-resolution cameras for 
monitoring environmental and vegetation conditions in Brazil and China, as well as in other, 
unspecified locations. Brazil had designed the 60-kilogram (132-pound) Saci-1 microsatellite to 
monitor cosmic rays, the magnetic field, and plasma. Shortly after launch, communications with 
the craft failed.809

18 October 
NASA released its newest and most accurate map of the continent of Antarctica, created from 
data that the Canadian Space Agency’s (CSA’s) RADARSAT-1 satellite had collected over an 
18-day period during the spring of 1997. Vexel Corporation of Boulder, Colorado, had 
developed software to generate a mosaic of the continent from “many small images made from 
different angles and orientations of the satellite.” Project officials and scientists remarked that the 
most important discoveries resulting from the radar images concerned the network of ice 
streams; the new satellite data revealed that the streams traveled “enormous distances at speeds 
up to 3,000 feet (914 meters) per year⎯100 times faster than the flow of surrounding ice.” The 
CSA had begun planning RADARSAT in 1980, because of Canada’s interest in using a high-
resolution radar satellite to monitor shipping channels in the Arctic. NASA’s negotiations with 
the CSA had resulted in an agreement: NASA would launch the satellite and provide software 
and data analysis in exchange for access to some of the data the satellite produced. Additionally, 
the CSA would make at least two imaging scans of Antarctica. RADARSAT had launched from 
Vandenberg Air Force Base on 4 November 1995, but, until 1997, Canadian controllers had not 
completed a difficult rotation of the satellite, necessary to place Antarctica in full view. Once 
correctly oriented, RADARSAT had been able to complete the imaging in 18 days because it 
could collect data anytime of the day or night and in any weather. The last satellite map of 
Antarctica had used images from five different satellites, spanning the years 1980 to 1994.810 
 
20 October 
President William J. Clinton signed into law the FY 2000 appropriations bill for the Department 
of Veterans Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and Other Agencies, which 
included the US$13.65 billion NASA budget. Congress had approved NASA’s budget on 7 
October. In keeping with the President’s original request, the final appropriation included full 
funding for the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle program; US$80 million for 
Spaceliner 100, an MSFC program to find new propulsion technology; US$25 million for Shuttle 
upgrades; US$5 million for the National Center for Space Research and Technology, a joint 
venture including MSFC, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and private industry; and 
US$3 million to continue research into tether-guided satellites. The U.S. House of 
Representatives’ version of the bill had cut US$900 million from NASA’s funding, but the U.S. 
Senate had approved a budget equal to NASA’s FY 1999 budget: US$13.6 billion. House 
Republicans had voted to eliminate funding for Triana, a controversial Earth-observing satellite 
first envisioned by Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr., but the House and Senate conference 
committee had voted on a compromise, providing for the National Academy of Sciences to 
review the program and forbidding NASA from launching Triana until 1 January 2001.811

Space Laboratory at University College, London, announced that NASA had selected them to 
participate in its Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer mission. NASA’s mission called for the two

scientists to use a pair of specialized telescopes, one measuring ultraviolet and visible light and 
the other measuring x-ray light, to study GRBs, the “unpredictable powerful explosions in space 
that sometimes last less than one second.” A collaboration of Italian, British, and U.S. scientists, 
the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer was one of NASA’s medium-class explorer missions, 
scheduled for launch in 2003.812 
 
Brazilian space officials, having lost contact with their country’s Saci-1 satellite days after its 
launch, asked NASA to help them rescue the US$4.6 million satellite. Saci-1 had launched on 14 
October from China along with another satellite, the CBERS-1, which the two countries had built 
jointly. Brazil asked NASA to photograph the satellite, check its condition, and devise a plan for 
its recovery. President of the Brazilian Space Agency Luis Meira Filho remarked that Brazil had 
not given “the satellite up for lost,” because space officials knew its location. The CBERS-1 
satellite was functioning normally and had returned images of Brazil.813 
 
22 October 
NASA released an image of Jupiter’s volcanic moon Io, captured at the closest range ever 
accomplished. The image, which NASA’s spacecraft Galileo took during a flyby of the moon on 
10 October, showed a lava field near the center of an erupting volcano named Pillan, with visible 
new lava flows from its volcanic center. To capture most of the new images of Io, Galileo had 
used a fast camera mode, in which the camera preprocesses the image, averaging the brightness 
in its adjacent parts. However, Io’s radiation had disrupted the process, degrading the quality of 
the images. Radiation had not affected images, including the newly released image of Pillan, 
taken in other camera modes. Galileo Project Manager James K. Erickson remarked that Galileo 
would not use the fast camera mode during the next Io flyby.814 
 
27 October 
New York Governor George E. Pataki awarded NASA astronaut Eileen M. Collins of Elmira, 
New York, the state’s highest award, the Jackie Robinson Empire State Freedom Medal, for her 
achievement as the first female Space Shuttle Commander. Collins had been Commander of the 
historic Mission STS-93.  During that mission, she and her crew had deployed the Chandra X-
ray Observatory, the heaviest, largest, and most powerful x-ray telescope ever launched into 
space. Governor Pataki described Collins as “a bold pioneer of the reaches of space” and 
remarked that “her talent, intelligence and courage set an example that every woman and every 
man can hope to duplicate in their lives.” Every year New York presents the Empire State 
Freedom Medal, established in 1997, to “those who best demonstrate the qualities of 
determination, dignity, fairness, and honor that were exemplified by Jackie Robinson, who broke 
major league baseball’s color barrier.”815

failure of a Proton rocket in three months. The Russian Space Agency formed a commission to 
investigate the crash. Kazakhstan had temporarily banned Proton launches from Baikonur 
following a launch failure on 5 July, but Proton rockets had launched from the facility 
successfully on 6 and 26 September.816 
 
28 October 
Kazakhstan imposed a new ban on Russian launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome following the 
previous day’s crash of a Proton booster rocket, which had malfunctioned shortly after launch. 
Without naming a figure, Kazakhstan announced that it would require Russia to pay 
compensation in an amount significantly higher than the fee that Kazakhstan had charged Russia 
after the 5 July Proton crash. In addition, the Kazakhstan government formed a special 
commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Pavlov to investigate the accident.817 
 
NOVEMBER 1999 
2 November 
NASA announced that Administrator Daniel S. Goldin would present Simon Ramo and Bernard 
A. Schriever with NASA’s Distinguished Public Service Medal on 5 November at the start of a 
daylong conference. NASA, the U.S. Air Force Space Command, the National Air and Space 
Museum, the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, and the National Space 
Society were cosponsoring the conference, “Developing U.S. Launch Capability: The Role of 
Civil-Military Cooperation.” The award recognized the leadership of Ramo and Schriever during 
the early years of the U.S. space program. Ramo had been the chief scientist and leading civilian 
in the Air Force program to build the first U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile system. His work 
had fostered cooperation between the U.S. Air Force and aeronautics industry, the necessary 
foundation of the space program. Schriever had pioneered the development of the first ballistic 
missile for the United States; the resulting rocket technology had led to NASA’s successes in its 
early human spaceflight programs.818 
 
3 November 
A large section of the outer wall of one of the Lockheed Martin X-33 rocket plane’s two liquid 
hydrogen fuel tanks separated 2 hours after completing pressure and structural tests at NASA’s 
Marshall Space Flight Center. Lockheed intended the X-33 prototype to lead to the development 
of its VentureStar TM Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), and NASA planned to replace its fleet of 
Space Shuttles with a fleet of Lockheed’s VentureStar TM RLVs after 2012. The latest problem 
potentially delayed the X-33’s first test flight at least an additional six months, essentially 
guaranteeing that Lockheed Martin would be unable to produce an operational VentureStar TM 
vehicle by 2004. NASA had “placed a huge wager” on the VentureStar TM, committing US$941 
million to the X-33 program, which had been threatened by technical problems and cost overruns 
for more than a year. U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) examiners had criticized the

full-scale reusable vehicle.”819 
 
GAO reported that NASA had “inadvertently exported radiation-hardened, microcircuit, optical 
coupler parts to Russia,” relying on the manufacturer’s statement that the so-called rad-hard parts 
were not on the U.S. Department of State’s Munitions List and that, therefore, NASA was not 
required to obtain an export license. GAO also reported that NASA was “preparing to export 
sensitive encryption technology to Japan and Europe,” technology transfers related to building 
the International Space Station (ISS). Under international agreements related to the space station, 
NASA was obligated to deliver, disclose, or transfer certain technology, data, and commodities 
to other nations involved in building the ISS. GAO had investigated NASA’s export-control 
procedures after members of Congress expressed concern about safeguards to protect technology 
and information exported to support the ISS. GAO evaluators’ conclusions were similar to those 
of NASA’s Inspector General, who had reported earlier that NASA’s export-control procedures 
were likely inadequate for the technology exchanges necessary under the ISS program.820 
 
5 November 
NASA announced that its scientists had developed a new Digital Tectonic Activity Map 
(DTAM) of the Earth, pinpointing geologically and volcanically active features of the planet 
over the last 1 million years. Whereas most global geological maps were “plate maps,” 
emphasizing the definition of plate boundaries of the planet’s crust and current seismic or 
volcanic activity, the new tectonic map portrayed the broad architecture of Earth’s crust, 
identifying all current and past geological activity. NASA had primarily generated the DTAM 
using publicly available data and commercial software, but had also used spacecraft data, 
including Landsat images, hand-held astronaut photography, and radar altimetry of sea-surface 
measurements gathered by NASA spacecraft.821 
 
8 November 
Engineers discovered that exposure to 11 months of cold temperatures in outer space could cause 
the descent engine on Mars Polar Lander to malfunction. NASA had scheduled Mars Polar 
Lander to land on Mars on 3 December. Lander’s companion craft, Mars Climate Orbiter had 
burned up as it entered its Martian orbit on 23 September. The investigative panel studying the 
cause of Orbiter’s loss had uncovered the potential problem with Lander’s engines. Because of 
the discovery, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) altered their plans, deciding

10 November 
The Mars Climate Orbiter Mission Failure Investigation Board released its first report, 
identifying eight contributing factors that had led to the 23 September loss of Orbiter as it 
entered its Martian orbit. Arthur Stephenson, chairperson of the board investigating the failure, 
agreed with NASA on the causes of the mission’s failure. The board reported that “the failed 
translation of English units into metric units in a segment of ground-based, navigation-related 
mission software” was the primary cause of the loss, but that other significant factors had set the 
stage for the mission’s failure. Moreover, the team had failed to identify and correct multiple 
mistakes, leading to “a major error in our understanding of the spacecraft’s path as it approached 
Mars.” The failure board faulted the Mars Climate Orbiter team with “inadequate consideration 
of the entire mission and its postlaunch operation as a total system, inconsistent communications 
and training within the project, and lack of complete end-to-end verification of navigation 
software.” Although engineers working with Lockheed Martin Astronautics’ mission operations 
team had failed to convert English units into metric for entering data into ground-based 
navigation software, the investigating board focused most of its attention on the navigation team 
at NASA’s JPL, which had overall management authority for the mission. The board remarked 
that, because it had navigated interplanetary spacecraft successfully for 30 years, JPL had 
developed a “widespread perception that ‘Orbiting Mars is routine’,” leading it to pay inadequate 
attention to the risk of faulty navigation.823 
 
12 November 
NASA’s Office of Earth Science Enterprise selected Ball Aerospace of Boulder, Colorado, and 
Aerojet General Corporation of Azusa, California, to study the next-generation, spaceborne, 
microwave, atmospheric instrument for weather-forecasting and climate-change research, 
awarding each company a one-year, US$4 million, fixed-price contract through Goddard Space 
Flight Center. The new instrument, the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), was 
one-third the size and weight of existing microwave-sounding instruments on board the Polar-
Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) and the Earth Observing System-PM spacecraft. The 
application of new technologies, particularly in microwave electronics, had made the 
significantly smaller size of the ATMS possible. NASA intended to fly the first ATMS unit on 
the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environment Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory 
Project (NPP) mission, a joint effort between NASA and the NPOESS Program Office.

13 November 
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) entered safe mode when the fourth of six gyroscopes failed, 
halting its astronomical observations. Requiring a minimum of three operating gyroscopes to 
conduct observations, HST would remain in safe mode with a reduced power load, until Space 
Shuttle astronauts arrived with six new gyroscopes, another data recorder, a radio transmitter, 
and an improved computer. The telescope was not at risk. NASA had divided the servicing 
mission, originally scheduled for June 2000, into two missions, when the third gyroscope failed 
in February. NASA had scheduled the first part of the mission, Servicing Mission-3A, for the fall 
but rescheduled it for 6 December, because the Shuttle had wiring problems and needed its 
engine replaced. NASA had scheduled Servicing Mission-3B for mid-2001.825 
 
15 November 
NASA announced the winner of an essay contest to name the Deep Space 2 microprobes, which 
the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft was carrying to Mars. NASA had scheduled the two probes to 
crash into Mars’s south pole on 3 December. Paul Withers, a graduate student at the University 
of Arizona in Tucson, studying the thin upper atmosphere of Mars, had suggested naming the 
pair Amundsen and Scott, in honor of Roald Amundsen and Robert F. Scott, the first explorers to 
reach Earth’s South Pole. In his winning essay, Withers recalled that one century ago, Antarctica 
was Earth’s only unexplored continent. Withers wrote, “Scott perished in Antarctica. His 
memorial’s inscription reads: ‘To strive, to seek, to find, not to yield.’ These are the aims of the 
Deep Space 2.” NASA had designed the two probes with a dual purpose: to test advanced 
technology for future planetary-surface microlanders and to search for water ice 3 feet (0.9 
meters) below the Martian surface. Deep Space 2 Project Manager Sarah A. Gavit remarked that 
the names of the Antarctic explorers were appropriate for the probes, because “like Amundsen 
and Scott, Deep Space 2 will have to survive great odds, including not only braving the elements 
but also crashing into the terrain with unbelievable force.”826 
 
The main engine of Japan’s H-2 rocket malfunctioned 4 minutes after launching from 
Tanegashima Space Center, failing to put the Mtsat satellite into orbit. Fearing they could lose 
control of its trajectory, officials ordered the rocket’s destruction 8 minutes into its flight, 
marking the first time the National Space Development Agency of Japan had destroyed a rocket 
in flight. It was the second launch failure for the H-2 rocket during 1999; another H-2 had failed 
to place its payload in orbit in February. However, before the February malfunction, Japan had

16 November 
Officials at NASA’s Langley Research Center (LARC) officially opened the Center’s new 
Experimental Test Range (ETR), described as an “electromagnetic wind tunnel.” LARC 
engineers had designed the ETR to determine how low-frequency electromagnetic radiation 
affects aircraft, to help the military improve stealth technology. The ETR also would assist in 
testing technologies to enable airline passengers to watch television signals from satellites or to 
help Internet users make wireless connections. The first military customer that had signed up to 
use the ETR, the U.S. Army’s National Ground Intelligence Center, planned to use models of 
enemy targets in the test chamber, to see how they appeared on radar screens.828 
 
17 November 
NASA announced that new analysis of data from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter is 
possibly much older and colder than previously thought. Upon reaching the planet on 7 
December 1995, Galileo had dropped a probe carrying a mass spectrometer into Jupiter’s 
atmosphere to measure its chemical composition. The spectrometer had “detected surprisingly 
high concentrations of argon, krypton, and xenon,” raising questions about the noble gases’ 
provenance. Because Jupiter would have trapped the gases through condensation or freezing, 
scientists did not believe Jupiter’s atmosphere had trapped the gases at its present site. As 
positioned at present, Jupiter is too close to the Sun and too warm to have trapped the gases. 
Tobias Owen, an astronomy professor at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii 
and a member of the Galileo probe Neutral Mass Spectrometer team, suggested three hypotheses 
to explain how the gases had been trapped within the Jovian atmosphere: 1) Jupiter had formed 
in the area around the Kuiper Belt829 and was dragged inward to its present location; 2) the solar 
nebula, the cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system, had been much colder than 
scientists had previously believed; and 3) the solid materials that had brought the gases to Jupiter 
had begun to form in the original interstellar cloud of gas and dust, before the cloud had 
collapsed to form the solar nebula. Owen remarked further that, if either of the last two 
hypotheses were correct, then giant planets might be able to form closer to their stars than 
current theories had predicted. Such a finding could help explain “the new observations of 
planetary systems around other stars, in which such close-in giant planets are relatively 
common.”830

Interfax news agency reported that Russia had agreed to pay Kazakhstan US$400,000 in 
damages following the 27 October crash of a Proton rocket during its launch from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome. After reaching an agreement on compensation, Kazakhstan had lifted its launch 
ban for all Russian launches except the Proton rocket.831 
 
19 November 
NASA announced that new data and images, which the Galileo spacecraft had collected on its 
closest-ever flyby of Jupiter’s moon Io on 11 October 1999, revealed that Io, the most volcanic 
body in the solar system, was “even more active than previously suspected, with more than 100 
erupting volcanoes.” Data results from the flyby, which brought the spacecraft within 380 miles 
(611 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, had focused on Pele, Loki, and Prometheus, three of Io’s 
most active volcanoes. A close-up image of Pele showed part of the volcano glowing in the dark, 
with Pele’s hot lava behaving similarly to active lava lakes in Hawaii. Galileo’s 
Photopolarimeter Radiometer and Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer had provided detailed 
temperature maps of Loki, indicating the presence of an enormous caldera repeatedly flooded by 
lava. New data had clarified the location of lava from Prometheus, erupting, advancing, and 
producing plumes. NASA’s 1979 Voyager mission had observed a plume, and early Galileo 
images had shown a new lava flow and plume, erupting from a location 60 miles (97 kilometers) 
west of the area observed during Voyager’s mission.832 
 
21 November 
The People’s Republic of China announced it had launched into orbit its first piloted spacecraft, 
a non-reusable capsule named Shenzhou, which carried a mannequin for test purposes but was 
capable of carrying a crew of four. Xinhua news agency reported that the capsule, launched from 
Jiuquan satellite launch center aboard the new model Long March 2F, had spent 21 hours in 
space, orbiting Earth 14 times. China had built a new land- and sea-based, space-monitoring-and-
control network for the launch. China heralded the launch as a breakthrough in the Chinese 
government’s effort to “join the United States and Russia in the elite club of manned space 
flight.” The Chinese had abandoned the pursuit of human spaceflight in the late 1960s, because 
Premier Zhou Enlai thought it was too costly, but in 1992, President Jiang Zemin had decided to 
renew Chinese efforts, with the goal of putting a human in space by the end of the century. The 
head of China’s Manned Spaceflight Program told Xinhua news agency that the successful test 
flight of the Shenzhou capsule demonstrated that the Chinese spacecraft and the new Long March 
rocket performed superbly. During the mission, the Chinese had conducted experiments in 
remote sensing, environmental monitoring, space materials, astronomy, and physics. Shenzhou 
had landed in Inner Mongolia using a parachute.833

company had failed to put three satellites in orbit in April, sustaining a total loss of US$1.5 
billion. Investigations into the launch failure of a rocket using similar parts had delayed 
Lockheed International Launch Services’ maiden flight of the Atlas IIIA, causing its first 
customer, Space Systems/Loral, to launch its Telstar 7 satellite on a European Ariane booster, 
instead. NASA had lost contact with its US$125 million Lockheed Martin–built Mars Climate 
Orbiter in September and, in the subsequent investigation, had discovered that Lockheed had 
used English units of measurement instead of metric, resulting in miscalculations in navigational 
data. Although for many years Lockheed Martin had supplied satellites to the National 
Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the U.S. government agency responsible for spy satellites, in 
September the NRO had awarded a major contract to the Boeing Company to develop the next 
generation of imaging-reconnaissance satellites. Lockheed Martin also faced increased 
competition from Russia’s new Dnepr rocket, Europe’s Eurockot, and the U.S.-based Orbital 
Sciences Corporation’s Pegasus.834 
 
A Russian Soyuz rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome carrying four Globalstar satellites 
into orbit. The launch was Russia’s first from the space center in Kazakhstan, since a Proton 
rocket exploded after launch on 27 October, prompting the Kazakhstan government to reimpose 
its launch ban. Kazakhstan had lifted the ban partially after Russia agreed to pay US$400,000 in 
compensation. Media reports indicated that Russia had earned US$70 million from commercial 
launches such as that conducted for Globalstar Inc., an important income source for the Russian 
space program.835

Oleksandr Serdiuk, head of the International Relations Department of Ukraine’s Space Agency,

Ukraine to use Brazil’s Alcântara space complex to launch a new generation of Cyclone-4 
booster rockets, medium-weight rockets capable of putting 4 tons (3,600 kilograms or 3.6 
tonnes) of payload into a geostationary orbit. In 1992, when the USSR dissolved, Ukraine had 
retained part of the former Soviet Union’s space program, using several former Soviet factories 
to build rockets and selling rocket space to commercial satellite companies. Before the 
agreement with Brazil, Ukraine had only used launchpads in other former Soviet countries. 
However, Ukraine wanted to take advantage of the location of the Alcântara space complex near 
the equator, where spacecraft reach orbit more easily and commercial launches a

Dailey had begun work at NASA in 1992, after retiring from 36 years of highly decorated 
service in the U.S. Marine Corps. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin remarked that Dailey’s 
leadership at NASA had been unparalleled, and that he had “shaped and strengthened the 
[A]gency, and was responsible for developing an infrastructure that [would] carry NASA into the

new millennium.” Secretary Heyman commented on Dailey’s selection from a strong field of 
candidates, describing him as “a most impressive individual,” who had earned confidence and 
admiration throughout the air and space community and would continue the strong, dedicated 
leadership expected at the museum. In addition to managing 260 employees and a US$25 million 
budget, Dailey’s appointment placed him in charge of construction of the museum’s new 
710,000-square-foot (66,000-square-meter), hangar-style facility, expected to open at Dulles 
International Airport in December 2003. The Smithsonian had conceived the idea of the new 
facility to display its vast aeronautics and space holdings; the original National Air and Space 
Museum building was too small to house the additional collection of more than 180 aircraft and 
100 spacecraft.836 
 
27 November 
NASA’s Galileo spacecraft was unable to record its closest encounter with Jupiter’s moon Io, as 
it passed within 186 miles (299 kilometers) of the volcanic moon’s surface. Although radiation 
shut down the craft’s instruments, NASA was able to restart the instruments 4 minutes later, 
permitting Galileo to complete more than half of its planned observations. The craft had 
encountered a similar problem when it had flown within 380 miles (611 kilometers) of Io in 
October. NASA had added the close flybys of Io, located deep within the Jovian system’s 
radiation belts, to the end of Galileo’s two-year extended mission. The spacecraft had launched 
from Space Shuttle Atlantis on 18 October 1989, had begun orbiting Jupiter in December 1995, 
and had completed its primary mission in December 1997, thereafter, continuing an extended 
mission focused on Jupiter’s moon Europa, with flybys of the planet’s moons Callisto and Io, as 
well.837 
 
DECEMBER 1999 
3 December 
NASA officials and Mars Polar Lander Mission scientists were unable to communicate with 
Lander following its scheduled landing. The team had expected the first signal to arrive from the 
spacecraft at a tracking station in the Mojave Desert in California, approximately 30 minutes 
after the scheduled touchdown at 3:01 p.m. (EST). A second attempt to communicate with the 
craft had produced nothing. Before the craft’s landing, tracking data indicated that Lander had 
veered slightly off course. Flight controllers had fired its thrusters briefly to alter its approach 
angle slightly. Flight Operations Manager Sam Thurman had expressed his satisfaction with the 
new tracking data, which showed the craft heading for a point within a mile of its target.838 
 
7 December 
Mission controllers indicated that chances of ever contacting the US$165 million Mars Polar 
Lander were “remote at best,” after they failed to detect a signal during their “last best chance”

of communicating with the probe. NASA officials announced that the loss of Lander meant that 
NASA would need to drop the timetable for future Mars missions and rethink the entire Mars 
exploration program, including the scheduled launch of the next lander in 2001. NASA had 
already spent US$193 million on the planned 2001 launch. Edward J. Weiler, head of NASA’s 
Office of Space Science, indicated that NASA would convene a panel of experts to diagnose the 
Mars Polar Lander failure and to suggest a “new architecture” for its Mars program. Although 
they had set no dates, members of Congress said that they planned to hold hearings about 
NASA’s procedures and budget.839 
 
9 December 
The National Research Council (NRC) published a NASA-funded study, which found that 
NASA needed more safeguards to protect astronauts from potentially cancer-causing radiation 
during spacewalks they would make while building the International Space Station (ISS). The 
study recommended that NASA change flight rules, improve space-weather forecasting, and 
install a radiation-monitoring device outside the ISS. The NRC recommended the extra 
precautions because the station’s assembly schedule, consisting of more than three dozen flights 
and 1,500 hours of spacewalks over four years, would coincide with the most active part of the 
11-year solar cycle. Moreover, the report estimated a nearly 100 percent chance that at least two 
assembly missions would overlap with a serious solar storm and a 50 percent chance that five 
flights would overlap with such a storm. Additionally, the NRC predicted that a change in the 
station’s planned orbit, which the Russian Space Agency had requested to accommodate Russian 
launches to help build and resupply the station, would increase the level of radiation exposure. 
George L. Siscoe, a Boston University physics professor and chairperson of the study, remarked 
that, although the radiation levels were not life threatening, they exceeded the 30-day and 60-day 
limits set to protect the skin and eyes. To safeguard crew from exposure to the increased risk of 
developing cancer later in life, countries participating in the ISS program would have to pay 
careful attention to flight schedules and crew rotation. Furthermore, the amount of radiation 
exposure sustained during ISS missions might affect an astronaut’s chances of assignment to 
additional spacewalks and their selection for future missions.840 
 
10 December 
Europe’s new 746-ton (677,000-kilogram or 677-tonne) Ariane 5 rocket launched smoothly on 
its first mission, carrying the European Space Agency’s 3.7-ton (3,400-kilogram or 3.4-tonne) X-
ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) scientific satellite into orbit. In what France called an industry 
milestone and “hailed as proof of Europe’s superiority in the commercial launch market,” the 
powerful rocket lifted off at the opening of its launch window from Europe’s facility in Kourou, 
French Guiana, depositing the satellite in orbit exactly on schedule, 29 minutes later. Jean-Marie 
Luton, chairperson of Arianespace, the France-based commercial space company that dominated 
the world’s commercial satellite-launching market, remarked that, although the United States 
remained its most serious competitor and China was catching up quickly, “Europeans were still

one step ahead.” Arianespace intended the Ariane 5, twice as heavy and twice as powerful as the 
Ariane 4, to carry 10- to 12-ton (9,100- to 10,900-kilogram or 9.1- to 10.9-tonne) payloads by 
2005, transporting space-exploration modules and serving the ISS. The XMM satellite was the 
largest scientific satellite ever built in Europe, equipped with three powerful telescopes, with 58 
mirrors each, and “capable of observing everything from supernovas to the remains of exploded 
stars.”841 
 
A six-member team of Brown University scientists used data from NASA’s Mars Global 
Surveyor to examine six categories of evidence supporting the hypothesis that oceans once 
existed on Mars. The team, led by planetary geologist James W. Head III, published their 
findings in the journal Science. Primarily using altimetry data and images captured by Surveyor, 
the researchers had found that the border between two geologically dissimilar areas was nearly 
level in elevation, suggesting an ancient coastline. Furthermore, they found that the topography 
below the possible coastline was consistent with the effects of sedimentation and the volume of 
the hypothetical sea was within range of previous estimates of Martian water. A series of terraces 
running parallel to the supposed shoreline gave credence to the idea of receding water; low areas 
contained the appearance of possible mud cracks; and scars from impact craters suggested 
groundwater or ice near the surface.842 
 
At a scheduled 13 December ribbon-cutting ceremony, NASA announced the opening of 
FutureFlight Central (FFC) at Ames Research Center’s Moffett Field in Mountain View, 
California. NASA had designed the two-story facility⎯the world’s first full-scale, virtual, 
airport control tower⎯to test methods of solving, under realistic conditions and configurations, 
potential air and ground traffic problems at commercial airports. NASA and the Federal Aviation 
Administration had jointly funded the US$10 million project. The design of FFC permitted 
“integration of tomorrow’s technologies in a risk-free simulation of any airport, airfield, and 
tower-cab environment.”843 
 
12 December 
The U.S. Air Force successfully launched a Titan II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base 
carrying the first of a new generation of military weather satellites, a Defense Meteorological 
Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D-3 spacecraft. Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space had built 
the DMSP Block 5D-3 craft under contract with the U.S. Air Force, and Lockheed Martin 
Astronautics had supplied the launch vehicle. U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center 
at Los Angeles Air Force Base managed the DMSP and Titan programs. The first launch of a 
Titan II since 19 June 1999, it was the ninth consecutive successful launch of the space launch 
vehicle. The Titan II, a type of booster previously used as an intercontinental ballistic missile 
(ICBM) and a fundamental element of the United States’ strategic deterrent for two decades, was 
one of 14 two-stage, liquid-fueled former ICBMs that Lockheed Martin Astronautics had

refurbished for Air Force space launches. NASA had also used Titan II rockets during its Gemini 
program in the 1960s, launching 10 piloted and 2 unpiloted missions. The DMSP Block 5D-3 
series accommodated larger sensor payloads than previous models, featuring a larger power 
supply; a more powerful on-board computer with increased memory, giving the craft greater 
autonomy; and increased battery power, intended to extend the mission’s duration. The National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operated DMSP, a program for strategic and tactical 
weather prediction to aid the U.S. military in planning sea, land, and air operations.844 
 
14 December 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin selected NASA Chief Engineer Daniel R. Mulville to 
replace General John R. Dailey as Associate Deputy Administrator, effective 1 January 2000. 
Dailey was leaving to become Director of the National Air and Space Museum. NASA had 
appointed Mulville as Chief Engineer in 1995, responsible for overall review of technical 
readiness and for execution of all NASA programs. From 1990 to 1995, Mulville had been 
Director of the Engineering and Quality Management Division in NASA’s Office of Safety and 
Mission Assurance, and, from 1986 to 1990, he was Deputy Director of the Materials and 
Structures Division in NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. Before that 
appointment, Mulville had served as the Structures Technology Manager at the Naval Air 
Systems Command since 1979, where he led the development of structural design, testing, and 
certification methods, as Program Manager for the Development of Composites for the AV-8B 
and F/A-18 aircraft, and advanced aircraft and missile programs. Mulville had received NASA’s 
Distinguished Service Medal, NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal, and NASA’s Exceptional 
Service Medal, among other awards. Goldin expressed his pleasure at Mulville’s acceptance of 
the position, remarking that, as Associate Deputy Administrator, Mulville would be his most 
senior advisor on NASA operations and commenting on Mulville’s outstanding work as NASA’s 
Chief Engineer.845 
 
17 December 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named A. Thomas Young to chair the Mars Program 
Independent Assessment Team, charged with reviewing NASA’s approach to robotic exploration 
of Mars following the recent loss of the Mars Polar Lander Mission. Among the review team’s 
tasks were the evaluation of several recent NASA missions to deep space, including Mars 
Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, Deep Space 1, and 
Deep Space 2. The team would analyze the projects’ budgets, content, schedule, management 
structure, and scientific organization, assessing how roles and responsibilities of those missions 
related to the missions’ safety, reliability, and success.846 
 
At the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in San Francisco, NASA presented images

the lava fountains, NASA’s Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, was also able to observe 
them. NASA scientists hoped to determine the temperature of the extremely hot lava on Io, by 
combining data from the telescope and from Galileo observations. Galileo scientist Alfred 
McEwen of the University of Arizona in Tucson remarked that capturing images of the fountains 
was a 1-in-500-chance observation. NASA announced that engineers at Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory’s (JPL’s) Measurement Technology Center had been able to repair images damaged 
by radiation during Galileo’s 10 October flyby using LabVIEW software from National 
Instruments. JPL’s Torrence V. Johnson compared the work to unscrambling a television cable 
signal: “JPL engineers had to break the code that was inadvertently introduced by the radiation 
near Io.”847 
 
18 December 
NASA launched its Terra satellite, carrying instruments made in the United States, Japan, and 
Canada, from Vandenberg Air Force Base atop a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS rocket. NASA had 
originally scheduled the mission to launch on 14 December, but a computer had aborted the 
launch moments before ignition. Terra carried five sophisticated instruments for observing the 
interactions among Earth’s landmasses, atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. NASA considered the 
craft the flagship of its Earth Observing System because of its instruments’ measurement 
capabilities and accuracy. The five instruments were 1) the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal 
Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), designed to capture high-resolution images of 
Earth in visible, near-infrared, shortwave-infrared, and thermal-infrared areas of the spectrum; 2) 
the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), a set of two broadband scanning 
radiometers for measuring Earth’s radiation; 3) the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer 
(MISR), an instrument using nine cameras to measure the amount of sunlight scattered in 
different directions; 4) the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), designed 
to view the entire surface of the Earth every one to two days and to make observations in 36 
spectral bands; and 5) the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), designed to 
observe the interaction of the lower atmosphere with the land and oceans.848 
 
19 December 
After an unprecedented nine delays, Space Shuttle Discovery launched from Kennedy Space 
Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. During Mission STS-103, the crew planned to restore the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to working order and to upgrade its systems. Discovery’s crew 
comprised Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr., Pilot Scott J. Kelly, and Mission Specialists Steven 
L. Smith, C. Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfield, Claude Nicollier, and Jean-François Clervoy.849

expected to return data for a minimum of five years, was deployed to measure sunlight reaching 
Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land, data needed for scientists to study whether slight changes 
in solar output affected global warming and cooling. ACRIM III was the third in a series of long-
term, solar-monitoring tolls that NASA’s JPL had built. ACRIM III’s data would expand the 
database begun with the ACRIM I mission in 1980, aboard the Solar Maximum Mission 
spacecraft, and continued with the ACRIM II mission in 1991, aboard the Upper Atmosphere 
Research Satellite. ACRIM I was the first instrument to demonstrate clearly that the total radiant 
energy from the Sun is not a constant. The Korean satellite, built by TRW Inc. for a three-year 
mission, carried three instruments for creating digital elevation maps of Korea, studying the 
biology of the ocean, and performing physics experiments on the effects of radiation on 
electronics. The Celestis mission carried 36 capsules of human remains, which would orbit for 
45 years before burning up in Earth’s atmosphere.850 
 
21 December 
Space Shuttle Discovery astronauts captured the HST using the Shuttle’s robotic arm. Discovery 
had to alter its approach to the space telescope, because the telescope’s failed gyroscopes had 
“left the telescope a little shaky,” but Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr. and his crew had prepared 
for such a scenario. A fully operational HST would have had its aft pointed at the center of 
Earth; Brown would have carried out a straightforward approach, rising up from below until the 
robotic arm simply locked on. Without its gyroscopes functioning, the HST slowly rotated at one 
revolution per hour. Therefore, controllers activated backup gyroscopes to eliminate the rotation 
as much as possible, permitting Brown to fly around the HST and properly position the Shuttle’s 
robotic arm. As both spacecraft traveled around the Earth at 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometers) 
per hour with Brown at the controls, Discovery moved closer to the HST until French astronaut 
Jean-François Clervoy had removed the 43-foot (13-meter), 25,000-pound (11,300-kilogram) 
telescope from orbit and anchored it in the Shuttle cargo bay.851 
 
22 December 
Robert S. Ruggeri, a retired NASA engineer and pioneer in de-icing research, died at the age of 
75. Ruggeri had begun working for NASA’s predecessor agency in 1944, retiring from NASA in 
1980. NASA had applied his findings from studying ice buildup on airplane wings in the 1940s 
and 1950s, to the development of rockets and Space Shuttles. When the United States sought to 
speed up its space program following the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik, Ruggeri had also 
researched the effects of cavitation⎯partial vacuums in flowing liquids⎯on cryogenic rocket 
pumps, looking for ways to make the pumps more efficient for rockets. Later in his career at 
NASA, Ruggeri’s work had focused on the design of compressors for advanced aircraft engines, 
as he sought ways to increase fuel efficiency, reduce air pollution, and minimize the noise of jet 
engines.852

In the second-longest spacewalk in NASA’s history, lasting 8 hours and 15 minutes, Steven L. 
Smith and John M. Grunsfeld successfully replaced all six of HST’s gyroscopes and had “just 
enough time to equip each of the telescope’s six batteries with a voltage regulator to prevent 
overheating.” NASA believed corroded wires had caused the gyroscope failures. To avoid 
repeating the failure, engineers used pressurized nitrogen rather than air to force fluid into the 
new gyroscopes. Smith and Grunsfeld alternated working inside the tight space housing the 
gyroscopes. Because of his long arms, NASA assigned the 6-foot-3.5-inch-tall (1.9-meter-tall) 
Smith, who had worked on HST during its last service call in 1997, the task of replacing the two 
sets of gyroscopes on the sides, which were more difficult to reach. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours 
longer than scheduled. Although Smith and Grunsfeld went to work an hour early and quickly 
organizing their tools in the cargo bay, the pair needed extra time to open coolant-line valves on 
a disabled infrared camera and encountered difficulty latching the doors of the cargo bay holding 
the equipment.853 
 
23 December 
British-born U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale and Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier installed a 
new central computer on HST, 20 times faster than the telescope’s previous one, and a 
refurbished, 550-pound (250-kilogram), fine guidance sensor. At 8 hours and 10 minutes, the 
pair’s spacewalk was the third longest in NASA’s history.854 
 
24 December 
Astronauts Steven L. Smith and John M. Grunsfeld completed the HST servicing mission, 
replacing a nonfunctioning radio transmitter and an outdated tape recorder. The spacewalk again 
exceeded 8 hours and, for the third time, ran behind schedule. As the pair prepared to begin their 
spacewalk, Grunsfeld encountered a mechanical problem with his suit and had to exchange it 
before exiting Discovery’s airlock. Grunsfeld also faced the most difficult task, replacing the 
transmitter, which was not easy to service in space. The job required him to disconnect and 
reconnect a series of thin coaxial cables while wearing bulky pressurized gloves. NASA had 
designed a special tool for the job, but even so, the task required more than an hour, and 
Grunsfeld needed to stop to rest his hands. The eight-day repair flight had accomplished all of 
the mission’s major objectives, although NASA cancelled a fourth spacewalk, preventing the 
astronauts from installing all six steel sunshades that protect HST from solar damage.855 
 
25 December 
Discovery astronauts placed the HST back in orbit using the Shuttle’s robotic arm. Astronaut 
Jean-François Clervoy operated the arm, grabbing a handle on the telescope’s side. After 
releasing the latches securing the observatory inside the Shuttle’s bay, the robotic arm lifted the 
telescope above the spacecraft, and ground controllers opened the door covering HST’s

telescope. Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr. and Pilot Scott J. Kelly fired the Shuttle’s thrusters to 
move away from the telescope slowly.856 
 
27 December 
Although crosswinds caused a late touchdown, Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely after its 
eight-day servicing mission to HST. NASA managers had instructed Discovery to fly an extra 
orbit before landing, while Mission Control monitored the weather on the ground. NASA had 
shortened the mission to eight days from the scheduled 10 because of numerous launch delays, 
and because Discovery must return to Earth before New Year’s Eve to avoid potential Y2K 
computer problems.857 
 
JANUARY 2000 
4 January 
After detailing only a few computer glitches, which had occurred during the dreaded Y2K 
transition, Federal Computer Week reported that NASA had narrowly avoided a Y2K data flaw 
that might have redirected the orbit of its Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. According to 
NASA’s Chief Information Officer, the software that transmitted the commands directing 
satellite orbits had automatically reverted to 1 January 1999 commands, when it should have 
used 1 January 2000 commands. Attentive operators caught the potential problem before the 
software had sent the faulty data to any satellites. Although the episode accentuated the

computer crashes actually occurred during the changeover.858

In the wake of the failure of the Mars Polar Lander Mission, an independent assessment team 
appointed by NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin assembled for the first time to begin a 
review of NASA’s approach to the exploration of Mars. The 16-member team included 
aeronautics experts from NASA, aerospace industries, the U.S. Air Force, and academia. 
Although NASA officials held out hope that Lander would eventually respond to signals from 
Earth, Goldin tasked the team with evaluating NASA’s successful and unsuccessful missions to 
Mars. The independent investigation continued NASA’s pattern of scrutinizing all failures to 
improve its proficiency in the exploration of space.859

NASA released recently obtained images that further supported the possibility that Jupiter’s 
moon Europa might be home to a liquid ocean. The Galileo spacecraft had captured the images 
when passing Europa’s north pole. Using a magnetometer instrument, Galileo had recorded

11 January 
The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Rockwell International Inc., Boeing North 
American Inc., and United Space Alliance for concealing millions of dollars in fraud committed 
by a subcontractor. According to the suit, the subcontractor had used funds from the Shuttle 
program to purchase homes, jewelry, and vacations. The subcontractor accused of the fraud had 
pled guilty to all charges five years earlier, and the culpability of the major aerospace companies 
in concealing the theft was the last significant legal matter to come to trial. The three companies 
claimed that they had cooperated with government investigations into the 180 felony fraud 
violations and were not liable for the actions of the rogue subcontractor.861 
 
12 January 
Using NASA’s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spacecraft, astronomers found 
significant proof that thousands of exploding stars had generated the halo of gas around Earth’s 
Milky Way, possibly originating as the galaxy evolved. The findings were among the first 
generated from the FUSE project, and scientists hoped that they represented the first of many 
significant discoveries. The halo surrounding the Milky Way had intrigued scientists for decades, 
but researchers had been unable to shed light on how or why the gas formed as it did. A team of 
astronomers presented the findings at the American Astronomical Society conference, 
proclaiming the FUSE observatory “open for business.” H. Warren Moos of Johns Hopkins 
University, Principal Investigator of the FUSE project, stated that the “debugging period” had 
concluded, and that project managers had moved from fine-tuning the instrument to performing 
space observations. The FUSE spectrograph had more than 100 times the power of previous 
instruments, and many researchers hoped that it would allow more extensive investigation of the 
formation and collapse of stars⎯a research agenda that might eventually uncover the sequence 
of events that resulted in the formation of the Earth862 
 
A National Research Council panel made up of climate and environment experts announced that 
it had found significant evidence to support the theory of global warming. The panel found that 
the Earth’s surface had warmed at a rate substantially greater than average for the past 
millennium. Panel Chairperson John M. Wallace of the University of Washington’s Environment 
Program clarified the group’s findings: “The surface of the temperature is rising and has risen 
substantially in the past 20 years.” Wallace also carefully pointed out that the group had not 
addressed the issue of causation: “We are not saying that the rise is due to greenhouse gases nor 
are we saying that it is going to continue.” The findings added to the ongoing debate over global

warming critics dismissed them.863 
 
The Russian Space Agency announced another delay in the launch of the crew compartment for 
the International Space Station (ISS), after two Proton rockets exploded when metal and mineral 
particles contaminated their engines. The Russian Space Agency had planned to use a Proton 
rocket to launch the ISS module. The S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, 
which built the boosters, promised to replace the Proton rocket’s faulty parts. Funding problems 
had previously slowed construction of the crew compartment, disrupting the timeline for the 
international project.864 
 
As a part of its “Celebrate the Century” program, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a stamp 
commemorating the Space Shuttle Program. The stamp with the Shuttle’s image joined 12 other 
stamps with images recalling significant American memories of the past century, such as video 
games, the fall of the Berlin Wall, personal computers, and Cabbage Patch Dolls. The Space 
Shuttle stamp was part of the celebration of the 1980s portion of the millennium. Kennedy Space 
Center Director Roy D. Bridges Jr. issued a statement thanking the Postal Service for the 
honor.865 
 
13 January 
Astronomers using images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) discovered what they 
believed to be the first examples of “isolated stellar-mass black holes adrift among the stars of 
our galaxy.” They announced their discovery at a convention of the American Astronomical 
Society. The findings supported a long-standing theory that black holes could form with the 
collapse of just one massive star, although an opposing theory had concluded that multiple stars 
must collapse in tandem. Moreover, the researchers’ contribution was the latest in a string of 
recent findings illuminating the relatively commonplace nature of black holes.866 
 
14 January 
Science and business leaders from the United States and Singapore signed an agreement to 
collaborate on biotechnology research conducted in space. The pact, focused on improving drugs 
and crops, outlined experiments planned for a 2001 Shuttle Columbia mission. U.S. Senator 
Christopher Bond (R-MO) called the agreement an “important step toward increasing scientific 
knowledge.”867

NASA declared an end to its attempts to contact Mars Polar Lander, which had descended to the 
Red Planet’s surface on 3 December 1999. The planned 90-day mission had derailed when

mission controllers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were unable to communicate 
with the probe after it landed. Investigators had methodically tried different commands to reach 
Lander. Meanwhile, scientists and amateur space enthusiasts alike had offered a wide range of 
hypotheses concerning the cause of Lander’s silence, speculating that Lander had exploded 
before actually reaching Mars’s surface or that it had simply sunk in the Martian dust. After 
exhausting all means of contacting the probe, NASA had declared the US$165 million mission 
concluded, indicating that future missions would attempt to make up for the loss of Polar Lander. 
Project Manager Richard A. Cook expressed his sense of closure about the decision to stop 
investigating the matter: “we feel somewhat complete in the sense that we did go through the 
things we thought were reasonable . . . we gave it a good shot.”868 
 
24 January 
NASA released the first HST images taken after the Shuttle’s Mission STS-103, in which the 
crew of Discovery realigned and refurbished the telescope. The stunning clarity of the new 
images suggested that the mission specialists had succeeded in their sensitive work. According to 
Steven Beckwith, Director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the work returned HST to “a 
condition that was better than it was even before the fourth gyroscope failed.” Astronomers had 
focused on targets more than 5,000 light-years away to test the upgraded telescope. During the 
servicing mission, astronauts had also installed a Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and a 
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, new instruments that would contribute to the already 
formidable strength of the HST.869 
 
28 January 
NASA announced that the Food and Drug Administration had cleared for diagnostic use a new 
technology to fight breast cancer, originally developed at JPL. OmniCorder Technologies, Inc. 
had built the device, called the BioScan System, using a sensor developed by JPL researcher 
Sarath D. Gunapala. Gunapala had originally developed the sensor, named the Quantum Well 
Infrared Photodetector, to locate hot spots in fires and volcanoes. When researchers had learned 
that the increased blood flow surrounding cancerous tissues often raises skin temperatures 
slightly, medical scientists realized that doctors could use the technology to conduct noninvasive 
screenings, helping to detect breast cancer. The new device had charted temperature changes as 
slight as 0.027°F (-18°C) from one area of the body to another, making it a promising tool for 
doctors and cancer researchers.870 
 
NASA released the research results of astronaut John H. Glenn Jr.’s historic 1998 voyage aboard 
Shuttle Discovery. The report detailed the 88 experiments conducted on Mission STS-95, the 
most of any Shuttle mission. NASA responded to some critics, who called the mission a 
publicity-driven flight with little scientific value, disclosing that Glenn himself had participated 
in 10 experiments during the mission. After becoming the first American to orbit the Earth in

The publication Florida Today announced that astronaut Janice E. Voss would carry aboard the 
next scheduled Endeavour flight a commemorative stuffed bear, manufactured to raise money 
for victims of the shooting at the Columbine High School in Colorado. Voss had agreed to the 
plan when students from Columbine, visiting Kennedy Space Center as NASA’s special guests, 
explained their fund-raising goals. NASA had invited the Columbine students to Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, to watch a Space Shuttle launch. NASA also announced that at the conclusion of Voss’s 
mission, it would donate to the still-recovering high school an official Endeavour flight kit. Of 
the class’s trip to NASA to watch Endeavour’s launch, a parent of one of the Columbine students 
said simply that it was “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”872 
 
3 February 
In another escalation of the increasingly tense debate over how to handle Russia’s repeated 
delays in building and launching the service module of the International Space Station (ISS), 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced that, if Russia did not meet a July 2000 
deadline, the United States would provide a substitute module. Russia was already more than two 
years behind schedule, affecting the ISS’s timeline and hampering the cooperative international 
effort. Goldin’s decision followed Russia’s announcement of its plan to direct more resources to 
the failing Mir space station. Some space experts perceived Russia’s designation of scarce 
financial funds to Mir, rather than to the ISS, as a signal of Russia’s reluctance to participate 
fully in the international space consortium. In his strongest criticism to date, Goldin said of 
Russia’s ISS involvement: “To say we are frustrated and disappointed is an understatement . . . 
We want the Russians to be there, but we felt we had to be responsible custodians to keep the 
program on track.”873 
 
7 February 
President William J. Clinton’s proposed budget for NASA was unveiled at NASA Headquarters 
in Washington, DC. The proposal contained none of the cutbacks that had driven the Clinton 
administration’s previous NASA budgets, instead calling for steady increases in funding for 
space exploration over a period of five years. The key caveat, however, was that most of the 
increases were scheduled to be implemented after Clinton left office. Most noteworthy, the 
proposal set aside US$6 billion to begin research into designing a replacement for the Space 
Shuttle fleet. Officials hoped that NASA’s plan to build a reusable launch vehicle to replace the 
aging Shuttles would come to fruition around the year 2005.874

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced that NASA would merge the Office of the 
Chief Technologist and the Office of Aero-Space Technology, to better facilitate NASA’s 
technological advancements. According to Goldin, placing a range of issues, from IT operation 
to technology-based research, under the domain of a single leader would promote IT 
compatibility. Goldin appointed Chief Technologist Samuel L. Venneri to head the new Office, 
giving Venneri the responsibility of developing a long-term strategy to keep NASA at the 
forefront of technological development. Goldin also tasked Venneri with forging new 
relationships with companies using technologies similar to the type that NASA developed and 
used. Venneri had been NASA’s Chief Technologist since 1996.875 
 
8 February 
The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft set an astronomical record by 
facilitating the discovery of 102 comets. The spacecraft featured a Large Angle and 
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument that allowed astronomers to observe comets 
that previously would have been invisible. Douglas A. Biesecker, an astronomer at NASA’s 
Goddard Space Flight Center, was responsible for making 45 discoveries on his own. According 
to the researchers working on the project, SOHO had revealed far more suicidal comets (those 
plunging into the Sun’s atmosphere) and sungrazers (those that pass by the Sun) than scientists 
had previously expected to find. The findings had practical implications as well. By observing 
the patterns of comets as they circled, collided, and split, scientists hoped that they might be 
better prepared to predict the behavior of a comet headed for Earth.876 
 
9 February 
Russia successfully launched a Soyuz test rocket equipped with a Fregat accelerator unit able to 
carry payloads into high orbit, but lost the Fregat unit upon its reentry to Earth. The rocket took 
off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying only a dummy payload into space, in a 
test that was part of Russia’s ongoing research into developing vehicles and technologies that 
would eventually serve the orbiting ISS.877 
 
More than 10,000 white-collar workers walked off the job at the Boeing Company, in protest 
over failed contract negotiations. Most of the strikers came from the aerospace giant’s work site 
in Seattle, Washington.878

In a much-anticipated launch, the Astro-E satellite lifted off aboard an M-5 rocket from the 
Kagoshima Space Center on the Japanese island of Kyushu. However, soon after launch, Astro-E 
was lost when the rocket suffered a “control system breakdown,” propelling the satellite into a 
lower orbit than planned. U.S. officials monitoring the launch determined that the satellite had 
most likely burned up in Earth’s atmosphere. Astro-E, the product of a joint venture between the 
United States and Japan, carried new x-ray–sensing equipment, which scientists had hoped 
would further illuminate the material surrounding black holes. Scientists had designed the new

Shuttle Endeavour lifted off in Mission STS-99, planning to use new radar technology to map 
Earth’s terrain. Crew included astronauts Kevin R. Kregel, Dominic L. P. Gorie, Janet L. 
Kavandi, Janice E. Voss, Mamoru Mohri, and Gerhard P. J. Thiele. The astronauts planned to 
extend the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission antenna from Endeavour’s cargo bay. The 197-
foot (60-meter) antenna would gather mapping data necessary to create the most comprehensive 
map of Earth ever drawn. NASA collaborated with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency 
in planning the mission and hoped to cover more than 70 percent of Earth’s surface during the 
11-day mission.880 
 
14 February 
The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft successfully orbited the asteroid Eros, 
160 million miles (258 million kilometers) from Earth, gathering close-up images of the craggy 
rock, in the first successful orbit of a spacecraft around an asteroid. The unique images revealed 
large boulders and craters on Eros. Scientists noted with amusement that on the Valentine’s Day 
encounter, NEAR obtained images of a heart-shaped chasm on Eros. NASA planned for NEAR 
to orbit Eros for about one year.881 
 
18 February 
NASA announced that a team of astronomers had discovered what they believed to be the 
earliest known structure ever to form in the universe. The researchers had used the Hale 
Telescope at Palomar Observatory in California and the National Science Foundation’s Mayall 
Telescope in Kitt Peake, Arizona, to find an ancient quasar. By measuring the quasar’s redshift 
to determine how fast the quasar was moving away from the galaxy, scientists had been able to 
calculate the cosmic distance separating Earth and the quasar. The odds of discovering such a 
distant and relatively fast-moving quasar were remote, especially since scientists could monitor 
only a fraction of the sky at any one time. The discovery had the broader value of providing a 
reference point by which to assess those bodies between Earth and the quasar. Daniel Stern of 
NASA described the finding’s utility: “Finding a quasar at this distance is like turning on a 
flashlight at the edge of the universe.”882

The American Museum of Natural History’s new Hayden Planetarium, which had used 
information gathered from NASA and the European Space Agency to compile a database 
containing billions of stars, opened to the public. From 1935 to 1997, the New York City 
museum had hosted thousands of visitors annually with a less elaborate planetarium. The new 
planetarium was only one part of the sparkling US$210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space, 
which museum curator Michael M. Shara hoped would inspire future scientists. The facility, 
resembling a spacecraft on the outside, featured informative programming hosted by celebrities, 
such as actors Tom Hanks and Jodie Foster. As they walked through the new facility, visitors 
could observe displays demonstrating how scientists believed the universe had evolved over a 
period of 13 billion years.884 
 
20 February 
By conserving fuel throughout their mission, the astronauts aboard Shuttle Endeavour were able 
to prolong their time in space by one extra day, allowing the crew to map the Earth’s terrain, 
covering several million square miles more than they had originally estimated possible. The extra 
9 hours and 10 minutes of mapping allowed the radar flown from Endeavour to survey Australia 
in detail, making up for time lost when a Shuttle thruster had failed.885 
 
22 February 
Shuttle Endeavour returned safely to Earth after a successful 11-day voyage. The scientific 
community and the public greeted the Shuttle’s return with even more fanfare than usual, 
because the crew had obtained stunning images of Earth. Endeavour’s six-person crew had 
worked nearly around the clock, keeping radar antennas running to compile the data for three-
dimensional digital maps of Earth’s surface. The crew had gathered more than 300 digital tapes 
of radar data during the mission, which NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin called “one of the 
most challenging, difficult missions we ever undertook.” The mission had successfully mapped 
43.5 million square miles (113 million square kilometers) of Earth’s terrain. NASA and the 
National Imagery and Mapping Agency expected that transferring the data into readable maps 
would take between one and two years. NASA had obtained the images primarily for the U.S. 
Department of Defense, to improve the accuracy of missiles and to assist in navigation for 
military planes and troops.886

timeline and cost limits. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had ordered an audit of the 
NASA-Boeing contract in 1999, because projected cost overages had continued to rise. 
Nonetheless, as Boeing neared completion of the construction of its portion of the ISS, both 
NASA and the aerospace giant were optimistic that cost overruns had stabilized, and that the 
space station hardware would perform well in space.887

NASA’s Glenn Research Center (GRC) in Cleveland, Ohio, opened a new laboratory dedicated 
to the study of ballistics. The laboratory, housed in the complex’s Building 49, featured a 40-foot 
(12-meter) gas gun that could shoot projectiles at speeds of up to 1,500 feet (457.2 meters) per 
second. A camera with the ability to capture 2.5 million images per second allowed researchers 
to observe the behavior of the projectiles and chart the results of their impact on aviation 
equipment. “The whole idea,” Team Leader Dale A. Hopkins explained, “is to watch the impact 
and see how materials struck by the projectiles behave . . . not just whether they survive, but how 
they deform and fail.” GRC had designed the new facility to test materials used for aircraft 
engine housings and for flywheel containment. Researchers hoped that the new tools would help 
engineer aircraft that could withstand the pressures of high-speed and high-altitude flight better 
than those already available could. GRC had been testing ballistic materials since 1980.888

Chester M. Lee, who had served as Mission Director for six Apollo Missions to the Moon, 
including Apollo 13, died from complications of open-heart surgery. Lee had begun his 23-year 
career with NASA in 1965 after retiring from the U.S. Navy, specializing primarily on the 
Apollo Missions. He had also served as Program Director for the 1973–1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test 
Project, the first joint venture between the United States and the former Soviet Union.889 
 
8 March 
A National Academy of Sciences task force issued a report supporting the development and 
deployment of the Triana research satellite proposed by Vice President Albert A. Gore Jr. 
Congress had authorized the task force in 1999, to investigate the feasibility of Gore’s plan, 
which called for a satellite to orbit Earth continuously, capturing live pictures of the planet. Gore 
believed that obtaining the images and making them available on the Internet would increase 
public awareness of environmental issues. The proposal had sparked a political controversy 
between Gore and the Republican Congress, prompting Congress to demand that a task force 
investigate the value of the project. The task force reported that the satellite had scientific merit. 
White House science advisor Neal Lane praised the study’s results, urging House members to act 
with “bipartisan Congressional support.” The process of investigation and approval of the project 
had drawn public attention to the political debate about space exploration.890

An independent study, commissioned by NASA in the wake of the highly public failures of Mars 
Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, found that cost-cutting measures had created significant 
risks for NASA’s Shuttle program. Although the report maintained that the overall safety of 
NASA’s operations remained within an acceptable range, the investigators warned that the use of 
contractors and the lack of oversight compromised the quality of NASA’s missions. NASA’s 
chief of the Office of Space Flight accepted the report’s recommendations to improve NASA’s 
operations, also noting, however, that NASA had already investigated and dealt with many of the 
weaknesses highlighted in the report. With budgetary matters always a pressing concern, NASA 
had made various necessary reductions in personnel, relying on companies such as Boeing and 
Lockheed Martin more than ever. NASA had initiated the investigation to understand more fully 
the impact of the changes on NASA’s highest priority⎯the safety of its astronauts.891 
 
10 March 
In an article in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Maria T. Zuber of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that they had found compelling evidence that 
Mars once had a wet climate. According to Zuber, “Evidence is building of more water on the 
surface of Mars at one time.” The researchers had used the laser measurements taken by Mars 
Global Surveyor to reach their conclusions. Although Zuber indicated that scientists did not yet 
have enough evidence to determine whether Mars once had a surface ocean, the study did find 
large, buried channels beneath the planet’s crust, suggesting that an enormous flow of water once 
deluged the landscape. The researchers had also found further evidence of two distinct “crustal 
provinces” on Mars, similar to those on Earth. The team estimated that Mars’s crust was 50 miles 
(80 kilometers) thick beneath the planet’s southern highlands, but only 22 miles (35 kilometers) 
thick beneath the northernmost areas of the planet. By using Surveyor’s data to analyze 
thoroughly the topography of the planet, the research team had also drawn the conclusion that 
Mars had once been home to more water than ice. The variety of landmasses suggested that, for a 
period, the planet’s core had released heat, turning ice trapped beneath Mars’s surface into water. 
As one newspaper described the formative events estimated to have taken place approximately 4 
billion years ago, “It steamed and streamed.”892

The Sea Launch Company suffered a setback in its bid to become a major participant in the 
satellite launch industry, when one of its Russian-Ukrainian Zenit 3SL rockets carrying a British 
communications satellite crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The launch was only the third 
undertaken by the international company, which had planned to use a converted ocean oil rig 
known as Odyssey as its permanent launchpad. The Sea Launch Company comprised the Boeing 
Company, together with companies from Russia, Ukraine, and Norway. The company had 
designed its innovative Sea Launch System to use Earth’s rotation and the faster movement of

satellite had cost London-based ICO Global Communications more than US$100 million to 
develop.893 
 
14 March 
NASA announced that it had renamed the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft, 
already orbiting asteroid 433 (Eros), after Eugene M. Shoemaker, an expert in the study of 
asteroid craters and their origins who died in 1997. Shoemaker’s work on Meteor Crater in 
Arizona, during the 1960s, had set the standard for crater investigation. Shoemaker had worked 
for NASA teaching astronauts about meteors and craters. He died in the Australian outback 
while researching asteroid-impact craters.894 
 
16 March 
NASA dedicated a new aerospace laboratory at Anne Beers Elementary School in Washington, 
DC, featuring a simulated Shuttle cockpit and Mission Control Center. NASA had named the 
facility, designed to encourage student interest in space exploration, for U.S. Representative 
Louis Stokes (D-OH), who had proposed legislation to fund the endeavor in 1998. NASA’s GRC 
and Goddard Space Flight Center had worked with the Orchard Glenn School of Cleveland, 
Ohio, and the University of the District of Columbia to construct the innovative facility.895 
 
17 March 
The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report stating that the Russian components 
for the International Space Station (ISS) did not meet NASA’s standard safety requirements. 
GAO’s findings were the latest in a long series of controversies, particularly between the United 
States and Russia, in the international effort to build the space station. Most significant of its 
safety deficits, the Russian crew module did not have adequate shielding to protect the ISS crew 
from orbiting space debris. At the time of the report, the Russians were already more than two 
years behind in delivering the crew module.896 
 
21 March 
During routine testing in preparation for a July 2000 launch, excessive vibration damaged 
NASA’s High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Images (HESSI) spacecraft. The vibration test device 
was accidentally set at a level 10 times higher than appropriate, causing structural damage and 
cracks in two of the satellite’s four solar arrays. Officials estimated that the damage would delay 
the planned launch by at least six months. NASA had designated about US$75 million for the 
project. The faulty test, occurring at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, revealed the high degree 
of precision required of engineers when creating and testing a space-bound craft. Although the 
satellite had vibrated at the incorrect setting for only about 200 milliseconds, it still sustained

eventually.897 
 
29 March 
Planet sleuths Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley and Steven S. Vogt 
of the University of California at Santa Cruz announced the discovery of two very small planets 
outside Earth’s solar system. Smaller in mass than Saturn, the planets resided approximately 100 
light-years from Earth. Although Marcy and Vogt had concluded that the planets were very hot, 
and that neither planet was capable of supporting life, their discovery reinforced the long-
standing theory that planets form by “snowball effect,” growing from smaller to larger, as well as 
suggesting that many other stars in the galaxy might harbor small planets. To make their 
discovery, the astronomers had used the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii in one phase of a 
multiyear project to observe stars within 300 light-years of Earth.898 
 
30 March 
Engineers at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) successfully tested a prototype for 
the “flying lifeboat” that would transport astronauts to and from the ISS. DFRC officials 
launched a robotic X-38 from under the wing of a B-52 flying at 39,000 feet (12,000 meters). It 
free fell for more than 40 seconds before deploying a 5,500-square-foot (511-square-meter) 
parachute, which provided a soft landing for the spacecraft. The test was a significant step in 
evaluating the technology planned for the crew return vehicle, a low-cost ISS initiative.899 
 
31 March 
The National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR) released the results of a survey 
indicating that NASA employees had the highest level of job satisfaction among federal 
government employees. NASA employees rated very favorably in the categories of employee job 
satisfaction, customer orientation, making reinvention a priority, management communication, 
and employee participation in cross-functional teams. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
announced the survey’s findings, stating, “I am incredibly proud of these results. They represent 
a strong statement of the top-to-bottom excellence of the NASA team.” NPR and the Office of 
Personnel Management administered the survey to understand employees’ perspectives on 
“reinvention and workplace issues.” When informed of NASA’s outstanding score, Keith 
Cowing, the editor of Nasawatch.com remarked, “I’m not at all surprised. I used to work there. I 
loved my job.”900

Russian cosmonauts Sergei V. Zalyotin and Alexander Y. Kaleri launched from Earth aboard 
Soyuz TM-30, headed for the Mir space station. In their planned two-month mission, more than 
seven months after the last crew members had left the high-maintenance spacecraft, the men 
aimed to restore Mir to working order. Many experts had assumed that Mir’s days as an active 
space research center were finished when the previous crew of cosmonauts left the station. 
Although unable to pay to keep cosmonauts aboard Mir, Russia was still hoping to obtain 
funding to keep the space station in operation and had not taken it out of orbit. When the 
Netherlands-based MirCorp had agreed to pay US$20 million to lease the Russian-owned 
station, Russia had scrambled to put together a crew for a repair mission. The departure of Soyuz 
caused some concern in the international space community, once again raising speculation 
regarding Russia’s commitment to the International Space Station.901 
 
5 April 
NASA awarded its Commercial and Government Inventions of the Year awards. Inventors Anne 
K. St. Clair, Terry L. St. Clair, and William P. Winfree, working as a research team at NASA’s 
Langley Research Center, won the award for inventing a material that they had named Colorless 
and Low Dielectric Polyimide Thin Film. Commercial manufacturers could apply the 
thermoplastic material to many types of surfaces to protect against ultraviolet radiation and high 
temperatures. The researchers also suggested adding the material to liquids, such as paints and 
cosmetics, to provide ultraviolet protection. Douglas B. Leviton received the Government 
Inventor of the Year award for his Ultra-High Sensitivity, Incremental, and Absolute Optical 
Position Encoder. The encoder allowed scientists to calibrate space-bound instruments more 
accurately than they had done previously. Both awards recognized inventions completed during 
1999. NASA honored the recipients at a ceremony, presenting them with plaques and cash 
awards.902 
 
NASA released a comprehensive new study, which found that the levels of ozone in the Arctic 
stratosphere were declining rapidly. In some parts of the stratosphere, the atmosphere had lost 60 
percent of its ozone over the course of one year. The report, compiled by hundreds of European 
and American scientists, also demonstrated that changes in the global climate (primarily global 
warming) threatened to delay the recovery of the ozone layer. The scientists were optimistic that 
the ozone layer would recover eventually, but perhaps not until the mid-21st century. The study 
had cost NASA more than US$20 million, and the European scientists contributed US$10 
million. The researchers had gathered data using satellites, airplanes, and hundreds of weather 
balloons.903

officials feared the autopilot was about to malfunction. The cosmonauts planned to concentrate 
on plugging a small air leak and conducting several scientific experiments during a spacewalk.904 
 
In two Nature articles, research teams announced that through independent research they had 
discovered the same result: the Ulysses spacecraft had passed through the longest comet tail ever 
discovered. Although the Ulysses vehicle had made its unintended discovery in 1996, when it 
passed through the tail of Comet Hyakutake, scientists had taken four years to confirm the 
discovery. The scientists concluded that Ulysses had discovered a comet tail approximately 300 
million miles (483 million kilometers) long. “The discovery was made quite by accident, a bit 
like finding a needle in a haystack when you weren’t even looking for it in the first place,” was 
how one project member described the fortunate discovery. Ulysses, a joint mission of NASA 
and the European Space Agency, had launched in 1990 to study solar winds and rays, not 
comets. However, the spacecraft had picked up some unusual readings during its mission, which 
turned out to be signs of Hyakutake’s tail, extending much farther than previously estimated.905 
 
NASA announced that follow-up studies had determined that the distant mass known as TMR-
1C, discovered in 1997, was probably not a protoplanet⎯a young, still-forming precursor of one 
of the giant planets. In 1998 astronomer Susan Terebey of the Extrasolar Research Corporation 
had published findings suggesting that the body was a protoplanet several times larger than 
Jupiter. Terebey’s research had received widespread attention. However, although NASA had 
released the images of TMR-1C captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), NASA had 
urged scientists to obtain further verification before identifying the body as a protoplanet. After 
observing the body over several months, astronomers had concluded that TMR-1C was a bright 
star, rather than a planet. Reflective dust had likely increased the brightness of the star, located 
approximately 135 billion miles (217 billion kilometers) from Earth, making it appear to be a 
planet. After her initial high-profile announcement, Terebey had continued to study the star using 
the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and had amended her own hypothesis, reporting, “the 
new data do not lend weight to the protoplanet interpretation and the results remain consistent 
with the explanation that TMR-1C may be a background star.” Most newspapers gave as much 
coverage to the news of the changing assessment as they had given to the original discovery.906 
 
15 April 
Princeton University graduate student Xiaohui Fan discovered a distant quasar that scientists 
believed to be the oldest object ever observed by a human being. Fan had worked as part of a 
team using the 32-foot (10-meter) W. M. Keck Telescope. Estimating that the quasar was 12

billion years old, astronomers expressed their excitement that the benchmark discovery would 
enable them to observe the universe in its formative stages.907 
 
18 April 
The United States and Brazil signed a treaty giving U.S. aerospace firms access to Brazil’s 
Alcântara launch site, located just 3° south of the equator. The treaty was the first accord signed 
by the United States that allowed U.S. satellites to launch from foreign soil. The launch site’s 
location near the center of the globe would save money for aerospace companies, because 
satellites could take a shorter path to equatorial orbit, requiring less fuel. Brazil benefited from 
the boost to its embryonic space program and the possibility of capturing a portion of the 
lucrative commercial-satellite business. At the time of the agreement, U.S. firms controlled two-
thirds of the annual US$66 billion commercial satellite industry.908 
 
19 April 
After completing four months of on-orbit checkout and verification, Terra, the newest in 
NASA’s series of Earth Observing System Satellites, became functional. NASA had developed 
and launched Terra to monitor Earth’s atmosphere on a daily basis. Researchers hoped that 
gathering frequent data would allow a more comprehensive assessment of Earth’s climate 
change. According to Yoram J. Kaufman, Project Scientist for Terra at Goddard Space Flight 
Center (GSFC), “Terra is measuring and documenting the Earth’s vital signs, many of them for 
the first time.” In the midst of public and scholarly discussions of global warming and climate 
change, the new research satellite was a step toward understanding the causes of the changes. 
“The data will help us understand our planet, aid in our distinguishing between natural and 
human-induced changes, and show us how the Earth’s climate affects the quality of our lives,” 
Kaufman clarified. The satellite’s first transmitted images thrilled scientists. The satellite 
surveyed North America, creating images in many different layers, to reveal how different levels 
of population and types of vegetation affected the climate. NASA officials planned to make the 
images obtained by Terra available to business, scientists, and the public.909 
 
20 April 
NASA revealed what it called “the first detailed images of the early universe,” captured by the 
Balloon Observations of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) 
experiment. For the BOOMERANG experiment, scientists had suspended a powerful telescope 
from a research balloon circumnavigating the Antarctic. Andrew E. Lange of California Institute 
of Technology called the experiment and the resulting images “an incredible triumph of modern 
cosmology.” For the most part, the data, obtained by closely measuring variations in the 
microwave background radiation, confirmed scientists’ existing theory that, in its earliest days, 
the universe was flatter than it is today. According to this theory, confirmed by other evidence 
besides these images, the universe is flat and forever expanding. In summarizing the significance

confirmation of the prediction of our best theory of what caused the structure of the universe.”910 
 
24 April 
NASA and the science community celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the deployment of the 
HST. During its decade in space, the HST had enabled astronomers to make hundreds of 
discoveries. According to NASA, the HST’s “rapid-fire rate of discoveries and cosmic images 
has profoundly changed the science of astronomy, and astounded and inspired people around the 
world.” The U.S. Postal Service and NASA unveiled a series of five stamps designed to 
commemorate the HST’s decade of contributions. The images on the stamps would not have 
been possible without the HST’s power, which enabled it to capture images of the Eagle Nebula, 
Ring Nebula, Lagoon Nebula, Egg Nebula, and Galaxy NGC 1316. NASA held a series of 
events to celebrate the anniversary. Hubble’s 10 years in space had not begun smoothly, as many 
critics of the program had been quick to point out. As the Baltimore Sun remembered, the HST 
was “once the butt of late-night talk-show jokes,” because a flawed mirror initially had prevented 
the telescope from focusing. However, after a series of costly repairs, the HST had produced a 
litany of awe-inspiring images. The HST made more than 271,000 observations in its first 10 
years, with another decade of usefulness anticipated. HST Project Scientist David S. Leckrone of 
NASA’s GSFC summarized the HST’s impact, “Not since Galileo aimed a small, 30-power 
telescope into the night sky in 1609 has humanity’s vision of the universe been so revolutionized 
in such a short time span by a single instrument.”911 
 
25 April 
NASA announced that a team of scientists had used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to solve one 
of astronomy’s fundamental problems⎯determining the distance from Earth to a cosmic object. 
Peter Predehl, the lead researcher on the project, had found that by scattering x-rays between 
Earth and a given object, the dust grains and scattered materials between the two points could 
serve as measuring posts to determine the distance covered by the x-ray. Because of the Chandra 
Observatory’s superior resolution and strength, particles that scientists could not otherwise have 
observed would serve as points of context. Researchers were confident that they could use the 
new approach to help determine the size of nearby galaxies. Furthermore, the newly devised 
means of measuring the distance between objects and Earth had implications for understanding 
the universe and its age.912

stated that the Red Planet held special promise for researchers. The possible presence of water 
and other signs of life on Mars intrigued scientists, making a Mars landing a priority for NASA. 
In addition, because scientists have estimated that the two planets are roughly the same age, the 
exploration of Mars could lead to new information about Earth. Goldin made his remarks in the 
aftermath of the high-profile crash of Mars Polar Lander.913 
 
NASA announced the creation of a new office dedicated to improving heath and safety for its 
workforce. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin appointed Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian as 
Chief Health and Medical Officer, giving him the responsibility for developing programs to 
research and implement the best medical procedures for astronauts and other NASA personnel. 
“On the ground and in space, rapid advances in medical knowledge and tools need to be adapted 
and incorporated into our planning and practices,” Goldin said when announcing the new 
position. Nicogossian faced the task of establishing NASA’s Health Council, in keeping with 
NASA’s commitment to making heath and safety its number-one priority.914

The Carrier Test Pilot Hall of Honor, aboard the USS Yorktown, inducted U.S. Senator John H. 
Glenn Jr., honoring him for his distinguished aviation career before becoming an astronaut. 
Before Glenn became the first man to orbit Earth, he had already achieved a long record of flight 
exploits. Glenn’s fellow test pilot Neil A. Armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the Moon, 
attended the induction. Upon receiving the award, Glenn expressed his gratitude at joining the 
distinguished ranks of the Hall of Honor and spoke of his lifetime of flight experiences.915

The “Love Bug” computer virus infected the computer system of NASA, along with those of the 
Pentagon, the CIA, Microsoft Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and other major business and 
government offices. Considered one of the most damaging and costly computer viruses in 
history, “Love Bug” spread primarily through e-mail messages, corrupting files on millions of 
computers. Four of NASA’s 10 space centers suffered from the attack, causing both Johnson 
Space Center (JSC) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to shut down e-mail and other 
communication between computers.916 
 
News reached the United States that space debris had crashed to the ground near Johannesburg, 
South Africa, prompting NASA to respond. Several metal balls had fallen from the sky, leaving 
8-inch (20-centimeter) dents in the ground. NASA scientists clarified that the debris probably 
came from a Delta rocket launched in 1996. Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris Nicholas L. 
Johnson explained that manufactured objects sent into space plummet back to Earth nearly every 
day, landing mostly in the ocean. Johnson also stated that NASA would compensate anyone hurt

NASA successfully launched the GOES-L satellite aboard an Atlas 2A rocket from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida. The new weather satellite would provide the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration with detailed readings on severe weather systems affecting the 
United States. NASA deemed the GOES-L satellite a top priority because of the declining 
returns of the aging GOES-8 satellite. NASA had delayed the US$220 million satellite project 
because of engine problems, causing anxiety to weather forecasters who depended on the 
satellites to track the powerful hurricanes that affected the United States in 1999. As Director of 
the National Weather Service’s Southern Region, William Proenza explained, “It is vitally 
important that we have continuity of data or we may be finding ourselves impaired in our ability 
of forecasting.” NASA had kept the May 2000 launch of the GOES-L on track, despite some 
calls to postpone it so that NASA could launch Shuttle Atlantis on an urgent repair mission to the 
International Space Station (ISS). However, NASA officials had determined that the risk of 
inadequate weather forecasting was too great to take a chance on delaying the launch.918

Nature published a letter from physicist Leonard Reiffel revealing that, during the Cold War in 
the 1950s, the United States had funded a research program focused on detonating a nuclear 
bomb on the Moon, part of a plan to demonstrate the strength of the U.S. military. The Armour 
Research Foundation⎯now a part of Illinois Institute of Technology⎯had directed the project, 
known as A Study of Lunar Research Flights. Astronomer Carl Sagan, then a young graduate 
student, had worked on the project. As Reiffel explained, Cold War politics had dramatically 
affected science agendas during the period: “There was lots of talk on the part of the Air Force 
about the [M]oon being ‘military high ground’.” The scenario had called for the U.S. Air Force 
to launch a small nuclear device from an undisclosed location and detonate it on the Moon. 
Those planning the detonation had selected an atomic bomb, because a hydrogen explosive 
would have been too heavy for a rocket to carry 238,000 miles (383,000 kilometers) to the lunar 
landing spot. Military leaders eventually called off the plan because of concern that, during the 
building and launch of the bomb, a nuclear accident could occur on Earth.919 
 
Astronomers using the telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico captured the first-
ever images of the so-called Metal Dog Bone asteroid, officially named 216 Kleopatra. Scientists 
had categorized the asteroid as a main-belt asteroid, theorizing that the New Jersey–sized rock 
was the result of an ancient, violent collision. Steven Ostro of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
called the find “one of the most unusual asteroids we’ve seen in the [s]olar [s]ystem.” Scientists 
made the discovery by bouncing radar signals off the asteroid and cataloging the signals’ echoes. 
By gathering a comprehensive collection of echoes, the research team had been able to assemble 
a computer model of the asteroid’s shape. The use of radar signals with a moderately powered 
telescope had made the long-distance discovery possible. Ostro marveled at the technology, 
describing the find as akin to “using a Los Angeles telescope the size of the human eye’s lens to 
image a car in New York.” Many of the astronomers working on the project spoke of their

the asteroid posed no danger to Earth.920 
 
5 May 
Laurence Vico released a study on astronauts’ loss of bone density because of time spent in 
space. Vico and his team of researchers had examined the bone-mineral density of 15 
cosmonauts who had spent from one to six months aboard the Mir space station. They had found 
a “striking” loss of bone density, in some cases as serious as that experienced by paraplegic 
patients. The team of doctors suggested that physicians should examine astronauts more closely 
for susceptibility to bone-weakening conditions such as osteoporosis, before they traveled into 
space, and that postflight recovery periods should be much longer than previous standards 
dictated. The sample study found that astronauts experienced an average bone-density loss of 
more than 5 percent, and that the lost bone did not immediately regenerate after postflight 
recovery periods. Scientists had long been aware of the physical challenges posed by the lack of 
gravity in the space environment. Therefore, NASA and the space agencies of other countries 
had carefully dictated diet and exercise programs for astronauts. The study had special relevance, 
however, because the international space community was continuing work on the ISS and 
anticipating even longer stays in space.921 
 
12 May 
The board appointed to investigate the mishap that had damaged the High Energy Solar 
Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI) spacecraft in preflight testing announced its findings. The 
investigators had discovered that the computer controlling the vibration device had sensed an 
abnormally high level of static friction and had responded by delivering approximately 10 times 
the exertion of gravity suitable for the test. A slight misalignment of the shaker mechanism had 
proved just enough to throw off the preflight testing. The board had determined that the accident 
had been avoidable. Routine maintenance and a pretest of the testing device itself would have 
caught the problem before any damage had occurred. NASA planned for the HESSI satellite to 
undergo repairs at the University of California at Berkeley.922 
 
Cosmonauts Sergei V. Zalyotin and Alexander Y. Kaleri conducted a 5-hour spacewalk to repair 
tiny cracks weakening the hull of the Mir space station. The cracks, the result of the June 1997 
collision of a cargo craft with the station, had caused the module to lose air pressure steadily. 
The spacewalk was not the first attempt to solve the problem, but previous teams had been 
unable to locate the cracks. Zalyotin and Kaleri tested a new “cosmic version of super glue,” 
designed to seal the fractures even in the harsh environment of space. The Russian Space Agency 
clarified that the cracks were not crippling to the space station, and that the crew could maintain 
acceptable levels of air pressure by manipulating oxygen outflow inside Mir. However, the 
agency hoped to solve the problem permanently, because Russia planned to use the aging space 
station for commercial purposes. The Netherlands-based MirCorp, which had committed nearly

19 May 
Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Mission STS-101 bound for 
the ISS. The seven-astronaut crew comprised Americans⎯James D. Halsell Jr., Scott J. 
Horowitz, Susan J. Helms, James S. Voss, Mary Ellen Weber, and Jeffrey N. Williams⎯and 
Russian cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev. The crew planned to make repairs to the space station, 
focusing primarily on replacing four malfunctioning solar-powered batteries. The crew also 
planned to use the thrusters of the Shuttle to realign the ISS’s orbit. Having been unoccupied and 
underpowered for nearly a year, the station had fallen below the optimal orbiting altitude. The 
station had gradually descended at a rate of about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) per week. The 
Shuttle mission plan also called for Atlantis’s crew to repair a damaged radio antenna and 
stabilize a shaky construction crane mounted on the outside of the ISS. Because of volatile 
weather in April 2000 and a full docket of rocket launches, NASA had delayed Atlantis’s launch 
three times, pushing the Shuttle’s liftoff into mid-May. Russian cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev, a 
veteran of two tenures aboard Mir, had spent more time in space than the rest of Atlantis’s crew 
combined.924 
 
22 May 
Astronauts Jeffrey N. Williams and James S. Voss conducted a 6-hour spacewalk to make repairs 
to the ISS. The pair successfully repaired the station’s construction crane, replaced a failed 
antenna, and began installing a much larger, Russian-built crane, designed to aid workers in 
adding the final modules to the ISS. NASA officials highlighted the exercise as a precursor of 
the maintenance schedule to come: “This spacewalk was a good example of what future 
spacewalks are going to look like, where we will need to perform maintenance on the space 
station.” The spacewalk occurred after Atlantis had docked at the space station, but while the 
hatch doors between the two spacecraft remained shut.925 
 
23 May 
Shuttle Atlantis, commanded by James D. Halsell Jr., began boosting the ISS into a higher orbit. 
By firing its steering jets 27 times during a 1-hour push, Shuttle Atlantis raised the space station 
about 9 miles (14 kilometers) farther from Earth than it had been. The effort was the first of three 
planned realignment maneuvers. NASA officials wanted to allow Atlantis’s thrusters to have a 
day to cool down before continuing with the project. In addition to changing the ISS’s orbit, 
Atlantis’s astronauts serviced the exterior of the space station and replaced four of its failing

the ISS had been experiencing during the months before Atlantis’s visit.926 
 
28 May 
NASA controllers began sending signals to the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory to perform a 
series of maneuvers that would ultimately end in the satellite crashing into the Pacific Ocean. 
The endgame commands marked the conclusion of a successful nine-year mission, which had 
recorded data on more than 2,500 gamma-ray bursts. The US$670 million satellite, launched on 
5 April 1991 aboard Mission STS-37, had provided researchers with never-before-seen images 
of explosions throughout the universe. “It will be like losing a member of the family,” remarked 
one NASA scientist who had worked on the program since 1979. NASA officials had decided to 
end the satellite’s space tenure because of the possibility that the aging satellite might become 
unresponsive and plummet out of control to Earth. By initiating the satellite’s demise, NASA 
could control the landing area of the 17-ton (15,400-kilogram or 15.4-tonne) spacecraft. Some 
critics charged NASA with being too conservative, because it had based its decision on the 1-in-
1,000 odds that an uncontrolled descent of the satellite to Earth would result in injuries.927 
 
29 May 
Atlantis touched down at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, only the 14th time that a NASA 
Shuttle had landed in darkness. NASA controllers used infrared cameras to monitor the Shuttle’s 
final descent. The return of the Shuttle ended the crucial mission to repair the ISS and reset the 
space station’s orbit to an optimal altitude. NASA’s Mission Control, congratulating the crew on 
a “super mission,” began almost immediately to anticipate the flurry of missions that would 
finally complete construction on the ISS. Atlantis had sustained minor damage during the trip, 
mainly dents and scratches on its wings caused by ice. Three members of the returning crew, 
astronauts Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss and cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev, had a special 
interest in monitoring the ISS’s completion, because they had been selected for the second 
research crew to the ISS and would make a long-term stay aboard the research station.928

2 June 
NASA announced a partnership with Dreamtime Holdings Inc., a start-up company backed by 
Lockheed Martin to provide the International Space Station (ISS) with high-definition television 
and to create digital archives for NASA. The agreement was NASA’s first involving a 
commercial partner that would provide support for the ISS. Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
announced the partnership at NASA’s Ames Research Center, located in the high-technology 
hub of California’s Silicon Valley, predicting that the partnership would move NASA to the 
forefront of the information age and terming it “innovative government at its best.” Dreamtime 
planned to spend US$100 million on the project, which would give civilians access to never-

the ISS.929 
 
4 June 
NASA de-orbited the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, after nine years in orbit, in a 
controlled reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. Director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center 
Alphonse V. Diaz called the event “a bittersweet day for NASA.” The spacecraft, NASA’s 
“gamma-ray equivalent” of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), launched in 1991 with four 
instruments designed to observe gamma rays. During the course of its impressive tenure, the 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory had yielded valuable data regarding the previously little-
known gamma-ray sky. The 17-ton (15,400-kilogram or 15.4-tonne), US$670 million research 
craft had orbited Earth for long after its predicted lifespan. Some critics had opposed bringing the 
craft crashing to Earth while it was still providing useful data. In 1999, however, NASA 
engineers had detected problems with one of the satellite’s control gyroscopes. After considering 
sending maintenance missions to repair the craft or training the Shuttle crew to capture the 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and bring it back to Earth for service, NASA officials had 
determined that the prudent response was controlled de-orbit and preemptive destruction of the 
satellite. NASA engineers used a series of engine burns to guide the satellite in its reentry into 
Earth’s atmosphere and to direct the pieces of debris from the craft to crash into the Pacific 
Ocean. Like NASA’s efforts to control the reentry of Skylab in 1979, this maneuver was one of 
the first times that NASA had intentionally destroyed one of its own craft by guiding its reentry 
into Earth’s atmosphere.930 
 
5 June 
At the American Astronomical Society convention, scientists Karl Gebhardt and Douglas O. 
Richstone announced that an extensive survey of more than 30 galaxies had revealed that black 
holes reach their large size through gradual growth. Previously, some research had suggested the 
opposite⎯that black holes were simply “born” big. Using the HST, Gebhardt and Richstone had 
led a team of astronomers in determining the size of black holes in different galaxies. They found 
that, although small galaxies tend to have smaller black holes, the largest known galaxies have 
mammoth black holes. The astronomers suspected that the black holes had “grown up” along 
with the galaxies where they resided, feeding on gas and stars to acquire increasing mass. 
Although further research must determine the precise correlation between black hole and galaxy 
size, the scientific community greeted news of the discovery with great interest. The HST had 
not only made the discovery possible but had provided the opportunity for scientists to continue 
“black hole hunting,” to tabulate more exact answers.931

Scientists at the American Astronomical Society convention also unveiled the first detailed map 
of the region of the universe inhabited by Earth. Using an Australian robotic telescope, which 
measured distances between more than 100,000 galaxies, researchers had charted the locations of 
galaxies, dark regions, and cosmic clusters. Perhaps most significantly, the new map supported a 
long-standing theory regarding the size limits of cosmic structures. Because of the relatively 
small scope of previous mapping surveys, scientists had questioned whether the known standards 
of cosmic size were representative. The newest map, however, did not reveal any cosmic 
structure outside of previous standards. Therefore, scientists could support with greater 
conviction the idea that size limits existed as the universe evolved. The researchers termed the 
limits the “end of greatness.”932 
 
6 June 
After two earlier unsuccessful trials, Russia launched, without incident, a modified Proton rocket 
carrying a large Gorizont communications satellite. Propulsion-system flaws had triggered 
explosions of the Proton rocket in previous trials. The United States viewed the successful test 
launch as a positive sign of Russia’s commitment to the ISS project, a boost for the strained 
relationship between the two countries. After the failed tests, a joint NASA-Russian Space 
Agency research crew had determined that production flaws in the turbomachinery of the 
rocket’s second and third stages, including the presence of contaminants such as asbestos cloth 
and metal fragments, had caused the problems. Russia planned to test the Proton rocket again 
before scheduling the much-delayed delivery of its crew module to the ISS.933 
 
NASA announced that its Chandra X-ray Observatory had revealed a “luminous spike of x-rays,” 
known as a hot spot, located approximately 800,000 light-years away from its black-hole source. 
Scientists commented that the images captured x-ray behavior that astronomers had not 
predicted. Andrew S. Wilson of the University of Maryland explained, “the brightness and the 
spectrum of the x-rays are very different from what theory projects.” A possible explanation 
offered for the brilliant hot spot of x-rays was that a series of shock waves had catapulted across 
the galaxy electrons with energies as high as 50 thousand billion times the energy of light.934 
 
13 June 
Having restored Liberty Bell 7, which had spent 38 years at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, 
NASA placed the space capsule on display at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Liberty Bell 7 had 
carried astronaut Virgil I. “Gus” Grissom into space on 21 July 1961, in NASA’s second piloted 
spaceflight. After its pathbreaking, 15-minute, suborbital flight, the capsule had descended to the 
ocean. The hatch of Liberty Bell 7 had blown off just after landing, causing the capsule to fill 
with water and almost drowning Grissom. A helicopter present at the landing had tried to pull the 
Liberty Bell 7 out of the water, but the waterlogged capsule had become too heavy, and the crew 
had to cut it loose, leaving it to sink. Regarding the hatch’s failure, astronaut Grissom had 
maintained until his death in the 1967 Apollo launchpad fire, that he had followed proper 
protocol. Nearly 40 years after the ocean landing, the Discovery Channel had funded a recovery 
mission that had brought the historic spacecraft out of the ocean. Although divers had not found 
the hatch, previous NASA investigations had supported Grissom’s claim that human error had

not caused the hatch failure. NASA had restored the capsule, placing it in a clear plastic display 
case so that visitors to KSC could peer inside the spacecraft.935 
 
16 June 
After spending more than two months aboard the Mir space station, Russian cosmonauts returned 
to Earth. According to MirCorp, the mission had been the first privately funded crewed mission 
to Mir. Sergei V. Zalyotin and Alexander Y. Kaleri landed safely in Kazakhstan, having spent 
most of their time aboard the Russian spacecraft conducting crucial repairs. To keep the station 
running, MirCorp had signed a lease agreement for Mir and paid for the mission. However, with 
the return of Zalyotin and Kaleri, Russia placed on hold the prospect of continuing Mir, even if 
supported with private funds. “If there is no money, Mir will not fly,” Russian Space Agency 
Director General Yuri N. Koptev stated at the end of the mission. Russian officials indicated that 
the Russian Space Agency would leave the space station unpiloted once again, until private 
investors could fund another mission. The continuing focus on Mir, while the building of 
Russia’s ISS module ran far behind schedule, agitated some NASA officials and international 
space leaders.936 
 
NASA and the Boeing Company announced an agreement to use Boeing’s Delta Launch 
Services Inc. for a variety of NASA missions. The contract, estimated to be worth at least 
US$168 million, included options to extend the agreement. NASA also awarded both Boeing and 
Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services Inc. indefinite delivery–indefinite quantity 
contracts for 10 years. The agreements solidified NASA’s partnerships with the two major 
aerospace companies. A NASA spokesperson clarified the reasons for the extension of the 
relationships, saying that Boeing and Lockheed “were selected based on their ability to meet 
NASA’s highly critical future mission requirements and their proven track records for providing 
a quality product.” At the time of the agreement with Boeing, the company had flown 82 
missions for NASA with a success rate of 98 percent.937

NASA celebrated the 20th anniversary of its Summer High School Apprenticeship Research 
Program (SHARP), created to encourage promising high school students, especially minorities, 
to pursue careers in math, science, and engineering. During the first 20 years of the program, 
nearly 3,000 students participated, and 3,300 NASA employees served as SHARP mentors. Most 
SHARP student participants had served as interns at one of NASA’s research centers during the 
summer months. NASA had begun the program and had continued to fund it as part of its 
educational mission.938

NASA reported to the public that Mars Global Surveyor had captured images depicting erosion 
and soil deposits consistent with the presence of flowing water on the planet in the past. 
Researchers had long postulated that, billions of years ago, Mars’s surface held abundant water, 
which had dried up as the planet’s atmosphere thinned. Because scientists had suggested that the 
one-time presence of water on Mars might indicate the one-time presence of life on the planet, 
the new evidence created significant excitement in the scientific community. In announcing the 
find, NASA reported that it “could turn out to be a landmark discovery,” but cautioned against 
drawing conclusions from the images without further analysis. Furthermore, the images 
suggested that water might have been present on the planet more recently than previously 
thought. Associate Administrator for Space Science Edward J. Weiler explained, “For two 
decades scientists have debated whether liquid water might have existed on the surface of Mars 
just a few billion years ago. With today’s discovery, we’re no longer talking about a distant time. 
The debate has moved to present-day Mars.”939 
 
22 June 
After a lengthy legislative battle, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a US$60 million 
increase for NASA in its FY 2001 budget. Although the amount was less than the Clinton 
administration had requested for NASA, the spending proposal marked the end of several years 
of cost cutting for NASA. Even during a period of budget surpluses, NASA had not achieved the 
victory without a fight. Some members of Congress, concerned over the delay in the completion 
of the ISS, had introduced a floor amendment to delete all funding for the ISS. However, the 
House had roundly defeated the budget-slashing amendment, as it had in previous years, with a 
vote of 325 to 98. Noting that the ISS was nearly complete, Representative Robert E. Cramer (D-
AL) spoke for NASA proponents when he said, “This is not the time to pull the rug out from 
under this program.”940 
 
30 June 
NASA launched the most advanced communications satellite it had ever developed, the Tracking 
and Data Relay Satellite-H (TDRS-H) created to provide communication between the Space 
Shuttles, ISS, HST, and NASA control centers. Intended to replace a communications satellite 
that had been in place since 1983 and had surpassed its mission-designed lifetime, the new 
TDRS-H was the first of three communications satellites planned to link NASA’s space-bound 
vehicles. NASA had designated nearly US$500 million for the design, building, and launch of 
the three new satellites. The TDRS-H launched aboard a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIA rocket, 
separating from it after about 30 minutes of flight. Once the satellite reached 171° longitude, it 
became operational.941

JULY 2000 
4 July 
Russia launched a new defense and spy satellite aboard a Proton-K rocket from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome. More concerned with the launch vehicle than with the military satellite, U.S. space 
officials praised the successful operation of the Proton-K rocket, a rocket similar in type to those 
that had been involved in several launch accidents during 1999. The United States had a 
particular interest in the launch, because Russia planned to carry a module built for the 
International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Proton rocket. Russia had built the Zvezda module to 
provide living space for the ISS crew. A spokesperson for the Russian Space Agency stated that 
the rocket’s successful launch confirmed Russia’s ability to transport its Zvezda module: “This 
launch is important in estimating the readiness of the Proton-K booster rocket for a more 
important mission July 12 when the same kind of booster will carry the Russian-built Zvezda 
service module to the ISS.” The Russian Space Agency had overcome significant financial 
shortfalls to complete production on both the Proton-K rocket and the Zvezda module.942 
 
7 July 
Engineers completed a weeklong series of tests on the U.S.-built Destiny laboratory, planned to 
launch to the ISS in 2001, ensuring that the module had no leaks and would provide a safe, 
vacuum-sealed environment in which the ISS astronauts could conduct research. NASA and the 
Boeing Company had worked together to test the 32,000-pound (14,500-kilogram) research 
laboratory. Placing Destiny in a pressurized chamber, engineers had monitored gas levels inside 
the module over the course of the week. Tip Talone, Director of the ISS Payload Process at 
Kennedy Space Center (KSC), characterized the results as “a large step in meeting the lab’s 
‘Destiny’,” stating that the laboratory had “exceeded expectations.”943 
 
12 July 
After nearly two years of delays and many questions regarding the Russian Space Agency’s 
commitment to the ISS, Russia successfully launched the Zvezda module aboard a Proton rocket. 
Building the 22-ton (20,000-kilogram or 20-tonne), US$320 million module, to provide living 
quarters for researchers aboard the ISS, had severely taxed the Russian space program. To bring 
the project to fruition, Russia had relied on the resourcefulness of its scientists and engineers, as 
well as resorting to creative financing arrangements, such as selling the U.S.-based Pizza Hut 
Company an advertisement for display on the side of the Proton launch rocket. Russia had 
insured Zvezda’s launch for more than US$1 billion. Hundreds of spectators, representing 
aerospace companies from Russia and Western countries, witnessed the launch from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Watching the launch with Director General of the Russian Space 
Agency Yuri N. Koptev, NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin praised the successful 
completion of the long-awaited module: “The Russians have gone through all sorts of difficulty 
with their economy, the political changes, and a whole variety of other problems, and they came 
through and did what they said they were going to do.” Koptev made clear the high stakes for 
future Russian space projects, based on the successful launch and linkup of Zvezda: “This is 10 
years of work and the success of this launch will determine to a large extent whether the Russian 
space programme continues or not.” The international space community greeted news of the

launch as a sign that the much-postponed ISS was nearing completion. Although Russia had 
plans to contribute further portals to the ISS, none of its subsequent contributions had as much 
potential to delay the international effort.944 
 
13 July 
Astronaut Eileen M. Collins, speaking for NASA, publicly responded to the report of the 
Commission for the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and 
Technology Development. The Commission had reported that a severe shortage of high-tech 
workers threatened economic growth in the United States, highlighting the need to increase 
funding from both private and governmental sources, to improve education in science and 
engineering. The report had emphasized that improved education in these fields was necessary if 
the United States hoped to continue training engineers and researchers qualified to bring 
NASA’s exploratory mission to fruition. Citing the example of her own educational and career 
path, Collins called for further support for research and education in mathematics, science, 
engineering, and technology. Both the Commission’s report and Collins’s response continued an 
ongoing debate over how to change the trend among students to choose paths of study outside of 
the fields of science and technology. In 1999 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had also 
testified before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology regarding the challenge 
of drawing young people to careers as scientists and engineers.945 
 
14 July 
NASA released to the Internet a database of 1.9 million celestial images, the largest collection of 
images of stars and other celestial bodies ever made freely available for public use. The rapid 
improvement of technology had made possible the release, which brought to home computers 
information that could have filled 6,000 CD-ROMs. The Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), 
which used two 51-inch (130-centimeter) telescopes to survey the sky, had collected the images. 
The University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center of 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had collaborated on 2MASS, creating a database of great 
value to scholars and the public alike.946 
 
William G. Fastie, known for helping establish the prestigious Johns Hopkins University space 
program and for inventing the spectrometer, died in Baltimore at the age of 83. Fastie, often 
called the father of the Hopkins space program, was one of the United States’ preeminent 
astrophysicists. His spectrometer, which measured the spectrum of light, helping scientists gather 
data about other planets, was not only innovative but also rugged enough to travel into space.947

As Russia’s Zvezda module, its major contribution to the ISS, continued its journey toward the 
ISS, NASA celebrated the 25th anniversary of one of the first international, collaborative 
missions. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project had launched on 15 July 1975, when American 
astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton lifted off aboard an 
Apollo spacecraft atop a Saturn 1B rocket. During the course of their nine-day mission, the 
NASA crew had docked the United States’ Apollo with Russia’s Soyuz 19 spacecraft, 
successfully and without incident. The Cold War–era mission, testing the ability of NASA 
spacecraft to link with Russian ones, had represented a significant step toward the development 
of international collaboration in future space exploration948 
 
The National Aviation Hall of Fame inducted four new members at a black-tie dinner and formal 
enshrinement ceremony at the Dayton Convention Center in Dayton, Ohio. Apollo astronaut 
Edwin E. “Buzz” Aldrin Jr. joined fellow Apollo 11 astronaut Neil A. Armstrong in the Hall of 
Fame. Aviators previously inducted to the Hall of Fame included Eugene A. Cernan, the last 
Apollo astronaut to walk on the Moon; Laurence C. “Bill” Craigie, the first U.S. military aviator 
to fly a jet aircraft; and Thomas B. McGuire Jr., the second-leading fighter ace in U.S. Air Force 
history. The National Aviation Hall of Fame’s Class of 2000 joined 166 award-winning aviators 
already chosen for the honor.949 
 
16 July 
The first of two Cluster spacecraft launches took place from Baikonur Cosmodrome in 
Kazakhstan. NASA and the European Space Agency had formed a partnership to develop and 
build the exploration craft, designed to travel around the Earth in a tetrahedral formation, 
collecting data on solar wind. Space officials planned to launch two additional Cluster craft one 
month after the first two had entered their orbiting pattern. With four satellites launched and 
flying in formation, scientists expected to harvest data about the “turbulent battle” raging 
between Earth’s magnetic field and the solar winds blowing at an estimated rate of 1–2 million 
miles (1.6–3.2 million kilometers) per hour. Researchers also hoped the new information would 
help scientists understand other interactions between the Earth and the Sun. Each of the four 
Cluster spacecraft carried instruments to measure the patterns of electrons and the presence of 
protons and helium, as well as instruments to monitor the characteristics of electronic fields, 
solar wind, and plasma waves.950 
 
18 July 
NASA announced that SPX Services Solutions had obtained a license to use NASA-patented 
technology to monitor more carefully levels of exhaust produced by the United States’ millions 
of motor vehicles. NASA had developed its atmospheric, remote-sensing technology to track 
greenhouse gases and to monitor Earth’s ozone layer. Combining government and private forces, 
researchers intended to focus on the pollution output of motor vehicles, particularly that of 
individual automobiles. SPX Services planned to design a device that would enable a driver to 
test his or her own vehicle to determine its compliance with U.S. Clean Air Act standards, rather

than requiring the driver to take it to an auto mechanic for an emissions test. The goal of self-
monitoring suited the increasingly popular idea of encouraging individuals to accept personal 
responsibility for protecting Earth from noxious pollutants.951 
 
20 July 
The 20 July 2000 edition of Astrophysical Journal Letters published research of Gibor Basri 
chronicling the first sighting of a flare from a failed star, or brown dwarf. Using the Chandra X-
ray Observatory, a team of scientists from the University of California at Berkeley had spotted 
the brown dwarf and its bright x-ray flare. Scientists believed that examining the x-ray flare 
would help them better understand dying stars and the explosive activity and magnetic fields of 
low-mass stars. Early analyses indicated that the brown dwarf’s x-ray flare was approximately 1 
billion times more powerful than the x-ray flares emitted from the planet Jupiter. Scientists 
reacted to news of the discovery with excitement and surprise. Robert E. Rutledge of California 
Institute of Technology stated that he and his colleagues were “shocked,” clarifying: “we did not 
expect to see flaring from such a lightweight object. This is really the mouse that roared.” The 
task of spotting an x-ray flare had been difficult, because the brown dwarf emitted the flares only 
periodically. However, the intermittent flares made the successful capture of an image all the 
more significant. The observation of the brown dwarf’s occasional release of x-ray flares 
confirmed the theory that brown dwarfs only release energy when they heat to temperatures 
above 4,500°F (2,500°C).952 
 
24 July 
Cape Canaveral, Florida, celebrated 50 years as a launch site. Long before NASA had begun to 
use the site, the U. S. Army had launched test rockets from the swampy land. The “li’l Bumper” 
was among the first, according to Dick Jones, a retired U.S. Army master sergeant who had 
helped with the 1950 launches. During its first 50 years, the Army had launched about 3,200 
rockets and missiles from the site, which would eventually become KSC.953 
 
26 July 
The Zvezda service module successfully docked at the ISS, immediately increasing the size of 
the space station by 50 percent. Through a series of rocket firings, Zvezda had drawn steadily 
closer to the ISS during its two-week journey to its new home 220 miles (354 kilometers) from 
Earth. Experts had deemed the successful launch and docking of the Russian component of the 
ISS vital to the long-term success of the collaborative venture. The Russian-built Zvezda, nearly 
identical to a core section of the Russian Mir space station, was to provide living quarters for 
researchers on the station, as well as vital electronic, computer, and communications systems. 
Anticipating significant interest in the historic linkup, NASA provided information on its Web 
site explaining how to view the space station as it traveled over Earth.954

28 July 
Nearly one year after the highly publicized failure of a probe to reach the surface of Mars, NASA 
announced plans for at least one, possibly two, robotic rovers to explore Mars by 2003. The new 
design plan, the outcome of an overhaul of NASA’s Mars Program in the aftermath of the 
unsuccessful mission, called for a rover larger than Mars Sojourner, which had successfully 
navigated the Martian surface in 1997. NASA planned for the new probe to continue the search 
for water on the surface of the Red Planet.955 
 
AUGUST 2000 
2 August 
Mitsuyuki Ueda of the Aeronautics and Space Development Division of Japan’s Science and 
Technology Agency announced that Japan had decided to freeze the development of an unpiloted 
space shuttle, which was four years behind schedule, because of problems in Japan’s shuttle 
program, as well as in its H-2 rocket program. Japan had originally conceived its planned 20-ton 
(18,000-kilogram or 18.1-tonne) shuttle in the 1980s, modeling it after the U.S. Space Shuttle, 
and designing it to conduct scientific experiments and to carry into space payloads of up to 3 
tons (2,700 kilograms or 2.7 tonnes). Technical and financial setbacks within Japan’s shuttle 
program contributed to the freeze. In addition, because the original plan had called for Japan to 
launch the space shuttle aboard a Japanese-designed H-2 rocket, a launch failure of an H-2 rocket 
had influenced the decision to halt Japan’s shuttle program. In the failed launch of November 
1999, officials had to destroy the rocket in midair, leading an advisory panel to suggest that 
Japan’s planned shuttle should launch from a reusable high-speed jet plane, rather than atop a 
rocket.956 
 
Space Media Inc. and S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (RSC Energia), 
prime contractor of the Russian service module of the International Space Station (ISS), 
announced a new multimedia partnership called Enermedia LLC. Under the new partnership, 
Space Media Inc. would use the Russian Space Program archives to develop and provide 
multimedia, which the Russian service module would broadcast on television and the Internet.957

A Russian Progress cargo spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, 
carrying fuel to the uninhabited ISS for use in adjusting the station’s orbit. The craft also carried 
scientific instruments, linens, and personal-hygiene supplies in preparation for the October 
arrival of the station’s first permanent crew.959 
 
7 August 
NASA announced that the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had located a “small armada of ‘mini-
comets’,” the fragmented remains of the nucleus of the comet LINEAR.  When it had 
disappeared behind the Sun on 27 July 2000, astronomers initially thought that LINEAR had 
disintegrated entirely. Upon losing sight of the comet’s core, ground-based observers had 
suggested that the nucleus had disintegrated into a “pile of dust,” and, consequently, astronomers 
at the Space Telescope Science Institute had reprogrammed the HST to search for the nucleus. 
The exceptional resolution and sensitivity of the HST had revealed the nuclei of a half-dozen 
mini-comets at a level of detail never before observed in a disintegrating comet. Some 
astronomers had suggested that the fragments the HST revealed were the “primordial building 
blocks of the original nucleus.” If so, studying them could help scientists understand how the 
comet had originally formed.960

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin began an official visit to Morocco to discuss space

A Starsem Soyuz-Fregat rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying 
into orbit for the European Space Agency (ESA) the final pair of Cluster II scientific satellites, 
Rumba and Tango. The launch was the 10th consecutive success for the French-Russian Starsem 
consortium. The first pair of Cluster II satellites, named Salsa and Samba, had launched on 16 
July 2000. Designed to determine the physical process of the interaction between the solar wind 
and Earth’s magnetosphere, the mission’s main objective was to increase understanding of space 
weather, viewed as “an increasingly significant obstacle to satellite activity,” thereby improving 
scientists’ forecasting abilities. Each of the four spacecraft contained a collection of instruments 
for detecting plasma fields, waves, and particles. The Cluster II mission, designed to last for two 
years following an initial three-month period of instrument and system commissioning, was an

international effort of more than 200 scientists from Canada, China, the Czech Republic, ESA 
member states, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Russia, and the United States. The original Cluster 
mission had ended during its inaugural launch in 1996, when a malfunction had caused the

10 August 
NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Science Edward J. Weiler announced that NASA 
had decided to send two large scientific rovers to Mars in 2003, rather than a single craft. The 
new plan called for the two craft to launch within weeks of each other, reaching Mars in January 
2004 after their respective seven and one-half-month-long journeys. The two 300-pound (136-
kilogram) rovers, exact duplicates of each other and similar to the highly successful Sojourner 
rover of 1997, would head to different locations on Mars. Mars Program Director G. Scott 
Hubbard explained that NASA had undertaken an extensive study of the two-rover option, 
weighing the excellent launch opportunity in 2003 against resource requirements and schedule 
constraints. The study teams concluded that it would be possible to successfully develop and 
launch identical packages, and that the new plan would not only double NASA’s scientific return 
but also add resiliency and robustness to the Mars exploration program. Although NASA had yet 
to select the two landing sites, Mars Program Scientist James B. Garvin suggested that possible 
locations included those with evidence of the existence of water in the past. Steven W. Squyres 
of Cornell University, Principal Investigator for the rovers’ Athena science package, explained 
that the goal of each rover would be to learn about ancient water and climate conditions on Mars. 
Each craft would operate as a robotic field geologist, reading the geological record at its landing 
site to discover what conditions had formed the local rocks and soils.963 
 
14 August 
The Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) officially commenced in 
South Africa’s Northern Province, with the gathering of scientists from 14 nations and six South 
African universities. NASA, alongside the University of Witwatersrand, led SAFARI 2000, their 
goal to “determine how the region’s natural ecosystems and human land use affect air quality 
and atmospheric conditions.” The initiative would use specially equipped planes to make four 
scientific flights each week, over a six-week period, through September 2000. A modern ER-2 
version of the U-2 spy plane would fly directly under the Terra satellite as it passed over various 
regions of southern Africa, to verify the satellite’s data. Three other aircraft would also fly with 
the ER-2 “like a stack of pancakes,” with the ER-2 flying at about 65,000 feet (19,800 meters) to 
conduct remote sensing, a Convair 580 aircraft collecting air and gas samples just below the ER-
2, and two Aerocommander 690A aircraft conducting similar tests at between 5,000 and 12,000 
feet (1,500 and 3,700 meters).964

Emergency rescue personnel from Canada, Russia, and the United States participated in training 
exercises near St. Petersburg in Russia, where they practiced maneuvers for rescuing astronauts 
returning to Earth from the ISS. The rescuers practiced searching in water and on land for a 
module carrying three astronauts, as well as practicing first-aid techniques.965 
 
NASA announced that its Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) had detected water 
vapor throughout interstellar space. However, in the very coldest areas, where temperatures are 
only 30° above absolute zero, the satellite had detected far less water vapor than most theories 
had predicted. In those areas, SWAS measurements had indicated water vapor concentrations of 
only a few parts per billion. Ronald L. Snell of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
remarked that the finding presented a “real puzzle to our understanding of the chemistry of 
interstellar clouds.” In warmer regions, such as those within star-producing gas clouds, SWAS 
had measured water concentrations as much as 10,000 times greater than in the coldest regions. 
The new results were the product of 18 months of observations using the compact radio 
observatory, launched in 1998 on a mission to “study the composition of interstellar gas clouds 
and their collapse to form new stars.”966

Robert R. Gilruth, “an aerospace scientist, engineer, and a pioneer of the American space 
program during the glory days of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo,” died at the age of 86. Gilruth 
had specialized in flight research, and in 1945 he had organized an engineering team to study 
experimental, rocket-powered aircraft, leading to the establishment of the Pilotless Aircraft 
Research Division and the creation of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics’s 
Wallops Island launching range. In 1952 Gilruth had become Assistant Director of the Langley 
Laboratory, investigating high-temperature structures and dynamics loads, and conducting 
hypersonic aerodynamics research at Wallops Island. His focus shifted to spacecraft in 1957, 
after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. When NASA began in 1958, Gilruth had become 
Director of the Space Task Group at Langley, ultimately devising all the basic principles of 
Project Mercury. In 1961 Gilruth had become Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, later 
Johnson Space Center (JSC), where he directed 25 human spaceflights over the course of 10 
years. George M. Low, Director of the Apollo Lunar Landing Program, once remarked in an 
interview that the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs would never have existed without 
Robert Gilruth. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin commented, “his courage to explore the 
unknown, his insistence on following strict scientific procedures, and his technical expertise 
directly contributed to the ultimate success of the American manned space program and the 
landing of a man on the moon.”967

Russian space officials announced a decision to alter plans for the Enterprise module of the ISS, 
which the company RSC Energia was building in conjunction with the U.S. company 
SPACEHAB. In the original plans, the module had been noncommercial, providing docking and

module to hold multimedia equipment for various business projects.968 
 
Lockheed Martin Systems Integration announced that the U.S. Navy had selected the company to 
build seven SH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopters, under the first SH-60R low-rate initial 
production (LRIP) contract, moving Lockheed Martin from development and testing to the 
production phase of the SH-60R program. The contract required Lockheed Martin to integrate 
the flight avionics systems, mission avionics systems, and stores and defense systems.969 
 
NASA announced the results of the most complete HST census of brown dwarfs, finding that the 
“odd and elusive objects also tend to be loners.” Joan Najita of the National Optical Astronomy 
Observatory in Arizona explained that the properties of brown dwarfs “reveal new and unique 
insights into how stars and planets form,” because they “bridge the gap between stars and 
planets.” The stellar objects are too low in mass to burn hydrogen, yet are more massive than 
planets; despite being 15 to 80 times more massive than Jupiter, brown dwarfs are difficult to 
detect because the light they emit is very faint. The HST census had found more low-mass than 
high-mass brown dwarfs, as is the case with stars, and the isolated brown dwarfs appeared to 
represent the low-mass counterparts of the more massive classes of stars. In carrying out the 
census, scientists had used the HST’s infrared vision to measure the brightness and temperature 
of stars in the cluster IC 348 in the constellation Perseus. Najita and colleagues had used the 
telescope’s NICMOS camera, developing a new technique to distinguish brown dwarfs from “the 
clutter of background stars.” The new procedure had measured the “strength of an infrared 
water-absorption band in the atmospheres of the stars,” a sensitive measure of each star’s 
temperature, solving several problems simultaneously. The procedure had enabled the scientists 
to distinguish the brown dwarfs from background stars and to measure the masses of the brown 
dwarfs without needing to assume their ages, thereby greatly improving estimates of mass.970 
 
24 August 
NASA awarded four small businesses 90-day contracts to develop concepts and requirements for 
providing access to the ISS on emerging launch systems. The contracts’ purpose was to identify 
potential backup capability and to augment the station’s primary resupply vehicles: the U.S. 
Space Shuttle, the Russian Progress, the ESA’s Automated Transfer Vehicle, and the Japanese 
H-II Transfer Vehicle. NASA awarded Andrews Space and Technology US$195,000; 
Microcosm, US$198,000; HMX Ltd., US$245,000; and Kistler Aerospace Corporation, 
US$264,000, to develop concepts, determine requirements of launch services, and provide 
suggestions on specific development risk-reduction activities, which NASA would need to 
perform. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center would manage the study contracts under the 
Alternate Access Project of the Space Launch Initiative.971

Margaret G. Kivelson and four coauthors from the University of California at Los Angeles 
published in the journal Science the strongest evidence to date that Jupiter’s moon Europa 
contains a salty, liquid ocean beneath its surface. The team had used data from the Galileo 
probe’s magnetometer to study Europa’s magnetic compass, finding that “the presence of a layer 
of electrically conducting liquid, such as saltwater” best explained the behavior of the moon’s 
magnetic compass. Kivelson explained that the team had inferred that the conductor must be a 
liquid ocean, since ice is not a good conductor of electricity. However, Torrence V. Johnson of 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) remarked that the magnetometer data by itself was 
insufficient to conclude the presence of a liquid ocean. Johnson explained that scientists needed 
several further steps of inference, such as precise measurements of gravity and altitude, 
indicating the effects of tides.972 
 
27 August 
In the second on-orbit failure of Hughes Electronic Corporation’s HS601-model satellite, the 
Spacecraft Control Processor (SCP) of Mexico’s Solidaridad I communications satellite 
malfunctioned, disrupting television, radio, and pager services. The first incident had occurred on 
the Galaxy IV satellite, causing similar communications disruptions in the United States during 
1998. In the current malfunction, operators in Iztapalapa and Hermosillo received a series of 
alarms indicating that the only functioning SCP on board the Satmex-owned craft had turned 
itself off. The satellite had two SCPs on board and needed only one to carry out its 
communications relay properly, but Solidaridad I already was running on its backup SCP, 
having lost its first processor a year ago. Engineers suspected that the cause of the incident was 
the growth of a tiny crystalline structure that leads to electrical shorts. Hughes investigators had 
identified this type of malfunction in their satellites containing tin-plated relay switches and, 
therefore, had begun to use nickel-plated switches in new satellites to prevent future occurrences 
of such electrical shorts. However, Solidaridad I, designed for 14 years of service in space, had 
launched in 1993 before the conversion to nickel-plated switches. The Solidaridad series, 
comprising two satellites, provided service to all of Mexico, also extending to the southwestern 
United States, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The malfunction led to the loss of 
educational television programming in 12,000 schools in Mexico, mostly in remote rural areas 
where some students rely entirely on televised courses. Satmex was transferring Solidaridad I 
users to the three other satellites in its fleet.973

A Russian Proton-K rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying into

NASA’s JPL named Thomas C. Duxbury Project Manager for JPL’s Stardust Mission, launched 
in February 1999 to collect a sample from Comet Wild-2 and return it to Earth. Duxbury, who 
had served as the Mission’s Acting Project Manager for the past year, replaced Kenneth Atkins, 
who had been heading a program to develop leadership for JPL’s projects. Duxbury had joined 
the Stardust project in 1996 as Mission Manager, responsible for navigation, mission design, the 
ground-data system, science-data management, and mission operations. Before working on the 
Stardust project, Duxbury had served on planetary mission teams, including several Mariner 
missions, the Mars Viking mission, Pioneer 10 and 11 to Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 and 2 to 
the outer planets, the Soviet Phobos Mission to Mars, the Mars Observer Mission, and the 
Clementine Mission to study the Moon. Concurrent with his position as Stardust Project 
Manager, Duxbury planned to continue to serve as a member of the science teams for Mars 
Global Surveyor’s laser altimeter and for the ESA’s Mars Express orbiter and lander, as well as 
continuing as lead scientist for geodesy and cartography in the Mars Exploration Office.975 
 
The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report discussing workforce and safety 
issues of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program. The report assessed the impact of workforce 
reductions on the Shuttle program; the challenges that NASA would face as it addressed its 
workforce issues; and the status of planned safety and supportability upgrades to the Space 
Shuttle. GAO identified 26 technical skills needed at JSC in Houston, Texas, as well as at other 
facilities in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. In addition, GAO found that the decrease from 
3,000 to 1,800 federal employees in the Shuttle program workforce since 1995 had placed NASA 
at a “critical juncture.” The Shuttle launch rate had dropped from eight launches in 1997 to three 
in 1999, a trend on the cusp of reversing itself in the aftermath of the July 1999 launch of 
Russia’s Zvezda module. Moreover, GAO reported signs of overwork and stress among NASA 
staff. Worker demographics⎯twice as many workers over age 60 as under age 30⎯had 
compounded the problem of a declining workforce. NASA officials welcomed the report, 
although the results reflected “a much harsher assessment of [S]huttle safety issues [than the 
assessment] prepared by NASA itself in response to an electrical short that accompanied the July 
1999 launching of the [S]huttle Columbia.” GAO also reported that NASA had terminated 
downsizing plans in December 1999 and had initiated efforts to begin hiring new staff. Although 
it was developing safety and supportability upgrades, which it would implement over the next 
five years, NASA still faced programmatic and technical challenges, such as a demanding 
schedule and undefined design and workforce requirements.976

A Sirius-2 communications satellite launched aboard a Russian Proton-K rocket from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launch marked the second success for the Sirius Company, 
which planned to broadcast digital radio to the United States. Sirius had placed its first satellite 
in orbit on 1 July 2000, scheduling a third launch for November 2000.977

Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) selected Space Systems and Applications Inc. of Lanham, 
Maryland, to provide engineering, science, and technology support for NASA’s Space and Earth 
Science Directorates. The value of the cost-plus-award-fee contract was US$204.5 million over a 
period of five years. Under the contract, NASA required Space Systems and Applications to 
provide research and information technology services including scientific data analysis, 
modeling and simulation of physical processes, development of flight-project data systems and 
large-scale data management, archival and delivery systems, and systems analysis and 
programming. These services would support a broad range of scientific disciplines⎯astronomy 
and astrophysics, climatology and atmospheric science, geodynamics, land processes, 
oceanography, planetary studies, solar and space plasma physics, and solid earth geographics.978 
 
7 September 
NASA announced that, on 3 September 2000, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) 
aboard NASA’s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite had 
detected an 11 million-square-mile (28.5 million-square-kilometer) ozone-depletion 
area⎯surpassing the ozone hole’s record of 10.5 million square miles (27.2 million square 
kilometers) set on 19 September 1998. Scientists investigating the extent of the ozone-depletion 
area expressed their surprise, suggesting that early-spring conditions and an “extremely intense 
Antarctic vortex”⎯an upper-altitude stratospheric air current that moves around the 
continent⎯might partly explain the record-setting size. Jack A. Kaye of the Office of Earth 
Sciences, Research Director at NASA Headquarters, remarked that, although scientists expect 
variations in the size of the ozone hole from one year to the next, they plan to observe the 
evolution of the ozone-depletion area in the coming months, to compare it with previous years. 
Manager of NASA’s Upper Atmosphere Research Program Michael J. Kurylo suggested that the 
new data reinforced concerns about the fragile nature of the ozone layer, indicating that, although 
international agreements had curbed the production of ozone-destroying gases, concentrations of 
those gases in the stratosphere were just reaching their peak levels. Therefore, he warned that it 
would be decades before the depletion area in the ozone layer would no longer occur annually. 
Associate Administrator for Earth Science Enterprise Ghassem R. Asrar commented that such 
discoveries demonstrated the value of long-term observations.979

Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-106 launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, to prepare the International Space Station (ISS) for the arrival of its first 
crew. The mission’s crew comprised Commander Terrence W. Wilcutt, Pilot Scott D. Altman, 
and Mission Specialists Daniel C. Burbank, Edward T. Lu, Yuri I. Malenchenko, Richard A. 
Mastracchio, and Boris V. Morukov. The purpose of STS-106, also known as ISS Flight 2A.2b, 
was to connect power, data, and communications cables to the Zvezda service module, as well as 
to deliver supplies and to perform maintenance. Although NASA officials had expressed concern 
that STS-106 might encounter a weather delay, the approaching storm had stalled offshore, so 
the Shuttle program experienced its first punctual launch since John H. Glenn Jr.’s historic flight 
in October 1998.980 
 
10 September 
Astronaut Edward T. Lu and cosmonaut Yuri I. Malenchenko conducted a spacewalk outside the 
ISS, connecting nine power, data, and communications cables between the Russian-built Zvezda 
and Zarya modules. Lu and Malenchenko also assembled and installed a 6-foot-long (1.8-meter-
long) magnetometer boom on the Zvezda module, to serve as a compass showing the relation of 
the ISS to Earth.981 
 
12 September 
NASA announced that scientists using the Chandra X-ray Observatory had confirmed the 
existence of “middleweight” black holes. Several groups of scientists used Chandra to focus on a 
mid-mass black hole located 600 light-years from the center of galaxy M82. Previous x-ray data 
from the German-U.S. ROSAT (Röntgensatellite) and the Japan-U.S. ASCA (Advanced Satellite 
for Cosmology and Astrophysics) had suggested the existence of a mid-mass black hole in M82. 
Scientists compared Chandra’s new high-resolution images with optical radio and infrared maps 
to determine that a single, bright source was emitting most of the x-rays. The scientists continued 
to observe M82 over an eight-month period, noting that the intensity of the x-rays rose and fell 
every 600 seconds. Philip Kaaret of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics explained 
that this behavior was similar to black holes swallowing gas from a nearby star or cloud. Martin 
Ward of the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom remarked that the findings opened “a 
whole new field of research.”982 
 
13 September 
Astronaut Edward T. Lu and cosmonaut Yuri I. Malenchenko installed three new batteries in the 
Russian service module Zvezda, which had launched with only five of its eight batteries to 
reduce its launch weight. Meanwhile, astronaut Daniel C. Burbank and cosmonaut Boris V. 
Morukov installed one of six batteries on the Russian-built control module Zarya. Burbank and 
Morukov needed a hammer and chisel to remove four small nut plates, which were obstructing a

14 September 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and H. Fisk Johnson, President of the Wisconsin-based 
private venture-capital company Fisk Ventures Inc. (FVI), signed an agreement to “explore a 
new frontier in biotechnology.” Johnson had approached NASA regarding its efforts to 
commercialize space activities, suggesting a partnership. NASA and FVI agreed to use NASA’s 
bioreactor to develop commercial medical products. The bioreactor technology creates a near-
weightless environment enabling cells to grow three-dimensionally. When raised in a traditional 
Petri dish, growing cells are flat. FVI had formed a joint venture with In Vitro Technologies Inc., 
called StelSys LLC, to focus on commercializing microgravity research in areas related to 
biological systems. StelSys paid NASA a US$100,000 licensing fee and a royalty of 5 percent of 
the company’s profits, capped at US$2 million, for the rights to 13 patents for the bioreactor 
technology for five years. NASA planned to use the bioreactor on the ISS, and StelSys intended 
to use it to research infectious diseases and to develop a liver-assist device for patients in need of 
transplant surgery. Goldin remarked that the agreement was “a symbol of the success that can be 
achieved when government, private industry, and academia work together on the exploration of 
new frontiers for scientific, technological, and economic growth.”984 
 
A GE-7 satellite, built by Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems for GE American 
Communications (GE Americom), launched from Korou, French Guiana, aboard an Ariane 5 
rocket. The C-band satellite supplemented GE Americom’s fleet of 12 satellites servicing the 
Americas, replacing the GE SATCOM C1 craft. A member of the A2100 family of satellites, the 
GE-7 joined four others⎯the GE-1, GE-2, GE-3, and GE-4⎯to provide distribution of cable, 
broadcast television and radio, business television, and broadband data distribution across the 
contiguous United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. The GE-7 would provide 
“service to regional and national customers, in-orbit protection for many current cable and radio 
customers, plus critical telecommunications services delivered by AT&T Alascom.”985 
 
NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science Edward J. Weiler appeared before the U.S. 
House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics to address the future of NASA’s space 
science programs. Weiler discussed NASA’s problems in the previous year, such as the loss of 
Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, explaining that, although NASA was developing a 
response to those losses, it would need more funding if it were to prevent similar failures in the 
future. House Subcommittee Chairperson Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) indicated that President 
William J. Clinton had proposed increasing the space science budget by US$200 million over

20 September 
Space Shuttle Atlantis landed at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida before dawn, the 15th nighttime 
landing in the Shuttle program’s history. Among the tasks that the crew had completed during 
the mission were delivering 3 tons (2,700 kilograms or 2.7 tonnes) of supplies for the first 
permanent crew⎯including toiletries, Russian and American meals, medical kits, and camera 
equipment⎯and installing the station’s toilet, an oxygen generator, a treadmill, and power and 
television cables. NASA officials had decided to extend the mission an extra day to allow the 
crew more time to accomplish its work inside the space station. N. Wayne Hale, STS-106 Flight 
Director, explained that the mission had begun with 52 items on its list of tasks to accomplish, 
but the number had increased to 74 different tasks, large and small, on board the ISS. The only 
malfunction during the mission had been that of a newly installed battery, which Russian 
Mission Control had ordered disconnected when it failed to charge properly.987 
 
21 September 
NASA selected 28 of 119 grant proposals, totaling US$10 million over four years, to conduct 
microgravity combustion research. NASA’s Office of Life and Microgravity Science and 
Applications, which was sponsoring the grants would provide the researchers with access to its 
microgravity research facilities, including drop tubes, drop towers, aircraft-flying parabolic 
trajectories, and sounding rockets. Twenty-six of the grants were for ground-based research, and 
two were for flight-definition efforts; four grants continued NASA-funded work, but the 
remaining 24 entailed new research efforts.988 
 
Russian police announced that cosmonaut German S. Titov, the Soviet Union’s second man in 
space and the first person to spend more than one day in orbit, had been found dead at home at 
the age of 65. Although the police had not reported an official cause of death, the media 
speculated that the cause was either carbon monoxide poisoning or a heart attack. Titov had 
spent 25 hours and 18 minutes aboard the tiny Soviet Vostok-2 spacecraft on 6 and 7 August 
1961. Fellow Soviet Yuri Gagarin had made the first flight on Vostok-1 on 12 April, flying for 
less than 2 hours, and U.S. astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. had followed Gagarin’s mission with a 
15-minute, suborbital flight on 5 May 1961. Titov worked on the Buran program during the 
1980s, attempting to create a Russian space shuttle, but the Soviet Union abandoned the project 
after the Russian shuttle had made one unpiloted flight. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Titov 
had entered politics, representing the Communist Party on the defense committee of the State 
Duma lower house.989

confirmed that the craft had deployed its solar array and verified a power-positive condition. 
NASA and NOAA had designed the satellite, the second in a series of five polar-orbiting 
spacecraft, to collect meteorological data and to transmit the information to users worldwide. 
NOAA’s National Weather Service planned to use the craft’s data for long-range weather and 
climate forecasts. Although NASA had managed the project of building and launching the 
satellite, it intended to transfer operational control to NOAA 10 days following the launch.990 
 
NASA released time-lapse movies created from images produced by the Hubble Space 
Telescope, showing “spectacular outbursts from young stars,” changing “dramatically over a 
period of just weeks or months.” NASA had combined individual images of young star systems 
XZ Tauri and HH 30 in the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud, captured over several years, to 
create the time-lapse movies. Documenting the activity of the early stages of stars’ lives, the 
movies demonstrated that images “taken of the universe today won’t necessarily look the same 
as those snapped a few months from now.”991

Administrator Daniel S. Goldin presented awards to three minority contractors at NASA’s 
annual Minority Business and Advocates Awards Ceremony. RS Information Services (RSIS), 
based in McLean, Virginia, won Minority Contractor of the Year; Rigging and Welding 
Specialists Inc., a Native American–owned business, won Minority Subcontractor of the Year; 
and Pace and Waite Inc. won Women-Owned Business of the Year. In addition, NASA 
recognized advocates for innovative approaches to using minority- and women-owned 
businesses, awarding NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal to Kenneth Martindale and 
Rodney J. Etchberger of Johnson Space Center and to Shantaram S. Pai of Glenn Research 
Center. Furthermore, NASA recognized five individuals for outstanding achievements and three 
NASA field centers for meeting or exceeding all socioeconomic business goals for FY 1999.992 
 
NASA named award-winning broadcast journalist Bob Jacobs as Chief of News and Information 
at NASA Headquarters. Before joining NASA, Jacobs had served for four years as Projects 
Manager for the Washington-based Broadcast Technology Division of the Associated Press, 
where he helped to develop and implement newsroom management technology. Clients had 
included the British Broadcasting Corporation, ESPN, National Public Radio, and CBS News. 
Jacobs had won an Emmy award and other regional honors for excellence in journalism.993

leave of absence from the University of California at San Diego where she is a physics professor 
throughout the remainder of the fall academic term.994 
 
NASA announced that a team of Lockheed Martin scientists using NASA’s Transition Region 
and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft to observe coronal loops⎯coils of hot, electrified 
gas⎯believed they had located the source of the heating mechanism that makes the Sun’s corona 
300 times hotter than its visible surface. A thirty-year-old theory had assumed that the coronal 
loops heated evenly, but the TRACE observations had indicated that most of the heating occurs 
at the base of the loops, near the point from which they emerge and return to the solar surface. 
The team had observed 41 loops extending from 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) to more than 
180,000 miles (290,000 kilometers) from the solar surface and had found that, although threads 
within shorter loops heat more evenly, longer threads cool noticeably as they attain height. The 
team had calculated the loops’ energy levels and estimated that “heating typically occurs in the 
first 6,000 miles of a loop’s length.” Richard Fisher, head of the Laboratory for Astronomy and 
Solar Physics at NASA’s GSFC, remarked that understanding how the coronal loops function 
could shed light on coronal-mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs can disrupt or destroy satellite 
components orbiting Earth and prompt surges in electrical transmission lines, causing blackouts 
on Earth.995 
 
27 September 
Arianespace, the France-based European satellite launch company, announced that it had won a 
contract to launch three more satellites for INTELSAT, the international satellite corporation 
based in Washington, DC. Arianespace already held a contract to launch three other satellites in 
the INTELSAT IX series. INTELSAT had scheduled six of the series’ seven spacecraft for 
launch from mid-2001 through the end of 2002, on Ariane 4 or Ariane 5 launch vehicles, from 
Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana. California-based Space Systems/Loral was building the 
4.7-tonne (4,700-kilogram or 5.2-ton) satellites. In 1965 INTELSAT had launched the world’s 
first commercial communications satellite, Early Bird.996 
 
Lockheed Martin announced that for the third time in four years, the Air Traffic Control 
Association had awarded the company its Industry Award, recognizing Lockheed’s outstanding 
achievement in and contribution to the science of air traffic control. The award specifically 
recognized Lockheed Martin Air Traffic Management for its worldwide support of air traffic–
control systems. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the German Civil Aviation 
Authority, and the United Kingdom’s National Air Traffic Services Ltd. Had all nominated the 
company for the award.997

NASA’s Langley Research Center awarded contracts valued at US$1.8 million to two companies 
for operating airport-surface surveillance systems intended to prevent runway accidents, a top 
safety priority of the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board. The contracts required 
Sensis Corporation of Dewitt, New York, and Rannoch Corporation of Alexandria, Virginia, to 
operate the Airport Traffic Identification System (ATIDS) and the Dynamic Runway Occupancy 
Measurement Systems (DROMS) at Detroit’s Metropolitan Wayne International Airport, for six 
months, establishing and validating the systems in a “live” environment. The contracts also 
required Sensis to deploy and evaluate DROMS at Memphis International Airport and to 
interface the system with the existing Sensis-operated ATIDS at that airport.998 
 
29 September 
NASA announced its agreement with Lockheed Martin on a plan for the X-33 space plane 
program. The agreed plan included aluminum fuel tanks for hydrogen fuel, a revised payment 
schedule, and a target launch date in 2003, contingent on Lockheed Martin’s winning additional 
funding under the Space Launch Initiative for completing the project. NASA had funded the 
project through March 2001. The restructured plan focused on “providing milestone payments” 
to Lockheed Martin’s team, following the completion of tests and the delivery of hardware and 
software systems this year. The plan also gave greater emphasis to mission safety, quality, and 
mission success. Arthur G. Stephenson, Director of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, 
pointed out that, despite setbacks, the program’s successes had included the creation of 
technology applicable to the space program and to the commercial aircraft industry, such as a 
revolutionary new rocket engine; a robust, reusable, metallic thermal-protection system; and 
software and sensors that automatically determine and predict failures and errors before they 
affect the flight.999 
 
NASA announced the restructuring of the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and 
Applications (OLSMA), part of the Human Exploration and Development of Space Enterprise 
(HEDS). OLSMA, renamed the Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR), would 
become a separate enterprise focusing on scientific research, working closely with HEDS to 
facilitate long-term exploration of space. The OBPR would comprise five divisions: the Physical 
Sciences Division, the Fundamental Space Biology Division, the Biomedical and Human 
Support Research Division, the Division of Research Integration, and the Division of Policy and 
Program Integration. NASA named Kathie L. Olsen as Acting Associate Administrator, to return 
to her position as Chief Scientist after NASA had filled the position permanently.1000

New NASA research published in the 1 October issue of the American Meteorological Society’s 
Journal of Climate warned that clouds might not help counteract climate-warming trends. 
Anthony D. Del Genio, of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, had 
analyzed observations of low clouds over land, collected between 1994 and 1997 as part of the 
U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program. Del Genio had 
found that clouds are thinner when temperatures were higher, a phenomenon occurring in any 
weather condition or season and at any time of day. Some climate theories had predicted that 
high temperatures would cause thicker clouds because of an increase in water vapor, but Del 
Genio explained that during warmer temperatures, the bottoms of clouds rise and become 
thinner. This occurs because clouds that form over a warm, dry air mass must rise higher before 
becoming sufficiently saturated with water to form a cloud base. Thinner clouds are less capable 
of reflecting sunlight back into space and are, therefore, unable to act as a “natural sun shield.” 
Del Genio’s findings corroborated long-term, worldwide satellite observations, published using 
the NASA-funded International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) database. The 
ISCCP, a global composite of cloud observations from international weather satellites, began 
showing a link between cloud thinning and temperature in 1992.1001 
 
International Launch Services (ILS), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin, Khrunichev State 
Research, and S. P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia, launched a Russian Proton 
rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Proton launch, the fourth in the year for 
ILS, successfully placed into orbit a United States–built GE-1A communications satellite serving 
customers in parts of Asia, including China, the Philippines, and India.1002 
 
3 October 
Russian space experts agreed that the Mir space station was in fine condition to continue orbiting 
Earth, and the Russian government extended the station’s time in space indefinitely, after the 
Netherlands-based MirCorp agreed to fund a new mission. Russia’s council of space engineers, 
known as the Council of Chief Designers, authorized plans to launch a Progress cargo spacecraft, 
in the middle of October, to deliver fuel and equipment to Mir.1003 
 
5 October 
European Space Agency (ESA) engineers announced the discovery of a flaw in the European 
receiver on NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, prompting an inquiry into why engineers had not 
identified the problem before NASA had launched the craft, and how the issue could be resolved 
before the craft reached its destination. Cassini’s probe data relay subsystem (PDRS) lacked 
sufficient bandwidth to navigate the Doppler shift with the Huygens probe as the probe 
parachuted toward the surface of Saturn’s moon Titan. Therefore, the system would be unable to 
recover all of the data that Huygens’s six instruments would generate. Cassini and Huygens 
launched on 15 October 1997, with Huygens scheduled to separate from Cassini on 6 November 
2004, break through Titan’s atmosphere on 27 November 2004, and descend to the moon’s

surface using a parachute system. The mission plan called for Huygens to measure the 
composition and winds of Titan’s atmosphere and to collect images. The probe would send the 
data via the S-band PDRS to Cassini, which would then transmit the data to Earth. However, the 
ESA stated that the inadequate bandwidth of the PDRS meant that link margins would degrade, 
because the Doppler shift on the data subcarrier would be outside the bandwidth of the receiver-
phase lock loop, leading to a potential loss in the link of 10dB over what engineers had assumed 
for the mission.1004 
 
6 October 
NASA announced the selection of Sverdrup Technology Inc. to fulfill a contract providing 
engineering, science, and technical services at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The two-
year contract, with three one-year priced options valued at US$300 million over five years, 
would go into effect on 15 October.1005 
 
9 October 
The High Energy Transient Explorer Mission (HETE-2) launched aboard a Hybrid Pegasus 
expendable launch vehicle, from Kwajalein missile-range facility on the Kwajalein Atoll in the 
Pacific Ocean. The Center for Space Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology headed 
the HETE-2 mission, designed to detect and localize gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using a set of 
instruments that would allow simultaneous observations of the GRBs. The craft would compute 
locations of GRBs and immediately transmit the coordinates to ground-based observers. HETE-
2, an international collaboration among the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, replaced the 
original HETE spacecraft, which was lost following a rocket malfunction in November 1996.1006 
 
11 October 
Space Shuttle Discovery launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida, on Mission STS-92, also known as ISS Assembly Flight 3.3A, to carry out an 11-day 
construction mission requiring four scheduled spacewalks at the International Space Station 
(ISS). Discovery’s crew⎯Commander Brian Duffy, Pilot Pamela A. Melroy, and Mission 
Specialists Koichi Wakata, Leroy Chiao, Peter J. K. Wisoff, Michael Lopez-Alegria, and 
William S. McArthur⎯was transporting a truss and a docking port to the station, planning to 
install them before the arrival of the first scheduled ISS crew at the end of October.

Responding to a 25 January 2000 article in the New York Times, alleging that grants in the mid-
1990s had benefited the Russian civilian agency Biopreparat, NASA’s Office of Inspector 
General published a report stating that NASA had not followed the U.S. Department of State’s 
guidelines for administering biotechnology grants to Russia, thereby inadvertently funding germ-
warfare laboratories. The Russian government owned 51 percent of Biopreparat, the organization

that had conducted most of the Soviet Union’s biological warfare research since the 1970s. At 
the time of the article’s publication, Biopreparat was continuing to research pathogens that had 
been included in the Soviet biological warfare program. The Inspector General found that 
“almost three-fourths of US$1.68 million in NASA grants intended for space biotechnology 
work found its way to ‘institutions that had been affiliated with Russia’s biological warfare 
program’.” Therefore, the Inspector General asserted that NASA had not followed the 
Department of State’s guidelines requiring NASA to “regularly visit and participate in the 
research it was funding at Russian institutes that had been part of the Soviet biological warfare 
program.” NASA agreed with the Inspector General’s sole recommendation: to practice 
“invasive collaboration” in the future, when funding biotechnology research in countries with 
known or suspected biological weapons programs.1007 
 
Space Shuttle Discovery arrived at the ISS. Shuttle Commander Brian Duffy successfully 
executed the rendezvous without the Shuttle’s radar, relying on a star-tracking system and on 
handheld lasers operated by his crew. The Ku-band antenna had failed after launch, disrupting 
the radar and television link. The Shuttle docking was NASA’s first conducted without radar.1008 
 
The ESA signed a four-year contract with two industry groups⎯Sarcom, led by Spot Image of 
Toulouse, France, and the Emma consortium, led by Eurimage of Rome⎯granting the two 
groups “priority access to the Envisat radar remote-sensing satellite” scheduled for launch in 
2001, as well as imagery from the ERS-2 spacecraft, already in orbit. About the new business 
relationship, a major policy shift for the ESA, Acting Envisat Mission Manager Günther 
Kohlhammer remarked that the ESA had realized that it needed to change so that it could 
develop new markets. The contract gave commercial orders for the satellite images priority over 
scientific requests, setting new limits on the type and number of users ESA would grant access to 
data without paying commercial prices.1009 
 
14 October 
Despite unexpected problems, astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Discovery installed a 9-ton 
(8,200-kilogram or 8.2-tonne) structural truss on the Unity module of the ISS, completing one of 
the major objectives of the mission. The Z1 truss held four mass gyroscopes and the station’s 
main Ku-band and S-band communications antennas. In addition, the truss provided a temporary 
attachment point for a set of solar arrays scheduled to arrive during a December Shuttle mission. 
The astronauts faced several obstacles during the installation process. A short in the Shuttle’s 
payload circuitry disabled the computerized camera system needed to orient the truss for 
attachment, causing a 2½-hour delay. However, the astronauts were able to wire a backup 
computer into an alternate power source, restoring power to the Space Vision System, which 
NASA had programmed to “determine the truss’s precise location and orientation with respect to 
the station by measuring the locations of the targets on its surface as viewed from different

payload bay cameras.” The astronauts had to delay their work again when the Space Vision 
System failed to generate reliable data during certain orbital lighting conditions, requiring 
astronaut William S. McArthur to recalibrate the system.1010 
 
15 October 
Astronauts Leroy Chiao and William S. McArthur made a spacewalk outside the ISS to link 
electrical cables to the station’s new truss and to deploy the main antenna. The pair routed six 
power- and data-cables between the truss and the station, as well as four backup cables. Tests 
indicated that all connections worked. The astronauts moved one of the truss’s two antennas to a 
temporary location out of the way of future construction work; mounted the main antenna, a 78-
inch-wide (2-meter-wide) dish, to a 12-foot (3.7-meter) boom; and extended the main antenna. 
According to NASA’s schedule, the ISS crew would turn on the antenna during an April 2001 
Shuttle mission.1011 
 
16 October 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced the appointment of Baruch S. Blumberg, 1976 
Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology and Medicine, as Senior Advisor to the Administrator, 
effective immediately. While continuing in his position as Director of NASA’s Astrobiology 
Institute, Blumberg would also provide guidance to NASA’s newly created Office of Biological 
and Physical Research (OBPR), an interdisciplinary effort combining research in biology, 
physics, chemistry, and engineering. Goldin also announced that NASA would begin a search, 
headed by Blumberg and NASA Chief Scientist Kathie L. Olsen, to fill the position of Associate 
Administrator for the new OBPR and other key positions. Olsen would serve as Acting Associate 
Administrator until NASA had filled the position.1012 
 
Three astronauts attached a new docking port to the ISS, with two of the crew spacewalking and 
one operating Discovery’s robotic arm from inside the Shuttle. Astronauts Peter J. K. “Jeff” 
Wisoff and Michael Lopez-Alegria, assigned to work outside the ISS, had difficulty loosening 
the latches securing the docking port inside Discovery’s cargo bay. However, once they had 
freed it, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata lifted the 2,700-pound (1,200-kilogram) port using 
the Shuttle’s robotic arm and positioned it on the space station. When the port was within 1 foot 
(0.3 meters) of its position, the astronauts outside gave Wakata “invaluable” instructions, 
necessary because the crew was working without the assistance of the camera at the end of the 
robotic arm. The camera had been out of commission since the short circuit on 14 October.1013 
 
17 October 
Russia launched a Progress supply spacecraft to deliver fuel to the uninhabited Mir space station, 
which was slipping from orbit. Increased solar flare activity had expanded the atmosphere, 
creating friction between Mir and the thin gases above Earth and causing the station to descend

steadily, ever since its last crew had returned to Earth in June after a 73-day mission. The fuel 
would enable the station to achieve a higher orbit, preventing it from falling into thicker layers of 
the atmosphere and burning up. Some Russian politicians had called for disposal of the station, 
and U.S. space officials had urged the Russian government to dedicate its “scarce space funds” 
to the ISS. However, MirCorp, a private company based in the Netherlands, had leased time on 
Mir and agreed to fund the Progress launch, thereby saving the station.1014 
 
18 October 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin recognized members of the Space Shuttle’s ice and debris 
inspection team for their work on 10 October, leading to the discovery of a stray 4-inch (10-
centimeter) pin near the Shuttle’s external fuel tank, hours before the scheduled launch of STS-
92. In response to the find, NASA had delayed the launch for 24 hours to allow the team to 
retrieve the pin, thereby preventing the damage that would have ensued if the pin had been 
sucked into the Shuttle’s thermal protection system or into a main engine. Goldin awarded 
employees Gregory N. Katnik and Jorge E. Rivera NASA’s Exceptional Achievement Medal, an 
honor recognizing significant contributions to the mission of NASA through substantial and 
significant improvements in operations, efficiency, service, financial savings, science, or 
technology. United Space Alliance employees Michael Barber, John B. Blue, and Thomas F. 
Ford received NASA’s Public Service Medal, an award given to individuals who are not 
government employees but make exceptional contributions to NASA’s mission.1015 
 
In preparation for the December arrival of a pair of solar panels, astronauts Michael Lopez-
Alegria and Peter J. K. “Jeff” Wisoff cleaned up the top of the newly installed truss on the ISS. 
The two men also deployed a tray on the truss, which would hold the connections between the 
station’s central structure and the Destiny laboratory module built by the United States and 
scheduled for installation in January. Next, the spacewalkers tested “mini-jetpacks,” known as 
Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue or SAFER. NASA intended the nitrogen-powered jetpacks for 
use only in emergencies, such as rescuing an injured or incapacitated spacewalker. With only 
limited fuel supplies in the jetpacks, each of the astronauts’ moves had to be deliberate; each test 
maneuver lasted approximately 3 minutes, while the astronaut traveled a distance of about 50 
feet (15 meters). The astronauts remained tethered to the Shuttle’s robotic arm throughout the 
tests.1016 
 
19 October 
During their only full day inside the ISS, Shuttle crew members spent their last day before 
heading back to Earth transferring supplies, wiping down the station’s walls with fungicide to 
prevent mold and mildew, and testing four gyroscopes installed earlier in the mission. The crew 
spun the gyroscopes briefly at 100 revolutions per minute, and the gyroscopes functioned as 
expected.1017

SkyCorp signed a commercial Space Act agreement with NASA providing that SkyCorp deploy 
into orbit, either from the Space Shuttle or from the ISS, a satellite containing an Internet server. 
NASA and SkyCorp planned to test the idea as a “proof of concept” for a Low Earth Orbit 544 
satellite constellation, offering Internet access on a global scale. SkyCorp chose to launch an 
Apache server on a small satellite containing an Apple 500 MHz Power Mac G4. The agreement 
with NASA outlined SkyCorp’s novel idea of launching a partially assembled satellite aboard a 
Space Shuttle. Astronauts would assemble the craft in space before tossing it from a Shuttle or 
ISS airlock into an independent orbit. SkyCorp named its concept Gossamer. Typically, 
engineers assemble a satellite fully on Earth, and it must withstand the stress of launch. A 
satellite built according to the Gossamer concept would only need to retain structural integrity in 
microgravity, greatly simplifying guidance, navigation, and control requirements.1018 
 
23 October 
Chairman and founder of Beal Aerospace Technologies Inc. Andrew Beal announced his 
decision to cease all business operations effective immediately. The company had sought to 
develop low-cost, reliable, commercial space launch systems and had “made significant 
advances in low cost hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems.” Beal expressed confidence that, 
despite the company’s cost overruns and schedule delays, Beal Aerospace Technologies could 
have successfully developed its BA-2C rocket-launch system if it had remained in operation. 
Beal outlined the risk factors that had been beyond the company’s control and had led to the 
decision to cease operations: 1) NASA’s and the U.S. government’s commitment to the 
subsidization of competing launch systems; 2) federal laws mandating the company’s “potential 
liability for pre-existing environmental contamination at the only available Cape Canaveral 
launchpads”; and 3) uncertainty about receiving approval from the U.S. Department of State to 
launch from the company’s launch facilities in Guyana. Beal remarked that government 
subsidization of launch systems was the primary reason that the company had to choose, either to 
become a government contractor, like the Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin, or to cease 
operations.1019 
 
24 October 
NASA’s Langley Research Center selected Swales and Associates Inc. to provide research and 
development, engineering, and support services, under a contract valued at up to US$240 million 
over five years. Specific work areas covered under the contract included full-spectrum 
aerodynamics, gas dynamics, fluid dynamics, aerothermodynamics, acoustics and aeroacoustics, 
metallic and nonmetallic structures and materials, and spaceborne and airborne systems.1020 
 
Space Shuttle Discovery landed safely at Edwards Air Force Base in California, ending the 100th 
mission of the Shuttle program. Poor weather conditions had prevented the Shuttle’s scheduled

landing in Florida on 22 October. Edwards had opened as a backup site on 23 October, but wind 
and rainy weather had prevented a landing at either site until 24 October. The landing was the 
first Shuttle landing at Edwards since poor weather had prevented a Shuttle landing in Florida in 
March 1996. In the early years of the program, Shuttles had typically landed at Edwards Air 
Force Base, but later, both launches and landings became the functions of KSC in Cape 
Canaveral, Florida.1021 
 
26 October 
NASA announced the findings of an investigation into the 16 June incident involving the Space 
Shuttle’s main engine. The team, headed by Robert L. Sackheim, Assistant Director for Space 
Propulsion at NASA’s MSFC, had determined that 24 square inches (155 square centimeters) of 
tape had fallen into the Shuttle engine’s fuel system and that nobody had noticed the tape before 
the engine’s test firing. The tape’s location had caused the engine’s temperature to increase 
rapidly, beyond normal operating limits, damaging some components of the engine’s fuel pump. 
According to Sackheim, the engine controller had performed according to its design, shutting 
down the engine 5 seconds into the planned 200-second test when it sensed a temperature 
exceeding safe limits. Sackheim’s team had concluded, “the handling of, accounting for, and 
inspecting for loose materials, used to process and rebuild engines during normal operations, 
were inadequate.” The test had been a “temperature margin” demonstration, undertaken as part 
of the developmental phase of a more robust Pratt & Whitney Advanced Technology High 
Pressure Fuel Turbopump. The engine had not been in flight configuration but had been a unit in 
a testing process aimed at validating the prototype engine’s ability to operate at higher-than-
normal temperatures.1022 
 
The Russian government earmarked funds to send two Progress cargo spacecraft to the Mir space 
station, announcing that it would wait until February 2001 to make a final decision about the 
station’s fate. Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya I. Klebanov had explained that the decision the 
Russian government had been wavering about for more than a year rested on the availability of 
private funds to keep the station in orbit. Executives from MirCorp had promised the Russian 
government that the company would raise between US$100 million and US$170 million by next 
year, but Russian space officials were skeptical of MirCorp’s ability to meet this commitment. 
MirCorp had yet to pay the US$10 million it owed Russia for the 17 October launch of a 
Progress cargo spacecraft delivering fuel to Mir.1023 
 
NASA announced that it planned to implement a new Mars Exploration Program over the 
following two decades. NASA planned six major missions during the next 10 years, launching 
the Mars Odyssey orbiter mission in 2001, twin Mars Exploration Rovers in 2003, and Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter⎯a powerful scientific orbiter⎯in 2005. Additional plans included the 
development and launch, possibly as early as 2007, of a “long-range, long-duration mobile 
science laboratory,” which would “pave the way for a future sample return mission.” NASA also

proposed to create a new line of small missions called Scout missions, involving airborne 
vehicles or small landers. NASA would select designs for the Scout spacecraft from proposals 
submitted by the scientific community. Besides sending additional scientific orbiters, rovers, and 
landers to Mars during the second decade of the program, NASA announced its plans to launch 
its first sample-return mission in 2014, with a second mission in 2016. The new program 
incorporated “lessons learned from previous mission successes and failures” and built on recent 
scientific discoveries. Although NASA led the revamped program, the Mars missions also 
included international participants, particularly France and Italy, whose space agencies had 
agreed to conduct collaborative scientific orbital and surface investigations, as well as to 
contribute sample collection-and-return systems, telecommunications assets, and launch 
services.1024 
 
30 October 
NASA awarded Lockheed Martin Space Systems a US$1.15 billion six-year contract to produce 
35 additional super-lightweight external tanks for the Space Shuttle Program, the sixth 
production of tanks and the first composed entirely of super-lightweight tanks. The contract 
covered the manufacture, assembly, test, and delivery of the tanks, as well as the operations and 
maintenance of NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans and activities at MSFC and 
KSC. Jerry W. Smelser, Manager of MSFC’s External Tank Project Office, described the 
contract as designed to “assure the delivery of a quality product and to reward the contractor and 
employees on the basis of performance.”1025 
 
President William J. Clinton signed into law H. R. 1654, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2000, authorizing funding for “a robust space and 
aeronautics program for the Nation.” Clinton commended bipartisan efforts to pass an 
authorization bill funding NASA’s priorities, such as building the ISS, improving Space Shuttle 
safety, and using the Space Launch Initiative to reduce the cost of access to space. However, 
Clinton criticized the bill for limiting “NASA’s flexibility to pursue a promising commercial 
habitation module” for the ISS, saying that the bill included several “objectionable provisions” 
and only one of the 14 legislative provisions that his administration had proposed.1026 
 
31 October 
The first crew to inhabit the ISS launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on its 
four-month mission. A veteran of three U.S. Space Shuttle missions, William M. Shepherd 
commanded Expedition I. Crew members, with whom Shepherd had trained since 1996, were 
two cosmonauts, Pilot Yuri P. Gidzenko of the Russian air force and Flight Engineer Sergei K. 
Krikalev, a veteran of four Russian and U.S. space missions. With 484 days logged in orbit, 
Krikalev was one of the world’s most experienced space travelers.1027

2 November 
The first International Space Station (ISS) crew, Expedition I, arrived at the new station where 
they planned to live for the next four and one-half months. The crew’s Soyuz craft automatically 
docked at a port on the Zvezda habitation module. The Russian-built, NASA-financed Zarya 
propulsion-and-storage module, attached to the other end of Zvezda, was loaded with supplies 
and equipment delivered by recent Shuttle missions. Unless an emergency or breakdown 
occurred, the multi-hatch Unity module would remain off limits. A Shuttle crew had installed a 
structural truss on the Unity module in October, and during a mission scheduled for early 
December, another crew would attach a set of solar arrays to the truss. Without the solar arrays, 
the station did not have enough power to heat the module properly or to control the dew point, to 
prevent dangerous condensation. The ISS crew and their U.S. and Russian managers temporarily 
named the station Alpha, at least for the duration of the Expedition I mission.1028 
 
3 November 
NASA announced that the Chandra X-ray Observatory had detected iron-emission lines in the 
afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (GRB), marking the first time such lines had been 
“unambiguously detected” in association with GRBs, and the first time scientists had been able 
to measure their properties precisely in x-ray wavelengths. Luigi Piro, lead author of a paper 
published in the 3 November issue of the journal Science, explained that the discovery provided 
an important clue to understanding the origins of the bursts. The new data enabled scientists to 
rule out the theory that two neutron stars or black holes collide to cause a GRB, one of various 
theories about how the bursts originate. Instead, Piro suggested that the bursts were more likely 
the result of “something similar to a supernova explosion, but much more powerful.”1029 
 
6 November 
Jason Allen Diekman of Mission Viejo, California, pled guilty to federal charges of computer 
crimes after negotiating a deal with prosecutors. Prosecutors had charged Diekman in September 
with illegal hacking and with using stolen credit card numbers to purchase US$6,000 worth of 
computer equipment and other items. He had confessed to investigators that he had hacked into 
“hundreds, maybe thousands” of computers over two years, including systems at the University 
of California at Los Angeles, Harvard University, Cornell University, the University of 
California at San Diego, and California State University at Fullerton. Diekman’s most serious 
confessed invasions had occurred at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where he had 
gained root-level access to two computer systems, and at Stanford University, where he had

8 November 
An eruption of solar-flare activity prompted NASA to order the ISS crew to take shelter in the 
Russian-built Zvezda module for 12 hours. The federal Space Environment Center in Boulder, 
Colorado, rated the solar-flare event an S-4, making it the fourth-largest solar-radiation storm 
since 1976. NASA calculated that the ISS would travel through danger zones during the seven or 
eight orbits of a 12-hour period on 9 November. Officials advised the crew to activate radiation-
detection monitors in Zvezda’s living quarters and to remain in the aft section of the module 
during working hours, except for two periods of 15 to 20 minutes during each 90-minute orbit, 
when they could safely move around the cabin. Michael J. Golightly, Chief of Space Science at 
Johnson Space Center (JSC), explained that the Zvezda module had a shield heavy enough to 
reduce the crew’s radiation exposure by 60 percent.1031 
 
9 November 
The Chandra X-ray Observatory team won a Current Achievement award from the Smithsonian 
Institution’s National Air and Space Museum for “its efforts in building, placing in orbit, and 
operating the most sophisticated astronomical observatory ever built.” NASA had first proposed 
the Chandra in 1976 and had placed the telescope in orbit during a Space Shuttle mission in July 
1999. Since its deployment, Chandra had refined scientists’ knowledge of the nature of galactic 
nuclei, confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies like 
Andromeda and the Milky Way, captured images of an active starburst galaxy, analyzed the 
compositions of supernovas, and examined x-ray stars in the Orion Nebula. The museum also 
honored engineer and aviator A. Scott Crossfield with a Lifetime Achievement award. Crossfield 
had begun his career in the 1950s as a research pilot for NASA’s predecessor agency, the 
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and had become the first pilot to exceed Mach 2, 
accomplishing this feat while flying the rocket-powered Douglas D-558-2. Crossfield had joined 
North American Aviation in 1955 and had worked on all aspects of the X-15 program. In 
addition to his work on the X-15, Crossfield had developed the ground-control test methodology 
that became standard in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. He had served as a 
division vice president at Eastern Airlines between 1967 and 1975 and, after that, as a technical 
advisor to the U.S. House Science Subcommittee for Transportation, Aviation, and Weather until 
his retirement in 1993.1032 
 
NASA announced that the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had captured an image of a lone 
neutron star traveling close to Earth, one of several hundred million neutron stars that scientists 
believed to exist in the Milky Way. Hubble scientists believed that, at 200 light-years away, this 
neutron star was the nearest to Earth. No companion star affected its appearance, allowing

astronomers to more easily test and confirm stellar theories against its physical properties, such 
as size, brightness, and true age. Frederick M. Walter of State University of New York at Stony 
Brook remarked that, as the closest and brightest of the few known isolated neutron stars, this 
star would be “the easiest to study and is an excellent test bed for nuclear astrophysical 
theories.”1033 
 
United Space Alliance finalized its investigation into the loose pin that had delayed the October 
launch of Space Shuttle Discovery, reporting that the pin had come from the Vehicle Assembly 
Building. Technicians had incorrectly installed the pin, intended to secure a platform above part 
of the Shuttle’s fuel tank. During the Shuttle’s transport to the launchpad on 8 September, the 4-
inch (10-centimeter) metal pin had fallen 73 feet (22 meters), landing on a fuel line near one of 
the tank’s connections to the Shuttle. After inspectors had found the pin on 10 October, NASA 
officials had delayed Discovery’s launch 24 hours, so that technicians could remove the pin, 
preventing damage during liftoff.1034 
 
10 November 
NASA’s Stardust spacecraft entered safe mode after a stream of high-energy protons emanating 
from a solar flare hit the craft. Stardust, on a mission to return samples of a comet, had been 130 
million miles (210 million kilometers) from the Sun, traveling at about 12,000 miles (19,000 
kilometers) per hour, when the solar flare erupted on 9 November. The solar wind had brought 
the stream of protons into contact with the craft hours later, in the middle of the night, 
confirming that NASA engineers and scientists monitoring the situation had reason to feel 
concerned.1035 
 
13 November 
The NASA flight team for the Stardust spacecraft commanded it to leave safe mode after having 
successfully inspected the craft’s cameras. Once back in normal operating mode, the craft 
controlled its orientation in space perfectly.1036 
 
15 November 
Iridium Satellite LLC announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of 
New York had approved its bid to purchase the operating assets, property, and intellectual 
property of Iridium LLC. Iridium Satellite LLC would continue providing commercial satellite 
communication services to the U.S. government.1037 
 
16 November 
The Russian government decided that it could no longer afford to maintain the Mir space station 
and would destroy it in February 2001 during a controlled descent. The Russian government had 
previously decided to abandon Mir, but had extended the space station’s time in orbit after the 
private MirCorp, based in the Netherlands, had leased time on the station, financing its operation.

According to the Russian government, a primary factor in its decision to end Mir’s orbit had 
been increasing skepticism over MirCorp’s continued ability to finance Mir.1038 
 
17 November 
When the automatic docking system failed, cosmonaut Yuri P. Gidzenko used remote control to 
dock the first Progress cargo spacecraft arriving at the ISS. The craft, loaded with food, boots, 
and supplies, had traveled smoothly to the ISS until within 300 feet (91.4 meters) of the station. 
When the spacecraft’s automatic docking system failed to lock onto the space station, Gidzenko 
took control, guiding the craft to within 15 feet (4.6 meters) of the station. Glaring sunlight and a 
fogged camera lens forced him to wait 40 minutes, before he was able to complete the maneuver 
safely.1039 
 
20 November 
EarthWatch Inc., a Colorado-based company developing a network of satellites to capture 
images of various regions of the Earth for commercial applications, launched its QuickBird 1 
craft from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, aboard a Russian Cosmos-3M rocket. However, ground 
stations did not pick up its signals as planned. U.S. tracking data listed the craft’s orbit as 
“decayed,” and a Russian Aerospace Agency spokesperson described the craft as “effectively 
lost.” EarthWatch had lost its first satellite, Early Bird 1, four days after its 24 December 1997 
launch because of a power-system problem.1040 
 
Arizona State University and JPL, a division of California Institute of Technology, announced 
the creation of the Arizona State University Planetary Imaging Facility and Advanced Training 
Institute (PIF-ATI) for the study of Mars. Arizona State University and JPL would jointly fund 
the new facility, which the two institutions intended for scientists and students to use. PIF-ATI 
expanded on a facility originally planned in support of the Thermal Emission Imaging System 
(THEMIS), scheduled to fly on the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft. PIF-ATI would offer 
scientists and students outside the project greater access to instruments and data, providing 
access for university students, for students of the fifth through twelfth grades, and for their 
teachers.1041

NASA selected six teams of scientists to participate in the first new mission of its Origins 
Program. The teams would use the new Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), scheduled 
for launch in July 2002, to study the formation of galaxies, stars, and dust discs, under the 
following projects: “Galaxy Birth and Evolution,” “Black Holes and Galaxies,” “Unveiling 
Hidden Stars,” “Inside the Milky Way,” “From Gas to Stars,” and “Planet Formation: When the 
Dust Settles.” The teams, selected from 28 proposals submitted by astronomers located around 
the world, comprised the SIRTF Legacy Science Program.1043 
 
NASA selected 41 proposals of the 109 scientists had submitted, to conduct research on Earth 
and in space using NASA’s microgravity research facilities. NASA intended the researchers to 
use the facilities to “enhance understanding of physical, biological, and chemical processes 
associated with fundamental physics.” NASA was funding the research with more than US$15 
million in grants over a four-year period, under the sponsorship of its Office of Biological and 
Physical Research. Sixteen of the grants continued work already funded by NASA, and twenty-
four were for new research efforts. Thirty-six grants funded ground-based research, and the 
remaining five funded flight-definition projects.1044 
 
The U.S. Department of Energy announced its selection of the Idaho Engineering and 
Environmental Laboratory to produce plutonium-238, the most radioactive form of plutonium. 
NASA planned to use the isotope, which generates electricity to “keep things from freezing up,” 
to fuel a spacecraft on a mission to Pluto planned for after 2020.1045 
 
22 November 
Gerald A. Soffen, Director of University Programs at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center 
(GSFC), died of a heart ailment. Soffen had begun his career at NASA at JPL, working on 
biological instrumentation development, moving in the mid-1970s to Langley Research Center 
(LARC), where he worked on the Viking Mars Project as a project scientist. He became LARC’s 
chief environmental scientist before transferring to GSFC in 1983. At Goddard, Soffen had 
helped develop to NASA’s astrobiology program and to establish NASA’s Astrobiology 
Institute. In 1978 NASA had appointed him Life Sciences Director at NASA Headquarters and, 
since its establishment in 1990, he had served as Director of the University Programs Office. 
GSFC Director Alphonse V. Diaz remarked that science and students were Soffen’s two loves, 
and that “the Agency and the nation will continue to benefit enormously from the talented young 
people he has brought into the scientific community.”1046

The government of the People’s Republic of China released a document outlining its policy 
regarding its future human spaceflight program and satellite-launch industries. The document, 
which provided the outside world with information about China’s top-secret space program, 
described the Chinese space industry as “an integral part of the state’s comprehensive 
development strategy” and stated, “exploration and utilization of outer space should be for 
peaceful purposes and benefit the whole of mankind.” The paper provided details of China’s 
satellite program, stating that as of October 2000, China had developed and launched 47 
satellites with a success rate of over 90 percent. China had four satellite series in operation: the 
Dongfanghong telecommunications series; the Fengyun meteorological series; the Shijian 
research and technology series; and the Ziyuan Earth-observation series, which had recently 
launched its first spacecraft. The paper also outlined China’s efforts toward international 
cooperation, notably China’s signing of an agreement with a dozen countries, including the 
United States, Russia, Japan, and several European countries, allowing for scientific exchange 
and joint development of spacecraft components, as well as for commercial launch services. To 
date, China had launched 27 foreign-made satellites using its Long March series of rockets.1047 
 
24 November 
NASA Director of Media Services Brian D. Welch died after suffering a heart attack. Welch, 
who had led many of NASA’s public outreach efforts, was responsible for its news operations, 
for NASA Television, and for NASA’s Internet efforts. Welch had begun his career as a 
cooperative-education student of public affairs at LARC in 1979. In 1981 he had become editor 
of Space News Roundup, the newspaper of NASA’s JSC. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, 
Welch had worked as a public affairs mission commentator, Deputy News Chief at Mission 
Control Center, Manager of JSC’s Mission Commentary Team, and Newsroom Manager during 
Shuttle flights. NASA had appointed Welch as Chief of News and Information in 1994, and he 
had become Director of Media Services in 1998. Administrator Daniel S. Goldin spoke of how 
Welch’s sudden death had stunned NASA, saying that Welch’s “love and enthusiasm for 
spaceflight and exploration” was “infectious,” and describing Welch’s passionate approach to his 
work as the true embodiment of “the spirit of this agency.”1048 
 
28 November 
NASA announced the selection of a science team for the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), 
scheduled for launch in 2009. The team consisted of 10 principal investigators leading key 
science teams and 5 mission specialists. NASA intended SIM, part of its Origins Program, to 
search for Earth-sized planets around other stars; to measure precisely the locations and distances 
of stars throughout the Milky Way Galaxy; and to study other celestial objects, helping to answer 
fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the galaxy. NASA planned to place the 
SIM spacecraft in an Earth-trailing orbit around the Sun, enabling the craft’s multiple telescopes 
to gather the Sun’s light and producing information normally only obtained with much larger 
telescopes. NASA considered identification of potential observing targets for the Terrestrial 
Planet Finder a critical part of SIM’s mission. NASA planned the Terrestrial Planet Finder to

capture images of planetary systems around other stars and to search for chemical signatures 
suggesting the possibility of life.1049 
 
The National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated 
Program Office (IPO) selected Raytheon Company to provide imaging-sensor instruments for 
the new NPOESS craft, which would replace the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Polar-
Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) and the Defense Meteorological Satellite 
Program (DMSP) satellites. Under a contract valued at US$152.8 million, Raytheon would 
design, develop, and test the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument and 
develop the algorithms to produce environmental data records from VIIRS data.1050 
 
Lockheed Martin and NASA entered into a consolidated space operations contract (CSOC), 
allowing NASA to use the services of two commercial, satellite ground-tracking stations. Under 
CSOC, NASA customers would have access on a per-pass basis to additional stations on 
Svalbard Island in Norway, owned by Kongsberg Spacetec-Lockheed Martin Space Data 
Services, and in Poker Flat, Alaska, owned by DataLynx. Both tracking stations had recently 
completed CSOC operational-readiness reviews in preparation for inclusion in Lockheed 
Martin’s catalog of services available to NASA programs.1051 
 
30 November 
NASA announced that new technology recently tested at Ames Research Center (ARC) had 
converted sounds emanating from landing-gear wind noise into color images on computer 
screens, “enabling engineers to pinpoint loud and preventable aircraft flight noise more easily 
than in the past.” The imposition of nighttime curfews on noisy takeoffs and landings had 
prompted aircraft manufacturers to develop quieter planes. Paul T. Soderman, leader of the ARC 
aeroacoustics group, explained that the ability to visualize the cause of wind noise coming from 
landing gear enables engineers to analyze the problem so that they can find ways to reduce 
significantly noise. The engineers had created the sound images using a computer linked to a 
quarter-scale landing-gear model and an array of 70 microphones inside the wall of a wind 
tunnel. The researchers had then removed various combinations of landing-gear parts in the wind 
tunnel, resulting in significant noise reduction.1052 
 
Space Shuttle Endeavour launched from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 
Mission STS-97, carrying to the ISS Commander Brent W. Jett Jr., Pilot Michael J. Bloomfield, 
and Mission Specialists Joseph R. Tanner, Marc Garneau, and Carlos I. Noriega. The purpose of 
STS-97, also known as ISS Assembly Flight 4A, was to connect solar arrays, to prepare a 
docking port for the U.S.-made Destiny module, to install Floating Potential Probes, to install

the ISS and the Shuttle.1053 
 
DECEMBER 2000 
1 December 
Raymond Toricelli of New Rochelle, New York, pled guilty to breaking into two NASA 
computers in 1998, to steal user names and passwords to gain access to other systems. The two 
computers, which helped launch robotic spacecraft, were at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
(JPL) in Pasadena, California. Toricelli had also set up a chat room to direct people to a 
pornography site, which paid him 18 cents per referral; broken into a San Jose University 
computer system to gain access to other networks; and stolen more than 15 credit card numbers 
online. He stated that he had never intended to damage the computers he illegally entered. 
Prosecutors planned to seek a prison term of 8 to 14 months at Toricelli’s sentencing on 7 March 
2001. The maximum penalty for his crime was 27 years in prison and a US$950,000 fine.1054 
 
Space Shuttle Endeavour docked successfully with the International Space Station (ISS), the first 
Shuttle docking at an inhabited ISS. William M. Shepherd, Commander of the ISS, noted the 
festive mood at the space station, even though the two crews would not meet in person until later 
in the mission. Soon after Endeavour docked, Canadian astronaut Marc Garneau used the 
Shuttle’s robotic arm to lift the 49-foot-long (15-meter-long) tower containing the solar array out 
of the cargo bay, where it would remain suspended 10 feet (3 meters) above the Shuttle while the 
crew slept.1055 
 
3 December 
Endeavour astronauts attempted to deploy the new solar array at the ISS, but only one of the two 
panels unfurled as planned. Joseph R. Tanner and Carlos I. Noriega conducted a spacewalk to 
assist in attaching a 17-ton (15,400-kilogram or 15.4-tonne) power assembly, while Marc 
Garneau maneuvered the Shuttle’s robotic arm from inside Endeavour. The spacewalkers were 
unable to open the latches on the storage boxes containing the folded solar panels, delaying their 
attempts to unfurl the array. They began to unfurl the first panel 1 hour behind schedule, but 
although it reached its full length in 14 minutes, the panel did not appear to have the correct 
tension. NASA officials decided to delay expanding the second panel for a full day, to give them 
time to determine the cause of the inadequate tension of the first panel. The ISS crew did not 
witness the deployment of the solar array, because the Shuttle crew carried out their work during 
the ISS crew’s sleep period.1056 
 
4 December 
Members of the astronaut crew who had flown aboard NASA’s historic 100th Space Shuttle 
flight, Mission STS-92, visited NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility to present Silver Snoopy

awards, “the highest accolade that the astronauts corps gives to people who build flight 
hardware,” to the Lockheed Martin employees who had built the Shuttle’s super-lightweight tank 
and liquid-oxygen tank. NASA had named the Silver Snoopy award after the Peanuts character, 
the dog that imagined he was a fighter pilot.1057 
 
Space Shuttle Endeavour Commander Brent W. Jett Jr. successfully unfurled the second panel of 
the solar array (colloquially referred to as a solar wing) that the crew had deployed on the ISS on 
3 December. Jett used computer commands to unfold the panel a few feet at a time, a process 
that took nearly 2 hours. No problems occurred until the crew had extended the panel almost 
fully, when it became clear that a panel on each blanket was stuck to a neighboring section. 
Endeavour’s crew turned the Shuttle to allow the Sun to warm the blankets and fired thrusters to 
shake the array, snapping the wing into place. The panel began generating electricity before it 
reached its full 115 feet (35 meters). To NASA’s relief, the panel was stretched tight. Once the 
crew had completed the process, Commander Jett radioed to Mission Control that they had two 
tensioned blankets, and Mission Control replied, “Great work, gentlemen. We think you’ve 
earned your solar wings.”1058 
 
5 December 
NASA made data from its Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 
(ASTER) available to the public. ASTER, a general-purpose imaging instrument featuring 14 
spectral bands, extremely high spatial resolution, and stereo-imaging capabilities, had launched 
aboard NASA’s Terra satellite in December 1999. One of ASTER’s primary goals was “to 
acquire a one-time cloud-free image of the entire land surface of Earth,” intended as a baseline 
image for monitoring environmental change.1059 
 
Endeavour astronauts Joseph R. Tanner and Carlos I. Noriega worked outside the ISS to connect 
power lines, correcting an electrical shortage that had restricted the station’s first crew to two of 
three habitable modules. The two astronauts also inspected the first solar panel that they had 
unfurled, to determine whether the crew could correct its tension. Wearing a small TV camera on 
his helmet, Noriega beamed down to Mission Control images of the loose tension cables on the 
array’s right wing. The cables had slipped off their pulleys during the solar panel’s deployment 
on 3 December. Tanner remarked that an astronaut could place one tension cable back on its 
pulley without too much trouble, but that the other cable would require more work. Mission 
Control instructed the spacewalkers to try to fix the cables on their third and final spacewalk the 
following day.1060 
 
7 December 
NASA and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced the signing of 
a memorandum of understanding to form a partnership to use science and space technology to

prevent natural disasters. The agreement called upon NASA and FEMA to apply remote-sensing 
research images to emergency-management issues, creating accurate and informative maps of 
flood plains and wildfires, as well as other types of maps, intended to help state and local 
communities respond to and mitigate natural disasters. The partnership, affiliated with Project 
Impact: Building Disaster Resistant Communities, would use NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise, 
as “part of an aggressive new strategy devoted to significantly increasing the application of 
NASA remote sensing data, information, science and technologies to societal needs.”1061 
 
Astronauts Joseph R. Tanner and Carlos I. Noriega were able to tighten the slack solar panel on 
the ISS within minutes, using only a hook to place two tension cables back on their pulleys. 
Although the wing functioned well even though it was slack, if the astronauts had not adjusted its 
tension, the solar cells might have torn or the support rods might have bent or broken. After 
repairing the wing, the two astronauts installed a camera cable and a static-electricity monitor on 
the outside of the ISS. The monitor would help NASA learn how to protect spacewalking 
astronauts from electrical shocks.1062 
 
8 December 
Michael C. Malin and Kenneth S. Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems published research in 
the journal Science based on images from NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. The two 
researchers had found that the images showed massive sedimentary deposits on Mars, suggesting 
that the planet “was once a water-rich land of lakes.” Malin described the images as revealing 
“hundreds and hundreds of identically thick layers,” features that were “almost impossible to 
have without water.” J. William Schopf, head of the Center for the Study of Evolution and the 
Origin of Life at the University of California at Los Angeles, commented that the images 
provided the “strongest evidence yet for what appear to be sedimentary units on Mars,” 
supporting the theory that, billions of years ago, Mars had been wetter, warmer, and possibly 
hospitable to life.1063 
 
Hatches between the ISS and Space Shuttle Endeavour opened for the first time, and the three 
members of the space station crew, who had been living aboard the ISS for five weeks, received 
their first visitors. ISS Commander William M. Shepherd commended Endeavour’s crew for 
their installation of the giant solar array on the space station. The two crews spent their day 
together transferring supplies, such as food, water, mail, and gifts, to the space station and 
removing trash, damaged items, and unneeded items for return to Earth.1064

Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, after completing the 11-day 
Mission STS-97 at the ISS, where the crew had installed and deployed the station’s new solar 
array. Shortly before touchdown, the ISS sailed above KSC, a “reminder of the pressure” on 
NASA to support more flights to the ISS as the station’s assembly accelerated. Shuttle Program 
Manager Ronald D. Dittemore remarked that the successful mission of Endeavour to the ISS was 
“a good way to end this year⎯a very successful five missions.”1065 
 
A team of three high school students from the North Carolina School for Science and 
Mathematics in Durham won first place in the Siemens-Westinghouse Science and Technology 
Competition. The team won for discovering the first evidence of a neutron star in the nearby 
supernova remnant IC443, using data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the 
National Science Foundation’s Very Large Array (VLA) Observatory. The students had located 
a point-like source of x-rays embedded in a supernova and had determined that the central object 
was most likely a pulsar, a young and rapidly rotating neutron star. Bryan M. Gaensler, a pulsar 
expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had reviewed the team’s paper, 
remarked that the students had produced “a really solid scientific finding.”1066 
 
12 December 
The Netherlands-based MirCorp, the company originally established to keep the Mir space 
station in orbit for commercial purposes, announced that, following a board meeting during the 
previous week, the company had decided to “retool the company to work with other Russian 
space equipment.” The company planned to develop a new orbiter capable of docking with the 
ISS, to market existing space technologies, such as cargo spacecraft, and to explore commercial 
projects involving access to a future Russian module on the ISS.1067 
 
16 December 
Ganymede, the largest moon in Jupiter’s solar system, joined the planet Mars and Jovian moons 
Europa and Callisto as the only known bodies showing strong evidence of the presence of liquid 
water beneath their surfaces. During the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, 
Margaret G. Kivelson, a planetary scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, 
announced that NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had found evidence of a vast sea of liquid beneath 
the surface of Jupiter’s moon Ganymede. Using data collected from Galileo’s magnetometer 
during May 2000 and earlier, Kivelson’s team had measured the moon’s magnetic field. The 
magnetometer had registered readings “best explained by a thick layer of water⎯about as salty 
as Earth’s oceans⎯hidden about 120 miles [190 kilometers] beneath” the moon’s surface. 
Thomas B. McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who also presented research at 
the conference, had used Galileo’s Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer to discover that portions 
of Ganymede appeared “to have types of salt minerals that would have been left behind by 
exposure of salty water near or onto the surface.” Gene D. McDonald, an astrobiologist at JPL, 
which manages the Galileo Mission, remarked that Ganymede might be a more promising 
destination than Europa for robotic spacecraft searching for life. Ganymede, farther from Jupiter

than Europa, has better protection than Europa from Jupiter’s intense and deadly radiation. 
Therefore, biomarker compounds emerging on the surface of Ganymede would survive longer 
there than on the other Jovian moons, as would any spacecraft orbiting or landing on 
Ganymede.1068 
 
19 December 
NASA suspended all of Cassini’s observations of Jupiter that required the spacecraft to point⎯to 
take magnetic-field measurements⎯in order to capture images, after the craft developed a 
problem with a maneuvering system. NASA permitted Cassini to continue making observations 
that did not requiring pointing. On 17 December, Cassini’s No. 2 reaction wheel had begun to 
require extra force to turn, prompting the craft to switch from electrical power to a hydrazine-
thrusting system, which Cassini needed to conserve for use in its primary Saturn mission. Cassini 
Program Manager Robert T. Mitchell remarked that, if tests of the maneuvering system were 
favorable, the craft could begin its observations again in a week to 10 days.1069 
 
20 December 
NASA’s Office of Earth Sciences selected Gencorp Aerojet to build the Advanced Technology 
Microwave Sounder (ATMS), a spaceborne instrument for measuring microwave energy emitted 
and scattered by the atmosphere. NASA intended the ATMS to replace instruments currently 
used on polar-orbiting weather satellites. NASA planned for the ATMS, working alongside an 
infrared sounder instrument, to produce daily global atmospheric temperature, humidity, and 
pressure profiles, essential for accurate weather forecasting and long-term climate research. 
Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of Earth Science Enterprise Ghassem R. Asrar 
remarked that the advanced technology would improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, from 
the current three-to-five day forecast span to seven-to-ten day predictions. NASA planned to fly 
the first unit as part of the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System 
(NPOESS) Preparatory Project Bridge mission, intended to ensure continuity of research-quality 
data through the bridging of sounding data between NASA’s Earth Observing System research 
missions and future NPOESS operational missions. Goddard Space Flight Center would provide 
oversight of the contract, worth US$206.6 million.1070 
 
NASA announced it had begun searching worldwide for proposals from principal investigators 
and institutions to develop its first mission to Pluto. In the announcement of opportunity, NASA 
solicited proposals for a complete mission to the Pluto-Charon system and the Kuiper Belt, 
requiring that submitted proposals include an expendable launch vehicle and spacecraft, its bus 
and systems, and the scientific instrumentation package. Although NASA placed no restrictions 
on the mission’s launch date, its stated goal was to reach Pluto by 2015, at a cost of no more than 
US$500 million in FY 2000 dollars. This was the first time that the Office of Space Science had 
solicited proposals for a mission to an outer planet on a competitive basis. NASA had chosen this

missions rapidly and at a relatively low cost. NASA made the announcement after it had issued a 
stop order on the Pluto/Kuiper Express (PKE) mission on 12 September because of the PKE 
mission’s unacceptably high increases in cost. NASA also appointed Colleen Hartman, the 
Deputy Director of the Research Division of the Office of Space Science, as the new Outer 
Planets Program Director, to act as the point of contact at NASA Headquarters for budget, 
content, and policy direction.1071 
 
The Huygens Communications Link Enquiry Board released its findings, recommendations, and 
conclusions, after conducting interviews and hearings with the European Space Agency (ESA), 
NASA, and industry project staff and experts. The Board had reviewed the unexplained 
anomalies in the communication subsystem of the Huygens Probe, discovered during a Probe 
Relay Link Test in February 2000. The ESA Director General had formed an independent 
inquiry board to assess the current status of the Huygens communication link; to recommend 
means of safeguarding the mission objectives and guaranteeing full scientific data return; and to 
recommend ways to prevent similar problems in future projects. The Board had found that the 
entire project structure had led to the anomaly, outlining the specific problems in its report. The 
Board also made six recommendations and provided 10 recovery options. The Board’s key 
recommendation was that, in the future, when a mission carries new hardware, the mission plan 
should be sufficiently flexible to allow for changes from ground command.1072 
 
21 December 
NASA’s JPL announced that the Cassini spacecraft, after successfully undergoing a series of 
tests, was resuming the use of its electrically powered reaction wheels to control its orientation. 
Although mission scientists were uncertain of the cause of the spacecraft’s switch to a different 
maneuvering system, they suggested that a small piece of material, perhaps from the motor’s 
magnets, might have lodged in an area where it caused friction. Because the scientists were 
unable actually to detect any such material, they speculated further that either centrifugal force 
had subsequently forced the material out, or the motor had ground it up. Scientists also suggested 
that reduced lubrication in the bearings, during prolonged operation at reduced speeds, might 
have caused the problem, and that, perhaps, the increased motor speeds used during the tests had 
restored the lubrication.1073 
 
26 December 
Ground controllers in Russia restored communication with Mir, after they had been unable to 
contact the uninhabited space station for 24 hours. Spokesperson for Russian Mission Control 
Valery Lyndin allayed fears that Mir would crash to Earth shortly, announcing that Russia had 
received no indication that the space station was losing pressure. Mission Control Chief Vladimir 
A. Solovyov explained that the station’s batteries had lost power and no longer had sufficient 
energy to communicate with ground controllers. Once ground controllers had identified the

problem, they had switched off specific systems to direct more energy to ground 
communications. Although Mir’s solar panels were recharging the batteries, the cause of the 
power shortage remained unclear.1074 
 
27 December 
Russian Space Agency Director General Yuri N. Koptev reiterated Russia’s commitment to the 
international community, stating that Russia definitely would bring Mir safely down in February 
2001. Koptev “angrily dismissed Communist demands to keep the nearly 15-year-old station in 
orbit,” referring to the 20-hour loss of contact earlier in the week as a “final warning that time 
was up” and an indicator of the level of the station’s wear and tear. Communist lawmakers, 
including cosmonaut Svetlana Y. Savitskaya, who called the move a concession to NASA, had 
criticized the government’s decision to destroy the space station. However, Koptev had 
countered the criticism, saying that, if Mir spun out of control, the Russian president and 
government would have to explain to the world where the station would fall and how much 
damage it would cause.1075 
 
28 December 
Cassini Program Manager Robert T. Mitchell, at NASA’s JPL, announced the resumption of the 
spacecraft’s observations. Cassini had operated without any problems, since scientists had 
reactivated its reaction-wheel system on 21 December.1076
