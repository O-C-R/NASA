FOREWORD 

T h e  National Aoronautics and Space Act defined the national effort 
in  the   exploration  of  s p a c e t h e  largest,  most  complex  research  and 
development effort ever undertaken.  It also provided fo r  the  continu- 
ation of  the  long trad i t ion  of  research in aeronautics begun under  the  
National  Advisory  Committee fo r  Aeronautics. 
Dur ing  the  past five years, an  immense effort has  been  set in  motion. 
Tha t  th i s  effort has borne f ru i t  is evidenced by  the  events of  the  years 
since the  passage of  the  Act, some of  which  a r e  recorded in th e  pages 
tha t   follow.  These  events constitute  a t   least  a  partial  record  of  th e  
raw  material  which  is giving  shape  to   the  space  effort.  I n  some in- 
stances, they represent the  growth of  space technology and equipment : 
improvement  in   the   percentage  of  successful launches;  the   develop- 
ment of  large  boosters capable of  suppor t ing  larger  payloads in more 
complex missions.  T h e  overall increases in reliabdity, sensitivity, and  
accuracy  of  equipment  a re   all  s igns   of  th e   increasjng  bread th   and  
dep th  of  our  knowledge of  the  requirements f o r  space f igh t .   I n  o t hw  
instances, these events portray our increasing capacity to explore both 
the near and  far  reaches of  spaca and  to benefit from knowledge gained 
by  exploration.  Though   our  knowledge  has  increased  a t  a  drama t ic  
rate,  the   demand  fo r   new  information-which  has  become  such  a 
pressing  demand  fo r   practical  reasons,  fo r   defense  urposes,  and   as 
p a r t   and   parcel  of  th e   persistent  human  drive  t o  in ow-threatens

The  wide  range  of  events recorded here po r t ray   the wide scope of 
this tremendous scientific undertaking.  B u t  perhaps even more indic- 
ative  than   the   variety  of  events,  i s   the   broad  social,  economic,  and 
political  impact  of  the   many  projects  and   programs.  For  instance, 
Professor  Freder ic  Seitz, President of  th e  National  Academy of  Sci- 
ences,  said  recently  th a t   there  was  no  p a r t   of  university  activity  re- 
lated  to   science  and   t e chno log   "which  is  no t   involved  in  a  funda-  
mental way  in  the  space effort.  Or, in another field, we  note t h a t  by 
the  end  of  1963,  some  65  political  entities  were  cooperating  in  our  
international  space program. 
These are  developments, perhaps trends, which  are emerging as th e  
S  ace Age  becomes more  and  more  a p a r t  of  the   Nation's  daily  life. 
TEeir pa r t s  a r e  recurded here as past, but, more importantly,  they  are  
also  prologue.

This chronology  of  the   sixth  -par  of  th e   space age  was  prepared 
from open public sources.  Like its annual  ancestors, i t  was  intended 
tec R nological, organization  and  policy  aspects of  space exploration 
rovide  a  compilation  of  known  events  r e l a t e d   to  the   scientific, 
to  
and  exploitation.  Although  i t s  index  is a  ready vehicle  for informa- 
tI;olra+i.entryit w a s  not  conceived  as historical  assessment.  It pro- 
vides a  comprehensive listing of  the  growing welter of  events in the ir  
own date and place.  The  pace and complexity of  the  challenging and  
sometimes  drama t ic   endeavor  as   man  learns  and  masters  na ture  
beyond  planet  E a r t h   is a t  least  chronicled in  a  useful  form.  Hope- 
fully,  i t   provides  some  of  the   much-needed  perspective  f o r   most 
readers,  many  of  whom  a re   undoubtedly  as  breathless  as contempo- 
rary   historians.

Physics,  NASA  O 5 c e   of  Space  Sciences,  at, Marymount  College, 
Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson,  New  York,  s ta ted   t h a t  : “There  [is] 
a  great  deal  of  discussion  of  whether  the  United  S ta te s  should 
have  women  astronauts,  and  I am  frequently  asked  fo r  my  own 
opinion  on  this  subject.  F rank ly ,   i t   makes  l i t t le   difference  to  
me.  I believe th a t  there will  be women  astronauts some time just

ways  t h a t   women  can  contribute  importantly  to   the   space  pro-

NASA  had  over  146 women  who  were  classified  as  professional 
Aerospace  Technologists,  77  of  whom  were  professional  mathe- 
maticians  whose  responsibility  was  the   programing  and  opera- 
t ion   of  NASA’s highly  complex computers and  similar  equipment, 
Dr.  Roman  said. 
“Moreover,  I  should  emphasize  th a t   as  badly  as  we  need 
scientists  and  engineers, we  also need  educated  women  as well  as 
men  in   other  fields  and   no  one,  man  o r   woman,  should  go   into 
science  simply  because  of  i t s   glamour  . . . The   space  program,

During January:  Dr.  Douglas McKie,  Univ.  of  London,  wr i t ing   in

subject of  renewed interest  in the  U.K.  since Parliament was con- 
ures.  8 r .  McKie pointed out th a t  the  recent adoption of  th e  wave- 
siderin  t h e  adoption  of  the  metric  system of  weights  and  meas- 
length of  a  line in the  spectrum of  krypton-86 a s  the basis fo r  an  
international  un i t  of  length  was the  realization  of  an  old  French 
dream  at the   time  of  the  adoption  of  the  metric  system-the  use 
of  an   invariable  na tura l   standard.  A t   the   time  of  th e   French  
Revolution, Dr. McKie asserted, France  had  become weary of  the  
chaos of  variable systems of  weights and measures and t h e  govern- 
ment and  the  National Academy urged the  States-General to  adopt 
a national system.  The  States-General authorized the Academy t o  
formulate a system of  weights and  measures based on measurement 
of an  a rc  of  the  meridian as the  universal standard and decimals as 
the notation  system.  Th is  was  done by  1793, bu t   Revolut,iona.ry

Ernest  W.  Brackett,  Director,  Procurement  and  Supply,  a t   t h e  
NASA-InduStry  Programs   Plans  Conference, Wmhmgton,  D.C., 
explained  the   role of  small business in  NASA  contracting.  “Dui.- 
ing  fiscal year  1962 small business companies received  66  percent 
of  th e   total  number  of  contractual  actions,  large  and  small, 
placed by  NASA.  Th is   small business share of  NASA  procurement 
amounted  to   approximately  $125  million,  or  12 percent  of  the  
total  NASA  procurement  placed  with  all business firms . . . They 
a re   able  to   compete  sucmssfully  fo r   many  of  NASA’s contracts, 
par t icu lar ly   in  furn ish ing  components and  supplies.  Dur ing   fis- 
cal year  1962, of  the  hundred contractors who received  the  largest 
dollar value of  NASA  prime contracts, 24  were small business con- 
mrns.  I n  those procurements where small business concerns sub- 
mi- 
bids,  they  were  successfuI  in  receiving  57 percent  of  the

dollar  value of  the   awards.”

performance  of  SYNCOM  I  communications  satellite  before  sg enate

Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications.  A f te r  
SYNCOM  was  successfully  launched  by  Delta  vehicle,  NASA  God- 
dard  Space  F l i g h t   Center  had  determined  apogee  of  SYNCOM’S 
elliptical  t ran s fe r  orb i t  would  occur a t  21,700-mi.  a l t i tude ,  about 
600-mi.  short  of  synchronous  a l t i tude   but  well  within  allowable 
error .   So t h a t  more nearly  synchronous  orbit  could be  achieved, 
s igna l  was  sent  from  USNS  K i n g s p o r t   in  Lagos  harbor,  Nigeria, 
commanding  satellite’s  apogee  motor  to   fire  10 min.  ear l ier   ( a t  
5:42  a.m.)  th an   firing  time  set  on  onboard  timer.  SYNCOM  re- 
ceived  and   stored  signal,  and  a t   5:42  a.m.  signal  was  sent  from 
K ingspor t   to execute the  command.  20.1 sec. la ter ,  ground  recep- 
tion of  satellite telemetry  abruptly ceased.  Because apogee motor 
was  t o  have  fired  fo r  21.2  sec.,  Colonel Warren   sa id  it was “diffi- 
cu l t  to imagine tha t   these two events a re  unrelated  . . . . 
“So, wha t  can we make of  all th i s  ? 
First we know t h a t  SYNCOM 
is in orbit. 
I f  t h e  apogee motor d id  not  fire, it is still in  t h e  ellip- 
t ica l   orbit  and   will  eventually  be  found,  e i ther  by  optics  or  by 
rada r .   I f   th e   apogee  motor  did  fire, SYNCOM  is  i n   a very  h igh  
a l t i tude  orbit,  and  without  telemetry,  there  is only a  slim  chance 
t h a t   it  will  be  found.  A  search  ha s  been  organized  which  will 
continue  un t i l   such  time  a s   it  is  found,  or  un t i l   fu r th e r   search 
seems unwarranted.  I f   it  is  found, we  will  have  another  chance 
to  t r y   out  the   command  system,  and  if  it works,  we  could  again 
be in  business. 
“Secondly, we know t h a t  one of  the communications transpond- 
ers  worked well in th e  t ran s fe r  ellipse. 
“Thirdly,  we  have  shown  once  more  t h a t   th e   Delta,  launch 
vehicle  is  a  reliable  booster,  th i s   being  its  15th successive  flight 
with  performance  well  within  a m p t a b l e   error.”

space  activities  are   closely  coordinated  with  the   National  Aero-

“The A i r   Fo rce  ha s  developed  a  solid  foundation  of  space on

significant military  space possibilities 
Utilizing  the   technological  base  SO   f a r  es- 
must trans la te  these technical  capabilities 
in to  ac tua l  defense systems.  Th e  time  required  to  move  from  a

Yet,  it is  the  ready military capability,  not  the  technological base, 
th a t   accomplishes  deterrence.  Accordingly,  the   A i r   Force  pro- 
poses to  begin some of  these conversions a t  once. 
“The fo rwa rd  program aims a t  two basic objectives : 
“FIRST,  t o  enhance  th e  general  military  posture  of  t h e  United 
S ta tes   by  building  a  defense  capability  in   space.  Space  is  not 
only a new  area of  vulnerability  to  a t tack ,  but  also affords impor-

relation to  a military th rea t  posed by a hostile power. 
“SECOND,  to   provide  a  capability  within  the   space  region  fo r

exploitation  of  space,  and   to  provide  a  system  of  protection  fo r

F e b m r y  25: Dr.  Robert  C.  Seamans,  Jr.,  NASA Associate  Adminis- 
t ra to r ,  presented  before House  Committee  on Science and   Astro- 
nautics  an  account  of  NASA’s u se  of  FY  1963 funds.  Exp la in ing  
$170  million  decrease  in  launch  vehicle  costs  because  of  luna r -  
orbit-rendezvous  decision,  he  sa id   NASA  had  deferred  develop- 
mental phase of  Nova very  large  launch vehicle  and w a s  conduct- 
ing “ fu r th e r  studies on th e  requirements  a n d  design concepts of  a 
large  launch  vehicle  consistent with  o  timum  post-lunar-landing 
usage  . . . . We are continuing  [M-17 engine developments  [for  
Nova],  since  it is a  long  lead  time  component,  but  have  reduced 
t h e  level of  contractor effort to  reflect t h e  removal of  a firm opera- 
t i e z l d t im i c g   . . . . ,, 
Speaking on space sciences, Dr. Seamans said : “Extensive study 
of  the  biological  science  area  ha s   demonstrated  tha t   specific  re- 
coverable  satellite  flights  should  be  undertaken  for  the   purpose 
of  acquiring  da ta   on  th e   effects of  space  environment  on  l iv ing  
matter.  W e  are,  therefore,  undertaking  such  a bio-satellite pro- 
g r am   a nd   have  increased  ou r  estimated  fund ing  requirements in  
th i s  area by  $13.0  million  in  th i s  fiscal year.” 
On communications  satellites, Dr. Seamans said : “We re-exam- 
ined  ou r   Communication  Sa te l l i te   program  quite  carefully  in  
t h e  Iight  of  the  creation  of  the  Communication  Satellite  Corpo- 
ration  a nd   the   reoriented  activities  of  th e   DOD  following  th e

FebruaTy  96':  Results  of  MARINER  11  flight  towards  and  pas t   Venus 
were  detailed  i n  NASA  press  conference.  Analysis of  microwave 
and   in f ra red   radiometer  scans revealed Venus is covered by  cold, 
dense clouds in upper  atmosphere;  preliminary  estimate of  Venu- 
t ian   surface  temperature  was  around  800" F.  Temperatures  a r e  
essentially  same on  d a rk   and   sunlighted  sides  of  Venus,  with  a 
cold spot in  southern  hemisphere.  Any carbon  dioxide in atmos- 
phere  above cloud  layer  w a s  too small to be de tmkd   by  MARINER 
11's  instruments.  High-density  electron  ionosphere  was  not  de- 
tected.  Rada r   obsei-vation on  Venus  from  Goldstone  Track ing  
S ta t ion   established  Venus'  rotation  ra te   as 230,  plus  or minus 
40-50  days,  retrograde,  with  225  days  as non-rotating s ta tus   fo r  
Venus.  T h i s   observation  together  with  other  ground  !measure- 
ments and  da ta  from MARINER  n's magnetometer indicated Venus 
has   very  low,  if  any,  magnetic  field. 
Analysis  indicated  solar  plasma  continuously  flows  o u t   from  
the  sun, velocity of  observed solar winds varying  from 200 to 500 
miles per second  (approximate)  and having temperature of  about 
l,OOO,OOOo  F.  Density  is  normally  about  10 to   20  protons  and  
with  it  lines  of  magnetio  force  which  ong ina te   in  t h e   [ s u n q  
electrons  per  cubic  inch.  Because  solar  plasma  "carries  alo 
corona,  and  the   frequent  variations  in  plasma  velocity  results in 
th e   deformation  of  these  field  lines,  . . . it  is difficult to deduce 
from  the  point-by-point  measurement of  magnetic field  what  the  
general  undisturbed  configuration  of  the  solar  field  would  be 
. . . . It  i s  hoped  tha t   fu r the r   da ta   may  reveal  the  presence  of

MARINER  11 da ta  on  ionized particles  in  space revealed a flux of 
from  f ew   hundred  to  a  thousand  electron v o  P ts.  I n   range  0.5  to 
about  100 million particles per sq. centimeter  er sec.  in  the  range 
10 mev  fo r   protons,  "very  few  exist  a t   times,  b u t  a t  o ther   times 
the ir   flux may  be  a number of  times  th a t  of  cosmic rays.  I n  the  
range  of  energies 10 to  800 mev  fo r  protons,  there is nearly  com- 
plete  absence  of  particles  normally  [with  g rea t  number  possible

Pa t r ick  AFB : “. . . abou t  ou r  fu tu r e  in  space,  le t  me establish  two 
bench marks.  T h e  first  is th a t  the  A i r  Force needs everything it 
can ge t  from  NASA.  NASA  needs us, too,  as  th e  record of  how NASA  
pu ts   th ing s  in to  space  indicates,  bu t   if  the re  weren’t  a NASA ,   th e  
same fac i l i ty  and  capability  would  have  to  be created  some other 
way. 
“There  is  reassuring  precedent  fo r  th e  pr inc ip le  of  hav ing  an  
need.  T h e  case a t  point  is the  Atomic Energy  & mmission.  Ou r  
outside-of-defense civilian  agency provide  th e  t  pe of  support we 
own  nuclear  weapon  flexibility  as well  as the   Polaris-carrying 
submarine is su0icient testimony. 
“The  clear  lasson  fo r   us   in  th e  space  field  is  t h a t  we must  p u t  
requirements  on  NASA  to  meet  whatever  p a r t  of  ou r  needs can be 
met in  th i s  way.  W e  must utilize every  possible resource to  build 
the  necessary  military  capability  and  I can assure you  t h a t  NASA 

79 
A S TRONAU T IC S   AND  AERONAUT IC S ,   19  6 3  
is ready  to  respond.  J i m  Webb, the  NASA  Administrator,  harbors 
no illusions about NASA’s responsibilities in support of  national de- 
fense requirements. 
“The second bench mark  is t h a t  there  is no  such khing as peace- 
fu l   space or  m i l i tary   space.  There  is  just  space.  The  new  and  
five years ago, w r - f o r   reasons whic ”a seemed not  unreasonable 
massive  space p 
m   in  a civilian 
ency  w a s  launched nearly 
a t   the   time-a  great hullabaloo  about  peaceful objectives  . . . . 
“We  have  a lot t o  learn.  T h e  recent  agreement with  NASA  fo r  
joint  participation  in   the  Gemini  program  is  one  way.  T h a t  
agreement represents an answer from both  W D  and  NASA  to critics 
who said there  was no  place in space  fo r  military  man.  Ou r  own 
activity directed  toward manned  space vehicles will  increase, and  
with  NASA’s back-up,  we’ll  a t ta in   the   needed  capability  earlier 
than   we  would  otherwise. 
“A   term  you  hear  around  Washington  t o  denote th e   areas  of 
cooperation between  government agencies is  ‘interface.’  Here   a t  
Pa tr ick   is one of  the  primary ‘NASA-Air  Force interfaces.’  Such 
terms  usually  leave me  pre t ty   cold  b u t   th is   one  does  have  some 
descriptive  value. 
“There will  be  plenty  of  problems between  th e  A i r   Force  and 
NASA.  but  not  by  any  means  all  at th e   ‘interface’ points  such  as  
the  Cape.  W e  wouldn’t  either one be  t rue  to  t ru s t  o r  trad i t ion   if 
there weren’t.  Any  machine as big as the  national space effort is 
bound  to have some kind of  friction.  Bu t  ju s t  remember, a clutch 
is  a  friction  interface.  Its purpose  is  to  join  two shaf ts  for the  
transmission  of  power.

make the  best  program  fo r  both  military  and  civilian  purposes. 
“The  Gemini  program  provides  f o r   two   men  to   be  placed  in

than   proposed  in  the   Gemini  program  i t   would  provide  more

two p ro   rams a re  therefore not entirely  comparable.

several  sources-f 
rom  solar  flares,  from  space-ambient  radiation 
such  a s   found  in  the   Van  Allen  belts,  or  from  nuclear  devices 
t h a t  may  be  exploded  i n  th e  earth’s  atmosphere.  There  a r e  two 
approaches which  a re  being  taken  to   the  solution of  th is  problem, 
a nd   they  may  be  used  in  conjunction.  T h e   first  is  shielding, 
which  is  the   current means  of  protection  against  radiation.  Bu t  
in   space  systems,  where  weight  is   of  critical  importance,  con- 
ventional  shielding methods  a re   likely  to  be  out  of  the   question. 
“The  second  method  seeks  to  make  use  of  a  d r u g   with  an t i-  
radiation  properties.  Some  1,800  potential  an t irad ia t ion   d rug s  
a re   currently  being  evaluated,  and   a  number  of  them  appea r   t o  
hold  g rea t   promise.  Several  interesting  fac ts   have  already 
emerged  from   these  studies.  F o r   example,  cells  with  less  than  
the  normal supply of  oxygen a re  protected  from  rad ia t ion  damage. 
S t imu la t ing  th e  production  of  white  blood  cells  and  slowing  the  
metabolism  also protect  the  cells to  some degree against  radiation 
damage.

‘%hen  design  of  the  F-1  was  begun  in   1959, combustion  in- 
stability  was  known  to  be  a  potential  problem.  Accordingly, 
early in the program tests of  various injectors for the th ru s t  cham- 
ber  were  conducted,  and  a  design  w a s   selected  which  had  not 
experienced  unstable  combustion.  F o r   about a  year,  from  mid- 
1961  to   mid-1962,  engine  tests  were  conducted  without  th i s  
phenomenon occurring.  Then, on  J u n e  28  last year we  mere test-

traced  to  combustion  instability.  Since  th i s   occurrence,  several 
cases of  combustion instability have taken place. 
“This phenomenon is not unique to the  F-1,  but has occurred  in

1962 and   the   first six  months  of  F Y  1963,47  per cent  of  NASA’s 
prime contracts over $25,000 were  awarded to  firms in California. 
I f   the   second  rank ing   state  is  excluded  in   each  of  these  years,

“Unless  the   nation  decides  to  forego  the   opportunity  it  now 
has  to  insure  a  pre-eminent  position  in   space,  I foresee  no  pos- 
sibility,  certainly  not  in  the  nea r  fu ture ,  th a t  the  volume of  space 
activity  conducted  in  California  will  decline  . . . It  does  seem 
likely  th a t  a s  ou r  national  investment  in space research  and  devel- 
opment  increases,  California  will  find  it more  difficult  to  main- 
t a in  i t s  present percentage of  the  to ta l   . . . .” 
NASA’s procurement,  Mr. Webb  said : “ I n  shor t ,  we  a r e  making 
a  deliberate  effort  to   use  the   self-policing  forces  of  t h e   market 
place,  to   avoid  building  government  competition  with  indus try ,  
and   also  to  maintain  sufficient managerial  and  technical  capabil- 
i ty   in  ou r  own  organization  to  make certain  th a t  ou r  contractors 
a r e  giving  us  the  reliability  we  must  have  and  th e   taxpayers  a 
dollar’s-worth of  work fo r  every do l lar  we  spend.“ 
I n   reviewing  t h e   international  aspects  of  the   NASA   program, 
t h e   NASA   Administrator  cited  the   provisions  of  th e   National 
Aeronautics  and   Space  Act  of  1958,  and   sa id :   “Some  citizens, 
who  regard  military  necessities  a s  the  prime justification  fo r  ou r  
results  a s   a  national  treasure.  which  should  t e  keDt  under  lock 
space effort,  find  it, difficult  to  accept  the  open,  unclassified  char-  
acter of  our civilian  space program.  Some re   a rd  basic scientific 
and   key,  and   ask  ‘Why  do  ‘we  give  aw ay   ou r   iecrets  to   the  
Russians?’ 
“The  answer  is  th a t   our  program  involves  both  science  and  
technology.  There   a r e   no  red  secrets  of  na ture ,   and   it  would 
be  self-defeating  to   t r y   to   classify  the   science a n d   principles  of 
nature.  On the  other hand, technological advances and  inventions 
a re  the   product  of  men  and  effort,  and   can  properly  be  classified 
a nd   kept  from   potential  enemies  where  th e   national  interest  so 
re   uirerj. 
aAccordingly,  our national  space program moves fo rwa rd  with 
the   basic  scientific  research  conducted  by  t h e   civilian  agency, 
available  to  th e   whole  scientific  community,  bu t   technological 
development  conducted  by  both  NASA   a n d   the   Department  of 
Defense  which  is  shared  by  both  agencies,  and   classified  when 
defense  and  military  interests  a r e   involved.  I n  th i s  manner  we 
have  protected  ou r  national  security  while making the  maximum

“The  manyfold  demands  fo r  technical  manpower  draw   on  th e

posed  on  these  requirements  is the   need  fo r  science, mathematics

I n  t h a t  competition,  not  all  sectors of  demand  have succeeded in

“Fo r  tlie  first time.,  we  a r e  confronted  with  a plurality  of  goals

“Faced  w i th  the  same manpower  problem  as  t h e  Soviet Union, 
how,  in  a  democratic society where each  citizen  must  have  a  free  
choice of  h i s  or her  occupation,  do we  meet  th is   challenge? 
“The urgent  need  for more  individuals  having advanced  t ra in -

Conference  a t  Dunsmuir  House,  Oakland,  Calif.,  NASA  Admin- 
istrator  James   E. Webb  sa id :   “ . . . we  must  all  concern  our- 
selves with  th e   progress  and  the   promise  of  scientific  research 
and   technological development  in  th is  country,  and  the  effects of 
this activity  upon  society.  My  own  work  on projects concerned 
with  civic  and   urban  problems,  has  le f t   an  indelible  impression 
of  the ir   complexity  and  urgency  . . . . 
“Today  we  a re  dealing  not  only  with  profound  changes in   the  
social  and   economic structure  of  the   country  and  the  wor ld ;   we 
are  dealing, as  well, with an  even more profound  change in man% 
own  conception  of  the  boundaries  and  limitations  o f   his  hnbit- 
able environment  and  his  understanding of  the forces of  the uqi- 
verse  . . . Man  is  no  longer  rooted  to  te r ra   fimm, either  in  the  
l i tera l   sense,  or  in  his  understanding  of  the   powerful  forces  of 
th e   universe  of  which  he  is  a minuscule  pa r t .   Increasingly,  he 
comprehends th a t   the   new  understanding  and   knowledge which 
are   being  unleashed  by  science  and  technology  will  alter  his 
existence  in  more ways,  and  more  rapidly,  than   he  can  possibly 
f o r e s e e . .   . . 
“Man  has  gained  mobility,  his  horizons  have  broadened  not 
only  in   the   g v p h i c a l  sense,  but  because  he  no  longer  feels 
bound  by  a  family  farm ,   o r  a  traditional  village  industry  . . . . 
A  civilization w h c h  can move with serious purpose to  gear  itself

launching  of  LUNIK  rv was  an   in i t ia l  step  “in  a  very  well  orga-

here  along  the  A t lan t ic   seaboard  to  a  grea t   nation  of  almost 200

search and  development effort  to  the  p r iva te  sector of  the  economy 
in  as quick  and  a s  useful  a way  as possible. 
“We  a re   committed,  first,  because  th e   Space  14ct  requires  it. 
NASA  is  directed  to  ‘Provide  fo r   the   widest  practicable  and   ap- 
p rop r ia te   dissemination  of  information  concerning  i t s   activities 
and   the   results  thereof.’ 
“We a r e   also  committed  because  we  a r e  m ind fu l   th a t   a  la rge

cies;  and   th a t   it  is  essential  t h a t   the  maximum  value  be  wrung 
out  of  th i s  p a r t   of  the  to ta l  effort. 
“The  requirements  fo r   space  exploration  begin  in   the   field  of 
anatomy  and  run   through  v ir tua l ly   the  whole gamu t  of  scientific 
and   technological  interest,  through  new  power  sources  t o   zero

receive no compromises  from  th a t  harsh  environment.  Wh ich  is  
to  say t h a t  a  very  large  p a r t  of  the  to ta l  space work  is a t  th e  very 
leading  edge  of  the   s ta te-of- the-ar t ;   and   t h a t   in  another  large  
p a r t  of  t h e  s ta te-of- the-ar t  must be extended. 
“It is  reasonable  to  th ink  th a t  an  effort  of  such  size, range and 
sophistication,  extending  over  a  number  of  years,  cannot  f a i l   to  
have  major  scientific  and   economic  consequences : consequences 
th a t   begin  a s  scientific  and  technological  advances  and   then  are  
converted  in to   new  techniques  of  manufacture,  new  systems  of 
organization,  and  new  products  and   services.  T h e   space  effort 
mill be, we  th ink ,  altogether  comparable  in i t s  effect on  the  Amer-

I n  AIAA  speech a t  Dallas on “Space Policy  and Space Management,” 
Dr. Edward   C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of NASC .   reviex-ed the  
national objectives in space : 
“F i r s t   of  all,  there  is  an   over-all  policy  objective,  which  the  
President  ha s   ex  ressed  as   the  determination  of  this country  ‘to 
become  the   Tor I p  d‘s  leading  space-faring  nation.‘  I t   is  worth 
mentioning t h a t  th is  is a broad umbrella.  . . .  Suffice to  say tha t  
the   space  program  is  not  a  one-project  design  nor  a  short-run 
episode.  I t   is  a  growing,  expanding,  multi-project  program, 
which  I predict  will  become  an  increasingly  significant  p a r t   of 
our   way  of  life.  As  impor tan t   as  i t   is,  the   moon  project  is not 
the  whole space program ;   i t   is j u s t  one portion  and one phase  of 
an  over-all moqram  which has bread th  through variety and  dep th  
f a r  into the  future. 
“A few  features  of  th is  broad  space y l i c ?   ?re: 
“1.  I t s  ob jec t ive s   are   peacefu l   . . . t  e  distinction  a s  to what 
is peaceful  and  what  is not  peaceful  is  a ma t ter   of  intent  and  j s  
not  determined  by  what  agency  of  t h e  government  engages  in 
them  . . .

“2.  O u r  policy  asserts  th a t   space trave l   and   space exploratia- 
a re  subject  to  in te rna t iona l   law and  t h a t  such  ac t iv i ty  should  be 
consistent with  the  provisions of  the  United Nations char ter .   . . . 
“3.  It is our  policy  t o  seek  increased  internationa.3 coopera t ion  
in,  and   mutually  advantageous  agreements  for,. the   orderly  and 
open  conduct  of  space  and  space  related  activities  . . . . 
“4.  It is also  ou r   olicy  t h a t   th e   concept  and   performance  of 
ou r   space  responsibiyities  sha l l  be  maintained  and   strengthened 
a s  a na t iona l  p rog ram   ra the r  th an   a  series of  separate  and  unre- 
la tedpro jec ts .   . . . 
“5.  There  a r e  inherent  risks  in   space  exploration,  par t icu lar ly  
in manned flight, and  they must be recognized  . . . . 
“6.  While we must continue to  improve on s ta te-of- the-ar t  com- 
petences, it is essential  th a t  we s tr ive  ju s t  as h a rd  to  make so-called 
quantum j u m p s  in techno logy   and  pe r fo rmnnce   . .  . . 
“7.  It  is  a  significant  element  of  policy  t h a t   progress  be  the 
jo in t   product  of  government  and  private  enterprise.  . . . 
“ I n  conclusion,  the  national  space  program  is  a n  essential  and 
dynamic fea ture  of  o u r  economy.  It benefits the  many ra the r  than  
the  feu-.  It strengthens  the  nation,  both  a t  home and   abroad.  It 
looks forward  rather  than  backward.  It highlights  th e  con tr ibu-  
tions  of  the  most  able  technologists  and   the  most  able  managers

simply  an   inevitable  pa r t   of  life.  H e   accepted  the   proffered 
explanations of  the  world  and  the  universe, and his  curiosity was

F l igh t ,   NASA   %eputy  Associate  Administrator  and   Director  of 
Manned  Space F l igh t  D. Brainerd  Holmes said t h a t  “ the  present 
Gemini  is   a  different  program  than   the   one  with  which  we 
s tar ted .   It  had   two  fundamental  purposes  or ig ina l ly  which  we 
have not given  u p  and  which w e  s t i l l  consider t o  be of  paramount 
importance-to  ga in   experience  in   prolonged  weightlessness  and 
to  gain experience in rendezvous before Apollo  . . . . 
“However,  as we  developed  th e  Gemini  program,  we  found  it 
was  not  wise  to   have  only  an   updated  Mercury  spacecraft.  W e .  
found  as  we  developed  the   subsystems  f o r   Gemini  t h a t   i t   was 
much  wiser  t o   incorporate  technology  known  today-not 
some- 
th ing  t h a t  was  early  developmental technology of  th e  past.  Th i s  
concept  would  lead  us s tep  by  s tep  toward Apollo,  and  we  would 
reap  tremendous  benefits  from  it.  I n   addition  . . . i t   became 
quite  appa ren t   to  us  t h a t   th i s   would  be  a  very  useful  E a r t h  
orbitalspacecraft  . . . . 
“ I n   developing  the   Gemini  subsystems,  we  find  t h a t   they  are  
better  and  more  sophisticated  th an   in i t ia l ly   conceived  and   the  
spacecraft  is much  more  sophisticated  th an   an t ic ipa ted .   There- 
fore,  the  costs tend  to  be higher  and  the  time  scales  longer  . . . . 
“We  had   planned  to  have  th e   first  manned  Gemini  flight  the 
second flight,  du r ing  th e  first qua r te r  of  1964.  Our  present  plan 
is  t h a t   the   first  manned  flight  in  th e   series  would  not  be  until 
the  fou r th  qua r te r  of  1964.  Our  cu r ren t  plan  grew  in  part  from 
the   advisability  of  having  more  sophisticated  subsystems,  which 
required  more  time,  and   in  p a r t   from   a  reorientation  of  the  pro- 
am  to   include  a  second  unmanned  flight  before  the   manned 
K s h t   . . . . 
. . . th e  T i t an   I1  . . . has  had  some developmental  problems 
over and  above what we had  anticipated.  However, th e  problems 
a re   always  encountered  in  a  developmental  program.

“We  a re  planning  an  unmanned  flight  a t  th e  end  of  th i s  year

“Instrumentation  is   a  key  element  of  technology  in  the  Space

Soviets using our own brand  of  F i f t h  Avenue public relations have

Jaffe   described  role  of  satellites  in  communications  and  sa id :  
“.  . . Today,  approximately  300 telephone channels a re  available 
across th e  Nor th  Atlantic. 
“Notwithstanding  these  recent  and   radical  improvements  in 
trans-A t lan t ic  telephone service, we can predict  the  need  for  still 
more  channels.  Every   time  communication  channels  have  in- 
creased,  they  have  been  loaded  to  capacity  almost a t  o n e n e w  
means  f o r  communication  have never  caused  the  abandonment of

the   old  ones.  Dur in   1960 there  were  more  than   three  million 
fold  increase i n   overseas calls dur ing   the  next  decade.  Such  an  
increase  in  t r a 5 c  will  overtax  the   current  and   planned  under- 
sea  cables, and  high  frequency radio  facilities.  And  ou r  curren t  
communication  facilities  have  no  capability  for  transm i t t ing  
television.  . . . 
“Communications satellites should soon be providing a substan- 
t ia l   increase  in our  capabilities fo r  world-wide high quality com- 
mon  carr ier   communications, a t  least over those routes where the  
also great enough to  jus t i  f y  the  necessarily large  investment in  a

where service can  also be  provided  to   areas not  served  by  other 
means,  e i ther   because  of  their  isolation  or  because  the   t r a c

Budget,  it i s  still  too  early  i n  the  consideration of  th i s  budget  by 
Congress to  d raw  firm conclusions as to  what  the final result  will 
be.  The  House  subcommittees have  given  the   NASA  programs  a 
most careful review, accumulating da ta  from  hearings which w i l l  
to ta l   more  th an   4,000  pages  of  testimony.  The i r   devotion  and 
attention  to  details  has   been  impressive  bu t   in   my  opinion  the  
f w  a program  th a t   is urgently  needed, has  achieved a high  P eve1 
overall  result  of  the ir   actions  is  an   ina&quate 
level  of  sup   o r t  
of  success,  and   i s   now  giving  th is   nation  th e   promise  of  early 
preeminence  in   all  phases  of  space  exploration  and  use.  I n  th e  
areas  reduced,  NASA  will  present  a  s trong  case  fo r   restoration  as 
the   legislation  proceeds  to  enactment. 
“A f te r   i ts  many  details were brought  under  close scrutiny  and 
the   possibility  of  postponement of  many  of  these  examined,  the  
Committee  has   endorsed  the   program and   the   way  it  is  being 
carried  ou t   b u t   decided  to  defer  approval  un t i l   subsequent 
budgets  in  a  number  of  impor tan t   areas.  My  view  is  t h a t   the  
necessary  resources  should  be  authorized  th is   year,  ra the r   than  
have  impor tan t   segments postponed  with  the   consequent  in tro-  
duction of  uncertainty a t  many levels in the  government-industry- 
university  team  now  engaged  in  th i s  urgent  national  effort. 
“A t   the   reduced  level  of  fund ing   recommended,  we  will  cer- 
ta in ly   have  to  slow  u p   or   postpone  a  number  of  programs  and 
direct  a reduction  in th e  scheduled level of  effort in th e  p lan ts  of 
our  contractors  where  90%  of  the  work  of  th e   space program  is 
done.  Unless an adequate level of  support  is restored, momentum 
already attained with great effort and difficulty will be lost and  the  
stretch-out required will add to  the  final cost of  the  work required 
to carry  out t h e  program.”  (S ta temen t)

“Well,  i n  the   first  place,  we  don’t  know  whether  th e  Russians 
the i r  plans may be.  W h a t  we  a re  interested in is what 
are-what 
the i r   capabilities  are.  While  I have  seen  the   statement  of  Mr. 
Love11  [ Ju ly   161 about what he thinks the  Russians a r e  doing, h is  
information  is   not  final.  The i r   capacity  is  subs tan t ia l ;   there 
is  every  evidence  tha t   they  a r e   ca r ry ing   on  a  major  campaign 
and  diverting g m d y  needed resources to  the ir  space effort.  W i th  
th a t   in   mind,  I  think  tha t   we  should  continue.  It may  be  th a t  
o u r  assumption  or  the  prediction  . . . th a t  they  a re  not  going to

d iver t   ourselves  from  our  effort  in  an  area  where  the   Soviet, 
Union  has  a  lead,  i s  making  every  effort  to  maintain  th a t   lead, 
in  a n  area which  could affect ou r  National  security  as well as  g rea t

ou r   own  program  and   go   to   the   moon  before  the   end  of  th is  
decade. 
“The  point  of  the  matter  always  ha s  been  not  only  of  ou r  ex- 
citement  o r   interest  in  being  on  the   moon,  but  the   capacity  to  
dominate  space,  which  would  be  demonstrated  by  a  moon  flight. 
[This]  I believe,  is   essential  to   the   United  S ta te s   a s  a  leading

by a newspaper  story.” 
Asked  about  the   possibility  of  cooperating  with  U.S.S.R.  in  
a jo in t  luna r  mission, he replied  : 
“We have said before to th e  Soviet Union th a t  we would be very 
interested  i n   cooperation.  As  a  ma t te r   of  fac t ,   finally,  a f t e r   a 
good many weeks of  discussion,  an agreement  was worked  out  on 
an  exchange of  information with  regard  to  weather, bu t   we  have 
never  been  able to  go  in to  more detail.  T h e  kind  of  cooperative 
effort which would be required  fo r  th e  Soviet Union and  the  United 
S ta te s  together  to  go to  the  moon would  require  a breaking down 
of  a  good  many  barr iers  of  suspicion  and   d is trus t   and   hostility 
which exist between  the  communist  world  and  ourselves. 
“There is no evidence a s  yet  th a t  those barr iers  will  come down, 
though  quite  obviously  we  rrould  like  to   see  them  come  down. 
if  the   Soviet  Union  were  a n   open  society  as  we  a r e  
obvious!? kin  of  cooperation  could  exist,  and   I would  welcome  it.

“Th i s   question  requires  a  fu r th e r   exploration  of  the   motives 
underlying  the  U.S.  space effort.  I s  it pr imar i ly   a scientific pro- 
gram,  o r  IS  i t  motivated  by  a  broader  concern with  the  national

support w a s  not tendered fo r  scientific reasons primarily, bu t  c-e 
from  a  deep-seated conviction  t h a t   the   expanded  program  will 
make  an   impor tan t  contribution  to  our  fu tu r e  strength a n d  secu-

who  complain,  ‘The  scientific exploration  of  the  moon  ha s  r een

on  which  we  take  issue  with  some  of  ou r   scientific  collea  a, 
accorded a secondary pr ior i ty  in  the  luna r  program.’  This remark

is based  on  the   premise  t h a t   science  should have  top  pr ior i ty   in  
th e   space program.  However,  while  science plays  an   impor tan t  
role in  luna r  exploration,  it was never intended  to  be  the  pr imary  
objective  of  t h a t   project.  T h e   impetus  of  the   luna r   project  is 
derived  from   its  place  in  the   long-range  U S .   program  for  the  
in  space, the  extension o 9 man’s control over his physical environ- 
exploration  of  the  solar s  stem.  The  hear t  of  tha t  program is man

C i n  the   long  run.  Thus,  the   pace  of  the   program  must  be  set, 
not  by  the  measured  pa t terns   of  scientific  research,  but  by  the 
need  for  a  vigorous  response  to   the   national  challenge  . . . .”

chance of  ge t t ing  back to earth. 
“Most  impor tan t   of  all,  it  seemed  to   me,  is  th i s :   They   have 
decided  t h a t  with  a sof t  landing of  instruments on the moon they

“Those  who  argue  th a t   we  should  dispense  with  the  f r i l l s   of 
science  and   s  ace exploration,  and  concentrate  on  the  necessities 
of  military  Ievelopment,  fo rge t   t h a t   we  can’t  really  say  wha t  
th e   military  necessities  in  s  ace  will  be.  Our  crystal  ball  is 
not  th a t   good,  a nd   it  w o u l d L  foolhardy  to   pretend  t h a t   it  is. 
We do not wish  t o  develop a Maginot  l i e  in   space, only  to  have  
it  flanked  by  forces  of  greater  flexibility.  We  need  to   develop 
i n   a  broad  way  our  space  capability  so th a t   we  shall  have  the  
ability  to   move  in   any  direction  required  by  fu tu re   events  to

service not more than  six months a f t e r  the   [British-French]  Con- 
corde  s ta r t s   ca r ry ing   passengers.”  P ro to type  of  Concorde  was 
expected  to   be  flying  by  end  of  1966.  Mr.  Ha laby   said  U.S. 
should be  able to  test-fly  supersonic transport  by  1967 th a t  would 
be  “better,  fas ter   and  longer-ranged  with  superior  handling  and

FCC  Chairman  E. William  Henry   predicted  in  address  to  American 
B a r   Association’s  Committee  on  Communications,  meeting  i n  
Chicago,  th a t   a  single  communications  satellite  eventually  may 
equal  ca r ry ing   capacity  of  a l l   telephone  cable  circuits  between 
U.S.  and  rest  of  the  world.  La s t   pea r   5  million  telephone  calls 
were made  from U.S.  to   176 countries.  Ex i s t ing  facilities  prob- 
ably  will  be  used  to   capacity  by  1965, he  said,  and  $500-million 
in terna t iona l  communications system will be in  operation by  1970. 
New  transistorized cable, with capacity of  almost  six times present

Under   questioning by  the  House  Appropriations  Subcommittee  on 
Independent  Offices,  NASA   Deputy  Administrator  Dr.  Hugh   L. 
Dryden discussed the  fu tu r e  space programs to  follow th e  manned 
luna r  landing program : 
“There a r e  three  principal  candidates  fo r  what  might be  called 
the  next  program.  These a re  the  manned  orb i ta l  laboratory ; the 
f u r th e r   exploration  of  th e   moon;  and   finally,  man’s  in terp lane-  
ta ry   travel. 
“One  difficulty  is  the  definition.  MERCURY  is a one-man orb i ta l  
laboratory;  GEMINI  is  a  two-man  orb i ta l   labo ra to ry ;  APOLLO  is a 
three-man  orb i ta l   labo ra to ry ;  and  a l l   will  s tay   u p  f o r  the  du ra -  
tion  of  the   t r i p   to   th e   moon. 
“ I f   you  are  going  fu r the r ,   you  come  t o   a  question,  Do  you 
want  something f o r  3  men,  6 men,  12 men,  or  20  m en ?  
“One  of  o u r   problems  is  to  define  the   requirements  and   both 
the  Department of  Defense and  ourselves are  making studies.  We  
have  agreed  there  should  be  only  one  project  for  the  time  being 
because th i s  will  be  a  2 or 3 billion 
roject.  W e  have agreed we 
will  not  proceed  unilaterally.  A  $cision,  of  course,  has  to  be 
made  as  to  what,  if  anything,  in  th e   1965 budget  will  be  i n  th i s  
f ie ldo rano the r   . . . . 
“As  to  th e   fu r th e r   exploration  of  the  moon,  the   definition  is 
a  very  variable  one.  You  might  leave  a n   astronaut  out  and ,  
figuratively  speaking,  take   camping  equipment  along  fo r   a  few

base  where  you  t r y   to  build  a  station,  as i n   th e  Antarctic,  tha t  
man can occupy fo r  sometime  . . . . 
“All  of  these  th ings   run in to   th e   billions  of  dollars  and   cer- 
ta in ly   Congress w i l l   be  involved  in  it. 
“There  a re  people who  favor  one or another of  these projects. 
I personally  favor   the   manned  orbital  laboratory  as being  t h e  
next  project.  W h a t  we  find on the  Moon may  change ou r  minds 
on  this,  but  from   present  knowledge I feel pr ior i ty   should go  to 
a manned  orbital  laboratory.  Some of  th i s   equipment has been 
in  space f o r  a  period  of  a year  or more.  T h a t  is the length  of  a 
trip  to  Mars   or  Venus  and   back. 
‘As you  know,  the   matter  of  making  major  decisions  of  th is  
k ind   in Government is a complicated one and  I cannot say a t  th i s  
t ime  when  the  hardware will be  recommended  by  the administra- 
tion.  One  reason  f o r   saying  th e  manned  orb i ta l   laboratory  has

Rep. Jo seph  E. K a r t h   (D.-Minn.) , in  M iw i l e s  and Ro c k e t s  interview, 
advocated  selling  space  boosters  to   foreign  countries.  Noting 
Scout  and  T h o r   boosters  already  were  available  to   European  
countries, h e  sa id  A t la s  also should be made available, under these 
conditions : 
“One,  t h a t   they  pay   fo r   the   vehicle-I 
don’t  th ink   we  should

_
give it away. 
“Two,  we  would  need  to  launch it f o r  them.  . . . Th i rd .  what- 
ever  sec‘mies  surround  th e   launch  vehicle  and /o r   other  devices, 
a l l  of  th is  would  be  handled  by  U.S.  personnel  . . . . 
“ I n  my opinion, other nations a r e  no t  as interested  in  advancing 
scientific exploration  a s  they a r e  in embarking on programs to  ad -  
vance  the i r   own  economic position.  And   in  th is   instance  I say 
it’s fine fo r  us to  cooperate by  selling  to   them  a  booster  or  what- 
ever other  paraphernalia  they  need. 
“As  these  countries  become  more  involved  in  space  programs, 
it may  be  they  will  be  desirous  of  buying  S a tu rn s  o r  Centaurs. 
We don’t  necesssrily need t o  s top  a t  Atlas.  I think the  whole high- 
th ru s t   field  of  boosters  is a  tremendous  market  with  g rea t  poten- 
tial. “.  . . we  should do  th is  th rough  a n  agency  of  the  U.S.  govern-

“These a re  the specific values of  space exploration:  the  benefits 
of  basic  research, economically valuable applications of  satellites, 
contributions  to  industrial  technology, a  general stimulus to  e d u -  
cation  and  to   the   younger  generation, and   the  strengthening of 
ou r   international  position  bv  our  acceptance  o f   leadership  i n   a 
historic human enterprise.  The  current discussion of  these values 
of  the  space program  has served the United  S ta tes  well  i n  direct- 
ing  i t s  attention  to  questions of  national  purpose.  But,  however 
we  may  try  to break  the  program  down  into  its  elements and   to 
a t temp t   a  detailed  balancing  of  debits  a n d   credits,  the   fact 
remains tha t   th e  space effort is greater th an  the  sum of  its parts. 
It  is  a  grea t   adventure and   a  p a t  enterprise,  no t  only  fo r   the  
United  S ta tes   but  fo r   all  humanity.  W e  have  the  power  and

heightened  by  the   fac t   tha t   federal  activities  in  defense,  space,

the  space agency the  major consumer of  tra ined  manpower within 
this federal  complex  of  technical  agencies?  In   actuality,  NASA 
will be  using six percent of  the  national manpower pool i n  science

an   additional  one  percent  in  government  laboratories.  I f   th e

“When  the  President  spoke  these  words,  there  was  f a r  more

Of  course  there  are  difficult problems  still  in  the  way  of  serious 
Soviet-American  cooperation  on  a  manned  space  flight.  Bu t  
f,he  financial, political  and  scientific advantages  to both  sides of  a

September  20:  Addressing  U.N. General  Assembly,  President  Ken- 
nedy  listed  results of  U.S.-U.S.S.R.  negotiations : 
“We have,  in   recent years,  agreed on a limited nuclear test-ban 
treaty,  on  an   emergency  communications l ink   betwean ou r  capi- 
tals, on  a  statement  of  principles  for  disarmament,  on  an   111- 
th e  peaceful  exploration  o f t h e  Antarctic,  and on tempering last 
crease  in   cu l tura l   exchan  e,  on  cooperation  in  outer  space,  on 
year’s crisis over Cuba  . . . . 
“Finally,  in   a  field  where  the   United  S ta te s   and  th e   Soviet 
field of  sp-there

a jo in t  expedition to  the  moon. 
“Space  offers no  roblem  of  sovereignty;  by  resolution  of  th i s  
Assembly,  t h e   mem ?le rs of  the  United  Nations  have  foresworn 
any claims to  terr i tor ia l  r igh ts  in outer space or on celestial bodies, 
and  declared  th a t   international  l aw   and  the   U.N.  char ter   will 
apply.  Why,  therefore,  should man’s  first  flight to the moon  be 
a ma t ter  of  national competition? 
“Why  should  the  United  S ta tes  and  the   Soviet Union,  in  pre- 
par ing   fo r   such  expeditions, become  involved  in   immense  dupli- 
cations  of  research,  construction  and   expenditure?  Surely  we

“The  contest will  continue,  the   contest between  those  who  en-

space technology to an industrially oriented goal. 
“Resistance to new  ideas  and  new  technologies is p a r t   psycho- 
logical ; a good deal of  i t  is practical when new expenditures have 
to  be  justified to   stockholders in   terms of  an  upward  sales curve.

of  th e  basic  difference in  approach,  the   language barr ier ,   differ-

Oc tobe r   1: F i f t h   anniversary  of  NASA.  Ceremonies  throughout  the  
week  included  open  house  a t  Wallops  S ta t ion ,  Va.,  Sept.  29  and

versary Banquet i n  Washington Oct. 5. 
I n  its  f i f th  yea r  of  spate  operations  (October  1,1962-October 
1,1963), NASA   launched  12 orbital,  deep space, and  manned space 
flights,  of  which  10 were  successful,  1  par t ia l ly   successful,  and  
one  unsuccessful.  Th e  X-15  rocket  research  a i rc ra f t   set  a  new 
a l t i tude  record  of  350,000 f t .   and  began  its follow-on  flights  in-  
volving  space  research.  T h e  Mercury  program  added  a  6-orbit 
flight  and   was  concluded  with  a  22-orbit  flight.  Among  other 
successful  flights  were  fou r   scientific  satellites,  two   communica- 
tions  satellites,  the   first  and   second  synchronous-orbit  communi- 
cations  satellites,  and  another  weather  satellite.  T h e  fifth  scien- 
tific  lun a r   probe  (RANQER  v)   was  unsuccessful  and   led  to  a 
reworking of  th e  remaining Ranger probes. 
Project  Apollo  flight  testing  was  begun. 
I n   its  five  years  of  space  operations,  NASA  had   launched  a 
to ta l   of  68  orbital,  deep  space,  and   manned  space  flights,  of 
which  39  were  successful,  9  par t ia l ly   successful,  apd   20  unsuc- 
cessful,  fo r   a n  overall  average of  2%  successes fo r  every  failure. 
T h e   ra te   of  improvement  ranged  from  1 success  per  fa i lu re   in 
1958-59  and   1959-60,  to  2  to   1 in  1960-61,  to  5  to 1 i n   1961-62,

A t   NASA  F i f t h   Anniversary  Honor  Awards  Ceremony,  held  at 
Smithsonian  Ins t i tu t ion ,   23  individuals  were  singled  out  fo r  
outstanding  contributions  to   th e   civilian  space  program.  Vice 
President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  s ta ted   th a t  U S .  space  policy  was 
c lear :   “W i th   o r   without  cooperation  from  any  other  country, 
we  a re  going to the  moon, and  we  a re  going  to  make t h a t  t r i p  a s  
soon  as  we  can.  . . . We  would  like  to   do  th i s   th rough   in ter-  
national  cooperation.  Leaders  of  both  par t ies   have  sought  co- 
operation  under  two  administrations.  T h e  moon  represents  ou r  
major  space  goal  fo r   th is   decade,  and   i f   cooperation  is  possible 
we  are   willing  to  share th i s  goal  a s  well  a s  others.” 
NASA   Administrator  James  E. Webb summarized  the   five years 
of  space  achievements  and   looked  ahead :   “From   the   first  two 
IJnited  S ta te s  satellites,  Exp lo re r   I and   Vanguard  I, launched 
early  in  1958, we  learned  t h a t  th e  ea r th  was s l igh t ly  pear-shaped

in   trouble  on  i t s  f if th   anniversary,  according  to   J o h n  Finney  of

began to  question the  validity  of  th e  manned lun a r  landing.  “The

approach being urged by th e  scientific cr i t ics  is a step-by-ste  pro-

J o h n  Finney  of  the New Y o r k  Times concluded  t h a t  th e  race t o

the  moon had   always been a  one-sided  one, t h a t  there was no evi-

a t  eventually 
proceeding on  a  building-block  program  in  space  t 
would  lead  to a  luna r  landing,  bu t  not  a s  a  special,  high-priority 
project.  This,  Finney  said,  was  also  the   approach  of  the   U.S. 
until May  1961.  “Then,  in  th e  wake  of  th e   Bay  of  P ig s   fiasco 
and   the  first  Soviet  manned  space  flight,  the   Kennedy  ,Qdmin- 
istration  ordered  a n   ab rup t   change  in   course.’’  Th e   original 
justification  was  th a t   U.S.  restige  w a s   a t  stake.  As  time  went 
on  and  budget  resistance  feveloped  in   Congress,  the   Adminis- 
tra t ion   argument  sh if ted  to  one  of  a t ta in inq  “a  position  of  pre-

emphasized  more  and   more.  F ina l ly ,   the   President’s  proposal 
for  the   jo in t   U.S.-U.S.S.R.  manned  luna r   program  seemed  to  
undercut  a l l  preceding positions.  To Mr. Finney,  a l l  th is  added

H i s   own  invention,  the   technique  makes  it  possible  to   goldplate

resistance  to   tarn ish .   Th i s  new  method,  “Lockspray-Gold,”  has 
the   advantage  of  grea t   flexibility  since  there   is   no  l im i t   to  the

Reported  in Aviation World  (FZugwZt) th a t  West  Germany  has  a 
$25  million-budget  to  develop  a  series of  5  satellites to be  built 
under  NASA’s established quality control  standards.  The  satellite 
would  consist of  three pa r t s :   the  satellite capsule with  a  recovery 
unit,  the   sun   mirror,  the   energy  converter.  T h e   first  satellite 
recovery  capsule  would  descend  with  the   aid  of  a  parachute; 
la ter  models  would  include a winged  glider  version.  Telemetric 
transmissions and  subsequent evaluation would  commence as  soon 
as  the   satellite  enters  an  E a r th   orbit.  The   second  satellite  and 
the   remainder  of  the  series would  be  equipped with  engines tha t  
will  permit  changes  in  the   orbital  parameters.  On  the   second 
satellite small solid fuel  rockets would  be used, but  the  following 
models could be  equipped  with  ion  engines. 
The   satellite’s mission  would  include  research  in  the   guidance 
and  direction  stabilization  systems du r ing   the  launching  investi- 
gation of  the  orbital rendezvous problems, as  well as a study of  the  
radiation  belts.  I n  the  case  of  the  fifth  satellite,  the  ion engines 
could  be  replaced  with  nuclear-powered engines  to   permit  con- 
tinuous  orb i ta l   changes  and   accelerate  to   an   escape  velocity.

Addressing  th e   I l l -n a t ion   Committee, U.S.  Ambassador Ad la i

proposal  fo r   U.S.-U.S.S.R.  cooperation  in  exploration  of  the  
moon  th a t   President  Kennedy  had   offered  last September.  Bu t ,  
Stevenson  continued, “If g ian t   steps cannot be taken  a t  once, we 
hope  t h a t   shor ter  ones  can.  We believe there  a re  areas of  work, 
shor t   of  in tegra t ing   the   two  national  prorgams,  from   which  all 
could  benefit.  We   should  explore  the   opportunities  for  prac- 
tical  cooperation, beginning  with  small steps and hopefully  lead- 
in   t o  larger  ones.” 
t t r e s s i n g   th a t   U.S.  manned  luna r   program  was  only  one pa r t  
of  the   s  ace program  and  th a t   no  more  than   10 percent  of  th e  
total U.g.  space  expenditure  went  directly  for   the   luna r   flight, 
he added : (‘Let me make clear tha t   exploration  of  the  moon  is not 
a  s tun t ,   distinct  from   the   outer-space program  as  a  whole;  nor  
is it, the  exclusive concern of only two  n a t’ ions. 
“Ou r   policy  of  engaging  in  mutually  beneficial  and  mutually 
supporting  cooperation in  outer  space-with 
the  Soviet Union  ;\s

to  pursue  an   active  program  of  re-  
search and development over the  entire range of  space tmlmology. 
Th is   includes manned  space  flight,  the   development of  nuclear-

reliability  of  Scout  booster  (50%)  was  because of  difficulties in

in fu tu re  space systems, he  said,  lyas development of long-lifetime

solving  the  major problem  of  equipment’s melting

“Spin-off  is  in  t h e  form  of  ideas and  innovations, not  finished

spin-off)  and  added  t h a t   these  examples do  not  include  all, no r  
can they be considered statistically representative of, the  transfers  
which have taken place. 
“NASA  centers have come u p  with  about 850 innovations though t

“&me  ( th e   interval  between  the   inception  of  an  innovation

U.S.S.R.  has  failed  in   a t  least  13 attempts  to  send  probes  to Mars, 
Venus,  a n d  the  moon  since October  1960, Astronautics  and  Aero- 
space Engineering reported, and  these fa i lures  were chiefly caused 
by  inability  of  fou r th   stage  to   send  the   payload  out  of  pa rk ing  
orbit.  A&AE   concluded,  “it  seems clear  t h a t  th e  Russians  have 
need  for an   improved  upper  stage to  launch  deep-space  vehicles, 
and  th a t  Polyot I fills the  bill.”  ( A Q A E ,  12/63,90) 
During  1963: Man’s conquest of  space moved from  spectacular hazard 
toward  routine  accomplishment,  from  the  exhilarating  peaks  and  
slumps  of  first-generation  hardware  and   experiments  to   the  
steadily improving reliability  and  capability  of second- and th i rd -  
genemtion launch vehicles and satellites.  NASA  launched  13 major 
space  shots,  with  mission  results  of  11 successes, 1 pa r t ia l   success 
a nd  1 unsuccessful,  compared with  t h e  1962 record of  19 succeSses, 
4  pa r t ia l   successes,  and  3  unsuccessful.  Project  Mercury  ended 
with  L .   Gordon  Cooper’s  22-orbit  f l igh t ;   Project  Apollo  began 
i t s   flight  tests  with  two  unmanned  capsule  tests.  Communica- 
tions  satellites  demonstrated  near-synchronous  orb i t   and   Sa tu rn  
and Centaur  boosters  moved  toward  operational  s ta tu s  with  suc- 
cessful  test  flights.  U.S.S.R.  conducted  a  129-orbit tandem  flight 
and  orbited  an unmanned  prototype  of  a new manned  maneuver- 
able space capsule.  NASA   Administrator  J am e s  E. Webb cited  R S  
NASA’s greatest  specific  accomplishment  of  1963  th e   fac t   th a t  
his key staff  people  in Headquarters and  th e  Centers had  “learned 
to  supervise  the   efforts  a t   hand,”  th a t   he  now  h a s   “the  men
