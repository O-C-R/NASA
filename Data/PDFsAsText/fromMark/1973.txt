Foreword 

Th is  volume i n  NASA’s continuing series of  annua l  chronologies records the  
events  of  1973. The   15 th   year  of  the  space  agency’s  existence  is  memorable 
to  the   public  a s   the  Year   of  Skylab  and   the   Year  of  Jupiter.  The  nation’s 
first  ear th-orb i ta l  labora tory  was  launched. Beginning with  a  drama t ic  10-day  
fix-it  effort  tha t   restored  Skylab’s  capability  to  generate  electrical  power, 
three  three-man  crews  rendezvoused  a n d   docked  with  the  space  laboratory. 
The ir   total  of  1 2  351  man-hours   in   space  supported  the  feasibility  of  pro-  
longed  manned  space  flight.  Even  more  impressive  were  the  volume  and  
qua l i ty   of  experiment  results.  The   sophisticated  battery  of  telescopes  in   the 
Apollo  Telescope Mount  produced  182  842   frames  of  film  and   941  hours   of 
manned viewing  of  the  sun .  The  ea r th  was  not  neglected either.  Orienting  the 
labora tory   toward  the  ear th ,   as tronau ts   took  a  total  of  40  286   frames  of 
earth-resources  photographs.  Electric  fu rnace   experiments with  zero-gravity 
manufac tur ing  offered interesting possibilities  of  new  industrial  processes tha t  
cannot be  achieved  in   ear th   gravity.  Assimilation of  the knowledge contained 
in   the  mass of  da ta   is  still  continuing. 
As the year  closed, P ioneer  10 swept by   the  planet  Jup i ter  af ter   a 21-month 
flight  tha t   traversed  a  billion  kilometers.  Pass ing   through   the  intense  rad ia-  
tion  surround ing   the  largest  planet  in   ou r  solar  system, P ioneer   10  sent  back 
300  closeup photographs  of  the  planet  and   i ts   inner  moons,  along with  other 
measurements  of  the  swirling  atmosphere  and   i ts   massive  Red  Spot  and   of 
the  magnetic,  rad ia t ion ,   and   electrical  environments.  Even  a s   i t   returned  the  
data-much  of  which contradicted previous theories-Pioneer  10 was heading 
outward  toward  the  orb i ts   of  Sa tu rn   and   Pluto.  I n   the  late  1980s i t   will  be- 
come  the  first  man-made  object  to  leave  the  solar  system  and   voyage  in to  
interstellar  space.  The   events  of  Skylab  and   Pioneer  were  only  the  most 
visible  successes  of  1973,  however;  many  other  impor tan t   events  accom- 
plished  the ir   objectives with  less  notice. 
On  a  smaller scale,  bu t   particularly  impor tan t   to  a  few, was  the   announce- 
ment  of  a  new  hea r t   pacemaker  developed  from   electronic  components  and  
batteries  originally  designed  for   use  in   space. T h e  new  model  was  recharge- 
able,  thus   eliminating  the  need  fo r   periodic  surgery   to  replace  the  earlier 
instrument. 
Uses  fo r   the  vast  amount  of  da ta   from   the  Ear th   Resources  Technology 
Satellite Er ts   1 multiplied  as  i t  completed i ts   first  year  in  space  in  July  1973 :  
planning  land   use,  manag ing   water  resources,  estimating  crop   yields,  inven- 
tory ing   timber,  exploring  for   minerals  and   petroleum.  T h e  practical  benefits 
from   this  and   s im i lar  programs  seem a t  th is  writing  almost  limitless.  Indeed, 
the  pr inc ipa l   problems  a r e  no  longer  the  acquisition of  such da ta ,   bu t   ra ther  
its rap id   and   economical reduction  in t9  usable  forms. 
I n   aeronautics, work  went  forward   on  a  number  of  programs :   digital  fly- 
by-wire,  which  will  significantly  improve   a i rc ra f t   control;  the   supercritical 
wing,  which  provides  significant fuel  savings;  reduction  of  noise  and   pollu- 
t ion ;   and  hydrogen  injection  to  increase efficiency and   reduce pollution  from

gasoline engines. Collectively these efforts promise safer  flight, fuel economies, 
and  less damage to  our  environment. 
Thu s  on most  counts NASA  activities seemed to  bear   out  the Administrator’s 
statement  i n   late  1973  tha t   NASA  was  providing more  emphasis on  becoming 
more like one  of  the  service agencies of  the  government.” 
L <  
Altogether  1973  was  a  productive  year,  punctuated  a t   times  with  excite- 
ment.  And  while  real  achievements  were  being  realized,  plans  were  being 
la id   for  subsequent  programs,  a n d   th i s   volume  offers  specific  information 
abou t  both.

January  1973 

January  1 :   NASA  h ad   scheduled  15  spacecraft  launches  in  1973  from  Ken- 
nedy  Space  Center,  Eastern  Test  Range,  and  Western  Test  Range,  KSC 
announced.  Launches  would  include  four Skylab missions,  three of  them 
manned ;   Intelsat-IV  F-6,  F-7,  and   F-8  for  Communications  Satellite 
Gorp.;  Pioneer-G  to  fly  by  Jup i t e r ;   Canada’s  Telesat-B comsat;  RAE-B 
Radio  Astronomy  Explorer;  United  Kingdom’s  Skynet  11-A  comsat; 
Mariner  mission  t o  fly  by  Venus  and   Mercury ;   ITOS-E  Improved  T iros  
Operational  Satellite;  ERTS-B  Ear th   Resources  Technology  Satellite ; and  
AE-c  Atmosphere Explorer.  ( ICSC  Release  1-73) 
*  NASA  and   Soviet space  officials h ad   agreed  to  permit  representatives  of  the 
U.S.  and   U.S.S.R.  to  observe  and  advise  in  Apollo  and   Soyuz  flight  con- 
trol  rooms  dur ing   orbital  phase  of  July  1975  jo in t   mission,  Av ia t ion  
Week  & Space   Technology  reported.  No  agreement had   been  reached  to 
permit  U.S.  observers  a t   the  Soviet  launch  site  du r in g  liftoff  of  Soyuz 
spacecraft.  [See March  15-30.]  ( A v  Wk, 1/1/73,  13) 
*  An Aviation Week  8 Space  Technology  editorial noted  the  aerospace indus- 
t ry  forecast  f o r  1973 was  fo r   continuing improvement “across  the  en t ire  
technical  spectrum.’’  The   year  1971  had  bottomed  ou t   the  1969-1970 
recession  and   provided  the  “first  tangible  evidence  of  upswing.”  Th e  
year  1973  should  continue  the  uptrend  “on  a  modest  bu t   solid  curve.” 
Industry  had   been  “under  increasing pressure f rom  Congress,  the  Pen ta-  
gon  a n d   th e   taxpaying  public  fo r   the  last  five  years  to  improve  its 
manageria1 efficiency and   the  reliability  performance  of  i ts  products. The  
pressure  has  now  accumulated  to   th e  point  where  th e   industry  must  re- 
spond,  both  internally  in  cleaning  its  own  house  and   mounting  a n  
aggressive  campaign  for   government  contracting  reforms  to  match,  o r  
face the very  real  spectre of  nationalization  in  the  public mood  tha t  may 
well  prevail  four  years  hence.”  (Hotz, Av W k ,  1/1/73,  11 )  
*  Th e   “deeper  meaning”  of  Apo l lo   17  (Dec.  7-19,  1972),  the  last  manned 
lunar   land ing   mission  in   the  NASA  program,  was  discussed  by  author 
William  I.  Thompson  in   a  New   Yo rk   T imes   article:  Th e   mission  h ad  
represented a “sunset”  of  rocket technology.  “Apollo  17  turned  the n igh t  
into  day,  bu t   elsewhere  smalIer  lights  were  going  on   a s  men  began  to 
discover  relationships  between  consciousness  and   the   growth  of  plants 
. . . , between  enzyme  change and  f a i th  h e a l i n g .   . . , and   between  mind 
and  ma t ter   i n  psychokinesis.  . . . The space  program   was a n   important 
scaffolding,  bu t   now  tha t   the   building  of  the  new  human   culture  is  up, 
we  no  longer  need  the  scaffolding.”  To   spend  a  for tune   on  rockets  now 
“would  be  the   same as spend ing   a  for tune  on  dirigibles  in   1916. There  
a r e  other  forms  of  space travel  to b e  invented, and  these forms a r e  more 
likely  to  sp r ing  from  the  new  parad igms  emerging in   science than   from  
the  hardware   of  the  old  technology.  Th e  e r a  of  the  rocket has   climaxed 
in  Apollo  17 ;  if  we  push  on  and   ignore  the  sense  of  a n  ending,  we  shall 
find  only  the  bitterness  and   disappointment  of  the   anticlimax.”  ( N Y T ,  
1/1/73,  3 :13)

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTECS,  1973 
Dr.  James  C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator,  expressed  gratifi- 
January  2 :  
cation  in   his  monthly  letter  to   the  staff  “with  NASA’s excellent  perform- 
ance  in   1972, and   with  the  successful  transition  . . . from  the  completed 
programs  of  the  Sixties to  the  new  programs  and   new  challenges of  the 
Seventies.  I n   1972,  Phase   I  of  the  national  space  effort  of  the  United 
States was  completed  and   Phase  I1 well  begun.” 
NASA’s first year  with  all  launches a n d  missions  successful  underlined 
tha t   i t   was  NASA’s custom  “to  do  the  unprecedented  and   then  quickly 
make i t  routine.”  Zero failures could now  be  the  goal year  a f t e r  year. Dr. 
Fletcher  also  noted  tha t   of  18  space  launches in   1972 half  had   been  f o r  
other  organizations o r  countries,  with  8 being  reimbursed. 
On  another  “ impor tan t   front,”  the  NASA-wide  payload  cost-reduction 
campaign  begun  in   1972 had   gone  well,  with  valuable  suggestions f rom  
Centers and   contractors.  The   effort  “was  not  a  routine  cutback  exercise 
and   not  a  threa t   to   anyone’s  security.  I t   is,  instead,  a  creative  effor t  to 
expand  our   usefulness  even  though  funds  a r e   limited.  And  you  can  be 
sure  i t  has   a  lot  to  do  with  NASA’s 
long-range survival as   the  instrument 
of  the  U S .  Government  to  handle most  kinds  of  space  and   aeronautical 
R&D  and  other  related  assignments.”  ( N A S A  Ac t iv i t ies ,  1/15/73,  2-3) 
Dr .   Edward  E.  David,  Jr.,  Presidential  Science Adviser,  resigned  to  re turn  
to  private  industry. Th e  former  communications systems  scientist a t  Bell 
Telephone  Laboratories,  Inc.,  had   served  a s   Director  of  White  House 
Office  of  Science and  Technology for  28 mos and  had   instituted reorgani- 
zation of  the Federal science complex. The  New  Yo rk  T imes  quoted Wh i te  
House sources as  saying the  resignation was prompted by  disappointment 
th a t  his  advice  had   not  been  heeded  by  the  Nixon  Administration.  Fed-  
era l   support  for  science  and   technology  expressed  as   percentage  of 
budget  outlays  for  research  and  development  had   reached  the  lowest 
point  since  latter  years  of  the  Eisenhower  Administration.  Th e   White 
House  h ad   declined  comment  on  the  resignation  and   had   not  released 
the  text of  Dr.  David’s  letter  to  the President.  (Lyons, N Y T ,  1/3/73,  1 )  
Grumman  American  Aviation  Corp.  was  formed  by  the  merger  of  Grum-  
man   Corp.’s  general-aviation  interests  and   American  Aviation  Corp. 
Grumman’s  Gulfstream  1 and   2  and   Ag-Cat  program  assets  were  trans-  
f e r r ed  to American Aviation  Corp.  in  exchange  for   shares  in  American. 
Corporate headquar ters  of  the  new company would be  in  Cleveland,  Ohio, 
with  Grumman  President  E.  C.  Tow1 a s  company  Chairman  and  Ameri- 
can  Pres iden t   and   Chief  Executive  Officer  R.  W.  Meyer  as  President. 
(Znteravia, 4/73,  301; Grumman  Corp pro) 
Pres iden t   Nixon  accepted  the   resignation  of  Dr.  Edward  E. 
January   3 :  
David,  Jr.,  a s   Science  Adviser  and  Director  of  Office  of  Science  and  
Technology  [see  Jan .   21.  ( P D ,  1/8/73,  10) 
*  NASA  planned  to  spend  up   to  $100  million  du r ing   the  next  five  years  on 
the  post-Apollo  lun a r   science  program  to  extract  information  from   385 
kg   (850 Ibs)  of  lunar   samples,  30 000  photos,  and   “miles”  of  magnetic 
tape   from  six  Apollo  lun a r   land ing   missions,  the  New  Yo rk   T imes   re- 
ported.  Director  Anthony  J.  Calio  of  Manned  Spacecraft  Center  Office 
of  Science  and   Applications  had   said  in   a n  interview  th a t  recommenda- 
tions i n  a n  October 1972 repor t  of  the Lun a r  Science Institute were  being 
followed  in   much  of  MSC’S  planning,  but  the  MSC   Lunar   Receiving 
Labora tory  would  b e  closed  on  completion  of  Apo l lo   17  sample process- 
ing.  Th e   sample  collection  m igh t   be  divided  for  storage  a t   another 
Government  facility  a s  a  “precaution.”  Th e  LRL   repor t   h ad   sa id   preser-

vation  of MSG  cura tor ia l   facilities  fo r   lunar   materials  was  “absolutely 
essential”  to  luna r   science  objectives.  Calio  said  sample  inventory  and  
prepara t ion  of  rock  slivers  for   the   th in   sections  l ib ra ry   should  take  two 
years.  Repository  f o r   Apollo  geophysical  material,  including  magnetic 
tapes,  probably  would  be  Goddard  Space  Flight Center.  (W i lford ,  N Y T ,  
1/3/73,  25 )  
The  Aviation Advisory  Commission sent to  the Pres iden t  a  report of  its two- 
year  study  of  long-range U.S.  aviation needs.  Acting  under   Pub l ic  Law 
the   Commission  h ad   concluded  tha t   the  “U.S.  i s   fac ing   the  
91-258, 
greatest  combination  of  threa ts   to   i ts   position  of  world  preeminence  i n  
aviation  since  i t   established  tha t   position  in   the  la te   forties.”  Recom- 
mendations  included  establishment  of  Under   Secre tary   for   Civil  Avia- 
tion  in  Dept.  of  Transportation  to  p repa re  and  keep  curren t  a  10-yr  plan 
for   a i r   services,  airports,  airways,  a i r   vehicles,  and   ground  access. 
Civil-aviation  research  and   development  functions of  NASA ,   the  Federal 
Aviation  Administration,  and   o ther   Federal  agencies  should  be  placed 
under   the U SCA .   ( C R ,  1/12/73,  S608)  
0  Reaction  of  wr i ters   Norman  Mailer  and   Ka ther ine   Anne  Po r te r   to  space 
flight  and   to  nighttime  launch   of  Apo l lo   17  were  reported  in   the  Chris-

and  participated  in  a  space sem inar  du r ing  the “Voyage  beyond Apollo” 
cruise  of  the  S.S.  S ta tendam ,   which  left  New  York  Dec.  4  fo r   Cape 
Kennedy  and   the  Car ibbean .  
Mailer  had   sa id :   “Moon  colonies  offer  the  possibility  tha t   we’ll  b e  
able  to  discover  definitively  and   fo r   the   first  time  what  we  a re   doing 
wrong.  Whether  we  thrive  on  the   moon  or  fail  we’re  going  to  learn  
something  tha t   we’re  not  going  to  learn   by   staying  here   on  ear th .   . . .” 
P a r t   of  “the  fundamental  impasse  of  20th-century  man  and   woman  i s  
that  they  cannot  find  communities  which  express  the ir   philosophical 
ideas,  the ir   social  ideas,  and   the ir   private  ideas.  I n  o ther  words,  the  one 
th ing   tha t  we  can’t  do  any  longer  is verify wha t  we  think. We  can  have 
ideas.  But we  spend ou r   lives jus t   talking  about  them. 
“There   a r e   very  few  people  who  have  a  profound   sense  of  commit- 
ment.  One  of  the   reasons  tha t   the  astronauts have  been  so  revered  .  .  . 
is that  they  have  th is  huge  sense of  commitment.  . . . they  a re  absolutely 
devoted  to  a  living  a  life  tha t   they  believe  in   utterly  and   a re  willing  to 
go  through   grea t   hardsh ip   for   it.  I  think  tha t   until  our   society  reaches 
the   point  where  many  more   people  live  lives  of  such  commitment  it’s 
going  to   rema in   essentially  unhealthy.  . , . 
“The   decision  to  go   to  the   moon  is  such  a  declaration  of  intent.  If 
nothing  else,  one  ha s   to  risk  dy ing  on  it.  One  h a s  to  recognize  tha t   one 
is  taking a ma jo r   step,  and   the  idea  of  tak ing  a ma jo r  step br ings  out  i n  I 
people  a t  least for  a  shor t  period  . . . the  best  in   them.  Then,  if  there’s 
something  really  alive  in   the  venture,  they’re  likely  to   keep  chang ing  
the ir  hab i ts  and   go  on  to  make  more  of  themselves.” 
Miss Po r te r   had  said tha t ,   i n  almost  any th ing  men  undertook  together 
here   on  the   earth,  “ in   no  t ime   a t   all  there’s  a  pull  and  hau l   for   power. 
They’re  be tray ing  and  tr ick ing  each  other, getting i n  one  another’s way. 
And  yet  when  i t   comes  to  something  they  consider  b ig   ‘enough  and  
grand   enough   they  do   i t   i n   a  g rand   way  and   they  do  i t   well,  like  the  
astronauts.  . . . We’ve  always  built  and   saved  a  little  more   than   we’ve 
been  able to destroy,  don’t you th ink?”   ( C S M ,  1/3/73)

“Many  people may  have  the  impression  th a t   the   space program   is   over

with  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  and   with  NASA   to  develop  a  clear 
understanding  of  the  program”  and  its  relation  to  other  national  needs

cost  of  the  space  program   i n   relation  to  other  impor tan t   demands  on 
the  Nation’s  resources.”  He   would  “approach  the   question  of  current,

satellites,  “ i t   should  also  consider  the  use  of  educational  and   public

NASA  Hq.  held  its  first  press  briefing  on Mariner  9  (launched 
May  30,  1971)   since  spacecraft  ceased  transmission  October  27,  1972, 
one  year  af ter   i t   had  gone  into  Martian  orb i t .   Photos  were  released 
showing  three  kinds  of  channels  on  the  Mars   surface  thought  to  b e  
formed by   flowing water  sometime  in Mar t ian  history.  Harold Masursky 
of  the U S .  Geological Survey said one kind  seemed  to have been  formed 
by   melting  permafros t ;   the  other  two  looked  “as   though  it’s  necessary 
to  have  precipitation  and   a  collection  of  tha t   runoff  into  flowing  water 
channels.” 
New  Mexico  Univ.  geologist  Dr.  Bradford  A.  Smith  sa id   riverbeds 
on Mars probably  had   dr ied   because  of  orb i ta l  changes. When  the  Mars 
orb i t   was  more  elliptical  than   a t   present,  the   perihelion  would  be  much 
closer  to   the  sun,  perhaps  producing  long-term  climate  changes  which 
might,  “a t   certain  times,  perm i t   liquid  water  to  exist.” 
Dr.  Conway  B.  Leovy,  Univ.  of  Washington,  sa id   dust  storms  en- 
countered  by  Mariner  9  were  “phenomena  which  will  recur  on  Mars 
depending  on  the  particular  astronomical  relationship  between  the 
perihelion  and   the  solstice.”  Dust  storms  m igh t   have  been  responsible 
for   “the  remarkable  laminated  terra in   which  has  been  observed  in  both 
polar  zones.” 
Scientists had   determined  from Mariner  9  photos  tha t   the  planet  was 
a  more  varied  and   dynamic  body  than   expected.  Dr.  John  E.  Naugle, 
NASA  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Sciences,  sa id :   “Mars  is  like 
three  planets : the  old  cra tered   planet,  the  young  volcanic  active  planet 
th a t   you  see,  and   then  a n   entirely  different  situation  in   the  polar  re- 
gions  in   Mars.”  Mars  as  “planetary  laboratory”  of  towering  volcanoes, 
deep  r i f t   valleys,  broad   plateaus  broken  by  fault  lines,  ancient  planes 
with  moonlike  craters,  sand   dunes,  clouds  with  water  ice,  and   ever- 
changing  polar  caps  would  “substantially  increase  our   basic  knowledge 
of  planets  . . . and   . . . when  tha t   history  is  written  you  will  find  tha t  
planetary  exploration  h a s  contributed  in  a  ma jor   way  to  the  health  and 
welfare  of  life  on  this  planet.”  (Transcr ip t)

engineer  of  very  broad  competence  who  maintained  intellectual  integ-

*  Dr.  James  C .   Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator,  released  the   statement  given 
ou t   a t   the   NA SA   FY  1974  budget  briefing  held  Jan.  27 :   “The  budget 
the  Pres iden t   has   approved  for   NASA  fo r   FY  1974,  like  those  of  o ther  
agencies,  h a s   been  reduced  substantially  below  previous  plans  a n d  
expectations  to  hold  total  government  spending  to  the   targets  set  by  
the   President.  At  the   same  time,  the   budget  will  permit  NASA  to  ca r ry  
forward   a  substantial  and   significant  program  in   space  and   aero- 
nautics.” 
T h e  budget  provided  for   continuing  the  ma jor   projects  in  the   sched- 
ule  announced  Jan .   5  and   for  s tar t ing   two  new  projects:  Nimbus-G, 
“another  in NASA’s series of  experimental ea r th  oriented  satellites, which 
will  be  directed  a t   environmental  pollution  and   oceanographic measure- 
ments,  and   LAGEOS,  a  new  geodetic  satellite  for   extremely  accurate 
measurements  of  movements  of  the   earth‘s  surface.” 
I n   add i t ion   to  reductions  in   programs  announced  Jan .   5,  the  budget 
required  “ tha t   we  stretch out  schedules in   a  number  of  ongoing projects. 
The   second  Ea r th   Resources  Technology  Satellite  ( ERTS-B)  will  be 
delayed  two  years,  until  1976. Th i s  will  allow  i t   to  ca r ry   an   additional 
sensor.  Tiros-N, the  prototype  of  a  new  series of  operational meteorolog- 
ical  satellites  for   the  National  Weather  Service,  will  be  delayed  by 
abou t   one  year   io   1977. 
“We  will  also  undergo  another  belt-tightening  in   NA SA .   By  the  end  
of  FY  1974  our   civil  service complement will  be   reduced  1880 positions 
below  the   FY  1973   end  strength  approved  in   the  FY  1973   budget. 
Th is   reduction  includes  the   previously  announced  reductions  related 
to  the   termination  of  our   nuclear  programs.” 
Despite  a  “sharp   decrease  from   the   level  budget  anticipated  last 
year,”  Dr .   Fletcher  was  “very  pleased  with  the  program   content  we 
were  ab le   to  re ta in .   Clearly  from  what  ha s   been  said  today  and   on  
Janua ry   5,  we  will  have  to  cur ta i l   several  activities  tha t   a r e   of  ma jor  
importance  to  the   nation.”  But  “we  have  been  able  to  keep  NASA’S 
main  l ine   program   essentially  in tac t   and   each  of  the  programs  cu r -  
tailed  will  still  be   done,  e i ther   a t   a  la ter   da te   than   anticipated  o r   in 
a n   a l terna te   way  to  tha t   planned  last  year.  Although  I,  personally, 
would  like  to  see  a  h igher   NASA  budget,  I  believe  we  can  capitalize 
on  the   belt-tightening  required  to  produce  even  grea ter   yield  fo r   the  
tax  dollar  in   fu tu re   years.”  NASA  was  “making  substantial  efforts  to 
reduce  fu ture   costs  . . . while  still  giving  the  nation  a  s trong   pro-  
gram   in   space  and   aeronautics.”  Additionally,  a  pr ime   object  of  the  
space  shuttle  program   was  to  reduce  costs  of  opera t ing   i n   space.  NASA 
intended  to   “develop  and   in troduce   new  design  concepts  and   manage- 
ment  approaches  which,  together  with  the  relaxed  weight  and   size  con-

NASA  Comptroller  William  E.  Lilly  discussed  personnel  cutbacks  ne- 
cessitated  by   the new  budgetary  limitations.  The   total  NASA  Civil Service 
reduction of  1880 positions would  include  a Marshall  Space Flight  Cen-

Dr .   James  C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator,  discussed  NASA’s 
February 2: 
outlook  for  the  fu ture   in   a  letter  to  the   NASA  staff:  “I  regret  tha t   we 
have  not  been  able  to  stabilize  NASA’s budget  a t   about  the  $3.4  billion 
level  . . . and   tha t   our   reduced  program  workload  necessitates  a  fu r -  
ther  reduction  in   . .  . NASA   employees.  I  am   pleased,  though,  tha t   we 
can  proceed  with  most  of  our   mainline  programs  and   schedules  for  
this  decade  with  little  change.”  With  the  May  launch  of  Skylab  “we 
should  b e   able  to  give  th e   world  a  very  impressive  demonstration  of 
the  tremendous  new  capabilities  we  now  have  for  using  manned  and  
unmanned  spacecraft  in  Ear th   orbit.  I  believe  tha t   Skylab  will  awaken 
public  interest  throughout  the  world  in  the   usefulness  of  scientific 
and   practical  observations  to   be  made  from   E a r th   orbit,  and   in   the 
‘space manufacturing’ experiments.  I  am  also  confident tha t   the  reports 
from   Pioneer  10  a s   i t   swings  past  Jup i ter   in   December  will  stimulate 
strong  public  interest  in   expanded  programs  to   explore  the  planets. 
Ou r   jo in t   flight  with  the  Russians  in  1975  will  stress  the   potential  of 
large-scale  international  cooperation  in   space.  T h e   Viking  Lander  on 
Mars   may  produce  the   first  evidence  of  life  in   the  universe  beyond 
the   confines  of  our   home  planet  E a r th ;   and   i t   may  suggest  to  Ameri- 
cans  the   real  potential  of  space exploration  a s  a  continuing and  expand- 
ing   activity  dur ing   ou r   th i rd   century  as  a n   independent  and   demo- 
cra t ic   nation.”  Dr .   Fletcher  forecast  a  favorable  NASA   fu ture :   “With 
another  year  of  excellent  performance in   1973 like we  had   in   1972, and 
continued  s trong  bi-partisan  support  in   Congress,  this  forecast  is  bound

The   National  Science  Foundation  released  A n   Analysis  of  Federal  R&D 
Fund ing   b y   Function:  FY   1963-73 
(NSF   72-313).  Federal  expendi-

total  Federal  outlays  i n   FY  1973  for  the  first  time  since  FY  1965.  Be-

with  total  outlays  up   2.6%.  The  Federal  R&D   percentage  of  the  total 
was  expected  to  be  7.3%  in   FY  1973.  Of  total  outlays  fo r   space  re- 
search  and   technology,  98%  was  expected  to  go  toward  R&D,  bu t   the 
R&D  share   of  the  total  outlay  f o r   international  affairs  and   finance, 
veterans  benefits  and   services,  general  government,  and   income  se-

and   space R&T had   increased  emphasis  on  R&D   significantly  1963-1973, 
from   10%   to  an   expected  23% .   The   trend   toward  more   civilian-

supersonic  transport  effort : Environmental  and   economic problems  and  
order   cancellations  h ad   created  a  bleak  outlook  for   the   French  and 
British  Concorde.  T h e   modest  budget  request  for   research  into  the 
environmental  impact  of  the  U S .  SST  by  the  Nixon  Administration  was 
realistic  and   should  be  approved  by  Congress  “for  the   nation’s  protec-

i n  the  building  of  a n  SST  prototype.”  (W  Star  &  News, 2/8/73,  A10 )  
Aspects  of  Pres iden t   Nixon’s  FY  1974  budget  requests  were 
February  9 :  
discussed  in   a  Science  ar t ic le :   Th e   space  program   seemed  “alive  and  
well  as  i t   makes  the  transition  into  the  post-Apollo  era ,   despite  recent 
fears   . . . tha t   i ts   activities  might  be  cu t   back  severely.”  NASA  officials 
seemed  confident  the  space  shuttle  would  be  built.  The   President  had  
supported  the  project  “although  his  new  budget  message  contained  no 
mention  of  the  space  program”  and ,   “in  Congress,  i t   h a s   survived 
handily  all  past  attempts  to  kill  it.  Th e   fac t   tha t   the   project  helps 
sustain  a n   aerospace  indus try   tha t   has   suffered  grievously  from  layoffs 
is  a  point  lost  on  no  one.  And  then  too,  NASA   h a s   going  for   i t   the   fac t  
that,  both  in  Apollo  and   in   the  unmanned  programs,  i t   h a s   generally

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1973 

February  11 :   Rising  costs  of 
the   Skylab  missions  were  discussed  by  
Thomas  O’Toole  i n  a  Wash ing ton  Post  ar t ic le :   Nearly  $400 million  h ad  
been  added   to  cost  estimates  since  the  Skylab  program   had   or ig ina ted  
seven  years   ago.  Postponement  of  the   first  Skylab  launch  from  Apr i l   to 
May  had   added   $5  million  i n   overtime  costs  and   NASA  had   conceded 
ano ther   two-week delay  and   $5 million  i n   additional  costs  was  possible. 
Another  reason  fo r   skyrocketing  costs  was  the   post-Apollo  switch  of 
emphasis  f rom   the  moon  and   planets  to  the   ear th .   Skylab’s  original 
purpose   had   been  to  s tudy   the  sun   and   add i t ion   of  the  ear th   s tud ies  
program   on  Skylab  h ad   added   greatly  to  costs. 
Sky lab   was  the   flagship  of  the   U S .   manned   space  program.  It  was 
the   “most  impressive  mach ine   ever  built,”  weighing  90  metric  tons 
(100 U S .  tons)   and   prov id ing  living qua r te r s  equa l  to  a  three-bedroom 
house.  Scientists  saw Skylab as  the link between  the  first  decade  of  space 
exploration  and   the   198Os,  when  the   reusable  shuttle  would  become 
operational.  I t   would  provide  much  informa t ion   abou t   effects  on  the  
human   body  of  long   periods  i n   space.  The   last  of  three   Skylab  crews

serious  s ide   effects,  they  will  have  done  as  much  fo r   space  exploration 
as any  of  the  pioneers before  them.”  (O’Toole,  W  Post, A l )

NASA’s Pioneer  10   probe,  on   its  way  to   the   planet  Jupiter, 
safely  completed  its  crossing  of  the  Asteroid  Belt,  NASA  announced  a t   a 
Headquar ters   press  conference.  Launched  March  2,  1972,  the  space-

William  H.  K inard ,   Langley  Research  Center  scientist,  said  NA SA   was 
“firmly  convinced  tha t   the  Asteroid  belt  presents  little  hazard   to  fu tu r e  
spacecraft  go ing   out  to  explore  outer  planets.”  Pioneer  10  h ad   en-  
countered  an   average   of  one   large   particle  of  0.1-  to  1-mm   (0.004-  to 
0.04-in)  d ia   a  day  and   h ad   come  within  1640 million  km  (400 million

scopes  a n d   by  pressurized  cells  th a t   leaked  when  penetrated  by  a 
particle.  Pioneer  10  project  scientist  Dr.  John  H.  Wolfe  of  Ames 
Research  Center  sa id   the  asteroid  distribution  was  fairly  uniform. 
Pioneer  10 h ad   made  th e  most  distant  observations of  solar  atmosphere 
and   solar  wind  to  da te   a n d   had   found  th a t   the   sun’s  atmosphere  ex-

Dr.  James   C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator,  compared  the  NASA  FY  1974  
budge t   program   with  FY  1973 plans  i n   testimony  before  the   opening 
session  of  the   Senate  Committee  on  Aeronautical  and   Space   Sciences 
hear ings   on  the   FY  1974  NASA  au thor iza t ion :   “Last  year   Congress  ap- 
proved  $3.4  billion,  the  full amount  of  the  President’s  recommendations. 
In   presenting  the   budget  last  year,  I  was  able  to   s ta te   to  the  Congress 
tha t   the   p lann ing   associated  with  the   $3.4  billion  budget  request  was 
the   $3.4 billion  level,  . . . except  a s   necessary  to  meet  the   effects  of  in -  
configured  so  a s  not  to  requ i re  an   increase in   fu tu re  NASA  budgets  above 
flation,  or   unless  new  decisions  were  made   to   expand  the   program.” 
NASA  then  had   had   bb a  balanced  and   productive  program  which  d id   not 
inc lude   any   ‘built-in’  commitments  tha t   would  requ ire   a  h igher   total 
level  of  NASA  fund ing   i n   fu tu re   years.” 
NASA ’ s   FY  1974 budget  represented  a  change   in   th is   plan.  “To  meet 
the   necessary  constraints on  total  Government  spend ing  in   FY  1973 a n d

gram   objectives  were  generally  the  same,  “even  though  some  of  them 
will necessarily be  achieved  a t  la ter  dates.  For  this  reason,  NASA   budgets 
i n   fu ture   years  will  have  to  increase.  . .  . Th is   need  is  recognized  in 
the   preliminary  projections  for   FY  1975.”  NASA  was  “handling  the 
reductions  in   ou r   FY  1973   and   FY  197 4  budget  plans  in   a  way  tha t  
will  not  increase  the   levels  of  fu tu r e   fund ing   required  above  those

others-“are 
ones  tha t   have  been  presented  and   approved  in   previous 
years.”  NASA  had   ‘‘squeezed  a n d   stretched  the  program   about  a s  f a r   as  
we  can.  I n   some  of  the   reductions  we  have  made  in  FY  1973  and   FY 
1974   we  may  have  gone  too  far.  Any  fu r th e r   significant  reductions 
would  mean  a  real  loss  in   a  key  element  of  the  program.”

environmental  effects  had   been  made  in  1972  and   a  report  had   been 
filed  with  the   Environmental Protection  Agency.  T h e  shuttle’s  effect  on 
atmosphere,  water,  and   noise  would  be   “minimal  and   below  allowable

tist,  described  “ lunar   cataclysm.”  Luna r   dus t   brough t   back  by   Apollo 
as tronau ts  had   been  estimated  to  be  a s  old  a s  4.5  billion  yrs.  But  most 
luna r   rocks  were  less  than   4  billion  y r s   old  and   none  were  younger 
than   3  billion  yrs.  T h e   best  explanation  was  tha t   3.9  billion  y ~ s  ago 
the  moon  was  battered  and   bombarded  on  an   unprecedented  scale, 
crea t ing  so  much  heat  tha t   old  rocks were  destroyed  and   a  new  genera- 
tion  of  rocks was  created.  Since  then  the  moon  might  have  experienced 
minor  volcanic  erup t ions  bu t   no th ing   like  tha t   period  of  cataclysm. 
Some scientists  believed  the   moon  had   cooled  and   gone  into  a  period 
of  hibernation.  Dr.  Oliver A.  Schaeffer  of  the   State Univ.  of  New  York 
said  even  the  orange  soil  found   by  Apollo  17 astronauts had   turned   ou t  
to  be  3.71  billion  yrs   old,  an   age  disappointing  to  scientists  who  had  
believed  the  moon  had   been  formed  by  more  recent  volcanic  activity. 
Dr .   Keith  A.  Howard,  U S .   Geological  Survey  geologist,  compared 
the   luna r   landslide  found  nea r   the  ApoZlo  17  land ing   s i te   to  a  large, 
high-velocity avalanche on  ear th .   Dr .   Howard  suggested tha t   gas  within 
the   luna r   soil  had   been  released  du r ing   the   slide.  ApoZZo  17  samples 
would  be  searched  for   evidence  of  fluids. 
One   Apollo  17 instrument  placed  on  the  lunar   surface   had   made  an  
atom-by-atom search  f o r   evidence  of  lunar   atmosphere.  Although  the  
moon  had   no  atmosphere,  traces  of  argon,  neon,  and   helium  had   been 
found.  Dr .   John  H.  Hoffman,  associate  professor  of  physics  a t   the 
Univ.  of  Texas,  said  only  argon   appeared   to  have  been  generated  from  
the  moon’s  interior.  Neon  and   helium  apparen t ly   had   been  deposited 
by   the   solar  wind. 
Conference  attendees  unanimously  voted  to  congratulate  NASA  on 
completion  of  the  Apollo  program  by  send ing   a  letter  to   D r .   James   C. 
Fletcher,  NASA   Administrator:  The  conception,  design,  and   implementa- 
tion  of  lunar   exploration  represented  “an   ex traord inary   human   and  
technological  achievement.”  To  explore  ano ther   planet,  i t   had   been 
necessary  for  man  “ to   achieve  many  successive levels  of  technological 
capability  and   to  surpass  formidable  barr iers .   This  was  accomplished

the  Senate  Committee  on   Aeronautical  and   Space

Sciences  hear ings   on  the   FY  1974   NASA  authorization.  Among  effects 
of  space  and   aeronautics  on  “all  Americans  and ,   to  a  degree,  people 
throughout  the  world,  i n   1985,”  he  foresaw a  rise  in   a i r   cargo  revenues 
from   the  curren t   $1.6  billion  per  year  to  $14  billion  per  year,  with 
development  of  automated  hand l ing   and   compatible  aircraft.  T rade  
and   tourism  would  flourish  with  the   use  of  hypersonic  je t   a ircraf t ,  
“which  we  will  be  th ink ing   about  i n   1985  and   maybe  other  nations 
will  have  developed.”  Such  an   a ircraf t   could  fly  from   Washington  to

Dr.  Fletcher  said  NASA   could be   called  an   environmental agency.  “ I t  
is  not  ju s t   tha t   space  is  our   environment,  bu t   i t   is  ra ther   tha t   . . . 
virtually  everything  we  do,  manned  o r   unmanned,  science  o r   appli- 
cations,  helps  in   some  practical  way  to  improve  the  environment  of

tha t   is  ou r   essential  task,  to  study  and   understand  the  ea r th   and   i ts

The   House  Committee  on  Science  and   Astronautics’  Subcommittee  on  
Aeronautics  and   Space  Technology  opened  i ts   hear ings   on  the   FY 
1974  NASA  authorization.  Rep.  Ken  Hechler  (D-W.  Va.) , Committee 
Chairman,  said  the  Subcommittee  would  be   particularly  concerned 
with  “the  extent  of  progress  toward  the  enunciation  of  a  national 
aeronautics  and   aviation  policy.”  The   Subcommittee  had   been  partially 
responsible,  he  said,  f o r   the  reduction  of  emphasis  on  aeronautics  be- 
cause  i t   was  “not  aggressive  enough  in   its  insistence  tha t   more  em- 
phasis  be  placed  on  aeronautics  du r ing   . . . the  late  1950’s  when  the  
mendous  emphasis  on  space  tended  to  push  aeronautics  . . . in to   the 
Committee  was  first  established,  and   the   ear ly   1960’s when  the   tre-  
background.” 
Roy  P.  Jackson,  NASA  Associate  Administrator  fo r   Aeronautics  and  
Space Technology,  testified  tha t   reorientation  of  NASA’s space  a n d   aero- 
nautical  programs  to  meet  changing  national  goals had   been  completed 
“without  jeopardizing  the   continuing  development  of  a  broad  base  f o r  
new  knowledge, and   the  potential  for   meeting  fu ture ,   bu t   presently  un- 
seen,  needs.”  I n  the  OAST  aeronautics program   the  research  a n d  technol- 
ogy  base  took  pr ior i ty   over  experimental programs.  The   R&T  base  was 
“work  tha t   is  unparalleled  i n   the  U.S.  I t   is  the   da ta   base  f rom   which 
spr ings   new  ideas  fo r   development  i n   the  future.”  When  faced  with 
the  necessity  to  cu t   expenditures,  “we  had   to  consider  pr imar i ly   a  re- 
duction  i n  ou r  work  on  flight  experiments and   experimental programs.” 
Among  examples  of  meeting  fu ture   needs,  hydrogen  a s   a  long-term 
a i rc ra f t   fuel  for   the  distant  fu ture   was  a  “concept  of  potential  ma jor  
impor tance   to  the   reduction  of  a i r   pollution,  while  simultaneously  con- 
serving  ou r   increasingly  scarce  petroleum  reserves.”  Hydrogen  elimi- 
nated  hydrocarbon  pollution  and  was  “a  more   efficient  fuel,  bu t   the 
reduction  of  NO,  [oxides  of  nitrogen]  may  requ ire   additional  effort.” 
T h e  “earliest  likely  commercial  use  of  hydrogen  a s  an   a i rc ra f t  fue l  will 
be   abou t   15  to  20  years   hence.”  Hydrogen  was  “a   low-density,  cryo- 
genic  fuel  which  represents  problems  of  relatively  large,  insulated 
tanks,  the   need  f o r  materials  to  keep  the ir   s treng th   through  wide  tem-

the re   will  b e   some  complexities  to   solve  bu t   these  should  not  be   in-

George  W.  Cherry,  Deputy  Associate  Administrator  for  Programs   i n  
OAST,  described  the  status of  aeronautics programs  af ter   revisions neces- 
sitated  by  FY  1974  budget  restrictions.  The   General  Electric  Co.  quiet 
engine  contract  had  been  completed  and   both  engines  delivered  to 
NASA.  Engines  A  and   C  were  scheduled  fo r   extensive  in-house  research 
programs   a t   Lewis  Research  Center.  An  in-house  study  underway  a t  
LeRc  would  determine  the  technical  value  of  ano ther   contracted  effort, 
for  a  second-generation  quiet  engine.  “ In   the  meantime,  we  a r e  work- 
ing   to  generate  component  noise  design  and   performance  data,  so 
tha t   a  significant  noise  reduction  below  tha t   demonstrated  by  the  first 
Quiet  Engine  can  be  obtained  in  any  fu ture   engine  program.  No   im- 
portant  area   in  aeronautical  propulsion  has   been  terminated,  although 
fund ing   levels  f o r   certain  portions  of  the  aeronautics  programs  have 
been  readjusted  based  on   a  review  of  priorities.  T h e   F-8  high-speed 
supercritical  wing  verification  project  was  not  cut  back  o r   terminated. 
Dur ing   FY  1973,  the  project  was  completed  according  to  plan.  Th e  
results  were  very  encouraging  and   gave  confidence  as  to  wind-tunnel 
test  results  a t   transonic  speeds.”  A  follow-on  to  the  F-8  was  under  
study.  Depending  upon  results,  a  follow-on  F-8 
flight-test  program  
might  be  undertaken  in   FY  1975.  (Transcr ip t)

Science  and   Astronautics  continued  hear ings   on  NASA’s FY  197 4  
authorization. Dale D.  Myers,  NASA   Associate Administrator  for Manned 
Space  Flight,  identified  locations  for  space  shuttle  development:  Ken- 
nedy  Space  Center  and  Vandenberg  A i r   Force  Base,  Calif.,  a s   the 
launch  and   land ing   sites;  NASA’s Michoud  Assembly  Facility  fo r   the 
external  tank  production;  and   the  Rockwell  International  Corp.  facility 
a t   Downey,  Calif.,  fo r   orb i ter   and   systems  integration.  “The  ma jor  
unknown,  a t   the  moment,  is   where  the  solid  rocket  boosters  will  b e  
produced  and  tested. We expect tha t   this location  will  b e  identified when 
the  solid  fueled  rocket  booster  contract  is   awarded  th is   November.” 
Ph i l ip   E.  Culbertson,  Director  of  Mission  and   Payload  Integration 
in   OMSF,  contrasted  a  typical  operational  communications  satellite pro-  
gram  using  expendable launch  vehicles  with  one using  the  space shuttle. 
Launched on  the  T i tan   IIIB-Cen taur  launch  vehicle, each spacecraft was 
estimated  a t   467  kg   (1030  Ibs) . To   fulfill  1979-1990  requirements  fo r  
reliable  communications  services,  26  spacecraft would  be  required.  Use 
of  the  T i t an   IIIB-Cen taur   would  requ ire   26  new  spacecraft  and   26 
new  launch vehicles,  a t  a n   average  cost  for   each  flight  of  $25.8  million. 
“If  the  same  program  is  carr ied   out  using  the  Shuttle  and   Tug,  the  
cost  changes  significantly.  First,  with  the   Shuttle  we  can  apply  the 
low  cost  approaches  to  payload  design.  We  a r e  no   longer  constrained 
b y   weight  limitations ;  therefore,  we  can   ruggedize  th e   spacecraft 
structure,  simplify  th e   design  and   verification  test  program,  and   thus 
reduce  both  development  and   un i t   spacecraft  cost.”  Th e   shuttle  a n d

An  analysis  and   wind-tunnel  test  program   would  investigate  the 
sources  and   the  reduction  of  a irframe   noise.  “Recent  studies  and   flight 
tests  have  indicated  tha t   a s  we  continue  to  reduce  engine  source noise, 
i t   may  also  be  necessary  . . . to  treat  a irframe   noise.”  Fur ther   testing 
of  a irframe   shielding  and   analyses  would  determine  the   operational 
and   economic  feasibility  of  new  concepts  like  the  yawed-wing,  low-

The   House  Committee  on  Science  and   Astronautics’  Subcommittee  011 
Aeronautics  and   Space  Technology continued  hearings  on  the  FY  19743 
NASA  authorization. 
George W.  Cherry,  Deputy  Associate Administrator  for  Programs   in  
the  NASA  Office  of  Aeronautics  and   Space  Technology,  described  the 
Dept.  of  Transportation  Climatic-Impact Assessment  Program   ( C IA P )  , 
in   which  NASA  was  cooperating:  The   C IAP   “undertakes  to  assess  the 
potential  impact  on  the  atmosphere  of  large   fleets  of  SSTS  [supersonic 
transpor ts]   opera t ing   in   the  eighties  and   the   biological  consequences 
of  the ir   potential  modification  of  the   stratosphere.  We  a re   cooperating 
with  DOT   by  con tr ibu t ing   to  the   technology  needs  of  C IAP ,   with  par t ic-  
u lar   emphasis on  the   levels  to  which  pollution  can  be  limited.”  Contra- 
dictory  requirements  fo r   civil  transpor t   a ircraf t   (low-fuel consumption 
engines  required  by   SSTS  f o r   good  range  a n d   payload  characteristics, 
tended  to  be  extremely  noisy  i n   terminal  a rea s )   might  be   best  met 
by   variable-cycle engines  tha t   varied  the ir   mode  of  operation  in   each 
condition  of  the   flight  profile.  NASA  would  “intensively  study  variable 
cycle-engine  concepts  in   FY  1974.” 
Dr.  Seymour  C.  Himmel,  Deputy  Associate Administrator  fo r   Teeh- 
nology  in   OAST,  testified  tha t   hypersonic  research  fo r   potential  app l i-  
cation  to  military  and   civil  a irbrea th ing   cruise  vehicles  was  directed 
a t   “the  critical  aspects  of  propulsion,  structures,  and   aerodynamics 
for   th i s   flight  regime  where  hydrogen  is  used  both  a s   the   fuel  and   a s  
a  coolant.”  Hydrogen  was  the  most  likely  cand ida te   f o r   hypersonic  a i r -  
c r a f t  fue l  because  i t s   h igh   coolant  capacity  was  essential  f o r   a  propul- 
sion  system to  survive  i n   the   h igh- tempera ture  environment,  and   liquid 
hydrogen’s  coolant  capacity  could  cool  portions  of  the   vehicle’s  s truc-  
ture   away  from   the   engine  area.  NASA’S  s truc tures   a n d   materials  pro-  
gram   provided  essential  technology  f o r   designing  lightweight,  reliable, 
actively  cooled  s truc tures  and   advanced  the   technology of  actively  cool- 
i n g  s truc tures  heated  to  h igh   temperatures.  T h e  program   also  extended 
shuttle  technology  on  reusable  surface   insulation  toward  hypersonic 
cruise  application. 
Flight  Research  Center  test  pilot  Gary  E.  K r ie r   testified  on  NASA’s 
digital  fly-by-wire  program  to  develop  a n   all-electric  flight-control 
system  using  intelligence  inserted  into  the   digital  computer  memory. 
“We  d id   this  by  using  refurbished  Apollo  equipment  and   two  surp lus  
[Navy]  F-8  fighters.  Using  this  approach,  we  estimate  we  flew  abou t  
2  years  ear l ier   than   we  otherwise could have.’’  To   date, NASA  had   flown 
15  DFBW  flights  with  no  ma jor   problems.  “Airliners  tha t   we’ll  r ide   i n  
t h e   1980’s  could  profit  f rom   fly-by-wire i n   t h e   fo rm   of  smooth  flight 
a t   very  high  speeds  a n d   the   near   elimination  of  the   response  to  tu r -  
bulence  by   computer  application  of  smoothing  controls.”  The   “best 
use  of  FBW”  was  to  build  a  control-configured  vehicle  [CCV]  with 
reduced  drag,  increased  lift,  and   slower  approach   and   land ing   speeds. 
“ I t   h a s   been  estimated  tha t   land ing   speed  could  be  cu t   by   25   percent

ration  f o r  a n  ear th-orb i ta l  shuttle and   tha t   the  shuttle  design would  per- 
m i t   the  total  development  cost  to  stay  within  $5.15  billion  a n d   the  
per-flight operational  cost  within  $10.5  million.  Success in   meeting  th i s  
cost  was  “particularly  sensitive”  to  the  cost  of  the   hydrogen-oxygen 
tanks  and   an   acceptable  recoverable  and   refurbishment  cost  of  the  
solid-fueled  rocket  boosters.  Space   tug   development  was  “of  key  im- 
portance  to  gaining  full  utility  of  the  space  shuttle.”  Development  of 
the  full  benefits  of  nea r   space  in   . . . scientific  exploration,  practical

had   been  used  fo r   the   successful launchings  of  seven  satellites  bu t   the 
rema inder  had   been  spent on  an   expensive a n d  yet  unsuccessful booster. 
Interest  in   the  booster  had   dissipated  despite  the  French  desire  to  con-

converted  from  prepar ing   technology  to   assisting  in  development.  With 
this  transition,  “we  have  reduced  in  fiscal  year  1973,  and   will  fur ther  
reduce  in   fiscal  year  1974,  our   rate  of  Shuttle-oriented resource  invest- 
ments,”  bu t   wind  tunnels  and   arc   je ts   would  play  a  key  role  i n   shuttle 
development. Aerodynamic  and   heat-transfer  investigations  a t   subsonic 
through   hypersonic  speeds  in   simulated  shuttle  ascent  would  focus 
on  effects  of  the   rocket  plume  and  separation  of  rocket  engines. Wind- 
tunnel  and   structural  laboratory  vibration  tests  of  scale  models  would 
provide  vehicle  dynamic-response  characteristics.  Additional  tests  i n  
h igh- tempera ture   wind  tunnels  would  determine  structural  behavior 
and   integrity  of  therma l   protection  systems  a n d   supporting  s truc ture

revolution  brought  about  by   Apollo on  the  Moon  with  the   simultaneous 
revolution  brought  abou t  by   new  insight into  the  origins of  ocean  basins 
and   continents  on  the   Ear th ,   w e   may  begin  to  understand  the   great 
stresses and  s tra ins  within  ou r  crust a s  ocean  floors  grow  and   continents

Within  fu ture  unders tand ing  of  the  frozen  ocean  of  basalt  of  [Oceanus] 
Procellarum  and   the  vast  r idge   and   volcanic  system  tha t   splits  it,  may 
lie  the  simplification  of  thought  about  past  events  tha t   leads  to  the   ex- 
pansion  of  thoughts  about  present  events.  I  will  be   the  first  to  adm i t  
tha t   these  last  comments  give  free  run   to  the   imagination.  However, 
knowledge  never  becomes  a  resource  until  i t   i s  marr ied   to  imagination. 
I t   is  thus   . . . tha t   the   scientific  legacy  of  Apollo  will  be   realized.” 
Dr .   Rocco  A .   Petrone,  Marshall  Space   Flight  Center  Director  and  
former  Apollo P rog ram  Director, reported  the s ta tus  of  the  five scientific 
stations  deployed  on  the  moon  du r ing   the   Apollo  program :   The   first 
station  deployed  by   Apo l lo   12, in   November  1969,  “is  still  functioning 
over  3  years af ter   i ts  in i t ia l  deployment  in   the  very  demand ing  environ-

rigors of  temperature  and  vacuum  . . . and  still function , . . demonstrates 
one   facet  of  the  technology  we  have  developed.”  All  five  stations were 
still  functioning,  though  some  of  the  experiments  had   been  lost.  The

“And  yet we  have  had   i t  over  3  years  . . . and   the  seismometers worked 
beautifully  all  3  years.”  The   superthermal  ion  detector  was  “working 
beautifully and   had   fo r   3  years,  night  and   day.”  NASA   had   “five  seismic

‘decade  i n   space.’  Much  ha s  been  learned  abou t   the   effects  of  the  space 
flight  environment  upon  man.  We  have  found  tha t   some  body  systems 
respond  to  space  flight  fac tors   . . . with  changes  . . . observable  i n   the 
period  immediately  following  space  flight.  Occasionally  changes  have 
been  noticeable  du r ing   the   inflight  period  of  the   mission.  None  of 
these  changes  ha s  been  of  such  a  severity  as  to  cause  any   real  concern 
fo r  man’s  safety  in   space,  bu t   all  changes a r e   . . . being  watched  closely 
lest  they  have  implications for   long  dura t ion   flight.”  Cardiovascular  re- 
sponses which  showed the  greatest  changes also  appeared  most  amenable 
to   regulation  by   inflight  countermeasures,  such  a s  lower  body  negative 
pressure.  Medication  h ad   not  proved  of  value  in   trea t ing   e i ther   the  
cardiovascular deconditioning  o r   the   loss  of  exercise  capacity.  Counter- 
measures  were  also  be ing   investigated  for  the  small  bone  density  losses 
noted.  A  decrease  i n  hea r t   size had   been  noted  i n  both  U S .  and   Soviet 
space  crewmen  and   some  Soviet  crewmen  had   experienced  postflight 
muscular  difficulties.  “Both  astronauts  and   cosmonauts  have  also  re-  
ported  sensations  resembling  sea  sickness  du r ing   spaceflight.  On  the  
whole,  however,  U S .  as tronau ts  do not  appea r   to  be  excessively  plagued 
by   motion  sickness  symptoms.  The   growth  of  opportunistic  micro- 
organisms  appears   to  be   favored  i n   the   space  environment.”  (T ran -

*  D r .   James  C.  Fletcher,  NA SA   Administrator,  with  other  N A S A   officials, 
testified  on  the  FY  1974  NASA   authorization  request  i n   hearings  before 
the  House  Committee  on  Science  and   Astronautics. 
Dr.  Fletcher  pointed  out  tha t   the  NA SA   request  of  $3.016  billion  was 
down  $400  million  from  FY  1973  bu t   said  the  agency  program  was 
significant.  In   1972  NA SA   had  completed  the  transition  from  manned 
exploration  to  a   focus  on   practical  benefits,  unmanned  exploration, 
and   development  of  the  space  shuttle  “as  the  means  to  make  more 
practical  and   more  economical  all  fu tu re   uses  of  space,  unmanned 
and   manned,  especially  for  applications  of  economic,  commercial,  in-  
ternational,  or  national  security  significance.”  Work  on  uses  of  the 
shuttle was  “reinforcing  ou r  view  that  the  Space  Shuttle  system  will  not 
only  provide  the  launch  capability  needed  for  fu tu re   space  activities 
of  all  types  but  will  revolutionize  the  ways  in  which  space  is   used  a s  
well.  The   more  the  specialists  in   various  fields  look  at  the  shuttle’s 
capabilities,  especially  in   the  sortie  mode,  the  more  they  see  how  i ts  
weight  and   volume  capacity  and   flexible  operations  will  permit  them 
to  ca r ry   out  experiments  and   useful  applications  in   a  much  simpler 
and   economical  manner.” 
Assistant  Administrator  fo r   Institutional  Management  Joseph  F. 
Malaga  testified  that  NASA  Hq .   would  have  1581 permanent  positions 
in   FY  174 after  agency  reduction  in   force,  o r   6.3%  of  the  total  NASA  
Civil  Service  employment.  “This  is  down  600  positions  from  the  1968 
peak,  when  i t   represented  6.7  percent  of  the  NA SA   total.  Headquarters 
has  thus  kept  its  size  consonant  with  agency  size.” 
NASA’s policy  on  disposition  of  manpower  and   equipment  necessi- 
tated  b y   FY  1974 budget  cuts  was  described  by   Richard  C.  McCurdy, 
Associate  Administrator  fo r   Organization  and   Management,  in  a  pre- 
pared  statement:  “We  a r e  already  well  into  the  organization  and  opera- 
tion  of  a  comprehensive  program  to  identify  specific  employee  prefer- 
ences  and   abilities  and   corresponding  suitable  potential  employers.  We  
have  set u p  t ra in ing  fo r   staff  members  in  ga the r ing  job  information  and  
in   counseling  employees,  and   have  arranged   fo r   a  coordinated  flow  of 
information  about  job  openings  throughout  NA SA ,   and   other  Federal 
agencies,  state  and   local  government  units,  educational  institutions  and  
private  industry.  . . . But  even  more  basic  . . . is   ou r   recognition  tha t  
these  people  represent  a  virtually  irreplaceable  national  resource.”  H e  
referred  not  only  to  “this  highly  talented  and   trained  professional- 
technical  work  force  bu t   also  to  the  complex  of  sophisticated  plant  and  
equipment which  must be partially  idled.  . . . I t  would  be  unconscionable 
to  permit  key  elements  of  America’s  aeronautics  and   space  capability 
to  be   disbanded  or  retired  without  mak ing   every  effort  to   keep  them 
available  for  fu r the r   service  to  the  nation.” 
Dr .   George  M.  Low,  NASA   Deputy  Administrator,  testified  on  “prac- 
tical  returns  from  ou r   space  investment,”  including  the  work  of  N A S A  
Applications  Teams  i n   the   technology  utilization  program.  Teams  as-

of  the   Senate  Committee  on  Aeronautical  and   Space  Sciences  on  NASA’s 
FY  1974  au thor iza t ion :  “The  objective of  the  engine  refan   program   . . . 
a t   Lewis  Research  Center  is  to  demonstrate  the   feasibility  and   cost  of 
significantly reducing  the   noise  of  curren t   civil  fleet  engines.  The  JTSD, 
which  powers  the   Boeing  727   and   737   and   the   McDonnell  Douglas 
DC-9,  will  continue  i n   extensive  civil  fleet  use  well  into  the   1980’s. The  
first  JTSD  refanned  engine  ground   test  is  scheduled  fo r   Janua ry   1974.” 
Flight tests would  occur  i n  FY  1975. Analysis  of  benefits  from  refann ing  
indicated  tha t   approximately  50%  greater  community  noise  improve- 
ment  could  be   gained  f rom   a  fleet-wide JT8D  refan  retrofit  than   from  
a  fleet-wide  JT3D  refan   retrofit.  The   JT3D  powered  the  four-engine 
Boeing  707   and   Douglas  DC-8.  “Th is   analysis  resulted  in   the  decision 
i n   Janua ry   to  concentrate, within  available  resources,  on  the   JT8D  and  
to  de fe r  work  on  the   JT3D.”  NASA’s experimental  qu ie t  engine  program  
h ad   achieved  i t s  ma jo r   goals  du r ing   FY  1973  and   would  be  continued 
in   FY  1974.  “Altitude  performance  tests  . . . will  s ta r t   soon  in   the

Chiefs  of  Staff,  delivered  the  report  United  States  Military  Posture  f o r  
FY  1974  to  the   Sena te  Committee  on Appropriations’  Subcommittee on 
Defense  Appropr ia t ions :   Strategic  par i ty   existed  between  the   U.S.  and  
the  U.S.S.R.  “While  the   Soviet  Union  ha s   a  substantial  advantage,  not 
only  in   the  numbers  of  strategic  missiles,  bu t   also  i n   missile  throw- 
weight,  the  United  S ta tes  still  has  a  substantial advantage  in   o ther   a rea s  
of  key  importance  to  the  overall  strategic  balance-e.g.,  missile  ac-  
curacy, M I R V S   [multiple independently  targetable  reentry  vehicles],  sub-  
mar ine  quietness,  sonars, and   numbers  of  bombers and  bomber  payload. 
And,  while  the  Soviet  Union  ha s   enormous  advan tage   in   a i r   defense, 
without  a n   extensive  ABM   (antiballistic missile]  defense  . . . the  a i r   de- 
fense  could  be  substantially  undercut  by   ballistic  missile  attack,  pa r -  
ticularly  . . . a large  number  of  M IRV S . ”   The  U.S.  advantages were  trans-  
itory,  resting  on  a  “technological  lead  that  has   been  steadily  narrow ing  
over  the   past  decade.”  W i th   the   momentum  of  the   Soviet  offensive  re-  
search   and   development  program,  “we  cannot  preclude  the   possibility 
tha t   ou r   technological  lead  in   this  area   may  fur ther   diminish  o r   disap- 
pear   altogether du r ing  the  current  decade.”  Adm.  Moorer  believed  “ tha t  
the   Soviet  Union  will  soon  succeed  in   i ts   efforts  to  develop  an   effective 
M IRV   system  for   i t s   strategic  missiles.  Thus,  the  Soviet  Union  may  be  
ab le  to   challenge  ou r   lead  in   both  missile  guidance  and   MIRVS  . . . , and  
thereby  pose  a  significant  threat  to  ou r  Minuteman  force.”  (Tex t )

A p r i l   5-26:   NASA’s Pioneer  11  (P ionee r -G ) ,   second  Jup i te r   probe,  was 
successfully  launched  into  a n   excellent  trajectory  from   Eastern  Test 
Range   a t   9 : 1 1   pm  EST  by  a  three-stage  Atlas-Centaur-TE-M-364-4 
launch  vehicle.  Eighteen  hundred   persons  watched  the   nighttime  launch 
a f te r   tour ing   the  Kennedy  Space  Center  Flight  T ra in ing   and   Vehicle 
Assembly  Buildings,  where  Skylab  was  be ing   prepared   fo r   a  mid-May 
launch. 
Pioneer  11  sped  away  from   ear th   a t   a  velocity  of  51 80 0  km  per  h r  
(32  200   mph ) ,   equa l ing   the  speed  of  Pioneer  10  ( launched  March  2, 
1972,  and   still  head ing   toward  Jup i t e r ) ,   which  flew  faster  than   any  
previous  man-made  object.  The   p r ima ry   objective  was  to  obtain  pre-  
cursory   scientific  information  beyond  the  Mars   orb i t   with  emphasis 
on  investigation  of 
the   in terp lane tary   medium  du r ing   the   609-   to 
825-day   journey,  th e   Asteroid  Belt,  and   Jup i ter   and   i ts   environment. 
The  secondary objective was to advance the  technology for  long-duration 
flights  to  the   ou ter   planets. 
The   259-kg   (570 - lb )   spin-stabilized  spacecraft  carr ied   12   scientific 
exper imen ts   to   measure   magnetic  fields,  plasma,  cosmic  rays  and  
charged   particles;  the  electromagnetic  rad ia t ion   in   the  ultraviolet,  visi- 
ble,  and   infrared   ranges ; and  the  asteroid-meteoroid population.  Du r ing  
the   encounter  tra jec tory   with  Jup i ter ,   the   spacecraft  would  provide  the 
best  possible  information  on  the  rad ia t ion   environment,  provide  good 
viewing  conditions  of  Jup i ter   before  periapses,  and   obtain  a  shor t  
occultation  of  the   spacecraft  by  Jupiter. 
The   spacecraft  also  carr ied   a  pictorial  plaque  identical  to  the  one 
carr ied   on  Pioneer  10  f o r   identification  of  i t s   or ig in   by   any   possible 
intelligent  beings  of  ano ther   solar  system. 
S ix  hou r s   following  launch  the   large   number   of  thrus ter   pulses  used 
to  precess  the  spacecraf t  and   point  the  an tenna   toward  the  sun  provided 
the   impulse  to  deploy  fully  one   of  the  two  radioisotope  thermoelectric 
generators  tha t   had   failed  to  deploy  completely  a t   first.  The   mag- 
netometer  boom  was  deployed  and   the   spin  ra te   stabilized  a t   5.4  rpm .  
On  Apr i l   6 four   science  instruments-the 
helium  vector  magnetometer, 
charged   particles  experiment,  geiger  tube   telescope,  and   meteoroid, 
detector-were 
turned   on. 
An   Apr i l   11 midcourse  correction moved  the  targe t   point  a t   Jup i ter  
f rom   slightly  ahead   of  the   planet  as  it  moved  on   i ts   orb i t ,   and   above 
the  equa tor ia l  plane,  to  slightly  beh ind  the  planet  and  below the  equa tor .  
T h e   ad jus ted   course  would  allow  several  mission  choices:  to   make   a n  
equa tor ia l   pass  e i ther   close  to  o r   d is tan t   from   the   p lane t   to  inspect

The   dismantling  of  the  Federal  fellowship program  would  l iqu ida te   some

a  T h e   April  6  announcement  of  th e   discovery  of  a  distant  quasar  h ad  
strengthened  the  growing  theory  among astronomers  tha t   they  had   seen 
the   edge  of  the  universe,  Walter  Sullivan  said  in  the  N e w   Yo rk  Times. 
Th e   implication  was  that,  as   Einstein  believed,  the  universe  was  finite. 
“Beyond  i ts   expand ing   volume,  .  . .  nothing  exists--not  even  space, 
because,  in   this  concept,  over  such  great  distances  space  curves  back 
upon  itself.”  By  determining  the  ra te   a t   which  a  quasar   was  flying 
away  from   the  earth,  astronomers  could  estimate  its  distance  in   terms 
of  the  time  its  light  had   traveled  to  the   earth.  The   universe  appeared 
t o   have  originated  in   a  “b ig   bang”  some  13  billion  yrs   ago,  and   the 
earliest  quasars   should  be  visible  f a r   enough  away  fo r   the ir   light  to 
have  been  traveling  earthward  f o r   tha t   long.  “But  looking  across  vast 
can  see  out  only  to  12 
distances-and 
hence,  f a r   back  into  time-man 
billion  years   ( i n  the  most  distant  quasars)  .” Hale  Observatory  astrono- 
mer   Dr.  Alan  R.  Sandage   had   sa id   tha t   in   these  quasars   astronomers 
were  seeing  “ the   edge  of  the  world.”  Astronomers  had  long  suspected 
the   existence of  some  sort  of  wall  preventing  them  from  seeing  quasars  
i n   the   region  beyond  12  billion  yrs.  “Now  i t   is   beginning  to  look  a s  
though  the  ‘wall’  is real.”  (NYT, 4/8/73,  63 )

Ap r i l   20-30: 
Canadian  domestic  communications  satellite  Telesat-B-- 
named  An ik   2,  Eskimo  for   brother-was 
successfully launched  a t   6 :47  
pm  EST from  Eastern  Test  Range  by  a  three-stage,  long-tank,  thrus t-  
augumented  Thor-Delta launch   vehicle.  An ik   2  was  placed  in   a  highly 
elliptical  transfer   orb i t  with  a  36 480-km  ( 2 2  667.6-mi)  apogee, 212-km 
(131.7-mi)  perigee,  and  a 26.7"  inclination.  After  checkout and  reorien- 
tation  of  the   spacecraft,  the  apogee  motor  was  fired  a t   5:OO  pm  EST 
April  23,  br ing ing   the  spacecraft  in to   near  synchronous  circular  orb i t  
with  a  35 709-km  ( 2 2  188.5-mi)  apogee,  3 5  604-km  (22  123.3-mi) 
perigee,  1430.7-min  period,  and   0.1' 
inclination.  The  spacecraft  was 
dr if t ing   3"  per   day   toward  i ts   final  operational  position  off  the  west 
coast  of  South  America. 
Under  NASA-Telesat  Canada  contract,  the  NASA  mission  objective was 
to place An ik  2 in to  an  orb i t  of  sufficient accuracy to  allow the  spacecraft 
propulsion  systems  to  place  i t   in  a  s ta t ionary   synchronous  orb i t   while 
re ta in ing   sufficient  stationkeeping  propulsion  to   meet  the  mission  life- 
time requirements. The  objective was  met  and  the  mission was  ad judged  
a  success April  30. 
An ik   2-second 
in   a  series  of  Canadian  domestic  communications 
satellites-was  built  by   Hughes Aircraft  Co.  under   contract with  Telesat 
Canada  and   designed  to  provide  transmission  of  TV,  voice,  and   d a t a  
throughout  Canada   for   seven years.  The   spacecraft  system  provided  1 2  
channels  of  communications  to  relay  10  color  TV   channels  or   up   to 
9600  telephone  circuits.  Two  channels  would  be   protection  channels f o r  
the  1 0  traffic-carrying  channels. 
The   spacecraft  was  1.8 m  in   diameter  and   3.4  m  h igh   (6  by  11 f t ) .  
At  launch  i t   weighed  540  k g   (1200   lbs)  and   i ts   orb i t ing   weight  was 
270  k g   (600   lbs)  . The   electronics  system was  powered  by   2 3  000  solar 
cells with  sufficient onboard  battery  capacity  to  ma in ta in   service  du r ing  
a  sun   eclipse  of  the   solar  cells. 
An ik   I  had   been  launched  Nov.  9,  1972.  The   two-satellite  system 
would  ac t  a s  space repeaters  to  receive  transmissions from   ea r th  stations 
and   retransmitt  them  to  ea r th   stations  in   Canada.  A  th ird   satellite  was

0  Exclusive  astronaut writing  contracts with  L i fe   magazine  and   other media 
had   harmed  the  press,  the  public  interest,  the  space  program,  a n d   the 
astronauts  themselves,  Robert  Sherrod   said  in  a  Columbia  Journalism 
Review  article released  in  advance of  i ts  May/June  publication  date. Th e  
contracts had   brought  relatively  little  money  to  all  but  a  few  astronauts 
and   had   distorted  the ir   individuality  and   diversity  into  a  “deodorized, 
plasticized,  and   homogenized”  image.  Under  the  contract  system,  NASA 
could  censor  whatever  the  astronauts  signed.  “Even  though  th i s  censor- 
sh ip   was  rarely  invoked,  i t   was  inh ib i t ing ;   so  was  the  necessity  of 
Life’s  making  the  astronauts  look  good,  and   vice  versa.”  President

Sa lyu t  2 had   begun  tumbling  i n  orb i t  when  a  maneuvering  engine  fired 
and   then  kept  firing  out  of  control.  The   firing  had   forced  Salyut  2

I t  was  “puzzling,”  a Washington  S tar   and  Daily  News  editorial  said,  “ tha t  
Soviet leaders  remain  so  secretive  about  the ir   space problems, when  the  
general  na ture   of  a  mishap  cannot  be  hidden  from  modem  track ing  
equipment  and   more  openness  could  lead  to  a  shar ing   of  corrective 
knowledge. The   Russian  announcement  tha t   the  last  Salyut  had   merely 
completed its mission  .  . . fooled  no   one.  Greater  frankness,  certainly, 
will  be   needed  in   the  joint  mission  [ U S . - U S S R .   Apollo-Soyuz Test 
Pro jec t]   requ ir ing   the  confidence  of  each  country’s  experts  in   the 
other’s  equ ipmen t   and   ability.”  (W  Star  & News,  5/9/73,  A23)  
May   10: 
Skylab  1,  scheduled  for   launch  May  14,  would  ca r ry   950   k g  
(2100  lb s )   of  food,  including  lobster  newburg,  prime  r ibs   of  beef,  filet 
mignon,  asparagus, strawberries, and  af ter  d inner  mints, the Wash ing ton  
Post  quoted  Dr .   Malcolm  C.  Smith,  Chief  of  Food  and   Nutrition  a t  
Johnson Space Center, as saying. Each  Skylab mission would  ca r ry  more 
than   70   different  foods  prepared   b y   an   automatic  meal-reconstitution 
module.  Semisolid food  could  be  eaten  out  of  the   can  with  a  fork  and  
spoon  and   prevented  from  flying  around  in  the  weightless environment 
by  a  polyethylene membrane. Beverages could be  consumed one  swallow 
a t   a  time  from  a  multichambered  bellowslike  canister.  Previously,  as- 
tronau ts   had   to  dr ink   the  en t i re   beverage  a t   one  time  once  the   valve 
was  opened.  Fru i t   juices  were  fortified  with  potassium  gluconate  to  re- 
place the  potassium lost  in  weightlessness. The  use of  alcoholic beverages 
had   been  rejected  because  of  medical  drawbacks  and   public  opinion. 
The   astronauts  arranged   the ir   own  meals with  the  correct  combinations 
of  nu tr ien ts   and   calories.  Frozen  foods would  b e   used  the   first  time  in  
the  U S .   space  program.  The   cost  of  the  Skylab  food  was  $26.35  per  
man  per   day.  Twenty  percent  more  food  than   required  would  be  ca r -  
ried.  There   would  also  be   a  rescue  food  supply  of  16  days   fo r   three 
men.  (Ross,  W  Post,  5/10/73,  E l )  
The   Senate  passed  S.  70,  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  1973,  establishing  a 
Council  on  Energy  Policy  to  coordinate  energy  activities  and   recom- 
mend  policy. 
The  Senate also passed S. 373,  to  limit  presidential power  to  impound 
appropr ia ted   funds.  ( C R ,  5/10/73,  S8809-10,  8828-55)

astronauts’  physical  conditions.  (Wilford,  N Y T ,   5/12/73,  58) 
9  Objectives of  Skylab‘s scientific and  engineering experiments were outlined 
in   a  Kennedy  Space  Center  press  briefing.  The  57   ma jor   experiment 
components  aboard   the   space  station  scheduled  for   May  14  launch 
would  provide  da ta   for   270  investigations  in   ear th   resources,  solar 
astronomy,  and   materials  science by   702  investigators  and   associates- 
200  of  them  foreign.  Dr.  Edward  J .   McLaughlin,  NASA   Director  for  
Space Medicine, said 20  life sciences experiments would  provide “a  com- 
prehensive picture  of  the  interactions of  man  with  h is  environment and  
of  various  body  systems tha t   are   influenced  . . . by   the  space  environ- 
ment.”  They  would  deal  primarily  with  the   metabolic  and   cardiovascu- 
la r   systems, exercise capacity,  and nutrition. 
Dr.  Goetz  K.  Oertel,  NASA  Chief  of  Solar  Physics,  said  the   objective 
of  Skylab astronomy was “the  study  of  the  stars,  including the   sun,  and  
o ther   objects  in   space  such  as  planets,\ comets,  objects  and   l ibra t ion  
points near   the moon,  and   x-ray objects in   the  sky.”  Emphasis would  be 
placed  on  the  study  of  solar  activity  known  to  influence general weather 
pa t terns   and   on  solar  flares,  responsible for  rad io   communication black- 
ou ts   and   interference.  Skylab  was  unique  in  tha t   i t   would  b e   manned. 
The   astronaut  would  be   able  to  align  the  instruments  and   select  targets 
of  interest,  taking  advantage  of  phenomena  a s  i t   occurred. 
Dr.  Robert  A.  Parker ,   astronaut  a n d   Skylab  program  scientist,  said 
tha t   corollary  experiments  would  study  gas  and   particles  surround ing  
the  Skylab and  the ir  effect on  sensitive instruments,  collect micrometeor- 
oids,  study  man-made  disturbances  in   Skylab  and   the ir   effect  on  in-  
strument  alignment,  a n d   study  flammable materials  and  manufacturing 
techniques  i n   the  zero-g  environment.  (Transcr ip t)

M u y  14-24: 
Skylab  1 (SL-1)  was launched on  time a t   1 :30 pm  EDT

s tage   Sa tu rn   V  launch  vehicle  a f te r   a  nominal  countdown.  Liftoff  was 
witnessed by  U S .   and   foreign TV  viewers a n d  by  an   estimated  500 000 
persons  a t   KSC ,   including  U S .   and   foreign  dignitaries  and   26   former  
prisoners  of  war   invited  by   NASA.  The   Skylab  2  crew-Astronauts 
Charles  Conrad,  Jr.  (commande r ) ,   Pau l   J.  Weitz  ( p i l o t ) ,   and   Dr. 
Joseph P. Kerwin  (science pilot) -watched 
the launch  from  quaran t ine .  
Skylab’s  Sa tu rn   Workshop  ( SWS)  cluster  launched  toward  ea r th  
orb i t   included  the  Orbital  Workshop  (OW S )   with  i ts   Apollo  Telescope 
Mount  (A TM )   , airlock  module  ( A M ) ,   multiple  docking  adap ter   (M D A ) ,  
and   instrument un i t   ( I U )  . 
At  6 3  sec  in to   the  mission, indication was  received  tha t   the meteoroid 
shield had   deployed prematurely. The  Workshop  was  placed  in  nominal, 
circular  orb i t   with  438.2-km  (272.2-mi)  altitude,  93-min  period,  50” 
inclination,  and   7649.4-m-per-sec  ( 2 5  096.6-fps)  orbital  velocity.  The  
payload  shroud was jettisoned  on  time  at  1 5  min  and   25  sec af ter  launch 
and   the  ATM   deployed  a t   2 1  min  3 4  sec with  normal  deployment of  the  
ATM   solar  a r ray s   a t   26   rnin  38  sec,  bu t   ground  controllers  received  no 
indication  tha t   the  Workshop  solar  a r ray   system  ( S A S ) ,   which  was  to 
have  been  released  by  an   onboard  computer,  had   been  deployed. 
At  41 min,  a  ground  command  was  sent to  deploy the   two SAS  wings. 
They  did  not  respond.  The   command  was  sent  aga in   30   min  la ter   and  
a  th ird   time  near   the  end  of  the  first  orbit,  without  result.  Du r ing   the  
first  postlaunch  press  briefing,  Director  of  Launch  Operations  Walter 
J .   Kapryan   said  tha t   if  the   a r ray s   did  not  deploy  “the  mission  will  be  
seriously degraded.”  The  crew was not set  u p  to  perform  a  fix-it-yourself 
extravehicular  activity  ( E V A )   a n d   there   were  no  controls  f o r   deploy- 
ment  inside the Workshop. 
Anxious  officials  and   flight  controllers  began  analyzing  radioed 
launch   data.  Analysis  and   la ter   inspection  revealed  tha t   the  meteoroid 
shield  had   been  torn  off  by  vibration  of  the  vehicle  just  a f te r   passing 
through  mach  1 speed,  nea r   the   time  of  highest  dynamic  pressure. 
Some  early  measurements  indicated  tha t   the  shield  separation  s traps  
were  still  satisfactory,  bu t   la ter   measurements  indicated  failure.  The  
fa i lure  had   released the  securing mechanism on  SAS Wing 2 and  the wing 
r ipped   off.  A  piece of  shield had   wrapped  around   SAS  W ing   1 a n d  kept 
i t   from   deploying.  Loss  of  the   wings,  which  were  to  provide  power  to 
the  Workshop,  reduced  power  to  50%  of  i ts  average 8000-w ou tpu t ;   the  
rema in ing   50% would  be   supplied by   the  four   ATM  solar panels. 
A t   1 1 : O O   pm  EDT Skylab  Program   Director  William  C.  Schneider 
announced  the  Skylab  2  launch   had   been  rescheduled  to  May  20  to 
allow  assessment  of  damage  and   development  of  a  new  flight  plan  to 
maximize  scientific  re turn   from   Skylab’s  experiments  with  limited 
power.  Fuel  cells  of  the  Skylab  2  command  and   service module  (C SM )  
would  b e   used  to  produce  electricity,  af ter   joining  the  Workshop,  but 
the   CSM  oxygen  and   hydrogen  f o r   the  cells  would  last  only  16  to  2 1  
days.  I t   was  too  early  to  assess  the   effect  on  Skylab  3 and   4 missions, 
planned  f o r  56  days each. 
On  May  15  Skylab  faced   a  new  threa t   a s   temperatures  inside  the  
Workshop reached  above 311 K  ( 1 0 0 ° F ) .  T h e  lost  meteoroid  shield had  
also been  designed  to  reflect  sunlight  and   help  cool  the  Workshop.  LLWe  
th ink   we  can   live  with  the   electrical  power  shortage,”  Schneider  said,

“bu t  if  we  can’t  solve this  thermal  problem we  have a  serious situation.” 
Schneider  feared  foods  and   film  might  be  spoiled,  plastic  p a r t s   might 
begin  to   leak  poisonous  gases,  and   the  laboratory  might  become  un- 
inhabitable. 
T h e   en t ire   Skylab  team  was  mobilized-at 
Johnson  Space  Center, 
Marshall  Space  Flight  Center,  Martin  Marietta  Corp.,  McDonnell 
Douglas  Corp.,  TRW  Inc.,  and   Garrett  AiResearch  Co.-in 
a n   all-out 
attempt  to  overcome  the  loss  of  the  shield  and  solar  arrays .   Schneider 
sa id   NASA  was  studying  the  possibility  of  the  Skylab  2  astronauts’ 
pu t t ing   “some  kind  of  a  thermal  blanket  around   the  spacecraft,”  but 
tha t   would  require  a  delay  of  the  Skylab  2  launch  beyond  May  20. 
Astronauts  would  also  inspect  the  solar  wings,  but  whether  they  could 
make   repa irs   was  uncertain. 
T h e   Skylab  2  crew  returned  to  JSC  May  15  to  help  flight  planners 
salvage  the  mission. 
Special  attitude  maneuvers  were  run   to  obtain  temperature  da ta  
on  the  Skylab  cluster  and   to  limit  Workshop  temperatures,  a s   internal 
temperature  soared  a s   h igh   a s   325   K  (125’F).  Tempera ture   was  re- 
duced  by   pitching  the  Workshop  with  the  longitudinal  ax is   pointed  a t  
th e   sun   for  one  orbit  and ,   on  May  16,  the   Workshop  was  tilted  55” 
away  from  the  sun,  with  sufficient  sunlight  on  the  working  solar  panels 
to  charge   the  batteries  but  moving  the  space  station  out  of  the  sun’s 
full glare. 
Teams   continued  to   compute  options  to  overcome  the  loss  of  the 
shield : astronauts  could  spray-paint  S k y l a b   1 ’s   side  to   alter  radiation 
properties  of  the  gold  foil  coating  the  Workshop  shell,  could  wallpaper 
the  critical  area,  or   could  deploy  a  solar  sunshade.  Choice  of  the   th ird  
option  was  announced  May  16.  T h e   astronauts  were  trained  in   three 
possible  methods of  deploying the  sunshade and   in   procedures to  deploy 
the   jammed  solar  panel.  If  they  failed  with  the  panel,  a  near-normal 
16-  to  21-day  mission  could  still  be  realized  by  using  the  CSM  power 
and   curtailing  some  experiments.  After  tha t   experiments would  have 
t o  be  severely  cut back  to  reserve power  for  the  CSM’S  t r ip  home. 
On  May  17  NASA   announced  postponement  of  the   Skylab  2  launch 
until May 2 5  to  allow the  astronauts to  practice  techniques for   deploying 
the   sunshade  and   mission  engineers  to  design,  fabricate,  and   test  h a rd -  
ware.  Astronauts  Conrad,  Kerwin,  and   Weitz  flew  to  MSFC  to  practice 
installing the  sun  shield  in  the  Neutral  Buoyancy  Simulator. 
On  May  20  the  Workshop  was  purged  of  any  gases  from  the   over- 
heated  insulation  material  and   turned  slightly  to  allow  the  sun  t o  warm 
the   airlock  module  a n d   prevent  water  stored  there  from  freezing  and  
causing  breakage.  Components  of 
the  astronauts’  repa ir   k i t   were 
shipped  to  MSFC  fo r   final  testing  before  being  installed  in   Skylab  2’s 
Apollo  CSM. 
On   May  22   the  Skylab  2  astronaut  crew  flew  to   IGC  to  prepare   fo r  
the  May  2 5  launch.  Th r e e  thermal shields were  decided  on   a t   a  May  2 3  
review:  a  parasol  deployable  f rom   th e   Workshop  through  the  solar 
scientific  airlock,  a  backup  twin-pole  shield  deployable  by   the   crew 
d u r i n g  EVA,  and  a standup-EVA (SEVA) sail deployable by  the  crew  from 
the   CSM  i f   both o ther  methods  failed. 
The Skylab  2  countdown  resumed  a t   5:30  am   EDT  May  2 3  a t  KSC.  I t  
had   been  halted  eight  hours   after  Sky lab   1  liftoff  May  14. On  May  2 4  
the  three  emergency  sunshades  and   necessary  tools  were  stored  in   the

EDT  May  24,  bu t   retests  of  the  vehicle  indicated  no  damage. 
At  a May  2 4  press  conference Program   Director  Schneider  said  there  
would  be  limited  activity  by  the   crew  to  deploy  the  partially  opened 
solar  panel.  LLWe’re not  too  optimistic  tha t   we’ll  be   able  to  do  too 
much,  although  we  will  give  Capt.  Conrad  the  option  to  t r y   i t   if  i t  
looks l ike   a  reasonable  job.”  NASA   was ‘‘very  confident tha t   . . . we  will 
b e   ab le   to  deploy  a  [thermal]  shield,  we  will  get  the   spacecraf t   tem- 
peratures  back  under  control,  and   we  will  have  a  good  28-day mission.” 
Sky lab  2  (SL-2)  was  launched from   a s c  Launch  Complex 
May  25: 
39,  P a d   B,  on  a  two-stage  Sa tu rn   IB   launch  vehicle  in to   heavy  dark  
clouds  on  time  a t   9 :OO   am  EDT.  A s   Astronauts  Conrad,  Kerwin,  and  
Weitz  headed  toward  the  Sky lab   1  Workshop  they  were  to  attempt  to 
repa i r   in   o rb i t   and   man  fo r   28  days,  Commander  Conrad  told  Mission 
Control,  “We  fix  anything.” 
The   CSM/S-IVB  combination  was  placed  in  a  phas ing   orb i t   with 
224-km  (139.2-mi)  apogee and   150-km  (93.2-mi)  perigee  9 min  56 sec 
a f te r   launch.  Six  minutes  la ter   the   CSM  separated.  The   S-IVB  stage 
deorb i t  maneuver was  performed a t  2 :23 pm  EDT  a n d  the  stage splashed 
in to  the  Pacific Ocean. 
The   CSM  rendezvoused with  the  Workshop  a t   4 :30   pm  EDT  over  the  
Guam  track ing  station on the   fifth orbit.  Dur ing   15 min  of  TV  coverage 
the  CSM  flew  around   the  Workshop,  within  1.5 m  ( 5  f t )   of  it.  The  
astronauts  confirmed  tha t   the   SAS  W ing   2  was  missing  and   tha t   the  SAS 
W ing   1,  deployed  only  15”, was  restrained  by   a  piece  of  the  micro- 
meteoroid  shield  wrapped  around   the  SAS  beam  fairing.  Portions  of  the  
gold  foil  laminated  to  the  Workshop  skin  for   thermal  protection  had  
been  torn   and   heat  and   uv  radiation  from   the  sun   had   scorched  the 
skin. 
The   astronauts  soft-docked  the   CSM  with  the  Workshop,  using  only 
three   cap ture   latches;  ate  d inne r ;   and   undocked  to  attempt  to  deploy 
the   jammed   solar  panel. Weitz  stood  in   the  open  hatch  of  the  CSM  with 
Kerwin  holding  h is   knees  to  keep  him  from   d r i f t ing   in to   space.  He  
tr ied   to  free   the   solar  panel  with  a  shepherd’s  crook  and   a  pole  with 
prun ing   shears   attached  without  success.  Conrad  told  Mission  Control 
tha t   the  panel  appeared   to  be   “hooked  in   there  like  it’s  nailed  on.”  The  
repa i r   attempt was ended  a t  8 : 1 2  pm  EDT. 
T h e   crew made  f o u r   unsuccessful attempts to   redock  with  the Work-  
shop. Working  i n  bulky  spacesuits  and   gloves,  the   astronauts  evacuated 
the   a i r   from  t h e  Apollo  cab in   and   hooked  u p   a n  electric  cable  to  over- 
r ide   a  suspected shor t   i n   the  docking probe.  LLYea. We  got  a  ha rd   dock 
out  of  i t   [a   docking  using  all  1 2  sealing  latches  to  seal  the   two  space- 
c ra f t   together],”  Conrad  said  a t   11:50  pm  EDT.  The   crew  found  one   of 
the   cap ture   latches  had   stuck  in   the   retracted  position,  bu t   trouble- 
shooting procedures recommended by Mission Control restored  the latch.

M a y   26-June  21 : 
The   Sky lab   2  crew  entered  the  multiple  docking 
adap ter   on  the  Skylab  Workshop  a t   12 :45   pm  EDT May  26  and   per- 
formed  activation  and   Workshop  preen try   tasks.  A  chemical  detection 
device  inserted  in to   the  passage  indicated  no  lethal  gas was  present.  At 
2:30  pm  EDT Astronaut  Weitz  entered  the  Workshop  wearing  a  gas  
mask,  gloves,  and   soft  shoes  to  protect  him  from  the  heat.  Weitz  told 
ground  control,  “The  ows appears   to  be  in  good  shape.  I t   feels  a  little 
b i t  warm  a s  you might  expect, l ike  90  to  100 degrees  [ F ;  305 to  310 K]  
in   the   desert.  I  felt  hea t   rad ia t ing   from  everywhere  bu t   I  never  felt 
uncomfortable. And  nothing  I  touched  felt  hot  to  me.  It’s  a  d ry   heat.” 
Kerwin  and   Conrad  followed Weitz.  After  a  quick  inspection,  the  crew 
closed  the  hatch. 
At  4:30 pm  EDT the   crew began  to  deploy  the  solar  parasol-a  mylar 
shade   folded  against  a  telescopic  pole-through 
the  solar  airlock.  As 
they  readied  the  parasol,  the  astronauts looked  out  of  the  windows and  
identified  landmarks   across  the  U S .   Weitz  recognized  Seattle,  Wash., 
and   Conrad  spotted  both  launch  pads  used  fo r   the   Skylab  launches  a t  
I<SC. 
Conrad  and   Weitz  popped  open  the   shiny  aluminum  and   orange  
canopy  a t   8 :30   pm  EDT May  26  (Mission  Day  2 )   while  Kerwin  took 
TV  photos  from   the  attached  Apollo  CM. Significant  external  tempera- 
tu re  decreases were noted  almost immediately  after  deployment. In terna l  
temperatures  decreased  more  slowly.  The  Workshop  was  headed  back 
to solar inertial attitude. 
By  May 27  the Workshop temperature had   dropped to  309  K  (97’F). 
The   crew  activated  systems  and   experiments  while  the ir   back-and- 
for th   excursions  through  the  Workshop  were  televised  to  the  ear th .   The  
Wash ing ton   Pos t   la ter   said  they  resembled  “skin  divers  snorkeling 
through  a  cave  in   the Caribbean”  o r  a  scene from  the  film  “2001”  with 
astronauts  “ in   orange   flight  suits  and   white T-shirts  swimming  like  fish 
through  the  b ig   workshop,  floating  backwards  and   tumbling  like 
gymnasts.” 
On  May  28  the  astronauts  began  the   first  medical  tests,  tak ing   and  
processing blood  samples and  checking the conditions of  their  circulatory 
and   metabolic  systems.  Checkout  and   prepara t ion   of  the   (ATM) was 
begun.  Dur ing   a  seven-minute  televised  space-to-ground  news  con- 
ference  beginning  a t   1 :09   pm  EDT, Conrad  said  the  crew  had   adap ted  
rapidly.  “None  of  us  h a s  had   any  motion  sickness.  . . . I t   seems to   be  
l ike   the   simulator  except  with  the  absence  of  gravity.”  Kerwin  con- 
cluded  tha t   the  b ra in   and   eyes  must  override  the  body’s  vestibule  sys- 
tem  i n   the  inner   ear .   “You  say  to  your  bra in ,   ‘Brain,  I  want  tha t   way 
to  b e   up.’  And  your  b ra in   says,  ‘OK,  then  tha t   way  is  up.’  . . . Your  
b ra in   will  follow   YOU.'^  Conrad  agreed,  “We’re  in  good  shape  fo r   28  
days.” 
Dr.  Willard  R.  Hawkins,  JSC  Deputy  Director  of  Life  Sciences  f o r  
Medical  Operations,  said  la ter   in   the  mission  tha t   i t   was  “ra ther  
amazing”  tha t   the  crew  had   shown  no  signs  of  the   expected  motion 
sickness.  Da ta   received  were  preliminary,  but  prelaunch  exercises  in   a 
whirling  cha ir   might  have  helped  avoid  nausea. 
Tempera tures   continued  to  drop   slowly,  reaching  304   K  (88’F). 
At 8 :50   pm  EDT a 69-sec tr im   bu rn   put  the  Workshop in to   a  repeating 
ground   track   abou t   96  km  ( 6 0  m i )   west  of  normal,  to  acqu ire   ea r th

May  14-June  22 

On  May  29   checkout  of  the  ATM  was  completed  and   four   passes 
were  made.  Kerwin  trained  an   a r r ay   of  telescopes  to   observe  x-ray 
the   sun’s  atmosphere.  He 
emissions  and   examine  the  structure  of 
photographed  three  regions  of  the  sun  considered  active  b y   solar 
physicists  and   made  detailed  observations  of  the   full  solar  disk  and  
the  corona.  Conrad  and   Weitz  prepared  the  earth-oriented  cameras  for 
ear th   resources  experiment  package  ( ER E P )   passes.  Two  biomedical 
runs   were  made.  Dur ing   a  private  conversation  with  JSC,  Conrad  re- 
ported  tha t   the  internal  temperature  had  stabilized  near  304  I( 
(88°F )  
and   that,  while  th is   would  be  tolerable  for   the  rest  of  the  mission,  h e  
d id   not  think  the  crew  could  carry   out  the  full  protocol  on  the  bicycle 
ergometer  (exercise device). 
On  May  30  the  solar  telescopes  were  aimed  a t   the  active  regions  of 
the  sun  while  scientists on  the  ear th   received  excellent  TV  photos  of  the 
solar  corona  and   the   solar  disk  in  the  uv  spectrum.  Th e   first  EREP  
photo  pass  was  made  over  a  3200-km  (2000-mi)  s tr ip   from  Oregon  to 
the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Good  pictures  were  obtained  of  the  Great  Salt 
Lake,  gypsum  beds  in  New  Mexico,  and   the  soil  salinity  of  the   Rio 
Grande  Valley,  a s   well  as   microwave  measurements  of  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico.

After  the   EREP   pass,  the  batteries-at 
50% capacity-tripped 
off  l ine   and  ceased  to  produce  electricity.  They 
h ad   been  designed  to  t r ip   off  a t   20%  capacity.  One  ba t tery   also  lost 
the   regulator  tha t   allowed  the  solar  panel  to  recharge  it,  decreasing 
the  total  Workshop  power  by  6%,  or   250  w,  leaving  4200  w.  Th e  
Workshop  required  3600  w  for  maintenance,  leaving  only  600  w  fo r  
experiments. Th e  second  EREP   pass was canceled  for  a  power  evaluation. 
Sixteen  batteries  were  brought  back  on  line  but  two  remained  off   line 
and  were  useless.  Heat,  fans,  and   lights were  powered  down. 
Workshop  power  continued  reduced  May  31  and   EREP   experiments 
were  canceled.  T h e  crew  continued  medical  experiments,  each  taking  a 
turn   i n  a rotating cha ir  to  provide data on  motion sickness and  maintain- 
ing   balance  in   zero  g.  Weitz  repaired  the  m irror   system  on  the  uv 
stellar  photography  experiment.  Temperatures  had   dropped  to  301   K 
(82 °F ) .  
Th e  Skylab  astronauts took  the ir   first  day off  June  1 (Mission Day 8 )  
and   the ir   first  shower  in  space.  On  a  15-min  color  telecast  they  per- 
formed  housekeeping  chores and-to 
the  music  from  the  film  “2OOl”- 
did  handstands,  somersaults,  and   cartwheels  in  the  zero-g  atmosphere. 
Conrad  led  the  crew  in   a  r u n   around   the  watertanks.  Centrifugal  force 
overcame weightlessness,  so  the  men  could  keep  the ir   feet  on  the   track. 
On  the  ground  Skylab  officials announced  the  decision  to  make  a  second 
attempt to  free  the  jammed  solar panel,  while  engineers  and   the  backup 
astronauts,  led  by  Russell  L.  Schweickart,  tested  EVA  procedures. 
On  June   2,  Conrad  an d  Weitz  made  a  10-min EREP   photo  pass  from  
California  t o  Central Mexico  to   gather  data  on  earthquakes,  volcanoes, 
pollution  sources,  mineral  resources,  and   land-use  patterns.  On  the 
ground Schweickart successfully  tested  three ways of  free ing  the jammed 
solar panel  using  a  bolt  cutter,  a pry ing   rod,  and   a  surgeon’s  bone  saw. 
Th e   astronauts  completed  the   th ird   EREP  pass  over  Nor th   America  a n d

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1973 

Astronaut  Conrad  set  a  new  world  record  for   time  in   space  a t   1 :17  
am   EDT,  surpassing  the  715-hr  5-min ma rk   set  by   Astronaut  James  A. 
Lovell,  Jr .   T h e   first  ball  game  in   space  was  held  in   the  Workshop. 
Conrad  sa id  a ball thrown  in  weightlessness  “goes s tra igh t  as  a n  arrow.” 
The four th   EREP   pass  was  made  June   4,  as well  a s  five hours   of  ATM 
solar  viewing.  Dr.  John  Zeiglschmid,  Skylab  Flight  Surgeon,  told  a 
JSC  press  briefing  th a t   the   physical  condition  of  the   Skylab  crew  was 
excellent.  They   were  consuming  the  proper   amount  of  food  and   getting 
adequa te   rest.  Conrad  and   Kerwin  had   lost  only  0.5 kg   ( 1  l b )  ; Weitz 
h ad   lost  1.8 kg  ( 4  lb s ) .   Top   Skylab  officials  a t   MSFC  agreed  tha t   solar 
w ing   deployment  techniques  developed  by  Astronaut  Schweickart  were 
feasible,  without  unusual  safety  hazards. 
On  Jun e   6  prepara t ions   were  made  fo r   the  next  day’s  EVA.  Conrad 
said,  “I  guess  we  have  a  fifty-fifty  chance  of  pulling  i t   off.”  T h e   16 
Workshop  batteries  were  producing  4200  w-only 
600   w  more  than  
th e   minimum  necessary  fo r   the  astronauts’  survival.  One  battery  was 
down  to  half  charge  and  others were  believed  to  have  been  damaged  by  
the   heat.  Th e   astronauts  photographed  hurr icane   Ava  du r ing   a n   EREP  
pass,  made  an   ATM   pass,  and   photographed  uv  spectra  of  stars. 
Conrad and  Kerwin opened the AM   EVA  hatch  a t  11 :23  am   EDT   Jun e  7 
and  extended  the ir   umbilicals  and   a  rigged-up  7.6-m  (25-f t)   pole  fitted 
with  cutters  for  releasing  the  jammed  solar  wing,  as   Weitz  took  TV 
photos  from  the   Skylab  and   the  CSM .   Outsir]  Kerwin  had   difficulty 
keep ing   a  firm  footing,  with  only  makeshift  nndholds  a n d   foot  re- 
an tenna   mount.  His 
straints,  as  he  secured  the  end  of  the  pole  t o  
h e a r t   ra te   rose  to  150 beats  per  minute  and   he   1s  bu rn ing   energy  a t  
2000  to  2500  BTUS  an   hour .   Finally  he   extended  the  pole  to  the  beam  
holding  the  wing  and-with  Conrad  repeatedly  telling  him  to  “take  i t  
easy”  and  “cool  it”-managed 
af ter  several  tries to  fit the  cutters around

along  the  pole  to   the   wing.  Tangling  of  the  10.6- and   18.3-m  (35- and  
60 - f t )   flexible umbilicals  linking  the   as tronau ts   to  spacecraft  l i f e   sup- 
por t   systems complicated  their  movements. 
Kerwin  pulled  a  lanyard   to  sn ap   the  cutters  and   sever  the  bolt  a n d  
then  extended  the  wing  using  a  rope  attached  to   the  upper   surface. 
Conrad  pulled  a  rope  to  break  a  frozen  actuator.  Two  of  the  sections 
mak ing  up   the  wing were 40%  deployed  and   the   other  about  30%. 
T h e   two  astronauts  also  changed  a  film  magazine  in   a  telescope 
camera   and   latched  open  a  balky  door  on  a n   x-ray   telescope  before 
reentering  the  Workshop  and  closing th e  AM   EVA  ha tch   a t  2:53  pm   EDT, 
concluding 3 h r s   30  min  successful  EVA .  
T h e  Workshop  was  pitched  up   to  expose  the  panels  to  more  direct 
sunlight  and   unfreeze  the   hydraulic  system  tha t   deployed  them.  After 
a  few  hours   one  section  was  90%  deployed,  another  40%,  and   the 
th ird   29%. By  the  next  day   the  sections were  fully deployed. Additional 
electric  power  of  3000 w  was  obtained  and   all  eight  batteries  supplied 
by   the   solar  panels  were  charged  and   i n   good  working  order-paving

since you  left  ear th ,   you  have  more  than   fulfilled  the  prophecy  of  your 
pa r t ing   words,  ‘We  can  fix  anything.’  All  of  us  now  have   new  courage 
tha t   man   can  work  in   space  to  control  his  environment,  improve   h is  
circumstances a n d  exert  his will  even  a s  he  does on  earth.” 
On  June  1 2  the  n in th   EREP  pass  was  made.  Weitz  said  he  could  see 
pollution  flowing into Lake  E r ie   and   he   couldn’t  find Washington,  D.C., 
because  of  haze.  Conrad  melted  an   aluminum  alloy  to  study  the   be- 
havior  of  molten metal  in   weightlessness and   used  an   electron  beam  for  
welding  inside  a  small  vacuum  chamber. 
On  June   13 D r .  Hawkins  told  a  JSC   medical  review  tha t   Kerwin  and  
Weitz  were  no  longer  able  to  perform  a t   preflight  levels  on  the  bicycle 
ergometer,  ind ica t ing   the ir   cardiovascular  systems had   been  weakened 
by   weightlessness. The   condition  was  not  at  dangerous  levels  and   was 
not  in terfer ing  with  the ir   normal  day-to-day performance. 
Weitz  photographed  a  massive  explosion  on  the  sun   with  the   ATM 
solar  telescopes June   15. The   flare  had   erupted  from   the  center  of  the  
sun’s  side  facing  the ea r th   and   covered  an   a rea  40  200  km  ( 2 5  000 m i )  
wide.  Conrad  checked  ou t   the  Apollo  CSM  for  the   re turn   t r i p   to  ear th ,  
while  Kerwin  initiated  the  growth  of  bacteria  in   a  culture medium  and  
photographed  i ts   behavior  in   the  space  environment. 
On  June   1 7  a  tr im   bu rn   corrected  a  cross-track e r r o r   and   positioned 
the  vehicle  for  the  s tar t   of  t h e   Skylab  3  mission.  Pres iden t   Nixon 
telephoned  the  astronauts  from   Key  Biscayne,  Fla.:  “ I   guess  the  way  I 
could  summarize  this  project  is  tha t   i t   proves  tha t   man   still  matters. 
With  all  the   technical  machines  . . . tha t   you  had   to  work  with,  i t  
proved  tha t   when  there  were  difficulties  the  ingenuity  of  men  in   space 
was  what  really  mattered,  and   you  have  made  u s   all  very  proud   with 
the   way  you  handled  some  difficult  problems  in   this  project.”  T h e  
Pres iden t   invited  the  three  Skylab  as tronau ts   to  visit  h im   a t   San  
Clemente, Calif.,  a f te r   splashdown. 
At  3:22  am  EDT   June   18  (MD-25)  as tronau ts  Conrad,  Kerwin,  and  
Weitz  surpassed  the  previous  space  endurance  record  held  by   the 
Soyuz  I I   cosmonauts  (launched  June  6,  1 9 7 1 ) .   Conrad  asked  tha t   a 
message  be   relayed  to   Soviet  cosmonauts  giving  “our   respects  a t   th is  
point  in   o u r   flight  to  them  and   the i r   comrades.  Wish  them  good  luck 
from   u s   in   the   future.” 
EVA-2  began  a t   6:53  am  EDT  June   19.  Conrad  and   Weitz  moved 
through   space  to  retrieve  a n d   replace  the   ATM  film  cassettes  while 
Kerwin photographed  the  EVA  fo r  TV from inside the Workshop. Conrad 
also  freed  a  stuck  relay  by  s tr ik ing   i t   with  a  hammer.  One  of  two  dead 
ba t ter ies   began  charg ing   immediately.  From  the   ground  Schweickart 
said,  “ I t   worked.  Thank   you  very  much,  gentlemen.  You’ve  done  i t  
again.”  The   cameras  for   the   white  l igh t   coronagraph  and   x-ray  
spectroheliographic  experiments  were  replaced  by  the   astronauts  to 
permit  photography  dur ing   the  unmanned  period  between  Sky lab  2 a n d  
3 .   EVA  operations ended  a t  8:29  am  EDT,  af ter   1 h r   36  min. 
Du r ing   a  June  20   press   conference  from   space  Kerwin  said  the 
astronauts’  physical  condition  was  “a  pleasant  b ig   surprise.  I’m 
tremendously  encouraged  about  the   fu ture   of  long-duration flight.” 
June 22 :  
The   as tronau ts  undocked  the   CSM  from  the   Skylab Work- 
shop  a t  4:55  am   EDT  on  Mission  Day  29. As  the   CSM  pulled  away  and  
circled  the  Workshop,  TV  and   photographic  coverage  were  obtained 
by   the crew. CM  separation from   the  SM  a t  5:40  am  EDT  was followed by

Th e   CM   splashed  down  a t  9:50 am  EDT  1340 km   (830  m i )   southwest 
of  S an   Diego.  A  recovery  helicopter  dropped  swimmers  who  installed 
a  flotation  collar  and   a  sea  anchor.  T h e   recovery  sh ip   Ticonderoga was 
maneuvered  beside  the  CM   and  a  crane   lifted  i t   aboard   with  the  astro- 
nau ts   inside.  Medical  examinations  on  board   the   recovery  sh ip   found 
some  dizziness  and   ill  effects  from  weightlessness.  T h e   crew  would 
travel  by  sh ip   to  San   Diego  and   by  a i r   to  Ellington  A ir   Force  Base, 
Tex.,  June  24. 
Th e  Sky lab   1-2  mission  achieved  its  pr imary   objectives  of  establish- 
ing  the  Skylab Orb i ta l  Assembly  in  ear th   orbit,  obtaining  medical  da ta  
on   the  crew  fo r   use  in   extending  the  duration  of  manned  space  flight, 
and   performing  inflight  experiments.  I t   contributed  significantly  toward 
program   objectives  of  determining  man’s  ability  to  live  and   work  in  
space  for   extended  periods,  extending  the  science  of  solar  astronomy 
beyond  the  limits  of  earth-based observations,  and  developing improved 
techniques  for   surveying  ear th   resources  from  space.  Despite  mission 
anomalies,  80%  of  the  solar  da ta   planned  was  ob ta ined ;   1 2  of  the  15 
ear th   resources  da ta   runs   were  accomplished;  all  16  medical  experi- 
ments  were  conducted  as  required  and   a  time  history  of  man’s  adap-  
tations  to  zero-g  environment was  obtained  for   the  first  t ime ;   a n d   data 
were  taken  on  all  43  experiments scheduled  fo r   Sky lab   2  except  those 
precluded  by   the  use  of  the  solar  parasol  and   weight  and   power  limita- 
tions.  T h e  performance of  the  flight  crew  was  good  a n d  the  mission  was 
judged  officially  on  Ju ly   14 to  be  a success. 
Ma jor   records  set  to  date  included  the  longest-duration  manned 
flight,  28  days  50 m i n ;   the  longest  total  time  in   space  fo r   one man,  49 
days for  Conrad  (veteran  of  Gem in i  5 and   11 and  Apo l lo  12 missions) ; 
the  longest  inflight  EVA,  3 hrs   30  m in   by   Conrad  and  Kerwin  June   7 ;  
and   the  longest  distance  in   orb i t   for   a  manned  flight,  18 531 559  km 
( 1 1  514 967  m i ) .  
S k y lab   1-2  was  the  first  U S .   manned  orb i ta l   workshop.  Skylab  3 
was  scheduled  to   be  launched  in   August  and   Skylab  4  in   November. 
Th e  Workshop  would  be  operated  unmanned  between  manned  missions. 
Th e   Skylab  program   was  directed  by  NASA’s Office  of  Manned  Space 
Flight.  MSFC  developed  and  integrated  the  ma jor   program  components 
including  the OWS,  AM,  MDA ,   ATM,  payload  shroud,  and  most  experiments 
and   was  responsible  for   the  Sa turn   IB   and   Sa turn   V  launch  vehicles.

had  hea rd   tha t   NASA  “didn’t  have  enough money.”  A  retired  Navy  chief 
petty  officer had   sent  one  day’s  pay  af ter   each manned  flight  in  memory 
of  h is   son who  had   been  killed  in  the  Korean  war.  A  naturalized  citizen 
from  Eastern  Europe  had   sent  $100  i n   1964 because he   wished  to  be  a 
pa r t   of  the  space  program  tha t   would  mean  the  survival  of  a  free  U S .  
(NASA   Release 73-98) 
Man’s  ability  to  survive  i n   space  was  discussed  in   New   Y o r k   T im e s   and  
Wash ing ton   Post  articles.  Of  3 3   astronauts  who  had   made  Apollo 
flights,  11 had   suffered  from   motion  sickness  fo r   the  first  few  days   in  
space.  ApoZZo  13  (Ap r i l   11-17,  1 9 7 0 ) ,   the  aborted  moon  land ing  
mission,  had   ind ica ted .  tha t   men  in  danger  would  have  a  tough  time 
surviving  in   space.  Astronaut  James  A.  Lovell,  Jr.,  had   lost  6  k g   (14 
Ibs)  du r ing   the   six-day  mission.  John  L.  Swigert,  Jr.,  had   been  so  
overcome  by   fa t igue   near   the  end  of  the  flight  tha t   he  made  several 
e r ro r s   i n   checking  reentry  procedures.  Fatigue  might  also  have  con-

Calcium  loss  in   weightlessness, the  most  serious  of  potential  medical 
problems,  could  lead  to  th inn ing   of  the  bones  and   subsequent  bone 
breaks  af ter   long  periods  i n   space.  Other  health  problems  included 
increased  hea r t   rates,  weight  loss,  decreased  oxygen  consumption, 
reduced  blood  pressure,  and   the   reduced  flow  of  blood  to  the  b ra in   and  
kidneys. 
Psychological  effects,  a s   well  a s   these  problems,  would  be   studied 
on  Skylab  missions. Were   windows  necessary?  Should  doors  be  door-

close  ties  a r e   developing  between  NSF/RANN  and  NA SA   in   the  field  of 
Energy  Research  and   Technology.”  The   ma jor   focus  was  on  terrestrial 
applications of  solar energy. Lewis Research Center was especially active 
in   jo in t   work  on  requests  for  proposals  on  solar  thermal  areas,  photo- 
voltaics  (use   of  the  generation  of  electromotive  force  when  r ad i an t

Dr.  James  C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator,  testified  on   the  s ta tus  
of  the   Skylab missions before  the  Sena te  Committee on Aeronautics and  
Space  Sciences hear ing   on  the   difficulties tha t   had   postponed  Skylab  2, 
a s  the countdown resumed  a t  Kennedy Space Center  fo r  May 25  launch: 
T h e  micrometeoroid  shield  around   the  Sky lab   1 Orb i ta l  Workshop  had  
been  torn   off  about  one minute  af ter  liftoff  on May  14,  du r ing  the   t ime  
of  maximum  aerodynamic  pressure.  “At  the  same  time,  some  of  the 
solar  panels  used  to  generate  electricity  f o r   the  labora tory   were  a p -  
parently  also  damaged,  jammed,  o r   torn  away.  We  don’t  know  which. 
The   full  impact  of  this  malfunction  was  not  known  until  several  hours  
a f te r   launch ;   we  still  d o  not  know  the   specifics  of  the   actual  damage. 
The   net  result  was  tha t   Skylab  was  i n   a  good  orbit,  bu t   had   only  ap-  
proximately  one-half of  its power-generating capability i n  operation  and  
also  was  overheating  badly.”  The   overheating  occurred  because  the  
damaged  micrometeoroid  shield  was  also  to  have  provided  therma l  
balance.  f t   was  painted  “to  reflect  the   proper   amount  of  sun l igh t   so

th a t   the   laboratory  would  s tay   cool.”  Th e   Skylab  2  astronauts  hoped 
to  r ep a i r   the  damage  and   then  c a r r y   out  a  28-day  mission.  “If  the 
planned  repa irs   are   successful,  we  will  also  be  able  to  accomplish  most 
of  the   activities  scheduled for   the  two  subsequent  missions,  each  lasting 
56  days.”  Skylab  2  would  c a r r y   several  sunshades.  “We  don’t  know 
whether  the  micrometeoroid  shield  is  completely  severed  o r   whether 
par ts   of  i t   a r e  obstructing  some of  the  areas  where  the  sunshade might 
be  fixed,  bu t   . . . by  carry ing   several  different  shades,  we  should  a t  
least  have  one  which  will  b e   suitable.” 
Dr.  Fletcher  described  steps  to  be  taken  to  deploy  the   solar  panels. 
“If  i t  looks like  a n  easy  th ing   to  do,  if  one  of  the  panels  . . . is partially 
deployed  and   is  hung   up  on   something  and  all  i t   needs  is  a  little  tug, 
we  will  put  a  loop of  twine  around   the  end  of  it,  play  i t   out  so  tha t   we 
a r e  well  away  from the  panel  in  case  i t   starts  to  deploy,  and   give  a  little 
tug   on   the  twine.  If  i t   deploys,  fine;  but  if  it  does  not,  we  will  go  on 
without  it.  But  we  a r e   not  going  to  spend  too  much  t ime   on   th a t   fix. 
Th e r e  a r e  too  many  uncertainties  and  we  do  not  really need  the  power.”

Results from   the  Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount  ( ATM )   launched 
on  the   Sky lab   1 Orbital  Workshop May  14 were  presented  by  principal 
investigators  a t   a  Johnson  Space Center  press  briefing.  Naval  Research 
Laboratory  astronomer  Dr .   R ichard   Tousey  reported  the  detection  by  
TV  system  tha t   showed  what  the  
the  extreme  ultraviolet  monitor-a 
sun looked  like  in  extreme uv   radiation  of  a  broad  band-of 
a  “hole”  in  
the  solar corona.  “And  this coronal hole  is  believed  to  be  a  region where 
the   corona  is  a t   a  lower  temperature  and  a  lower  density,  and  there’s 
some  reason  to  believe  tha t   the  solar  wind  comes  ou t   of  coronal  holes 
to  a  greater  extent  than   from   any   where  else  on  the  Sun.”  Th e   first 
coronal  hole  had   been  recorded  in   1966  but  the  significance  of  such 
holes  h a d   not  been  recognized  until  they  were  observed  f rom   NASA’s 
unmanned  Orb i t ing   So lar   Observatories.  A  ma jor   objective  of 
the 
Skylab  astronomy  experiments  was  to  determine  how  the  solar  corona 
was  heated.  Skylab  instruments  were  observing  a t   a  wide  range   of 
wavelengths  generated  by   gases  of  different  temperatures  a t   different 
elevations in  the  solar  atmosphere.  Sharper   images  than   so  f a r   received 
were  hoped  for .   Th e   images,  thus   f a r   seen  only  through  a  TV  system 
with  abou t   one  tenth  the  anticipated  detail,  “whet  your  appetite  fo r  
what  the  instruments  will  b r ing   back,”  Dr .   Tousey  said.  (Transcr ip t ;

tasks  in   space:  “Hundreds   of  miles  above  the  melee  of  the  Watergate 
affair,  the  three  American  astronauts,  having  hazardously  patched  u p  
the  damaged  Skylab  and   activated  the  equipment  and   workshop,  have 
now  settled  down  to  a  routine  of  planned  experiments  designed,  above 
all,  to   test  man’s  capacity  to  live  in   the  weightlessness  of  space.  What- 
ever  the   troubles  in  the ir   political  world,  there  is  no  question  of  the 
Americans’  superb   capability  in   scientific  and   industrial  technology.”

*  Abandonment  of  technology,  a  “source  of  man’s  strength,”  would  be  a 
senseless  alternative  to  i ts   fu r the r   development  and   use,  D r .   Jerome  B. 
Wiesner,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  President,  warned  in   a 
Technology  Review  article.  Man’s  exploitation  of  and   dependency  on 
the   environment  could  not  be   changed  through   greater  unders tand ing  
of  science  and   its  application.  Even  a  relevant  technology  alone  would 
not  suffice.  Man  needed  “to  develop  the  ability  to  estimate  rationally 
and   to  choose  among  alternate  courses  of  action,  particularly  when  new 
technology  i s   concerned.  Above  all,  we  need  the   humility  to  adm i t   tha t  
we  will  not  find  any   absolute  answers  o r   permanent  solutions.”  But  the 
fallacy  of  the  approach ing   doomsday  argumen t   was  “ tha t   it  ignores 
the   considerable evidence  we  already  have  tha t   man  can   in   fact  modify 
h is  behavior  fast  enough  to  avoid  the catastrophic disasters predicted by 
the  doomsday-sayers.’’  The   evidence  included  the  fac t   tha t   scarcely  a 
decade  af ter   Rachel  Carson’s  warn ing   against  pesticides  ( i n   her   book 
Silent  S p r i n g )   “those  chemicals  a re   severely  controlled-possibly 
too 
much  so-and 
biodegradable  equivalents  a r e   on  the  verge  of  be ing  
introduced.”  Lake  Michigan’s  mar ine   life  was  near ing  extinction 10 yrs  
ago ;   “by   vigorous  ecological  controls  i t   ha s   been  restored.” 
Development  and   control  of  the  rapidly  chang ing  synthetic  environ- 
ment  had   become  a s   impor tan t   a s   contending  with  na ture .   Those  who 
saw  only  evil  i n   technology  “fail  to  recognize  that  ou r   situation  would 
b e   much  worse  i f   the   search  f o r   new  technological  solutions  was 
stopped.”  The   challenge  was  “to  move  on   f rom   where  we  a r e   to  tech- 
nologies  and   ways  of  employing  them  tha t   will  avoid  uncontrollable 
effects  i n   the   fu ture .  S topp ing   science  will  shu t  off  new  knowledge  and  
weaken  our   efforts  to  reverse  the  present  situation.  Technology  alone 
is  not  the   answer,  bu t   without  technological  developments  few  answers 
a r e  likely  to  be   found.”  More  than   30  yrs   ago   Dr .   Vannevar  Bush  h ad  
called  science  the  endless  fron t ier ;   “it  rema ins   tha t   today.  The   range  
of  exciting  research  now  exceeds  tha t   which  was  imaginable  when  Dr .  
Bush  coined  the   title.”  ( T e c h  Rev ,   5/73,  10-13)

u ty   Skylab  P rog r am   Director  John  H .   Disher  sa id   a  Ju ly   27  launch 
would  give  grea ter   solar  power  input,  because  the  relation  of  the  sun  to  
orb i t   plane  a t   tha t   da te  would  give  the  spacecraft  a  greater  percentage

communications of  crews  of  the  Skylab  Orb i ta l   Workshop  (launched 
May  1 4 ) ,  af ter  meeting  with  the  Deputy  Administrator,  Dr.  George M. 
Low;  Associate  Administrator  for Manned  Space  Flight  Dale D.  Myers;

treme”  operational emergencies, and   for  medical  reasons  ( to  permit  pr i-  
vate  doctor-patient relations) . Following  objections  from  some  newsmen 
to  the  May  29  Charles  Conrad,  Jr.,  pr iva te   conversation  on   operational 
matters,  Dr.  Fletcher  had   decided  to  instruct  Mission  Control’s  Capsule 
Communicator to   query   th e  seriousness of  a  situation  before  perm i t t ing  
a  private  conversation  from  Skylab. 
Dr.  Fletcher  sa id   in   h is   new  statement  tha t   he   would  rescind  this 
instruction  because  “we  believe  i t   would  b e   impruden t   to  discourage 
requests  by  th e   crew  fo r   pr iva te   operational  communications.”  P a r a -  
phrases  of  the   communications would  b e   ieleased  to  the  press.  “We  will 
continue  t o   leave  i t   entirely  up   to  the  flight  crew  as  to  when  to  call 
fo r   such  a  conversation,  and   will  send  no  new  instructions  o r   clarifica- 
tion  of  instructions.  T h i s  decision  was  reached  so  th a t   we  would  in   no 
conceivable  way  inh ib i t   them  from   calling  for   a  private  conversation 
when  they  believe  a  need  exists,  and   so  tha t   we  will  not  jeopardize  the 
(NASA   Release  73-110) 
safety  of  the  mission.” 
*  A Chicago Tr ibune   editorial hailed  t h e  Sky lab  2  astronauts  (launched May 
25  to man   the  crippled Workshop  orbited May  14)  as  “tinkerers.”  T h e  
men  who  overcame  the  senseless  stubbornness of  inan ima te   objects  had  
been  “superlatively  tra ined   and   admirably  persistent  and   a r e   the  prod- 
ucts  of  a h igh ly   scientific  preparation.  But  the  achievement  also  reflects 
the  fine  American  heritage  of  tinkering.  T h i s  was  the   quality  tha t   en- 
abled  the P i lgr im   fa thers  to make do  with  strange, native materials when 
they  landed   on   ou r   alien  shores.”  I t  was  also  “ the   practical  genius  th a t

Walter  F.  Mondale  (D -M inn . ) ,   said  GAO  was  “not  convinced  tha t   the  
choice of  a  launch  system  should  be  based  principally  on  cost  compari-

( i s  less costly when  the  time value  of  money  is  cons idered) ,  even though 
NASA’s calculations show  tha t   i t   is.” Payload  cost was  the  ma jor   element 
in   program  cost  estimates  f o r   both  the  shuttle  and  alternate  use  of 
existing  expendable  launch  vehicles.  NASA   had   estimated  $30.2  billion 
fo r   the  shuttle and   $50.1  billion  for  the  expendable systems. The   $19.9- 
billion  difference  was  due   to  estimated  low-cost design  of  shuttle  pay- 
loads  which  could  be  recovered,  refurbished,  and   reused.  GAO   recom- 
mended  tha t   Congress  “consider  the  fu tu re   space  missions  used  in

outside  terrestrial  background  interference,  using  the  moon  fo r   occul-

At  1 7  min  af ter   launch,  the  spacecraft  separated  from  the  launch  ve-

been  sa tura ted   25%-40%   of  the  observing  time  by  interference  from 
the   earth’s  rad io   noise.  Explorer  49,  in  lunar   orbit,  would  be   shielded

Dale  D.  Myers  sa id   in   a  speech  before  the  National  Space   Club  i n

H e   praised  aerospace  industry  cooperation  in   salvaging  Skylab : “ I t  
ha s   not  been  very  well  publicized,  bu t   many  of  the  components  on   the 
sun   shield  tha t   saved  Skylab  were  fabr ica ted   by   contractors  a t   the ir  
own  plants.  The   response  from  everyone  was  tremendous.” 
Skylab  1-2  had   shown tha t   the  astronauts went  through  a  rap id  learn-  
ing  curve   i n   ad jus t ing   to  zero g  and   tha t   “often  times  one  man  is  fully 
capable  of  accomplishing  tasks that  we  had   originally planned  fo r  two.” 
NASA  also  had   learned  “ tha t   for   a  man  to  perform  efficiently  in   zero 
gravity  he   must  have  adequate,  well-designed  body  restraints,  and   tha t  
th is   was  one  area   tha t   we  probably  underdesigned  in   the  Skylab  sys- 
tem.”  The   space  shu t t le   would  merge  the   capabilities  of  manned  and  
automated  space   activities  in   one  vehicle  “where  now  they  usually 
complement  one  ano ther   i n   separate  vehicles.”  The   issue  of  manned  
versus  unmanned   space  flight  had   been  dub ious  from  the   s tar t .   “Wha t  
is  really  the   question  is  whether  we  want  to   develop  the   full  potentials 
of  space  flight  o r   only  a  part  of  them.  Because  if  you  eliminate  man  
f rom   the   loop,  you  significantly  reduce  o u r  options  to  explore and   use

press  conference:  “ I   do think  tha t   the  bicycle ergometer  . . . contributed 
to  ou r   well  being.”  Subsequent Skylab  crews  “probably  should  exercise 
longer  periods  of  time,  and   . . . add   to  the   exercise  some muscular  ex- 
ercises  ra ther   than   strictly  cardiovascular.”

surprise”  to  find  out  “how  easy  i t   was  to  live  i n   zero-g,  and   how  good 
you  felt.  It’s  easy  to  move,  it’s  easy  to  work.”  He  said  tha t   fu tu re  
missions could go  on  open-ended as long a s  the  individual  crew member 
could  “pool  a  reasonable  amount  of  blood  in  his  legs  . . . and   provided 
h is   response  to  exercise,  his  appetite,  his  body  weight,  general  feeling 
of  well  being,  and   ability  to  do  work”  continued  without  significant 
change. 
Pau l  J. Weitz said  tha t   the easy  adjustment i n  space was due  partially 
to  the  “extremely  h igh   fidelity  equipment”  on  which  they  trained. 
“There  were  many  times  tha t   you  could  look  around   and   you  really

national  scientists  discussed solar  power  a s   a n   answer  to  man’s  energy 
needs. A  working  group  of  1 3  scientists  from   developed and   developing 
countries suggested  tha t   “a   massive internationally  funded  and   directed 
research  and   development  programme  f o r   the  a t ta inmen t   of  specific 
objectives,  should  receive wide  discussion among  scientists  in   [UNESCO ]

tion  of  satellites  to  collect  solar  energy  above  the  atmosphere  should  be 
left  to  one  country  “or  should  there  be  a  cooperative worldwide  attack 
on  the  problem  with  a  provision  for  beaming  the  collected  energy  to

a r r a y  wing  dur ing  launch  May  14 reported  its  findings  and   recommen- 
dations  to   Dr.  James  C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator.  The   Board, 
chaired  by  Lewis  Research  Center  Director  Bruce  T.  Lundin,  said  the 
most  probable  cause was  inadequate  venting  of  the  pressure  in  a  tunnel 
beneath the  shield.  Differential pressure bu i ldup  in  the  tunnel had  forced 
the  shield  away  from  the   Workshop  shell  and   in to   the   supersonic  a i r  
stream.  The   shield  then  broke  the  tiedowns  holding  the  solar  a r r a y  
wings onto  the  spacecraft. About  10  min  in to   the  flight  one  solar  a r ray  
wing was torn  away completely when  i t  was  struck b y   the  exhaust plume 
of  the  2nd-stage  retrorockets.  The   remaining solar a r ray  wing would  not

Dr.  Kerwin  said  Sky lab   1-2  medical  experience  enabled  him  to  ex- 
trapolate  a  56-day mission  “without  difficulty.”  He   felt  the  inflight  por-

m igh t   “feel  a  b i t   loggier  than   we  did.”  But  Sky lab   1-2  had   demon-

we  have  shown  in   the   past  with  unmanned  satellites  tha t   par t   of  the

Development  and   P lann ing   with  Gould,  Inc.,  and   former   Presidential

Government’s  highest  level  policy  and   advisory  body  with  technical 
competence.”  He   saw  the  new  arrangement  a t   NSF  a s   unstable,  with 
“formidable and   demanding” tasks. He saw two  possible  resolutions: NSF 
could  restrict  itself  to science and  academic research  o r  it could  transcend 
i ts   historic  past  and   achieve  the  national  s ta ture   necessary  to   influence 
agencies  and   departments on  technical  programs  tha t   cut  across  operat-

Science,  Dr.  David  said,  had   not  been  downgraded.  “Science  and  
technology  will  continue  t o - b e  the   warp  and  woof  of  ou r   society,”  b u t  
the  national  scene  had   changed.  The   former  White  House  apparatus, 
1957-1965,  had   been  “more  weighted  toward  space  and   military  mat- 
ters.  Importantly,  the  appara tus  was  also  responsible f o r  development  of 
programs   to   strengthen  the  infras truc ture   of  science  and   engineering. 
. . . I n  recent years we  have seen  the emphasis shifting toward  consumer 
and   public-oriented  technologies  in   energy,  transportation,  health,  edu-  
cation,  na tura l   resources,  ecology  and   environment,  a n d   social  systems. 
This shift  br ings  with  i t  a  powerful  new  set  of  policy  issues which  illus- 
tra te   the  necessity  to  include  not  only  science and   technology,  bu t   also 
economic,  social,  legal,  and   political  factors”-consumer  markets, 
public  preferences,  and  political  beliefs,  “matters  with  which  the  
Federal  establishment  has   little  experience  or   expertise.  I t   is  i n   such

*  Skylab science and   medical  briefings  were  held  by  NASA  a t  Johnson  Space  
Center.  Results  from  the  first  Orbital  Workshop  mission,  Sk y lab   1-2 
(launched May  14  a n d  May  2 5 ) ,  were  discussed a n d   science plans  fo r  
the  Skylab  3 mission,  scheduled  for   launch  July  28,  were  announced. 
At  a n   Apollo  Telescope  Mount  briefing  Dr.  Robert  A.  MacQueen, 
a  Skylab  principal  investigator  and   High  Altitude Observatory scientist, 
said  tha t   a  first  look  a t   available  da ta   indicated  tha t   the  objectives- 
to  examine  the   solar  corona  on  a  regu lar   basis,  deduce  the   three-  
dimensional  s truc ture   and   geometry  of 
the  corona,  understand  the 
evolution  of  the  corona  and   i ts   relationship  to  the  solar  disk,  and  
understand  the  outflow  of  the  solar  wind  from   the  corona-would 
be 
met.  The   most  impor tan t   conclusion  drawn   was  tha t   “ in   appearance 
the   corona  is now  a  less  dynamic  subject  than   o ther   solar  phenomena.” 
Dr.  Edward  M.  Reeves,  Harvard   College  Observatory  scientist,  sa id  
tha t   an   ATM  scanner  had   observed  “velocity  changes  in   whole  large  
areas  of  the   Sun   in  lines  of  the  transition  region  and   the  corona  which 
have  never  before  been  seen  in  this  pa r t   of  the   spectrum.” 
A t   the   medical  science  briefing,  Dr.  Michael  W.  Whittle,  P r inc ipa l  
Coordinating  Scientist,  said  tha t   the  weight  losses of  the   three   Shy lab   2

calcium,  and   phosphorus,  the  ma jor   constituents of  muscle  tissue,  had  
appeared  in   the   ur ine   and   indicated  the  muscle  loss.  D r .   Stephen  L. 
Kimsey,  a  Skylab  principal  investigator,  said  tha t   experiments  had  
shown  “no  abnormal  changes  i n   red  cell  metabolism”  i n   amount  of 
energy  stored,  change  in   the   integrity  of  the   cell  membrane,  o r   change 
in   the  red  cells’  ability  to  transfer   oxygen  from  the   lungs   to  the  tissue. 
Dr.  Verl  R.  Wilmarth,  ea r th   resources  experiment  package  pro jec t  
scientist,  said  du r ing   a n   EREP   briefing  tha t   the  objective  of  mapp ing  
the  depression  of  the   sea  surface   of  the  Pue r to   Rican  trench  using

A t   a  briefing  on  the   corollary  experiments  Dr.  Erns t   Stuhlinger, 
Associate  Director  for   Science  a t   Marshall  Space  Flight  Center,  sa id  
tha t   the materials processing and  welding experiments would  help  verify 
methods  of  construction  and   assembly  in   weightless conditions.  Among

Du r ing  CSM  maneuvers to   rendezvous with  the Workshop,  a  leak  was

back  f rom   orbit.  Analysis  indicated  the  oxidizer  valve  was  stuck  open 
o r   partially  open.  Quad  B was  isolated;  analysis showed  tha t   all  deorbit 
mission  rules could  be  satisfied. 
T h e   CSM  rendezvoused  with  the   Workshop  a t   3:38  pm   EDT  on   the

4:OO  pm  EDT  and   began  Workshop  activation,  bu t   activation  was  cu r -  
tailed  because  the  crew  quickly  began  to  feel  motion  sickness.  Lousma 
was  experiencing  nausea  and   Bean  and   Garr io t t   were  uncomfortable. 
Bean  sa id   he   and  Garr io t t   tended  “to  be  fairly  careful  of  how  we  move. 
And   since  we  a r e   moving  ra ther   slowly,  then  it’s  t ak ing   a  little  b i t  
longer  th an  we’d  planned.” 
Motion sickness continued the  second  day,  Ju ly  29,  and  the  astronauts 
were  tak ing   scopolamine-dexedrine  tablets.  Bean  communicated,  “We 
feel okay,  except  in  the stomach.  . . . And  our   th ink ing   is tha t   we’re  not 
going to  be  able to work much  faster  than  we  a r e  r igh t   now.  . . . There’s 
a  desire  to  maybe   take  a  break   for   a n   hour   or  two  and   get  in   the  bunk  
and   s tay   still  fo r   a  while.”  Flight  Director  Neil  B.  Hutchinson  told

Still  suffering  from   motion  sickness,  the  astronauts  continued  Work- 
shop  activation  July  30  (Mission  Day  3 ) .  Th e   first  EVA  was  delayed 
t o   Aug.  2  and   later  rescheduled  to  Aug.  4  to  ensure  the  astronauts’ 
complete  recovery.  Activation  was  completed  July  31  ( M D 4 )   and  
research  began  as  the   crew  improved slightly.  Bean  told  ground  control: 
“We’re  getting  be t ter ;   it’s  jus t   taking  a  little  longer  than   we  thought. 
. . . Everybody  feels pretty  good  between  meals.  Then   mealtime  comes, 
a n d   we’re  caugh t   . . . in   the  squeeze.  We’re  t ry ing   to  decide  whether 
we  ough t   to e a t  all we  have  to  . . . to  keep  ou r  s treng th  up,  o r  eat  about 
what we  want  to,  which  isn’t  very  much.”

A  medical  briefing  below  at  Johnson  Space  Center  suggested  tha t  
moving quickly from  the  confined CM  to  the large  Workshop might  have 
contributed  to  the  motion  sickness.  The   milder  nausea  experienced  on 
the   May  25-June  22   Skylab  2  mission  could  have  been  caused  by   a 
more  gradua l   transition  in to   the  Workshop.  “1  th ink   tha t   i t   is  merely 
a ma t ter  of  room  i n  which  you  can  exercise your  vestibular mechanisms, 
and   tha t   the  workshop simply presents more  of  tha t   space.  . . . perhaps  
i t  was  too much  too  soon.” 
On Aug.  2 a master  alarm buzzer awakened  the  astronauts a t  6 :45  am  
EDT.  Pressure   and   temperature  were  falling  rapidly  in  the  CSM  reaction 
control  system  quad   D  because of  an   oxidizer  leak.  Because of  quad  B’s 
July  28 leak,  only A  and  C of  the four  quads  remained  fully  operational. 
The   quad   D  leak lasted  two  hours,  losing  a n  estimated  5 kg   ( 1 2  Ibs)  of 
nitrogen  tetroxide  oxidizer.  Apollo  Flight  Director  Glynn  S.  Lunney 
said  a t   a  morning  press  briefing  tha t   the  spacecraft  was  flyable  with 
the  loss of  the  two  quad s  but  “it  would  be  flown  i n  a  mode which  is not 
entirely  standard.’’  The   main  concern  was  “ tha t   we  have  had   two 
problems  which  a re   related,  at  least  they  seem  to  be  related.”  A  flaw 
common to  the  whole  RC S   could  necessitate  the  crew’s  immediate  re turn  
to  the  ea r th   o r   accelerated  preparation  of  the  Skylab  4  spacecraft  to 
make  it  available  a s   a  rescue  vehicle should  the   CSM  become  unusable. 
Full  activation  of  Skylab-rescue-vehicle prepara t ion   was  authorized. 
Launch  and   checkout  crews  began  working  a  24-hr-day,  7-day-week 
schedule,  p repa r ing   two  additional  couches  and   other  equipment  for  
installation.  Earliest  possible  date  for   a  rescue  mission  was  established 
a s   Sept.  5.  The   EVA rescheduled  for   Aug.  4  was  aga in   postponed,  for  
2 4   to  48  hours   to  free   the  crew  for   system  checks,  to  f r e e   ground 
controllers to  troubleshoot the problem, and   to  give time to work out  EVA 
procedures  f o r   the  new  spacecraft  configuration.  While  reentry  pro- 
cedures  were  being  rewritten  for  the  new  configuration,  the   astronauts 
continued scientific  experiments. 
By  the   afternoon  of  Aug.  2  Dr.  Christopher  C.  Kraf t ,   Jr.,  J SC  
Director,  was  able  to  tell  the  astronauts  tha t   troubleshooting  the  RCS  
had   indicated  no  appa ren t   generic  problem,  bu t   two  unique  quad   fail- 
ures,  and  there  was  now  confidence tha t   the  two  remaining  quads  would 
ensure   a t t i tude   control  should  immediate  reentry  become  necessary. 
“We’re  proceeding  . . . a s   if  we’re  going  to   have  a  normal  mission.” 
Astronaut Bean  replied:  “Fine.  You  ju s t   said  the  r igh t   words.  . . . we’re 
pretty  happy   with  the  way  things  a r e  going,  a t  the  moment  . . . and   we 
agree   100 percent with what  you  just  announced.  . . . everybody’s  happy  
up   here.” 
On  Aug.  3  Skylab  Program   Director  William  C.  Schneider  said  a t   a 
J SC  press briefing  tha t   continuing  investigation  indicated  the  two  quad  
failures were unrelated a n d  reexamination of  reentry  capabilities showed 
three  ways  of  re turn ing   to  the  ear th :   using  the   p r ima ry   service 
propulsion  system,  using  the  RCS   with  the  two  operational  quads,  and  
than   . . . yesterday  morning.’’  A  slowdown  was  ordered  i n   the  emer- 
using  the  hybr id   RCS  i n   the  CM .   “We’re  feeling  considerably  better 
gency  rescue  preparations.  The  Apollo  CM  would  be  outfitted  i n   a 
Skylab  4  configuration,  with  three  astronaut  couches  ra ther   than   the

five  needed  f o r   a  rescue  mission.  Th e   slowdown  would  delay  rescue 
readiness  until  Sept.  10. 
Astronauts  Bean,  Garriott,  and   Lousma  conducted  the ir   first  full 
day   of  experiments  and  prepared  f o r   a n   ear th   resources  experiment 
package  pass.  Garr io t t   held  the  TV  camera  a t   the  window  to  telecast 
a  good  view  of  the  U S .   from   North  Dakota  t o   North  Carolina.  Later 
the  first  of  26  EREP   passes  was  made,  to  gather  da ta   for  oil  exploration, 
ocean  temperatures,  mapping,  land  use  surveys,  crop   inventories,  and  
pollution studies. 
A  master  a larm   sounded  in   the  CSM  Aug.  4,  la ter   a t tr ibu ted   to  a 
short-circuit  in   Skylab’s  solar  telescope  system.  Th e   shor t   knocked  out 
one  of  the  two  TV  systems in   the  ATM   bu t   d id  not  affect Skylab’s  main 
power  system.  Ground  crews investigated  problems  in   the  pr imary   and  
secondary  coolant  systems  Aug.  5.  One  had   been  slowly  leaking  since 
the  Sky lab   1  launch  May  14 and   was  expected  to   become  inoperative 
in   16 to  20  days.  The   secondary  loop  was  thought  to  have  a  small  leak, 
begun  du r ing   the  Sky lab   2  mission  and   giving  the   loop  a  predicted 
60-day   lifetime.  Possibly  additional  coolant  would  have  to  be  carr ied  
u p   by  the  next  manned  mission,  Skylab  4,  bu t   Program   Director 
Schneider  said  there  was  “no  immediate  danger  to  the   crew.”  By  Aug. 
6  evaluations  showed  tha t   only  the  pr imary   loop  was  leaking;  the 
second  was  sound  and   could  operate  fo r   the   rest  of  Sky lab   3  a s  well  as  
for  Skylab 4. 
Flight  surgeon  Pau l   Buchanan’s  nightly  bulletin  said  Aug.  5  tha t   the  
crew  “continues  to  report  good  health  and   optimistic outlook”  and   had  
asked  abou t   a n   increase  in   the ir   menus  “to  match  the ir   growing  ap -  
petites.”  Fluid  in take   and   output was  “optimal.” 
Th e   first  EVA  was  performed  Aug.  6.  Garr io t t   and   Lousma  stepped 
outside  the   orb i t ing   laboratory  a t   1:30  pm  EDT  t o   install  the  3.6- by  
7.3-m  (12-  by  2 4 - f t ) ,   paper-thin,  aluminized  Mylar  awning  over  the 
Workshop  to   reflect  the  sun’s  rays  away  from  the  spacecraft  skin, 
damaged  when  the  meteoroid  shield  was  torn   off  du r in g   the   May 
launch.  Garriott,  s tand ing   i n   the   Skylab’s  open  hatch,  pieced  together 
the  two  16.8-m  (55 - f t )   poles  from  metal  sections  and   handed  them  to 
Lousma.  Lousma  attached  them  to   a  bracket  t o   form   a  “V”  over  the 
Workshop.  Th e   sunshade  was  slowly  pulled  up   by  a  system  of  pulleys. 
One   rope  kept  twisting  around   the  poles  and   the  sunshade  folds  d id  
not  straighten  immediately,  bu t   after  four   hours- tw ice  
th e   time  ex- 
pected-the 
sunshade  was  successfully  deployed.  Workshop  tempera- 
tures  were  lowered  before  the   EVA  ended.  Astronaut Bean  sa id  Garr io t t  
and   Lousma  worked  “at  a  slow  and   steady  pace”  and   were  not  tired. 
Lousma  retrieved  and   replaced  film  in  four   ATM   experiments,  installed 
two  new  cameras,  removed  a  door  latch  from   a n   ATM  experiment,  and  
fixed  the  particle-collection experiment  to  the  r im   of  the  ATM. 
Lousma  also  inspected  the  two  leaking  quads   in   the  CSM  RCS  and  
looked  for  coolant  leaks.  He   noted  some  evidence  of  micrometeorite 
p i t t ing   but  no  clues  to   causes  of  the  malfunctions.  Th e   astronauts 
completed the   EVA  at  8 : O l   pm   EDT,  af ter   6  h r s  31 min,  surpassing the  
3-hr   30-min record  set  June  7  by  Sky lab   2 Astronauts  Charles Conrad, 
Jr.,  a n d  Dr.  Joseph  P .  Kerwin. 
Garriott,  first  solar  physicist  in   space,  focused  the   ATM  cameras  on 
the  sun   Aug.  7  for  the   first  time  du r ing   the  mission.  TV  audiences 
watched  him  work  a t   the  ATM  panel.

July  28-September  25 
By  Aug.  8  D r .   Lawrence  F.  Dietlein,  JSC   Deputy  Director  f o r   Life 
Sciences,  reported  the  astronauts  were  “in  excellent  spirits  and  have  no 
health  problems.”  They  had   completely  recovered  from  motion  sickness. 
Th e i r   weights  had   stabilized  af ter   a  loss  of  1.8  to  2.3  kg   ( 4  to  5 lbs) 
each.  Data  obtained  o n   the  rotating  ch a i r   indicated  the ir   sensitivity 
to  motion  had   lifted.  Since  deployment  of  the  sunshade,  temperatures 
in   the Workshop  had   dropped  to  296  K  (74’F). 
Th e  crew  photographed  a  coronal  transient  with  the  ATM   camera  two 
hours   Aug.  10.  I t   was  the  first  time  a  transient-protons 
and   free 
electrons  expelled  violently  from   the  sun’s  limb  a t   a  speed  of  about 
312   km   (194   m i )   per   sec,  a  phenomenon  tha t   occurred  two  o r   three 
times  a  year-had 
been  observed a t   tha t   range   and   time  resolution. 
Program   Director  Schneider  announced  Aug.  14 tha t   Sky lab  3  would 
continue  its  full  59-day mission.  From  analyses  of  the  CSM  and   Work- 
shop,  he   h ad   “concluded  tha t   there  is  no  imminent  need  for   rescue, 
and   . . . we  have  made  the  decision  to  proceed  with  a  normal  test  flow 
on  a n   accelerated  basis  a t   Cape  Kennedy.”  Skylab  4  was  be ing   pre- 
pared   for   a  normal mission  but  would  be  available fo r   a  rescue mission 
if  necessary.  The   earliest  launch  date  could  be  Sept.  25.  Schneider 
said,  “We’re  reasonably  confident  tha t   [CSM]  117  is   a  good  vehicle.” 
“Looks  like  they  got  a  renewed  burst  of  confidence  down  there,”  Bean 
sa id   when  told  of  the  decision.  “We  feel  th a t   way  up  here.”  JSC   an-  
nounced  Aug.  2 1   tha t   the   astronauts  would  install  a  new  “six-pack” 
of  gyroscopes  du r ing   an   Aug.  2 4   EVA,  to  replace  faulty  ones.  Th e  
six-pack had   been  carri2d  up   on  the  Sky lab   3  CM .  
Meanwhile  the  crew  continued  with  experiments,  requesting  more 
work  Aug.  14 because  all  had  spare  time  and   “you  ju s t   can’t  sleep  8 
hours   up   here.”  They  photographed  tropical  storm  Brenda  Aug.  19  
a s  i t  moved  across theYucatan Peninsula  toward  the  Gulf  of  Mexico. 
On  Aug.  2 1  Astronaut  Bean  discovered  and   photographed  through  
ATM  telescopes  what  Skylab principal  investigator  D r .  Robert MacQueen 
called  “certainly  one  of  th e   biggest  solar  events”  seen  on   the  Skylab 
missions.  Bean  said  the   complex  series  of  events  on  the  solar  limb 
looked  “like  a  b ig   bubble”  sitting  on  the  edge  of  the  disc.  He  observed 
i t  with  the  white  l igh t   coronagraph  and   x-ray   instruments  and   reported 
i t   to  be  three   four ths   the  size  of  the  sun.  NASA  scientists  alerted  other 
facilities  to  make  observations  from  ground  instruments  and   other 
satellites.  Dr.  MacQueen  sa id   the  event  might  have  been  caused  by   an  
explosion  on  the  back   side  of  the   sun.  “ I t   was  a beau t ifu l   event.”  T h e  
crew “d id   a  fine job.’’ 
tha t   the   Sky lab   3  crew  h ad  
Schneider  announced  Aug.  2 3   (MD-27) 
been  given  permission  to  continue  the  mission  f o r   another  seven  days. 
Dr.  Willard  R .   Hawkins,  J SC   Deputy  Director  of  L ife   Sciences  fo r  
Medical  Operations,  told  the  press  tha t   he   saw  nothing  in   the   medical 
the  mission,  and   . . . we  feel  we  can   go  the   full  59  days   as  planned.” 
da ta   thus   f a r   “that  would  indicate  th a t   we  could  not  press  on  with 
EVA-2  began  a t   1 2 ~ 2 4  pm  EDT  Aug.  2 4  with  AM   depressurization 
by   Lousma  and   Garriott.  Lousma  completed  installation  of  the   six 
redesigned  gyros  mounted  inside  the  spacecraft  by  connecting  cables 
to   a  computer  system  outside,  and   the  new  gyro  system  was  pu t   into 
operation.  Th e   astronauts  installed  a  sail  sample  on   a  h and   rail  to  test 
durability,  replaced  ATM  film,  retrieved  and   stored  cassettes  from  one

experiments,  concluding  EVA-2  a t  4:31  pm  EDT,  a f t e r  4  hrs  30  min. 
At  8:Ol  am  EDT  Aug.  25  (MD-29)  the  Sky lab  3  astronauts surpassed 
the  single-mission endurance  ma rk   of  28  days   50  m in   set  in   Ju n e   by  
Sky lab   2.  They  had   completed  404  ear th   orb i ts   a n d   h ad   traveled  18.5 
million  km  (11 .5  million  m i ) .   And  a t   6:11   am   EDT  Sept.  5  ( M D 4 0 )  
Astronaut  Bean  surpassed  the   space  flight  record  for   one  man  of  49 
days   3  h r s   38  min  36  sec,  set  in   June   by  Charles  Conrad,  Jr.,  on  
Sky lab  2. 
EVA-3  began  a t   7:18  am   EDT  Sept.  22.  Bean  and   Garriott  moved 
through  space  to  retrieve and   replace ATM   film  and   retrieve experiments 
and   parasol  samples.  EVA  operations  ended  a t  9:59   am  EDT,  af ter   2  h r s  
41 min. 
Du r ing   the  mission,  spiders  Arabella  and   Anita  first  spun  webs  in  
corners  of  the ir   cage,  without  the   normal  circular  pattern.  Each  day, 
however,  each  improved web  formation,  add ing   more  radials,  ad jus t ing  
to  weightlessness.  Garriott  said  of  Arabella  Aug.  9  tha t   “she  learned 
very  rap id ly   i n   zero-g without  the  benefit  of  any  previous  experience.” 
She   “figured  out  a  very  nice  solution  to   the  problems of  zero  gravity.” 
La ter   ground  controllers  told  Garriott  t o   share   h is   filet  mignon  with 
the   spiders  to   keep  them  alive  for   the  entire  mission.  Anita,  however, 
was  found  dead  Sept.  16, possibly  from  inadequate  diet. 
September  24-25:  Th e  Workshop  was  deactivated  and,  on  Sept.  25, 
the  CSM  powered  up. Th e  CSM  undocked  f-rom the Workshop  a t  3:34  pm 
EDT,  separa t ing  a t   3 :50. The   service propulsion  system  engine made  the 
deorbit  maneuver  a t   5:38  pm   EDT  and   the  CM   splashed  down  upside 
down  a t  6:20  pm   EDT  400  km  (250 m i)   southwest of  San  Diego,  Calif. 
Th e  astronauts  righted  the  CM   and  remained  inside until  the  recovery 
sh ip  U.S.S.  N e w   Orleans  maneuvered  alongside  and   a  crane   lifted  the 
CM   aboard.  Immediate medical  examinations found  the  crew  in  excellent 
spirits  and   surprisingly  good  condition.  Blood  pressures  and   hear t   rates 
were  within  norma l   range.  T h e   astronauts  would  rema in   aboard   sh ip  
in   S an   Diego  f o r   physical  checks  and  would  fly  t o   Houston  Sept.  26. 
They would  be  quarantined  fo r  one week. 
T h e  Shylab  3  mission  achieved  its  pr imary   objectives  of  performing 
unmanned  S a tu rn  Workshop  operations,  reactivating  the   Skylab  orb i ta l  
assembly  in  ear th   orbit,  ob ta in ing   medical  da ta   f o r   use  i n   extending 
manned  space  flights,  and  performing  inflight  experiments.  Despite 
mission  problems,  150%  of  scheduled  ATM  observing  t ime   was  accom- 
plished  and   EREP  sensors were  operated  on  39  Z-axis local  vertical  d a t a  
run s   and   5  solar  inertial  da ta   runs,  completing  218  of  the  386  ear th  
resources  task  sites.  All  medical  experiments  were  successfully  carr ied  
out.  All  bu t   one  of  the  corollary  experiments  achieved  or   exceeded 
objectives.  Of  13  student  experiments,  9  were  completed.  Added  un- 
scheduled  tests  and   experiments  had  significantly  increased  the  da ta  
yield  above  premission  p lann ing   and   Skylab  was  left  in   a n   excellent 
position  to   complete  the  final  SL-4  mission.  Sky lab   3  was  officially 
ad judged   a  success Oct.  11. 
Ma jor   records  set  by  the   mission  included  the   longest-duration 
manned  space  flight  to  date,  59  days   11 hrs  9 m i n ;   the  longest  cumula- 
tive  time  in   space  for   one  man,  69  days   for   Bean  (who  had   spent  10 
days  on   the  Nov.  14-24,  1969, Apollo  12 mission)  ; th e  longest distance

was  “taking  all  the  steps  we  know  how  to  prevent  a  fu tu r e  fa i lure   due  
t o  similar  causes in  other  programs.” 
Director  Bruce  T.  Lundin  of  Lewis  Research  Center  testified  that, 
throughout  six  years  of  reviews  and   certifications,  “the  principal  atten- 
tion  devoted  to  the  meteoroid  shield was  th a t  of  achieving a  satisfactory 
deployment.  Never  d id   the  matter  of  aerodynamic  loads  on  th e   shield 
or   aeroelastic  interactions  between  the  shield  and   its  external  pressure 
environment  dur ing   launch  receive  the   attention  and   understanding 
du r ing   the  design  and   review  process  which  in   retrospect  i t   deserved.” 
Th e   omission  h ad   not  been  surprising.  “From  the  beginning,  a  basic 
design  concept  and   requirement  was  tha t   the  shield  be  t igh t   to  the 
tank.”  Th e   question  of  whether  the  shield  would  remain  tight  against 
the   tank  under  the  dynamics  of  flight  through  the  atmosphere  “was 
simply  not  considered  i n  any   coordinated  manner.”  Possibly  contribut- 
i n g   to  the   oversight  “was  the  basic  view  of  the  meteoroid  shield  as  a 
piece  of  structure.’’  No  full-time subsystem  engineer  h ad   been  assigned 
to   the  shield.  “While  i t   is  recognized  tha t   one  cannot  have  a  full-time 
engineer on  every piece  of  equipment, it i s .  . . possible  tha t   the complex 
interactions  and   integration  of  aerodynamics,  structure,  rigging  pro-

in   Navy  service  and   the  first  of  two  destroyer-size SESS,  with  speeds to 
177 km  per   h r ,   was  to  be   added  by  1978. The   USN  was buy ing   2  of  30

N ew   York   T im e s :  “Since  the  Soviet M IRV   tests  have  been  anticipated

the  Soviets’  giant  missiles-especially

be  menacing  indeed.”  I t   was 
“precisely  this  Soviet potential  which  argues  for   a  serious,  effective and  
non-wasteful approach  to  the  circumstances  in  which  we  now  find  our-  
selves.  This  . . . is  no  time  to  proceed  with  turkeys  and   lemons,  or   to

came  true.”  Before the  issue  of  phasing  ou t   the  present  U.S.  arsenal  in

President  Nixon  submitted  to  Congress  Science  Indicators, 
1972, the  fifth  annua l   repor t   of  the  National  Science Board  of  the  Na- 
tional  Science Foundation.  The  proportion  of  the  gross national  product 
spen t   f o r   research  a n d   development  1963-1971  declined  i n   the   U S . ,  
France,  and   the  United  Kingdom,  bu t   increased  in  the  U.S.S.R.,  Japan ,  
a n d  West Germany.  By  1971, U S .  R&D   expenditures were  2.6%  of  GNP, 
Soviet  3.0%,  U.K.  a n d   West  Germany  2.0%,  a n d   Japan   and   France  
1.8% each. T h e  number   of  scientists  and   engineers engaged  in   R&D   per  
1 0  000 persons  declined in   the U S .  af ter   1969, bu t   continued  to  increase 
i n  the U.S.S.R.,  Japan ,  West Germany, and  France. All countries reduced 
the  national  defense  proportion  of  the ir   R&D   expenditures  significantly 
between  1961 and   1969. U S .  defense expenditures  dropped  from   6 5%  
to  49%   of  total  Government  R&D   spending.  Increases  in   the  U S .   and  
most  other  countries  occurred  in  space,  community  services,  and   eco- 
nomic  development. 
T h e   U S .   had   a  favorable  but  declining  “patent  balance”  between 
1966  a n d   1970,  with  a  reduced  number   of  pa ten ts   of  U S .   origin  in  
France,  West  Germany,  and   the  U.K.  and   increased  U S .   patents  of 
Japanese  origin.  The  U S .  had   a n  increasingly favorable  position  in   the 
patents,  techniques,  formulas, 
sale  of  “technical  know-how”-including 
franchises,  and   manufac tur ing   rights-during 
1960-1971 ; Japan   was 
the   ma jo r   purchaser,  surpassing  all  of  Western  Europe  af ter   1967. The  
favorable  U S .   balance  of  trade   in   technology-intensive products  grew 
1960-1971,  bu t   was  increasingly  negative  in   nontechnology-intensive 
areas. W i th in   technology-intensive areas,  produc ts  with  the  fastest r is ing

national  security.  . . . The   a rm s   limitation  agreement  signed  with  the

b e   done  to  ensure  continued  stability and   to  support  our   negotiation  of 
a  permanent  strategic  a rm s   agreement.  A  vigorous  research  and   devel- 
opment program  is  essential  to  provide  vital  insurance tha t   no  adversary 
will  ever  ga in   a decisive advantage  through  technological break through  
and   tha t   massive  deployment  expenditures  will  therefore  not  become 
necessary.  Yet  the  Congress is  in   the  process  of  slashing  research  and

*  A  Baltimore  S u n   editorial  commented  on  NASA’S  problems  with  the   Office 
of  Management  and   Budget:  OMB   had   promised  NASA  about  $3.4  billion 
annually,  b u t   OMB  impoundment  of  funds   had   cu t   NASA’s FY  1974 
budget to  about $3 billion  and  “ i t  appears OMB  will hold the space agency 
to  abou t  $3.235  billion  in   fiscal  1975.”  Inflation  had   aggravated  NASA’s 
problems  and   $85 million  had   been  cu t   from   the   FY  1974  shuttle  de- 
velopment  budget.  “But  now  NASA  is  suggesting  what  some  aerospace 
contractors a re  stating  explicitly:  Tha t   if   the   OMB   squeeze stays  on,  then  
NASA  will  have  to  cut  back  on  new  s tar ts  in   scientific  programs.  Th is   is 
an   odd  irony,  indeed,  since  the  very  purpose  of  the   shuttle  is  to  serve 
these  new  programs.”  The   S u n   felt  “ tha t   if  NASA  accountants  a r e   told 
to  sharpen   the ir   pencils  they  can  keep  the  shuttle  alive  a s  well  as  pro- 
vide  f o r   initiation  of

ergy   was  recognized  a s   a  “currently  viable  and   relatively  unpolluting

ommending  a  program   to   develop  necessary  technologies  and   “to  syn- 
thesize  these  into pilot plants capable of  generating power from  a variety 
of  geothermal  sources.”  An  advantage  of  geothermal  energy  was  “ tha t  
construction  of  power  plants  can   b e   carr ied   out  in   a  relatively  shor t  
time.”  With  solution  of  the  technical  problems  in   ex trac t ing  the  earth’s 
hea t   and   converting  i t   into  electricity,  “the  commercial  impac t   of  geo- 
thermal  energy  could  begin  to   be  felt  within  this  decade.  Geothermal 
energy  is,  therefore,  counted  on   to  contribute  a t   least  regionally  to  a 
resolution  of  the  energy  crisis  in   the  shor t   term   as   well  a s   to  provide

The   program,  be ing   carr ied   out  by  Je t   Propulsion  Labora tory   with  as- 
sistance  from   Lewis  Research  Center,  was  “an   exciting  experimental 
effort  to  b r ing   old  a n d   new  technology  to  bear   on  one  of  the  ma jor  
problems  of  modern  society.” 
I n  Pha se  1, begun  i n  April  for conclusion i n  December, small amounts 
of  hydrogen  gas were  being  injected  in to   a  lean  gasoline  a n d   a i r  mix- 
tu re   to  be   burned   in   a  s tandard   automobile engine,  first  i n  a  labora tory  
and   la ter   in   an   opera t ing   automobile  with  bottled  hydrogen  carr ied   in  
its  trunk.  Pre l im inary   labora tory   tests  had   shown  “a  significant  reduc- 
tion  in   pollution  without  a n   increase  in   fuel  consumption.  I n   fact,  our  
preliminary  figures ind ica te   tha t   hydrogen  injection  may  even  produce 
a  fuel  sav ing .   Th i s   comes  both  from  the   d irec t   effect  of  the   hydrogen 
on  the  combustion  process  and   from  the  better  atomization  of  the  fuel 
mixture.”  Work  was  progressing  a t   LeRC  on  a  labora tory   model  of  a 
generator  in  which  the  hydrogen  would  be  produced  from   gasoline  and  
water.  Phase   2 would  attempt  to  solve  engineering  problems  in   in tegra t-

the   austere  domain  of  space,  as on  Earth,  how  quickly  does  the  miracu-

Sh ikar in ,   accord ing   to  a  Vienna  correspondent  quoted  by   Znteravia. 
The   Soviet  shuttle  would  consist  of  two  vehicles  coupled  pick-a-back, 
each  in   delta  configuration  and   designed  for   hypersonic  opera t ing  
speeds. One  would  be   the  booster,  the  other  the  orbiter.  The spacecraft 
was  designed fo r  horizontal  takeoff  from   a  runway. The  manned  booster 
would  ca r ry   the  orb i ter   until  i t   attained  a  22-km-per-sec (4900   mph )  
speed  corresponding  to  a  2-  to  3-g  acceleration.  The  stages would  sepa-  
ra te   a t   about  a  30-km  (19 -m i )   altitude  and   the  booster  would  descend 
in   a controlled glide  to  land  on  the  runway. The   orbiter  would  accelerate 
to  a  more  than   100-km  (60 -m i )  altitude,  complete i ts  mission, and   glide 
back  to  the  ear th .   Construction was  expected to  begin  du r ing   the  1970s.

Symposium  and   Display  in   Moscow  and   a  subsequent  visit  to   Tokyo. 
The  Subcommittee  had  found  tha t   “although  military  and   space  par i ty  
had   been  achieved  with  the  United  States,  the  U.S.S.R.  is f a r  behind  in  
virtually  all  consumer  products.  There   a re   also  g lar ing   weaknesses  in  
certain  areas   of  high  technology.”  Soviet leaders  had   accepted  the  fac t  
that,  “if  the ir  plans  for  the  massive expansion  and   improvement of  the ir  
commercial a i r  transportation system a re  to succeed within  the  proposed 
time  frame ,   assistance  will  be  required  from  abroad   where  superior 
technology  exists.  We  believe  the  U S .   aerospace  indus try   is  the   best, 
though  not  the  only,  source  for   such  high  technology  products,  and  
evidently  the  responsible  Soviet  officials  th ink   so,  too.”  A s   one  of  the  
world’s  most highly  developed technological countries,  Japan  had   “much 
to  offer  to  any   cooperative  venture  in  science  or   space.”  The   Subcom-

The  “much  vaunted  European  challenge” to  U S .  aerospace  industry  would 
remain  a  myth,”  a n   Znteravia  editorial  said.  Recent  agreements  fo r  
bL 
U S .  companies  to  provide  European  manufac turers  access to  the ir   h igh  
technology might  seem  against  U S .   interests,  but  “such  agreements a r e  
in   fact  usually  followed  by   orders   fo r   US.-designed  aircraft.”  I t   was 
not  simply  tha t   the  currency  crisis  ha s   made  the  US  produc t   much 
L C  
cheaper  than   the   competitive European  design,  bu t   also  tha t   the  Ameri- 
cans  a r e  in   a  position  to  contract out  production work on  a proven  sales 
success.”  European  commercial a ircraf t   industry  products would  “never 
achieve the  success expected of  them.”  Europe’s total  share  of  the  West- 
e rn  market  for  commercial aircraft-just  over 9%-was 
“steadily  drop-  
p ing   a s   the  early  model  BAC  111s  and   Caravelles  a r e  withdrawn  from 
service  and   there  a re   no  advanced  versions  to  replace  them.”  However 
temp t ing   technologically  the  advanced  commercial  a ircraf t   offered  by  
European  industry  might  be,  “they  a r e   not  what  many  airlines  want 
in  the present  economic climate.” There  “seems little o r  no  inclination  i n  
Europe  to  accept inter-dependence in high  technology areas. There  is ap -  
parently  more  of  a  readiness to  cooperate across the Atlantic than   across 
the   European  frontiers.  If  the  European  aerospace  industry  wishes  to 
remain  a  viable,  independent  force  on  the   world  scene,  then  the   time

ing   this  p r ima ry   mission,  we  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  user 
agencies i n  government  and  with  the aerospace industry.”  NASA  also was 
transferr ing   its  technology  and   experience  to  nonaerospace  sectors  of 
the economy and  helping other Government agencies solve societal  prob-

some available manpower,  a t  a  time  when  the  Environmental Protection 
Agency  a n d   o ther   government  departments  need  our   help.”  NASA  had  
“un ique   capabilities  to  help  b r ing   into  being  a pollution-free,  resource- 
saving hydrogen  economy, and   to  facilitate extensive use  of  the  ultimate 
energy  source,  solar  power.”  NASA’s traditional  function  a s  the  Nation’s

sun.  Th e   en t ire   electromagnetic  spectrum  had   been  opened  to  man’s 
examination  by  study  of  s tars   in   ultraviolet  and   x-ray.  Observations 
f rom  NASA-launched weather  satellites had   enabled  forecasters to  observe 
weather  systems  from   space  as   they  developed  and   to  forecast  the ir  
effects a s  they moved  into  inhabited  par ts  of  the world.  Man h ad  learned 
what  instruments  in  space  could  provide  in   information  about  th e  
earth’s  resources  and   their  efficient  use  to  facilitate  decision  making, 
improve  the   lot  of  developing  countries,  and   preserve  and   improve 
conditions  in  countries like  the  U S .  
NASA   h ad   provided  technological  advancements  to  preserve  the   U S .  
position  as world  leader  in civil and  military  aeronautics. The  jo in t  NASA, 
A ir   Force, and  Navy X-15  rocket-powered a i r c r a f t  program had,  du r ing  
10  y r s   of  flight,  studied  effects  of  hypersonic  flight  on  a ircraf t   skin 
friction  and   thermal  expansion,  pioneered  the   use  of  ablative  coatings, 
aided  efficient  s truc tura l   design,  and   served  a s  a  workhorse  test-bed  f o r  
nearly  40  experiments.  NASA  contributions also  included  the  single-pivot 
variable-sweep  wing,  which  allowed  efficient  flight  a t   both  h igh   and  
low  speeds;  supercritical  wing  and   fuselage  shapes  tha t   permitted  a n  
a ircraf t   to   cruise  a t   15% higher  speed  without  increased  fuel  consump- 
t ion ;   and   the  world‘s  first  digital  fly-by-wire  control  a i r c r a f t   with 
a  computer-controlled electronic  system.  The   clean  combustion  program 
was providing new  concepts t o  reduce pollution  from engine exhaust. Th e  
a i r c r a f t  noise-abatement program  focused on development  of  a n  avionics 
system,  refinement  of  operational  procedures,  and   the  demonstration  of 
two-segment  flight  pa ths   f o r   qu ie ter   land ing   approaches.  T h e   refan 
program   was  demonstrating  JT8D  engine  and   nacelle  modifications  to  
reduce  noise  of  existing je t   aircraft. 
I n   applications  the  knowledge  gained  in   15 yrs   was  be ing   applied  in  
science,  medicine,  navigation,  communications,  agriculture,  cr ime   pre- 
vention,  and   commerce.  NASA-developed  technologies  were  producing 
safer   buildings,  bridges,  and   a i r c r a f t   and   improved  tires,  roads,  and  
railbeds.  I n   international  cooperation,  NASA  had   conducted  18  coopera- 
tive  satellite and   space probe  projects and   flown  2 5  international  experi- 
ments  on   i ts   spacecraft.  T h e   global  system  of  Intelsat  communication 
satellites comprised  1 2  satellites launched by  NASA. 
Ahead  were  completion  of  Skylab  4,  th e   th ird   and   final  manned 
Skylab mission ; the  July  1975  jo in t  US-U.S.S.R.  Apollo-Soyuz mission 
t o   dock  a  U S .   and   a  Soviet  spacecraft  in  space;  and   the  introduction 
of  the  revolutionary  space shuttle with  its European-built Spacelab in  the  
1980s.  I n   unmanned  exploration  Mariner  10, scheduled  fo r   launch  to- 
ward   Mercury  and   Venus  i n   early  November,  was  expected  to  provide 
the   first  photos  of  Mercury.  Pioneer  10   was  headed  fo r   a  year-end 
rendezvous with  Jup i ter ,   and  Pioneer  11  (launched  April  5 ,   1973)   was 
scheduled  f o r   a  second  reconnaissance  of  Jup i ter   i n   December  1974. 
Work was proceeding on  two Mar iner  spacecraft for   1977  launch toward 
Jupiter  and   Sa turn .  
Ma jor   thrusts  expected  for   the   1980s  were  outlined  in   a  statement 
released  to  the  press  by   Dr.  Homer  E.  Newell,  NASA  Associate  Ad-

A  47-member  NASA   delegation  led  by   Apollo-Soyuz  Test 
Pro jec t   Director  Glynn  S.  Lunney  met  with  Soviet  coun terpar ts   in  
Moscow  for   two  weeks  of  discussions of  technical  problems of  the   jo in t  
US.-U.S.S.R.  mission  scheduled  f o r   July  1975. Discussions culminated

Deputy  Administrator,  and   Academician  Boris  N .  Petrov,  Chairman  of 
the  Intercosmos Council of  the Soviet Academy of  Sciences. Dr.  Low had

Center,  and   the   Space   Flight  Control  Center. 
I n   an   Oct.  18  communique  D r .   Low  and   Academician  Pe trov   con- 
firmed  the i r   satisfaction  with  the  ASTP  project  status.  All  ma jo r   mile- 
stones  were  be ing   met  on  schedule  and ,   Dr .   Low  said,  progress  made 
indicated  tha t   the   scheduled  launch  date  could  be   met.  Soyuz  orb i ta l  
a n d   Apollo  docking  module  drawings  had   been  exchanged  a n d   agree- 
ment  had   been  reached  tha t   U S .   specialists would  par t ic ipa te   in   pre- 
flight  final  checkout  of  flight  equipment  a t   the   Soviet  launch  site. 
Specialists  would  be   exchanged  to   fit-check  compatible  equipment  a t  
U S .   and   U.S.S.R.  launch   sites.  Academician  Petrov  told  the  press  tha t  
U S .   specialists  would  b e  permitted  a t   the   Soviet launch  site  “ u p   to  the  
very  m inu te  of  launching.” 
Du r ing   the  visit  U S .   officials learned   the   dea ths  of  three  cosmonauts 
on  Soyuz  11  June   30,  1971, were  caused  by   accidental  tr igger ing   open 
of  an   exhaust valve  ra the r   than   by  a hatch  leak.  The  valve tr ipped   open  
just  af ter   the  reentry  capsule separa ted  from   the  larger   orb i t ing  module 
in   a  maneuver  including  f ir ing   of  12  explosive  bolts.  At  least  two  crew 
members  tr ied   to  close  the   valve  bu t   were  unable  to  move  fast  enough. 
Unconsciousness  from   rap id   decompression  came  in   less  than   10  sec ;  
ground  tests  showed  i t   would  take  27  sec  to   close  the  valve  by   hand .

Dr.  Owen  K.  Garr io t t  and   Jack  R.  Lousma-said 
tha t   the  crew’s  health 
had   been  “good  the  whole  time.”  Sufficient exercise,  meals on  time,  and  
plenty of  sleep had   accounted fo r  the ir  happiness and  well-being. Having 
a scientist-astronaut aboard  had  created a “grea ter  variety of  interchange 
around  the  d inner   table,”  mak ing   “a  better  mission  fo r   everybody.” 
The   mission  would  have  been  “50%  less  productive  if  Owen  had   not 
been  there.  He   added  a  grea t   amount  to  i t   . . . because his  point  of  view 
is,  jus t   different.”  Garriott  said  tha t   a  longer  mission  would  necessitate 
a  somewhat  less  strenuous  program,”  but  he  could  have  spent  eight 
6 C  
hours  a  day   a t   the  wardroom  window  with  a  camera  in   each  hand   and  
a  good  supply of  film  “and   never  have  any  tendency  to  become bored.” 
Lousma said  he  still  felt  “a  little less energetic”  than   before  the mission, 
bu t   within  two  weeks  “I’ll  be  back  to  the  same  condition.” 
Dr .   Willard  R.  Hawkins,  JSC Deputy  Director  of  Life  Sciences  f o r

Alfred  A.  Bishop, Manager  of  the  J S C  Missions Office,  said  tha t ,   a f te r  
the   first  two weeks  of  acclimation,  the  Skylab 4 crew  would  p e r f o m  28  
man-hours   of  experiments  each  day,  an   increase  from  the  19 to  221/2 
man-hours  on  Sky lab  3 .  T h e   increase would  provide  a n   additional  200

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1973 

*  Aerospace Indus tr ies  Assn.  of  America,  Inc.,  issued  its semiannual analysis 
of  aerospace  employment. Continued  restraints  in   Government  spending 
and   an   increase  in   foreign  competition  f o r   existing marke ts  were  cited 
a s   causes  of  an   expected  continued  decline  in  aerospace  indus try   em- 
ployment  through  June   1974. Employment  had   dropped  by   33%  since 
1968.  Nearly  950000   persons  had   been  employed  in   June   1973,  bu t  
by   June   1974 payrolls  were  expected  to  have  been  cut  by  about  32 000. 
The   most  significant  decline would  be  among  scientists  and   engineers- 
a  reduction  of  6000,  3.6%  below  December  1972. Employment  of  pro-  
duction workers was expected to  decline by  13 000 jobs,  leaving 460 000 
employed  by  the  end  o f  FY  1974. Missiles  and   space   employment  was 
expected to  decline by  28  000 workers between December  1972 and  June  
1974. Aircraft  group  employment faced  a similar period of  decline,  from  
556 000  to  533 000.  Employment  i n   the   helicopter  and   general-aviation 
field was  expected  to  increase 500  from   June   1973,  resulting  in   a  work 
force   of  22 500  by  June   1974. Employment  in   the   general-aviation a i r -

different  orbits,  had  facilitated studies of  many  regions  of  earth‘s  rad ia-  
tion  belts,  including  those where  no  space  station  had   been  before.  H e  
hypothesized  the  existence  of  an   “unstable  radiation  zone”  beyond  the 
outer  rad ia t ion   belt where  Soviet Electron  satellites  had   recorded  a flux 
of  electrons with  energies over  150  000 ev.  He  believed the  zone  to  be  a 
necessary  link  i n   the  formation  of  the  earth’s  rad ia t ion   belts.

ing  National Medal of  Science winners  [see Oct. 31 : “How serious Nixon 
is  about  achieving  the  objectives  cited  in   his  remarks  will  be  indicated 
by   fu ture   budgetary  activities.  I n   recent  months,  however,  there   ha s  
been  plenty  of  evidence tha t   the  Administration  wants  to  make  changes 
not  only  i n   the  substance  of  science  policy,  bu t   also  i n   the   way  tha t  
policy  is made.  The  most  obvious  indicator  was  the   sh if t   of  the   science 
advisory appara tus  from  the White House to  NSF.  Underlying the change 
seems  to  have  been  not  just  a  dissatisfaction  with  the   science  advisory 
machinery,  bu t   also  with  the  basic  relationship  between  the   scientific 
community and   its federal pa trons  which ha s  prevailed  since World W a r

Dr.  Fletcher  presented  1973  Payload  Model:  Space  Opportunities 
1973-1991,  a  study  of  the  number   a n d  kinds  of  payloads  tha t   could be  
launched  through   1991  with  the  space  shuttle  and   Spacelab  using 
budgets  at  the  FY  1973 level. The  study was  not  a  program   plan  bu t   a n  
estimate of  k inds  of  payloads  tha t   could be   flown.  Dr.  Fletcher  felt  “the 
full  range   of  the  space  capability  offered”  by   the  a u t t l e   was  even 
grea ter   than   the  model  indicated. 
Anticipated possible annua l  space payloads  for  all NASA  programs  and  
the   user  community,  excluding DOD,  began  with  1 2  i n   1973  and   moved 
through  18  in   1974,  38   in   1980  (when  the  shuttle  was  to  begin  its 
operational  pha se ) ,   61 i n   1985, to  70  i n   1990  and   59  i n   1991. The   70  
payload  opportunities  in   1990  included  2 1   automated  and   2 7   sortie 
(Space lab)   payloads  for  NASA  and   17 automated  and   5 sor t ie   f o r   non- 
NASA,  non-DOD  users.  Anticipated  requirements  through   1991  totaled 
810  payloads,  572   for   NASA  a n d   238  for   nOn-NASA,  non-DOD  users.  NASA 
and   o ther   nO n -DOD   agencies  were  expected  to  use  69%  of  the   shuttle 
traffic  a n d  DOD  31%. 
The   model  anticipated  NASA  automated  payloads  through  1991 might 
include  77   f o r   astronomy,  43  for   physics, 49  fo r   planetary  exploration, 
8  lunar ,   2 6   life  science,  53  ear th   observations,  22  ea r th   and   ocean

A  need  “ to  sh if t  gears and   re turn   to  the  main  l ine  of  development in   space 
flight”  was  underlined  by  Michael  A .   G.  Michaud  in   a  Spaceflight 
article:  The   purposes  of  space  flight  “go  fa r   beyond  our   lifetime.  U1- 
timately,  o u r   journey  away  from  Ear th   will  determine  the  fu tu re   of 
the  human   race ; this  millennial,  evolutionary  effort  must  not  founder 
now  f o r   lack  of  a  satisfying  rationale.”  The  basic  purpose  of  space 
flight  was  “ to   expand  the   realm  of  Man.”  Reasons  were  to  challenge 
human   abilities,  learn  more  about  the  universe  we  live  in,  search  f o r  
extraterrestrial  intelligence  and   prepare   fo r   contact with  it,  develop and  
test  technologies for   ear th   use,  stimulate  and   employ  advanced  sectors 
of  the  economy,  improve  orb i ta l   applications of  space  technology  with 
immediate benefits,  develop and   test military  technology, and   encourage 
international  cooperation.  Michaud  proposed  a  medium-term  program 
to  the   year   2000  to  assemble  a  manned  space  station  in   ea r th   orbit, 
build  a  base  on  the  moon,  land human  beings on Mars  by  2000, prepare  
fo r   interstellar  flight,  search  for   planets  in   other  systems,  a;”d  begin  the

neering-possibly

the  first  two  of  Jupiter’s  outer  moons,  and   on  Nov.  9 a n d   11 i t   crossed 
the   orb i ts   of  P a n   and   Andrastea. 
A t   a Nov.  19 press  briefing  a t   ARC  Dr .   John  E.  Naugle,  NASA  Asso- 
ciate Administrator  fo r   Space Science, said  tha t   low  temperature  in  tha t  
a r e a   of  the  solar  system  slowed  evolution  and   scientists  hoped  to   find 
objects  not  very  different  from  what  they  were a t   the ir   formation. “The 
passage  of  Pioneer  10 past  Jup i te r   also  marks  the  gateway  to  the  ex- 
ploration  of  the  ou ter  solar  system. This  is  an   exploration  which  is  crit- 
ical  if  we  truly  want  to  understand  the  formation  and   evolution  of  our  
solar  system.”  Dr.  William  H.  Kinard,  Langley  Research  Center  scien- 
tist,  said  tha t   Pioneer  10  had   encountered  100  times  more  space  dust 
than   expected  du r ing   the  journey   between  the  Asteroid  Belt  a n d   Jup i-  
ter.  He  expected  tha t   30   times  more  particles  would  be  detected  a s   the 
spacecraft  neared  Jupiter. 
Pioneer  10 crossed  the  orb i ts   of  Jupiter’s  moons  Demeter,  Hera ,   and  
Hestia  Nov.  22  and   was  11 400 600  km  ( 7  084  000  m i )   from   Jup i ter .  
By  Nov.  25   a  charged  particle  detector  aboard   the  spacecraft  had  
begun  to  show  traces of  particle  radiation.  Preliminary  indications were 
tha t   the   probe  was  beginning  to  cross in to   Jupiter’s  magnetosphere,  es- 
timated  to  be   2 0  times  stronger  than   the  earth’s.  The   planet’s  radiation 
belts  contained  particle  concentrations  up   to  1 million  times  h igher  
than   the   earth’s  Van  Allen  Belt  and   were  considered  by  some  scientists 
to  be  extremely  dangerous  to  the  spacecraft’s electronics.  At  a  distance 
of  8 336 400  km  ( 5  180 000  m i )   from  Jup i ter ,   spacecraft  instruments 
began  re tu rn ing   pictures  of  Jupiter’s  great  red  spot. 
T h e  final  spacecraft-attitude change  before  encounter was made  Nov. 
26   and   a  24-hour  day  of  imag ing   and  polarimetry  began.  At  3:30  pm 
EST  Nov.  26  Pioneer  10 successfully crossed  Jupiter’s  bow  shock  wave 
a t   a  distance  of  7 7 0 9 0 0 0   km  ( 4 7 9 0 0 0 0  mi)-with 
great  turbulence 
when  the  so lar  wind  h i t   Jupiter’s  magnetic  field. The   spacecraft was un- 
affected by   the  turbulence hu t   da ta   from 6 of  i ts  11 instruments changed 
dramatically.  So lar   wind  speed  abruptly  decreased  to  half  the   normal 
velocity  and   solar  wind  temperatures  rose  sharply.  On  Nov.  27,  a t   a 
distance  of  6 760 000  km  ( 4  200 000  m i )   from  Jup i ter ,   the  spacecraft 
crossed  in to   the   planet’s  t rue   magnetic  envelope,  the   region  of  in ter-  
planetary  space  into  which  the  solar  wind  could  not  penetrate.  Pioneer 
10 crossed  the  magnetopause,  entering  the   magnetic  field  f o r   the   first 
time  a t  3 :30   pm  EST. 
A t   a  Nov.  29  press  briefing  ARC  scientists  said  new  da ta   had   shown 
the   reach  of  Jupiter’s  magnetic  field  to  be  grea ter   than   predicted.  I t  
stretched more  than   1 3  000 000 km  (8 000 000 m i )   i n   diameter  and   i ts  
strength  was  4 0   times  tha t   of  the  earth‘s  magnetic  field.  I t s   direction 
was  south,  ra ther   than   nor th   as  predicted.  T h e  strength  of  the  magnet- 
ism  a t   6 400 000  km  ( 4  000 000  m i)   from  the  planet  seemed  to  rise 
and   fall  in   a  regular  10-hour  phase,  possibly  because  of  the  planet’s 
rotation.  Jupiter’s  mass  was  also  found  to  be  grea ter   than   estimated 
and  the  spacecraft was being  drawn  toward  Jup i ter   fas ter  than   p lanned ;  
i t   would  a r r ive   a t   i ts   closest  approach  two  minutes  ear l ier   than   pre-  
dicted. 
On  Nov.  30   Pioneer  10 recorded  a  sha rp   drop   i n   magnetic  a n d   r a -  
diation  measurements,  ind ica t ing   disappearance  of  the   magnetic  field.

c ra f t  entered  Jupiter’s  dipole magnetic  field.  Pre l im inary   da ta   indicated 
tha t   the  outer  portions  of  Jupiter’s  magnetic  field  did  not  rotate  with 
the  planet  and  were  more  flattened  than   the  earth‘s  field.  Also,  the  mag-  
netic  dipole  center  was appreciably  offset,  both  radially  and   toward  the 
nor th   from  the  center  of  the  planet.  The   magnetic  ax is  was  tilted  from  
the  spin  axis. 
Pwneer   10 crossed  the   orbits  of  Jupiter’s  innermost  moons-Callisto,

Ganymede,  Europa,  and   Io-Dec. 
(277  000  m i )   of  Ganymede,  the  infrared   radiometer  indicated  the 
moon’s  surface  tempera ture   was  125   K  ( -235 ’F ) .   S ix   hours   before 
i ts   closest  approach   to  Jup i ter   the  probe  entered  the  dangerous  region 
of  intense  rad ia t ion   and ,   soon  after,  the  imaging  system  ceased  re turn-  
ing   picture  data.  Radio  commands  switched  the  system back  to  normal 
operation  within  30  minutes,  however.  The  press  la ter   reported  tha t

December  3-11:  As  the  gold  and   silver  spacecraft  approached 
Jup i te r  and   radiation  intensity increased  10-fold every  two hours,  reach-

Pioneer  10 sped  past  Jup i ter   a t  a n  altitude  of  130 000  km  (81 000 m i ) ,  
traveling  155 140   km  per   hour  ( 9 6 4 0 0  m p h ) ,   the  fastest  speed  ever 
achieved  by  a  man-made  object.  The   spacecraft’s  11  instruments  sent 
back  read ings  and   pictures  tha t   came  in   loud  and   clear,  tak ing  46 min- 
utes  to  reach  a  jub i lan t   team  on  ear th .  
“Needless  to  say,  we’re  elated,”  Dr.  John  Wolfe,  P ioneer   Pro jec t  
Scientist,  told  cheering  newsmen. 
T h e   Fa sh ing ton  Post  la ter   described  the  scene  a t  A R C :   “SO deluged 
were  Pioneer  scientists  with  transmissions  of  the   spacecraft’s  ins tru-  
ments,  they  were  literally  changing  the ir   minds  about  Jupiter’s  physics 
and   chemistry  every  hour.”  Dr.  James  C.  Fletcher,  NASA  Administrator, 
sa id ,   “Some  of  u s  have  been  looking  through   telescopes  a t   Jup i te r   since 
ou r   ear ly   teens.  Th i s   is  more  than  we  ever  dreamed  of.” 
The  spacecraft suffered no apparent  failures and  continued to  function 
as planned.  However, preliminary  estimates of  rad ia t ion  belt parame ters  
a n d   observed  effects  on  the   spacecraft  and   instrumentation  indicated 
tha t   the   marg in   of  survival had  been  small. 
As  Pioneer  10  flew  by   Jupiter,  the   spacecraft  was  accelerated  and  
s lung   by  the   planet’s  gravity  into  a  new  tra jec tory   tha t   would  take  i t  
pas t  the orb i ts  of  Sa turn ,  Uranus,  Neptune,  and  Pluto and ,  traveling  a t  a 
constant 40  000 km  pe r  h r   ( 2 5  000 mph )  , out of  the  solar system toward 
the   constellation  Taurus .   Pwneer  10  would  be   the   first  spacecraft  to 
leave  the   solar  system.  By  7:OO  pm  EST  Dec.  4,  it  h a d   traveled  nearly 
1600  000  km  ( 1  000 000  m i )   beyond  Jupiter.

Pre l im inary   findings  from   the  encounter  included  the  discovery  of 
a n   ionosphere  (implying  a  tenuous  atmosphere)  surround ing   Jupiter’s 
moon  Io,  detection  of  helium  in   Jupiter’s  atmosphere,  new  density 
measurements  of  the   entire  Jovian  system  tha t   would  affect  curren t  
theories  on  the   formation  of  the  universe,  and   new  temperature  meas- 
urements of  Jup i ter   tha t   indicated little  difference between average  day- 
time  and   nighttime  temperatures. 
Pioneer 10 was expected to continue collecting and  re turn ing  da ta  until 
i t   reached  the  orb i t   of  Uranus   in  1980,  almost  3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   km 
( 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  m i )   from  the   earth.  Data  returned  would  determine 
whether  the   second  Jup i ter   probe,  Pioneer  11  (launched  April  5  and  
crossing  the  Asteroid  Belt  since  August) , could  safely  be  retargeted 
closer  to  the  planet.  The   Pioneer  10 mission  was  officially  ad judged   a 
success Jan .   9,  1974.

November  6-29: 
NASA  launched  Noaa  3  (ITOS-F)   National  Oceanic  and  
Atmospheric Administration meteorological  satellite  from   Western  Test 
Range a t  6:02  am  PST  on a  two-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor- 
Delta  0300 launch vehicle. The   satellite entered near-nominal orbit  with 
a  1509.2-km  (937.8-mi)  apogee,  1500-km  (932.1-mi)  perigee,  116.09- 
m in   period,  and   102.08O  inclination. 
T h e   pr imary   objectives  were  to  place  the  spacecraft  in   sun-synchro- 
nous  orbit  with  a  local  equator  crossing  time  of  8:30  am   to  permit  the  
spacecraft  to   accomplish  i ts   operational  mission  requirements,  make  an

(NESS) . 
Operational  responsibility  for  the  spacecraft  was  transferred  to  NOAA  
Nov.  29.  Excellent  da ta   were  being  returned.  Th e   orbit  would  permit 
regular,  dependable  daytime and   nighttime  meteorological  observations

described  by   NASA  Associate  Administrator  fo r   Manned  Space  Flight 
Dale D. Myers i n  a speech before the Poor R ichard  Club  in  Ph i lade lph ia :  
The   sun  was  the  “original  model  of  nuclear  energy,”  understanding  of 
which  could  lead  to   fusion  control  and   i ts  efficient use  for   power  genera- 
tion.  “The  Skylab  investigators  a r e   concerned  with  this  and   also  with 
explaining  how  solar  events  affect  the  Earth,  particularly  solar  flares 
th a t   trigger  au ro r a s   and   d isrup t   rad io   transmission.  Because  sunspot 
activity  correlates  with  temperature  and   density  variations  in   the 
Earth‘s  upp e r   atmosphere,  i t   is  conceivable  tha t   the  injection  of  energy 
into  the   atmosphere  by  solar  particles  may  tr igger   world-wide  weather 
phenomena.  Ou r   astronauts  saw  flares  shooting  up  100000  miles

they  would  be  turned  over  to  NOAA  as   a  p a r t   of  the   operational system,

i t   could  fall  shor t   by  as   much  as  17  percent.  Now,  even  before  war 
broke  out  in  the  Middle  East,  these  prospective  shortages  were  the 
subject  of  intensive  discussions  among members  of  my  Administration, 
leaders  of  the  Congress,  Governors,  mayors,  and   other  groups.  From 
these  discussions h a s   emerged  a  broad  agreement  tha t   we,  as   a  Nation, 
must  now  set  upon  a  new  course.  I n   the   shor t   run ,   th is   course  means 
th a t  we  must  use  less energy-that  means  less  heat,  less  electricity,  less 
gasoline.  I n  the  long  run,  i t  means  tha t  we must  develop  new  sources of 
energy which will  give  us  the   capacity to meet  our  needs without  relying

Walter  J .  Kapryan   said he  “personally sweated ou t  those  first  72  seconds 
through  max  q.” 
T h e  CSMJS-IVB  combination  was  placed  in   a  phasing  orb i t   with  a

tronau ts   and   transmitted  to   the  ground  the  astronauts  decided  not  to 
repor t   the  incident  to  ground  controllers.  Capsule  communicator  Alan 
B.  Shepard   la ter   told  the   crew,  “We  th ink   you  made  a  fa ir ly   serious 
e r ro r   i n   judgment’’  in   the  attempt  to  cover  up   Pogue’s  condition.  C a r r  
agreed,  “ I t   was  a  dumb  decision.”  Pogue   recovered  by  late  evening, 
Ca r r   suffered  only  minor  motion  sickness  problems,  a n d   Gibson  re- 
mained  in   good  health. 
Carr ,   Gibson,  and   Pogue   entered  t h e   multiple  docking  adap ter   a t  
9:32  am  EST  Nov.  1 7   (Mission Day  2 )   and  began Workshop activation. 
They  found  a  welcoming note  on  the   te lepr in ter :   “Jerry ,   Ed  and   Bill, 
welcome  aboard   the   space  station  Skylab.  Hope  you  en joy   your  stay. 
We’re  looking  forward  to  several months  of  interesting  and   productive

for   a n   earth-scanning  an tenna   tha t   had   jammed  du r ing   the  S k y lab   3 
mission. Gibson, anchored  in   a  portable  foot  res tra in t   on  the  bottom  of 
the   spacecraft,  held  onto  Pogue   while  Pogue  rewired  the  instrument, 
bypassing  a  shor t   circuit  and   restoring  the  antenna  to  80%  of  i ts  
or ig ina l  capacity. Gibson and  Pogue  reentered  the  Workshop  and  began 
pressurization  a t   6:19  pm  EST. The   6 -h r  35-min  EVA surpassed  the  6 -h r  
31-min record  set  Aug.  6 by  Sky jab   3  Astronauts Garr io t t   and   Lousma. 
At  3:45  am  EST Nov.  23  one  of  three  moment  gyros which  controlled 
the   spacecraft  overheated  and   was  ordered  shu t   down  by  Flight  Con- 
troller Ph i l ip   C.  ShaBer. Shaffer  told  the  press  a t   Johnson Space Center 
tha t   a  near-normal mission  could  still  be  flown  bu t   i t   would  take  more 
time  and   fuel  to  make  maneuvers.  Pogue  began  extensive photographic 
study  of  Comet  Kohoutek.  By  the  end  of  the  mission  Comet  Kohoutek 
had   been  observed  and   recorded  121   times  as  i t   approached,  looped 
around,  and   retreated  from  the  sun. 
T h e   first  full  day   of  scientific  research  was  scheduled  for   Nov.  27. 
by   the   launch  of  a 
While  photographing  a  bar ium   cloud-created 
Black  Brant  IVA  sounding  rocket  from  Poker  Flats,  Alaska-the 
space- 
craft’s  thrus ter   attitude-control system  used  three   times  the   amount  of 
nitrogen  gas   fuel  anticipated.  The   extra  fuel  use,  in   addition  to  poor 
weather  conditions,  forced  postponement  of  the  first  ea r th   resources 
experiment package  ( EREP) pass while  ground  teams designed improved 
techniques for   managing  a t t i tude  control and   fuel  consumption.  For   the 
first  t ime  Ca r r  pointed  the  space station’s  six  large  solar  telescopes a t  an  
unusually  active  region  of  the  sun. 
The   first  EREP pass  was  made  Nov.  29  dur ing   a  23-min  8850-km 
(5500-mi)  sweep  from  the  southwestern  U S .   to  South  America.  I n   a 
Johnson  Space  Center  press  conference  Skylab  Program   Director 
William  C.  Schneider  said  tha t   the  ground  team  had   concluded  tha t  
the  Nov.  28   problem  had   been  caused  by   an   incorrect  inpu t   of  in i t ia l  
conditions in to  the fuel management  program. Restrictions on maneuvers 
were  eliminated  and,  with  proper  fuel  management,  the  mission  could 
continue essentially  a s  planned.”

On  Dec.  1 the  astronauts photographed  a  laser  beam  pointed  a t  them 
by   Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  scientists  who  were  testing  the  lasers 
a s  a  reference  point  fo r   possible use  in   spacecraft  navigation  and   com- 
munications.  Ear l ier  attempts to spot the  flashing green  laser  had   failed. 
I n  a Dec.  1 3  Mission Day  28  Review  of  the  first  th ird   of  the mission 
Program   Director  Schneider  sa id   the  S k y h b  4  crew  had   accomplished 
84 hrs of  A TM solar viewing, 45  separate  observations of  Comet Kohou- 
tek,  80  ea r th   observatiob  experiments,  and   12   EREP passes,  although 
a  significant  portion  of  the  da ta   from  9 passes had   been  lost  because  of 
wrong camera  filters.  Schneider said  tha t   the  crew was  in   good physical 
and   mental  health  and   tha t   the ir   performance  had   been  outstanding, 
but  flight  planners  had   needed  to  ad jus t  work  schedules to  the   pace  of 
the crew. 
A  spectacular  limb  prominence  on  the   sun,  estimated  to  b e   the 
largest observed in   25  yrs,  was recorded  by  the  crew Dec.  18-19. 
Astronauts  C a r r   and   P o p e  opened  the  hatch  fo r   EVA-2  at  11:55 
am  EST Dec.  25,  Christmas Day.  Pogue  mounted  three  special  cameras 
to  pho tograph   the   sun   and   Comet  Kohoutek  before  i t   passed  behind 
the   sun.  Pho tographs   were  taken  of  the  comet’s  tail  and   coma.  Ca r r

replaced  film  cassettes  i n   the   ATM  and   repa ired   a  jammed  filter  on  an  
ATM   camera.  The   constant  movement  of  Ca r r   and   Pogue  outside  the  
spacecraft  disrupted  Gibson’s  efforts  to  aim  the   laboratory  cameras 
a t   Kohoutek  and   the  thrus ter   attitude  control  system  used  more  fuel 
than   planned.  Ca r r   a n d   Pogue  reentered  the   Workshop  and   closed  the  
hatch  a t  6:56  pm  EST  af ter   a  7 -h r  1-min spacewalk tha t   surpassed Gib- 
son and  Pogue’s Nov.  22  record. 
The   Dec.  28  perihelion passage  of  Comet  Kohoutek  was  marked  with 
a  live  ground-to-air  televised  conference  between  Dr.  Lubos  Kohoutek, 
discoverer  of  the  comet  ( 1 9 7 3 F ) ,  and   the  Sky lab   4  crew.  Gibson  said 
tha t   the   comet,  a s   seen  on  the   white-light  coronagraph,  was  growing 
dramatically. The  ta i l  fanned  out 20”  from  the  central ax is  and  could be 
seen  back  to  a  distance  three  times  the   diameter  of  the  coma.  Dr. 
Kohoutek  congratulated  the  “first  human  beings  studying  a  comet from  
outer  space”  and  wished  them  a  flawless splashdown i n  February .  
The   crew  began  EVA-3  a t   12:29  pm  EST  Dec.  29.  C a r r   and   Gibson 
moved  outside  to  photograph  the  sun  and   Comet  Kohoutek  a s   i t   began 
its tra jec tory   away from  the  sun.  Gibson said  the  comet had   a  spike and  
a  tail.  “Tha t  spike is very  evident. I t  is not  180 degrees ou t  from  the  tail, 
bu t   more  like  160  degrees.  I t   is  yellow  and   orange   . . . just  like  a  flame. 
I t   seems to   be   the  same  distance  out  a s  the   tail,  and   there   is  a  diffuse 
amount  of  material  which  goes  out  and   jo ins   up   with  the   tail.”  The  
as tronau ts   recorded  o ther   astronomical  phenomena,  retrieved  samples 
from   the   magnetospheric  particle  collector,  and   retrieved  the  comet 
observation  camera.  At  3:58 pm  EST  C a r r   and   Gibson  moved  back  in -  
s ide   the  Workshop  and   closed  the  hatch  a f te r   3  h r s  29  min. 
On  Jan .   1 0  the  mission  was  given  a  go-ahead  for   a  seven-day  exten- 
sion,  with  weekly  reviews  through  the   end  of  a  tentative  84.day  total 
mission.  I n   the  56-day  mission  review  a t   JSC,  Skylab  Program   Director 
Schneider  said  the  crew  was  “ in   good  sp ir i ts   and   excellent  physical 
condition  and   the   spacecraf t  is  i n   good  shape  to   continue.” 
On  Jan.  1 3  and   14 the  Sky lab  4 crew  photographed  a  solar flare  from  
beg inn ing   to  end-the 
first  opportunity  for  scientists  to  study  the   com- 
plete  life  cycle  of  a  so lar   flare. 
At  10 : 1 0  pm  EDT  Jan.  14 Carr ,  Gibson, and  Pogue had  been  in o rb i t  59 
days  11 h r s  9 min,  surpassing the  record  manned  flight  time  i n  space on 
a  single  flight  set  by   Sky lab   3  Astronauts  Bean,  Garriott,  a n d   Lousma 
du r ing  the i r   July  28-Sept.  25  mission. 
Mission  controllers  struggled  with  gyroscope  problems  with  increas- 
i n g   frequency  throughout  the   mission.  On  Jan .   22  the  second  control 
moment  gyro was  in   the   distress  position  fo r   six  hours,  causing  Skylab 
officials  to   order   the  recovery  force  into  por t   a t   San   Diego  three  days 
earlier  than   planned.  EREP  passes  were  limited  and   o ther   maneuvers 
reduced  to  conserve  fuel  and   reduce  stress.  Despite  nearly  three  dozen 
gyro  2  stress periods,  gyros 2  and   3  held  up   f o r  the  rest  of  the mission. 
A t   1:46 pm  EDT  Jan .   2 5   (MD-71)  the   crew  passed  the  record  cumu- 
lative  time  i n   space  of  69  days   15 h r s  45  min  set  by  Bean  du r ing   the 
S k y lab  3 mission. 
The   hatch  was  opened  fo r   E V A 4  a t   11:19 am  EDT  Feb.  3.  Gibson 
a n d   Ca r r   measured  the   atmosphere  surround ing   the  Skylab  solar  in-  
struments  to  evaluate  the   light-scattering  produced  when  photos  of  the  
sun   were  taken.  The   astronauts  also  photographed  the  sun   with  a n  
x - ray  sensitive camera,  retrieved  film  from   ATM  cameras,  and   removed

EVA  operations ended  a t  4:38  pm  EDT  af ter   5 h r s   19 min. 
February   5-8: 
Deactivation  of  the   Workshop  was  begun  Feb.  5 
(MD -82 ) .   A  three-minute f ir ing  of  the  steering  rockets  a t  4:48  pm  EDT 
Feb.  6  raised  the   Workshop's  altitude  to  about  450  km  (280   m i )   to 
reduce  atmospheric d rag  a n d  extend  the  orb i ta l  lifetime  to  an   estimated 
nine  years,  increas ing   chances  for  a  fu ture   revisit  to  the   laboratory, 
although  i t   could  not  be  inhab i ted   again.  The  crew  left  hehind  samples 
of  food,  film,  teleprinter  paper ,   and   electrical  cables  for   possible  in -  
spection  du r ing   the   1975  US.-U.S.S.R.  Apollo-Soyuz Test Pro jec t   mis- 
sion  or  du r ing   U S .   space  shu t t le  flights  planned  to  begin  in   1979. 
The  CSM  undocked  from   the  Workshop  a t   6:34   am  EDT  Feb.  8 
(MD-85)   and   made  a  fly-around  inspection  of  the  Workshop.  One  of 
two  redundan t   CSM  rocket  thrus ter   systems developed a  leak  dur ing   re- 
en try   preparation,  forc ing   the   astronauts'  to  reenter  without  a  backup  
thrus ter   system.  Jus t   before  SM  jettison  a t   10:45 am  EDT,  a  procedural 
e r ro r   caused  circuit  breakers   to  open,  blocking  the  stabilization  and  
control  thrus ters   from   firing.  Ca r r   quickly  took  manual  control  fo r   re- 
entry.  The   CM   splashed  down  upside  down  a t   11:17  am   EDT  Feb.  8, 
282  km  (175 m i )   southwest of  San   Diego  and   5  km  ( 3  m i )   from  the 
recovery  sh ip   U.S.S.  New  Orleans-ending 
1214  revolutions  of  the  
ear th .   The   capsule  was  righted  by  flotation  bags   while  the   carr ier  
maneuvered  alongside, and   the  CM   was  raised  by  a  crane   to  the  hanga r  
deck  about  40  min  af ter   landing.  Immediate  medical  examinations 
found  the  crew had  no  apparen t   severe effects f rom   the i r  long  exposure 
to weightlessness. They had   grown one to two  inches taller  from stretched 
sp ina l   columns  i n   space  and   had   lost  some  muscle  mass,  with  body 
fluids  read jus ted   fo r   zero  grav i ty ;   but  they  lost  most  of  the   slim-trim 
look  on  re turn   to  the  ear th .   They  were  back  to  normal  in   a  few  days. 
T h e   astronauts  would  rema in   aboard   sh ip   in   San   Diego  for   medical 
examinations and,  af ter   a  brief  dockside ceremony  Feb.  10, would  fly  to 
Houston.  The  men  would  b e  allowed to  rejoin  the ir   families bu t   contact 
with  the   general public  would  be   restricted  for   one  week. 
The   Sky lab   4  mission  achieved  i ts   pr imary   objectives of  performing 
Sa tu rn   Workshop  operations,  reactivating  the  Skylab  orbital  assembly 
i n  ea r th   orbit,  obtaining medical  da ta   fo r  use  i n  extending  the  dura t ion  
of  manned  space  flights,  and   performing  inflight  experiments.  All  58 
planned  scientific  and   technical  experiments  in   biomedicine,  solar 
astronomy,  solar  physics,  and   engineering  were  accomplished.  EREP  
instruments were operated du r ing  39  passes over  the  ea r th   a n d  the  crew 
spent  338  h r s   photographing  the  sun   a n d   Comet  Kohoutek  with  ATM 
instruments.  Sky lab   4  was  officially  adjudged  a  success Mar.  29,  1974. 
Ma jor   records  set  by   the  mission  included  the   longest-duration 
manned space flight  to  date,  84 days  1 h r   16 m in ;   the  longest cumulative 
time  in   space   f o r   a  man,  8 4  days   each  for   Carr ,   Gibson,  and   Pogue ;

President  Nixon  issued  a  statement  following  the  launch  of 
Skylab  4 :   “The  Skylab  flight  that  begins  today  marks-the  conclusion 
of  the  single  most  productive  program  in   the  history  of  man’s  quest 
for   knowledge  about  himself  and  h is   world.  Th e   crew  of  Skylab  will 
mark   i n   space  the  16th  anniversary  of  America’s  first  step  toward  the 
heavens.  From  the  launch  of  a  30-pound  [13.6-kg]  space  satellite,  we 
progressed  to  the exploration  of  the Moon, which  is  helping to  determine 
Earth’s  place  in   the   universe.  Now  we  a r e   moving  to  determine 
through  space  technology  man’s  own  place  in   the  universe,  a n d   to 
greater  understanding  of  our   own  planet.  As  we  a r e   grateful  for   the 
success  of  our   previous  ventures  into  space,  and   a s   we  look  to  the 
success of  tha t  which  is  imminent,  let  us  never  take  fo r  granted  the  skill 
and   courage  and   devotion  of  those  who  labor  on  behalf  of  the  United 
States  space  program.  Let  us  rather  pause  to  reflect  with  p r id e   upon 
what  we  have  done,  asking  God’s blessings  upon  our   efforts,  and   God’s 
grace  upon  those  who  bravely  place  the ir   lives  a t   the  service  of  peace 
f o r   all  mankind.”  (PD, 11/19/73,  1338)

talk  about  the  s trong   probability  of  a n   85-day  mission.  I t   will  be  the 
extreme  test  of  man’s  ability  to  function  i n  a  world  of  weightlessness,

326

like  the  control  centers  . . . in   this  country.”  It  was  “characterized  by  
consoles with  some  . . . large   display  screens down  f ron t   a n d   television 
display systems on the individual console.”  The  building housing Mission 
Control  was  in   two  sections.  “One  is  sort  of  a  w ing   where  the   main 
operations Control Room  is  and   some  aux i l iary   rooms  and  equipment.” 
Another  wing  held  equipment  for   teletype,  intercom,  and   TV. 
Lunney  sa id   a US .-bu i l t   docking  system  and   a U.S.S.R.  docking  sys- 
tem,  “actually  almost  two  docking  systems,  tha t   were  brought  over  by 
members  of  the  Soviet  test  team,”  had   been  undergoing  tests  at  JSC 
since September.  “The  tests a re   almost complete with  the  mandatory  test 
points tha t   have  to  be  taken. There’s a period  . . . where  some additional 
test  points  may  b e   taken  . . . and   tha t   will  probably  go  on  for   the 
rest  . . . of  November.”  To   date,  the  tests  had   gone  smoo2hly.  “I  think 
what  they  a r e   telling  us   is  tha t   the   assumptions  tha t   went  in to   the   de- 
sign  appea r   to  be  verified  and   that  indeed  we  can  expect  tha t   same 
kind  of  results  when we  use  the production  hardware  in  the qualification 
test  next  year.” 
Lunney  said U S .  delegates had   learned  tha t   the  Sept. 27-29  Soyuz  12 
flight  had   tested  fixes  to  the  spacecraft  to  prevent  reoccurrence  of  the  
fa ta l   June   30,  1971, Soyuz  11 accident  in   which  three  cosmonauts died 
f rom   decompression.  He   said  tha t   ‘‘all  the   fixes  worked  properly.” 
Modifications  included  use  of  spacesuits  for   launch  and   reentry,  a  gas 
supply  and   hose  system,  and   a  strong  cap  on  the   valve  tha t   had   been 
triggered  open accidentally;  the  cap  now  had   to be  fired  pyrotechnically 
to  release.  F ir ings   to  separate  the   reentry  module  were  modified  and   a 
manual  override  on  the  valve  was  made  more  accessible  to  the   crew. 
Discussions had   given  cba  fa ir ly   full  treatment  of  the   problem,  to  the 
po in t  where we  a re  satisfied  tha t   we  know  what  happened  a n d  we know 
what the  fixes are and  they appear  indeed to be  very substantial.”  (T ran -

NASA  launched  two  sounding rockets. An  Arcas from Antigua, West  Indies, 
carried  a   Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  meteorological  experiment  to  
measure ozone distribution  in   the  upper  atmosphere, monitor  anomalous 
ultraviolet  absorption,  and  extend  the  da ta   base  fo r   a   climatology  of 
stratospheric  ozone  in  the  tropics.  The   launch  was  in   conjunction  with 
a n  overpass of  the N imbus  4 satellite  (launched April  8, 1970 )  , bu t   the 
mission  was  unsuccessful  because  of  the  rap id   fall  rate,  caused  by   ab-  
normal  parachute  performance,  and   because of  the  lack  of  r ad a r   track.

By  now  NASA  should  have  learned  tha t   institutionalized  sexism  and

giant  s tar  system HDE 226868 to   the  x-ray  source Cygnus  X-1  and  had  
detected  evidence of  the  s truc ture   of  the  s tar   system’s  gas  clouds  swirl- 
ing  around  and   into  the  x-ray   source, or  black  hole.  Using Om  3,  they 
had   also  observed  extended  x-ray   sources  identified  with  clusters  of 
galaxies  like  those  in   the  Perseus,  Coma,  Virgo,  and   Centaurus  constel- 
lations. They  believed  enormous upheavals in   the  nucleus  of  the   Seyfert 
galaxy  were  affecting  the  en t ire   Perseus  cluster  of  several  thousand 
galaxies.  They   also  believed  the  x-ray  emission  detected  in  the  Seyfert 
galaxy  might  b e   associated with  the  inverse  Compton  effect,  in   which 
high-velocity  electrons  traveling  near  the  speed  of  l igh t   collided  with

“ tha t   knowledge  is  power  only  when  the   political  element  accepts  the

the  cutbacks i n  1969 a n d  1970, there was no panic. An  influx  of  retirees

The  theory  tha t   comets might  be   growing from material  dispersed  through

advanced  in  Na tu re   by  astrophysicists  Dr.  Hannes  0. A l f v b   and   Dr. 
Asoka Mendis of  the Univ. of  California at San  Diego. The  predominant 
view,  tha t   comets  like  Kohoutek  tha t   approached  the  sun   for  the   first 
time  had   probably  remained  i n   the   ou ter   fr inges   of  the   solar  system

The  Explorer 51 mission would  consist of  two  phases. Du r ing  Phase  1, 
excursions  would  be  made  a t   two-  to  four-week  intervals,  each  lasting 
several  days.  The   spacecraft  perigee would  be   lowered  in   steps  through 
a  range   of  150   to  125   km  ( 9 5   to  8 0   m i ) .   A t   each  perigee  step,  te- 
lemetry  da ta  would  be acquired. Phase  2 would begin  af ter  eight months

team  of  scientists  from  nine  institutions.  I n  addition  to  the  investigation 
of  solar  uv  activity,  the  instrumentation would  examine  particle  fluxes, 
airglow  intensities,  plasma  densities,  and   temperatures  and   magnetic 
fields  a t  low  altitudes. 
To   use  the   fu l l   spacecraft  and   instrument  capabilities,  a  new  rap id-

Summary 

Dur ing   1973:  Th e  U S .   put  26  payloads into  o rb i t   in   23   launches  and   the 
U.S.S.R.  orbited  107  payloads  in  86  launches.  The  U.S.  total  included 
13 spacecraft orb i ted  by  the Dept. of  Defense in   10 launches  ( 2  of  them 
multiple  launches)  and   13 by  NASA.  NASA’s 13  successful  launches  out 
of  1 4  attempts  nearly  matched  the  agency’s  1972  record  of  1 7  flawless 
launches out  of  17 attempts. 
NASA’s Skylab program   successfully launched the  first U S .  experimen- 
tal  space station-the  Orbital  W o r k s h o p a n d  three  successive crews  to  
man  it. Sky lab  4 ,  the final mission and the  longest-duration manned  space 
flight  to  da te   ( 8 4  days  1 h r   16 m i n ) ,   also set  records  fo r  man’s  cumu- 
lative  time  in   space  (84 d a y s ) ,   duration  of  extravehicular  activity  ( 7  
h r s   1 m i n ) ,   cumulative  orbital  EVA  time  for   one  mission  ( 2 2   h r s   2 1  
m i n ) ,   and   distance  in  o rb i t   fo r   a  manned   mission  (55 .5   million  km ;  
34.5 million m i ) .  By  the  year’s end  the Workshop  had  circled the  ear th  
more  than   3350  times  and  housed  nine  astronauts. Th e   Sky lab   2  crew’s 
r ep a i r   in   space   of  the  S k y lab   1  Workshop,  af ter   aerodynamic  forces 
damaged  i t   du r ing  liftoff,  salvaged the  endangered  program   and   proved 
man   could  do  difficult  construction work  in  space.  Th e   Sky lab   2  crew 
spent  28  day s   in   space  and   the   Sky lab   3  crew  59  days,  each  mission  a 
record  a t   the  time.  The   missions  proved  man   could  live  and   work  in 
space  for  extended  periods;  expanded  solar  astronomy  beyond  ear th-  
based  observations, collecting much valuable new  data  tha t  might  revise 
understanding  of  the  sun  and   its  effects  on  the  ea r th ;   and   improved 
techniques  for   surveying  ear th   resources  from  space,  re turn ing   more  
information  than   planned. 
In  NASA’s unmanned   program,  Pioneer  10  (launched  in   1972)  swept 
past Jup i ter   in  December  1973  at a distance of  130 000 km  (81 000 m i ) .  
The   first  spacecraft  to  fly  beyond  the   orb i t   of  Ma r s   and   to  penetrate 
the  Asteroid  Belt  capped  i t s   two-year, 826-million-km (514-million-mi) 
jou rney   by  re turn ing   more  than   300  closeup  photos  of  Jup i ter   and   its 
inner   moons  and   providing  new  information on  the  planet’s  atmosphere 
and   magnetic  field.  By  the   year’s  end  Pioneer  10 was  beginning  i ts  
five-year  extended  mission  to  reach  Saturn’s  orb i t   in   1976   and   the 
orb i t   of  Uranus,  the  limit  of  spacecraft  communications with  the   ear th ,  
in   1979. Thereaf ter   i t   was  to  become  the  first  man-made  object  to  es- 
cape   the  solar  system. Pioneer  11, launched  in   April,  had  passed  safely 
through  three   four ths   of  the   Asteroid  Belt  on  i ts   way  to  i ts   December  
1974  encounter  with  Jupiter.  Mariner  10, headed  toward  Mercury  via 
Venus,  was  more  than   14.5 million km  ( 9  million  m i )   from  the  e a r t h ;  
i t   would  pass  by   Venus  in   Feb rua ry   1974  and   would  provide  the  first 
closeup view  of  Mercury  i n  March. 
NASA  also  selected  land ing   sites  for   the   Viking  project’s  land ing   of 
two  spacecraft  on  Ma r s   in  1976.  Orbiter  and   lander   critical  design  re-  
views,  spacecraft  thermal  and   s truc tura l   tests,  and   other  hardware  tests 
were  completed  dur ing   the  year.

ASTRONAUTICS  AND   AERONAUTICS,  1973 

Scientific satellites launched  in  1973   included  Explorer  49  in   lun a r  
orb i t   to  measure  galactic and   solar  radio  noise  using  occultation of  the 
moon  to   reduce  background  interference,  Explorer  50  to  complete  a 
study  of  the  interplanetary  environment over  an   11-yr  solar  cycle, and  
Explorer  51  to  study  the  earth‘s  outer  atmosphere.  As  December  ended, 
scientists were  studying  Comet  Kohoutek  with  optical  telescopes,  radio- 
telescopes,  and  radar   from  the  ground;  high-flying a i rc ra f t  ; and   ins tru-  
ments  on  unmanned   satellites, sounding  rockets,  and   Sky lab   4 .  
N om  3,  launched by   NASA  fo r   the  National Oceanic and  Atmospheric 
Administration,  would  provide  atmospheric  soundings  and   very-high- 
resolution,  day-and-night  cloud-cover  imaging.  Two   communications 
satellites, Zntelsut-ZV F-7  for the International Telecommunications Satel- 
lite  Organization  and   An ik   2  Canadian  domestic  comsat,  were  success- 
fully  launched,  as  well  as   Nnss  0-20  Trans i t   navigational  satellite  fo r  
the  Navy. 
E r t s  1, launched  in mid-1972 as  the  first Ear th   Resources Technology 
Satellite, completed  its  7000th  photo-taking orb i t   of  the  ear th ,   demon- 
s tra t ing   the  great  potential of  remote-sensing of  the  earth’s  resources by 
providing  da ta   for  use  throughout  the  world. 
All  but  one  prime  contractor  for  the  space  shuttle had  been  selected 
and   design was  proceeding on  schedule. Most  of  the  shuttle  orbiter  sub- 
contractors  were  lined  up,  with  fabr ica t ion   to  begin  in   FY  1975. Nine 
nations  in  the  European  Space  Research  Organization  agreed  to  build 
the   Spacelab  for   a  wide  variety  of  applications  a s   a  shuttle  payload. 
NASA  and  DOD  made   jo in t   system studies fo r   the   space tug   and   tentative 
agreement  was  reached  fo r   DOD  to  develop  a n   in i t ia l   tug  stage  for   the 
shuttle. 
The   first two powered  flights of  the  X-XB  lifting  body  were  success- 
fully made in  the NASA  and  A i r  Force hypersonic aerospacecraft research 
program.  NASA  also vigorously pursued  solutions to  problems  of  a ircraf t  
noise,  pollution,  safety,  and   operational  efficiency  and   technology  for  
future-generation  a ircraf t .   Flight  tests  of  NASA’s d ig i ta l   fly-by-wire ad-  
vanced  flight  control  system  indicated  the   system  improved  handling 
qualities  of  a i rc ra f t   in  all  flight  conditions,  with  the  reduced  a ircraf t  
weight  increasing  payload  potential  and   reducing  fue l   consumption, 
The   JT8D  engine  refan  program  progressed  to  scheduling ground  tests 
fo r   Feb rua ry   1974. Th e   engine  modifications-in 
727,  737,  and   DC-9 
a ircraf t ,   models  tha t   made   up  60%   of  the  domestic  commercial  fleet- 
were  expected  to  reduce  areas   affected  by   a ircraf t   noise  by   75% .   A  
67%   reduction  i n   727  a i rc ra f t   land ing   noise  was  anticipated  from  a 
two-segment  land ing   procedure  being  tested  in  the  NASA  and   Federal 
Aviation  Administration  noise  abatement program.  Automobile  engines 
were  used  to  demonstrate  a n   internal  combustion  concept  fo r   reducing 
pollution emissions while  increasing engine efficiency for general-aviation 
a ircraf t .   New  flight  research  programs  included  the  remotely piloted  re-  
search  vehicle  project  in   which  the   pilot  flew  scale  models  from  a 
ground-based  cockpit,  eliminating  risk  to  the  test  pilot  and   reducing 
test-flight costs more   than   50%. 
I n  NASA’s sounding  rocket  program,  more   than   80  flights studied  a t-  
mosphere,  ionosphere, auroras   and  airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor 
streams, and  trapped   radiation  fluctuations; male  astronomical observa- 
tions  in   x-ray,  ultraviolet,  and   rad io   regions  of  the  electromagnetic 
spectrum ; and  supported  other  programs.  Rocket  launches  provided  a

Mount.  Forty-nine  balloons  were  flown  for   scientific  research  and   for  
development  of  new  technology  for   long-duration orb i ta l   missions. 
DOD’S  year   included fu r the r   development  and   implementation of  satel-

The  U.S.S.R.’s  record 86 launches topped 83 in   1971 and  74  in   1972. 
The   107  Soviet payloads  included  85  Cosmos  satellites,  2  Intercosmos,

Aerospace  indus try  employment in  the  Nation  increased  to 946  000  in  
June   bu t   declined  to  935  000 by   the  year’s  end. 
Techniques  developed  fo r   aerospace  activities were  applied  to  ear th-  
quake   prediction,  development  of  residential  so lar   heating,  and   fuel- 
sav ing  integrated  systems f o r  housing.  NASA  added  550  technical  br iefs  
to  i ts   more  than   5000  technical  innovations  already  available  for   U.S. 
indus try   use.  More  than   68 000  U.S.  indus tr ia l   and   commercial  firms 
requested  additional  da ta   on  these  innovations.  Some  3000  firms  spent 
$625 000  f o r   special  assistance  from  NASA’s Regional  Dissemination 
Ceaters;  1500  firms  purchased  1891  computer  programs  and   related

cedures  to  speed  technology  transfer   and   du r ing   1973   five  exclusive 
patent  licenses,  the  largest  number   since  the  program’s  inception,  were 
granted.  A  NASA  liaison  office  was  opened  in   New  York   City  to  work 
directly  with  city  agencies  on  public  safety,  d r u g   detection,  and   fire 
prevention. 
A  rechargeable  hea r t   pacemaker  was  developed under  NASA  auspices 
by   the   Johns   Hopkins  Univ.  Applied  Physics  Laboratory.  Electronic 
components  designed  for   space  use  were  incorporated  i n   the   device, 
which  could be   recharged  a t  home  by  the  patient,  eliminating  the   need 
fo r   surgery   every  two  years  to  replace  conventional  devices.  A  new 
rad io   transm i t ter   temperature  pill  allowed  doctors  to  check  localized 
in terna l   body  tempera ture   changes.  A  por tab le   visual  testing  device 
permitted  early  detection  of  eye  disorders.  A  test  hospital  room  for 
paralyzed  patients used  space-developed devices fo r   remote operation  of 
communications  systems and   appliances. 
The  NASA  FY  1974 appropr ia t ion   of  $3.002  billion  was  $13.9  million 
below  the   budget  request,  $62.4  million  below  the  $3.0645-billion  FY 
1973 authorization,  and   $406  million  below  the  FY  1973  appropr ia t ion  
of  $3.408 billion.  ( A & A   1972; A&A   1973; Aerospace, 2/74,6-11;  NASA

A  significant milestone was the  Intergovernmental Agreement  on  U.S. 
a n d   European  cooperation  on  Spacelab,  signed  by   the   U.S.,  Belgium, 
France,  West  Germany,  Switzerland,  and   the  United  Kingdom.  T o   be  
funded   a n d   developed  by  n ine   members  of  the  European   Space  Re-

Notable progress was made  i n  the Apollo-Soyuz Test Pro jec t ,  with  the 
jo in t   U.S.-U.S.S.R. 
rendezvous  and   docking  mission  on  schedule  for  
July  1975 launch. Work ing   groups met  i n  both  countries  and   a  Novem- 
be r   Moscow  meeting  familiarized  eight  U.S.  astronauts  with  the   Soviet 
Soyuz  spacecraft.  Docking  system  designs  were  essentially  completed 
a n d   all  hardware   construction  was  on  schedule.  Joint  dynamic  testing 
of  test un i ts   began  a t   Johnson  Space Center.  Flight  crews were  selected

During  1973 

Eighty-three nations entered  in to  Definitive Agreements for  INTELSAT, 
permanently  establishing  the  global  communications  satellite  system 
envisioned  in  the  U S .   Communications Satellite Act  of  1962. 
Scientists from  other nations cooperated in  NASA  studies rang ing   from 
investigations  of  the  solar  system  to  practical  applications  of  space 
technology.  Erts  1  and  Skylab  environment  and   resources  da ta   were 
used  throughout  the  world.  Scientists from  37  countries and   the  United 
Nations  participated  in  Er ts   1  experiments  and   Brazil  and   Canada  
established  the ir   own  ERTS  data-acquisition  facilities. Four  fore ign   ex- 
periments  were  carried  on  Skylab  missions  and   foreign  scientists par-  
ticipated  in   the  Apollo  solar  telescope  program  and   in   correlated 
astronomy sounding  rocket  programs.  Scientists in  19  countries and   the 
U.N.  participated  in   40  Skylab  data-analysis investigations. 
German  and  Australian  scientists were  coinvestigators for  Pioneer  11 
experiments  and   French  and  U.K.  scientists for  Mariher  10. Investiga- 
tors  from  40  nations and   ESRO  were selected  to  participate  in  the ApoZh 
17  lunar   sample  program.  A  jo in t   working  group  of 
the   U.S.S.R. 
Academy  of  Sciences  and  NASA  held  the  th ird   and   fourth  meetings  an 
space  biology  and   medicine,  exchanging  information  on  manned   space 
flight. 
Parallel  communications channels using  Intelsat  and  Molniya  comsat 
systems  were  planned  for  1974  to  support  the  U.S.-U.S.S.R.  Direct 
Communications  Link,  with  construction  of  ear th   stations  in   both 
countries for  access to  each  other’s satellites, 
Work   went  forward  for  fu tu r e   cooperative  satellite projects.  Agree- 
ment was reached with  Italy  to  fly  San Marco G 2  in  1974. Negotiations 
were  underway  with  West  Germany  for  1974  launch  of  the   AEROS-B 
aeronomy  satellite and   work  continued  on  the  experimental  CTS  comsat 
to  be  launched with Canada,  the   HEL IOS   solar p robe  with  Germany, the  
INTASAT  ionospheric beacon  with  Spain,  the UK-5  stellar x-ray  satellite, 
Canada’s Anik  Cy and  U.K.’s X4  technology  spacecraft. 
Negotiations  were  also  underway  on  NASA  launch  services  for   the 
French-German Symphonie comsat in   1974 and  two ESRO  test  comsats in 
1976  and   1977. The   U.S.  and  ESRO  were  about  to  en ter   agreement  f o r  
a n  a i r  traffic  control and  navigation satellite system. 
Du r ing   the  year  NASA  launched  30  sounding  rockets  from  ranges  in  
other  countries, including  rockets  carry ing  foreign  payloads or  coopera- 
tive  experiments.  New  sounding  rocket  agreements  were  signed  with 
Australia,  Brazil,  Germany,  Th e   Netherlands,  Norway,  and   Sweden.

A   burgeoning  worldwide  energy  shortage  led  President  Nixon  to   propose 
in  June   the  establishment of  a  Cabinet-level Dept. of  Natural  Resources, 
a n   Energy  Research  an d   Development  Administration,  and   a  Nuclear 
Energy  Commission.  The   shortage  reached  crisis  proportion  with  the 
embargo  by   Arab   nations on  oil  shipments to  the  US. in   retaliation  f o r  
U.S.  support  to   Israel  dur ing   the  October Arab-Israeli war .  
I n   a  November  speech  President  Nixon  noted  the  U.S.  was  on  the 
verge  of  “the  most  acute  shortage  of  energy  since Wor ld  Wa r   11.”  He  
called  for  reduced  use  of  heat,  electricity,  and   gasoline;  announced 
Federal  Government  steps  to  lower  energy  consumption;  asked  the 
Atomic  Energy  Commission  to  accelerate  licensing  and   constructing 
nuclear  power  p lan ts ;   and   asked  for   a n   emergency  energy  act. 
Nine  energy  bills,  passed  in   rap id   succession  by   the  first  session  of

the  93rd  Congress,  included  authorizations  for  mandatory  fuel  alloca- 
tion  programs,  construction  of  the  trans-Alaska  pipeline,  a  re tu rn   to 
year-round  daylight  sav ing   time,  a  speed  limit  on  interstate  highways, 
and   the   National  Emergency  Act.  Soar ing   prices  of  all  k inds   of  fuel, 
long  lines  of  cars  and   banned  Sunday   sales  a t   gas  stations,  and   a ir l ine  
f a r e  increases and   schedule cutbacks marked  closing months of  the  year. 
Economists  forecast  a  possible  depression  as  energy  shortages  ag-  
gravated  a n   already  recessed  economy.  Scientists  sought  additional 
sources  of  fossil  fuels  and,  for   the   future,  new  sources  of  energy  to 
make  the  U S .   energy-autonomous.  The   focus  turned  to  NASA  and   i ts  
pioneering  expertise  i n   the  technologies  of  solar  energy  and   develop- 
ment  of  hydrogen  a s   a  substitute  for   gasoline  in  automobiles  and   a i r -  
craft.  At  the   year’s  end  pending  legislation  endorsed  NASA  cooperation 
with  o ther   appropr ia te   agencies  i n   solving  the  worldwide energy  short- 
age  and   in   providing  the  U S .   with  fu ture   sources  of  non-fossil-fuel 
energy.  ( A & A   1973 ;   L ibrary   of  Congress,  Congr  Research  Service,

*  Aerospace  industry  sales  increased  to  an   estimated  $24.9  billion,  more 
than   10%  above  1972’s  $23.5  billion.  Commercial  aerospace  sales 
increased  43 . l% ,   to  $5.8  billion,  reflecting  deliveries  of  wide-bodied 
transports,  helicopters,  and   general-aviation  a ircraf t .   Ma jor   aerospace 
sales  included  $13.8  billion  to  the   Dept.  of  Defense,  u p   from  $13.2

sales  a t  $13.4 billion,  up   from  $11.6 billion. 
Sales  in   the  space  area   alone  declined  to  $2.9  billion,  from   $3.0 
billion  i n   1972.  Executive  and   utility  a ircraf t   sales  increased  from  
$558  million  in   1972  to  $826  million-up 
48%.  Un i ts   delivered  in-  
creased  39.1%.  Civilian  helicopter  sales  increased  from  $90  million  in  
1972 to  $121 million in   1973, a ga in  of  48%. 
Aerospace  export  dollar value  rose  27.6% because  of  two  US. dollar 
devaluations,  to  a  total  of  $4.9  billion;  aerospace  imports  increased 
37.5%  to  $777  million.  Aerospace  industry  profits  were  expected  to 
increase  by  2.7%  of  sales  af ter   taxes.  The   1973  profit  ra te   for   all 
manufacturing  industries was expected to be 4.6%. (Aerospace ,  2/74,  3) 
U S .   scheduled  airlines  flew  161  billion  passenger-miles  ca r ry ing   more 
than   200 million passengers, nearly 4 million tons of  fre igh t  and  express, 
a n d   some  16  billion  letters  fo r   the   U S .   Postal  Service.  The   US. fleet

World  space   activity  increased  slightly  over  las t   year.  Total  successful 
against  106 in  1972-as  did  total  payloads  orbited 
launches  increased-109 
-133 
against  126  in   1972.  The   difference  between  launches  and   payloads 
is  of  course accounted  for  by   the  multiple-payload launches  (DOD, the  pr in-  
cipal  user  of  th i s   system  in  the   past,  made   2  multiple  launches  in  1973, 
orb i t ing   5  payloads;  NASA  made   none,  for  the  first  time  since  196 6 ;   the 
U.S.S.R.  made   3 multiple  launches,  orb i t ing   8 satellites in   each) .  
Of  the  1973  world  total,  the  United  States launched  23  boosters carry ing  
26  payloads.  In   1972   30  U S .   boosters  launched  35  payloads.  Th e   U.S. 
booster  total  fo r   1973   also  declined  about  25   percent  f rom   th e   previous 
year,  and   both  booster  and   payload  totals  were  the   lowest  since  1960.  Of 
these  1973  totals,  DOD  was  responsible  fo r   10  launches  and   13  payloads.  Of 
NASA’s 13 launches,  4 were  n o n - N A S A   missions-Anik  2 for   Canada,  Intelsat-

IV F-7  for   ComSatCorp, N o w  3  for   the  National Oceanic  a n d  Atmospheric 
Administration,  and   a  navigation  satellite,  Nnss  0-20,  fo r   the   Navy.  The  
Soviet  Union  once  aga in   f a r   exceeded United  S ta tes  space  totals,  launch ing  
107  payloads  with  86   launches-both  world  records.  I t   had   launched  89  
payloads with  7 4  launches i n   1972. 
The   year   was  dominated  by   the   marathon  flights  of  the   U S .   Skylab 
program.  Each  three-man  crew  exceeded  the   records  and   accomplishments 
of  the  former,  and   the  three  separa te   flights  tha t   began  i n   May  1973  and  
ended  i n   February   1974  proved  tha t   man  could  live  and   work  in   space  f o r  
extended  periods.  The   final  Skylab  flight  lasted  a  record  84   days  and ,   to- 
gether,  nine U.S.  astronauts lived in  space fo r  nearly six months. 
Pioneer  10,  launched  i n   March  1972,  became  man’s  first  spacecraft  to 
reach  Jup i ter ,   passing  130 000  km  (81  000  m i )   from  the   planet  on  Dec.  3, 
1973. A  second  Jupiter  probe,  Pioneer  11, was  launched  early  in   1973  and  
emerged  undamaged from the  Asteroid Belt March 20, 1974. I t  was  scheduled 
to  pass Jup i ter   in  December  1974 a n d   to  fly  by  Sa turn   in   1979. Mariner  10, 
launched  late  in   1973,  photographed  Venus  du r ing   a  Feb rua ry   1974  flyby 
and  used  tha t  planet’s gravity  for   a  first-ever  encounter with Mercury  dur ing  
March  1974.  NASA  launched  three   different  scientific  satellites:  Explorer  49 
was  placed  i n   lunar   orb i t   to  investigate  galactic  and   solar  rad io   noise; 
Explorer  50  monitored  in terp lane tary   rad ia t ion   froin  an   o rb i t   halfway  be-  
tween  the   ea r th   and   the  moon;  and   Explorer  51 ’s   highly  elliptical  o rb i t  
allowed  i t   to  d i p   into  the   earth‘s  lower  atmosphere  fo r   aeronomy  investiga- 
tions.  The  Department  of  Defense also  placed  two  improved communications 
satellites  in   synchronous orbit. 
The   Soviet  Union,  in   i ts   most  prolific  year  to   date,  resumed  its manned 
efforts  and   continued  a  program  of  scientific,  interplanetary,  and   app l ica-  
tions satellites-not 
all  with  success. Early  i n  the   year,  i ts  unmanned  orb i ta l  
labora tory  SuZyut 2  broke  up   a f te r   10  days  in   ea r th   orb i t .   A  s im i lar   orb i ta l  
labora tory   a t temp t   a  month  la ter   met  with  fa i lu re   i n   orb i t   and   was  called 
Cosmos 557.  The   two-day Soyuz  12 mission,  ca r ry ing   two  cosmonauts,  was 
the  first  Soviet  manned  flight  i n   more  than   two  years   a n d   demonstrated 
Soviet  confidence  in   the  redesigned  Soyuz  capsule.  The   December  two-man 
flight  of  Soyuz 13 lasted  nearly eight days in   a n  appa ren t  test  of  the  modified 
Soyuz  craf t   to  be  used  fo r   the   1975  Apollo-Soyuz  docking  mission.  The  
Soviets also  sent  four   spacecraft  toward  Mars,  two  orb i ters  a n d   two  landers, 
bu t   only  one  orb i ter   performed  properly  upon  a r r iva l   in   Feb rua ry   1974. 
Luna  21  landed   successfully  on  the   moon  and   deposited  the   unmanned 
Lunokhd   2,  which  traveled  37  km  (23  m i )   over  i t s   surface.  Du r ing   1973 
the  Soviets also launched  eight  communications  satellites,  two  meteorological 
satellites,  and   OreoZ2 ,  a  cooperative Soviet-French scientific  satellite. 
Th i s  year  was the  first  s ince  1969 tha t   no  th ird   natioh  launched  a satellite 
of  i ts   own. 
As  we  have  cautioned  i n   previous  years,  the  “Remarks”  column  of  these 
appendixes  is  never  complete,  because  of  pr in t ing   time  and   the   inescapable
