FOREWORD 
Days, weeks,  months,  and  years  of  the  space a  e  clock  on.  Note- 
worthy  events  in  space  science  and  technology  if ash  by   a t   an   ever- 
accelerating rate.  Many   events  appearing of  current importance  be- 
come  less so  with  the  passage  of  time, whde  others  emerge slowly  as 
the  s ignxcan t  milestones align  themselves into  the  dynamic pa t terns  
of  progress.  Our  comprehension  of  the   meaning  of  astronautics  to 
the  fu ture  of mankind is likewise a growing thing.  The  grea t  bread th  
of  the   social,  political,  economic,  and  strategic  impact  of  man’s 
nascent  steps  to  explore  his  universe must  no t   be  ignored.  Ye t   all 
of  u s  tend  to  become preoccupied with our  problems and reaponsibili- 
ties near  a t  hand. 
One of  the  useful tools  to help gain  perspective and  greater  appre- 
ciation  is  a  chronology  of  documented  events.  As  current  meaning 
stems from the  decisions and progress of  the  past,  so also is the  fu ture  
conditioned  by   the   comprehension  and  the   actions  of  the   present. 
Prepared  from  open  sources,  this  chronology  has   reference  value  of 
contemporary utility  and will  also serve the  cause of  fu ture  historians 
and analysts. 
The   year  1962  was  only  the   H t h   year  since  the   Soviet  BPUTNIK 
opened  many   American  eyes  to   the   early  practical  significance  of 
space  science  and  technology.  Yet  i t   was  another  spectacular  ear 
in  space  affairs.  The   highlights  of  1962  were  many:  the   orz i ta l  
flights  of  Mercury  Astronauts  Glenn,  Carpenter,  and  Schirra ; th e  
successful launching of  more than 6 1  American vehicles;  the   spectacu- 
lar  data-recording  flight pas t   the   planet Venus by  MARINER   11,  n o t  to  
slight RANGER   v h i t t ing  the  moon  and  the  first international satellites, 
ARIEL   I and ALOUETTE.  There was  the  continued contribution of  Tiros 
weather  satellites  as   well  as   the   dramatic  first  live  global  telecom- 
munications achieved by  TELSTAR.  The  rocket-powered x - 1 5   research 
airplane  continued  i t s  record-making contribution  to  the   science and 
progress throughout  NASA[S  program  also  are  re- H ected  in  this  chro- 
technology  of  manned  space  flight.  Decisions  b  management  and 
nology, not  to   ignore  the  mdispensable contributions  of  other govern- 
mental agencies, the  aerospace industry,  and  the  academic community 
to  the   massive  research  and  development  effort  now  well  underway. 
I n  his  address a t  Rice University  on  September  12,  1962,  President 
John  F. Kennedy  said  t h a t   this Nation  “means to  be  a leading space- 
faring nation.”  These words sound the  challenge for which a response 
mus t   be  fashioned  by   all  Americans.  While  1962  was  an   even tfu l  
year,  the   fu ture   of  astronautics  appears  even  more  stimulating.

PREFACE 
A chronology  is no t   a full-fledged  history. 
B u t  this chronology  is a 
necessary  beginning  of 
the   historical  process  of  documentation, 
analysis,  and   verification  concerning  the   activities,  problems,  and 
accomplishments  of  the  National Aeronautics and  Space Administra- 
tion  and   its  academic,  industrial,  governmental,  and   international 
par tners   in  the   exploration  and   use  of  space  for  the   benefit  of  all 
mankind. 
Th is   historical  repor t   was  prepared  from  open,  public  sources. 
Science  and   technology  in   today’s  world  are   essentially  indivisible. 
services, a s  well  a s  inh rna t iona  P items of  a  non-NASA  character, have 
Space-related  efforts  by  the   De   a r tmen t  of  Defense  and   the  military 
therefore been  included  to help retain  a valid historical context.  Any 
effort  b y   a  free  society  also manifests  considerable  public  discussion 
and   policy comment,  the  inclusion of  which  was  considered pertinent 
to meaningful  presentation  of  known  events in   the   science and   tech-

Compilation of  th is   chronology  involved  the   entire NASA   Historical 
Staff  m t h  Mrs.  Helen  T. Wells  carrying  the   major  draftin  and   edi- 
torial  responsibilities.  Appendix  A  was  launched  by  Mg r.  Alfred 
Rosenthal,  Historian  of  the   Goddard  Space  Flight  Center,  while 
NASA  Center historians  a t  Launch Operations Center, Manned  Space- 
craft Center, and  Marshall Space Flight  Center also made  their mark 
in  this preliminary report. 
Incompleteness,  perhaps  errors,  either b y   commission  or  omission, 
may  require fur ther  gutdance by  history-makers  and  scholars.  Com- 
men ts  and   criticism  are  welcomed  by   the  NASA  Historical Staff a t  any

JANUARY  1962 
January  1: National  Bureau  of  S tandards   and  U.S.  Naval  Observa- 
to ry   increased  the   s tandard   frequency  transmissions  by   2  pa r t s  
in 1 billion  to allow f o r  higher precision in scientific measurements, 
radio communications  and  navigation,  and  satellite tracking. 
The  United Nations should tax  commercial  ventures in ou ter  space, 
the   ocean  depths,  and   polar  regions  to   obtain  financial  suppor t ,  
said  Dr.  Eugene  Staley  of  the   Stanford  Research  In s t i tu te   in 
a memorandum  to   the   United  Nations.  H e   also  proposed  t h a t  
the  U.N.  should be  given exclusive au thor i ty  to  license and regu- 
l a t e  space  traffic  and   satellites  relaying  telephone  and   television 
signals. 
January  I: Army  announced  installation  of  new  102-foot  an tenna  
near   Fo r t   Dix  built  in  conjunction  with  DOD’S  Project  Advent, 
one  link in  development  of  a  microwave  radio-relay  system  for 
global communications using active-repeater satellites in a 22,300- 
mile-hi  h orbit. 
Walter  g a h n   of  General  Electric’s  Defense  System  Depar tmen t  
was named  NASA’s Director  of  Management Analysis Division. 
January  3:  NASA  announced  th a t  Mercury Ma rk  I1 spacecraft would 
be  named  “Gemini,”  af ter   the   third  constellation  of  the   zodiac 
fea tur ing  the   twin  s ta r s  Castor  and   Pollux.  Gemini  would  be  a 
two-man  spacecraft  used  in  development  of 
the   rendezvous 
technique,  would  be  50%  larger  than   the   Mercury capsule,  and  
launched  in to  orb i t  by  a  T i tan  I1 booster. 
e  Mercury capsule  installed  on  top  of  Atlas  booster  prepara tory  for 
MA-6  manned  flight; it was  also reported  from  Cape Canaveral 
th a t   6rst  American  orbital  manned  flight was  now  unofficially 
scheduled for Janua ry  23. 
e  Vice  President  Johnson  sen t  a  congratulatory telegram  to  members 
of  the   OSCAR   ama teur  radio satellite  team:  “For me  this  project 
is symbolic of  the   type  of  freedom for which this coun try  stands- 
freedom  of  enterprise  and  freedom  of  participation  on  the   p a r t  
of  individuals  throughout  the   world.”  OSCAR  I  was  launched 
with  DISCOVERER  x x x v ~  on December  12 ,  1961. 
e  Da r tmou th  College  announced new  gradua te  program  leading  to   a 
doctorate in  the  field  of  molecular  biology. 
January  3-10:  Soviet  cosmonaut,  Ma jor   Gherman  S.  Titov,  visited 
Indonesia  a t   the   personal  invitation  of  President  Sukarno,  was 
then  scheduled to  go  to  Burma. 
Janmry  4:  Announced  a t  the  Manned  Spacecraft Center t h a t  a large 
“innertube”  or   “flotation  collar”  may   be  used  to   keep  Mercury  
capsule  afloat  after  a  water  landing.  Collar  would  be  installed 
b y   Navy   frogmen.  Astronaut  Alan  B.  Shepard  took  pa r t   in 
proving  tes ts  conducted on  Chesapeake Bay.

J a n u a r y   4:   NASA   announced  contract with  the  University of  Texas  to 
design and build  a radio antenna  a t  the  Balcones Research Center 
to   be  used  in  making  radiation  measurements  of  the   moon  and 
planets.  It would  be  16  feet  in  diameter  and  operate  effectively 
a t  30,000 to   150,000 megacycles. 
Dr.  William  W.  Kellogg  of  the   N A S   Space  Science Board  reported 
on  the   s tudy   of  the  planet  Venus  u t   the  American  Geophysical 
Union.  Bolometer  studies of  the  atmosphere of Venus  indicated 
a  temperature  of  -40’  C  (presumably  the   cloud  tops),  while 
temperatures  deduced  from  measurements  by   large  radiotele- 
scopes indicated  temperatures of  about  300O C  (572’  F) (believed 
t o   be  surface  tempertLturc).  A  planetary  probe  could  probably 
answer  questions  raised  on  t h e   tliickness  and  na ture   of  Venus’ 
aorosphere. 
J a n u a r y   5 :   President  Kennedy  released  p a r t   of  a  report  submitted 
earlier b y  Vice President Johnson, Chairman of  the  Space Council. 
T h e  report  s ta ted   th a t   the   U.S.  had   generated  a  greater  r a t e  of 
progress  in  space  in  1961   than   in  any  other  year  b u t   t h a t   “it 
is  too  early  to  make definitive comparisons  as between our newly 
developing competence  and  the  capabilities of  the  U.S.S.R.” 
0  NASA  first  made  public  drawings  of  three-man  Apollo  spacecraft 
to   be  used  in  lunar   landing  development  program. 
0  Dr.  J. P.  Kue t tner ,   formerly  chief  of  the   Mercury-Redstone  pro- 
gram,  was  named  MFSC   Manager  of  the   Saturn-Apollo  System 
Integration  Program. 
0  USAF   Minuteman  successfully  fired  from   silo  a t   Cape   Canaveral, 
i t s  third  straight success in underground firing. 
J a n u a r y   6:  FAA   released  memorandum  da ted   December  29 ,   1961, 
s ta t ing   th a t   S tanford   Research  Institute’s  radiotelescope  was 
a  hazard  to   air  navigation.  The   first  of  three  such  telescopes 
to  b e  bu i l t  in  the  U.S. by  SRI extends 90 feet too high for Moffett 
Field  air  traffic  and  128  feet  too  high  f o r   Palo  Alto  Airport 
traffic . 
J a n u a r y   7:  National  Science  Foundation  re   orted  t h a t   Congress 
had   appro  riated  $10 .8  billion  for  researc t   and  development  in  
F Y   62,  w t ich   included  $3   billion  for  research,  $6 .7   billion  for 
development, $1 billion for facilities, and $100 million for informa- 
NASA   spent  $1.4 billion,  the  DOD   $6 .2  billion. 
tion. 
0  Executive  Director  of  the   Space  Science  Board  of  the   Na t iona l  
Academy  of  Sciences, D r .  Hugh  Odishaw, reviewed  the  prospects 
in  space  in  first  of  a  series of  lectures  prepared  for  the   Voice  of 
America.  Despite  the   grea t   promise  of  practical  application  of 
space  technology,  Odishaw  sa id :   “I  would  contend  t h a t   th e  
challenges of  research dwarf  those of  adventure and application.” 
Other members  of  the   Space Science Board  were  slated  for  la te r  
lectures in  this Voice  of  America  series. 
Reported by  J. Alsop  t h a t  experts estimate th a t   the  U.S.S.R. could 
possibly  tes t   an   antisatellite  missile  during  1962,  and  would 
probabl  do  so in  1963. 
J a n u a r y   8:  gpecial hand  tools for  use  in  zero-gravity  conditions were 
tested  by  personnel  of  the  Manned  Spacecraft and   the  Marshall 
Space  Flight  Centers.  Experiments  were  conducted  in  simu- 
la ted   space environment  to   try ou t  non-torque hand  tools  drawn 
from  a number  of  industrial sources.

J a n w r y  8-15:  F i v e d a y   symposium  on  aerospace  medicine  held  a t  
School  of  Aerospace  Medicine  a t   Brooks  AFB,  Texas,  which 
included some 500 medical school professors, industrial scientists, 
military,  and other Government specialists. 
J a n w r y   9:  NASA’s Associate Administrator,  Dr .   Robert  C.  Seamans, 
Jr., moderated  a  panel  discussion  on  “Reliability-The  Key  to  
Space  Operations,”  a t   the   8 th   National  Symposium  on  Reli- 
ability  and  Quality  Control  in  Washington.  Panelists  John   H. 
Rubel,  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense;  Dr.  C.  S ta rk   Draper, 
Head  of  the   Dept.  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics,  M IT ;   Dr. 
Simon  Ramo,  Exec.  VP of  Thompson  Ramo  Wooldridge,  Inc . ;  
and  Dr .   Jack   A.  Morton,  VP   Device  Development,  Bell  Tele- 
phone  Laboratories  discussed  means  of  comprehensive,  planned 
C. H. Mitchell, Vice e ommander of  AFCS,  said t h a t  the   “Russian 
efforts  to   increase  the   Nation’s  percentage  of  success  in  space 
launchings and operations. 
Addressing  SAM’S  Aeros  ace  Medicine  symposium, Major  General 
threa t   in  space  is  becoming  obvious  . . . Clearly  it  is  our  re- 
sponsibility as  a  nation  to  insure th a t   space  is used  to  benefit  all 
mankind.  We  can  insure this  only  through  development  of  the  
ability  to   conduct  military  operations  in  space  with  maximum 
effectiveness  . . .” 
J a n u a r y   10:  NASA  announced  t h a t   the  Advanced  Sa turn   launch  ve- 
hicle,  to   be  used  for  manned  flights  around  the   moon  and  for 
manned  lunar  landings  with  rendezvous  technique,  would  have 
five-engined  first  and  second  stages.  The   first  stage  (S-IB) 
would be powered by  five F-1  engines ( to ta l  of  7 . 5  million pounds 
th ru s t )   and  the   second  stage  (S-11)  would  be  powered  with  five 
5-2  engines  (total  of  1  million  pounds  thrus t) .   A  third  stage 
(S-IVB)  with  a  single  J-2  engine  would  be  used  on  escape 
missions. 
x - 1 5   No.  1  piloted  by   Cdr.  Forrest  Petersen  (USN )   made  i t s   first 
forced landing in 47  flights when  i t s  rocket  engine failed  to  ignite 
in mid-air  after  two a t temp ts .   X-15  was brought  down without 
incident  a t  Mud  Lake, Nevada. 
0  NASA  and  A EC   awarded  5-yr.  contract  for   the   development  of  the  
Nerva  engine to  Aerojet-General Corp.  At  same  time, Aerojet- 
General  signed  a  subcontract  with  Westinghouse  Electric  Corp. 
for  nuclear portions of  the  development which began  in  1955. 
Jan ua r y   11:  I n   his  S ta te   of  the   Union  message  to   the  Congress, 
President  Kennedy  said:  “With  the   approval  of  this  Congress, 
we  have  undertaken  in  the   past  year  a  great  new  effort in  outer 
space.  Our  aim  is not  simply to  be  first  on  the  moon, any  more 
than   Charles  Lindbergh’s real aim was  to be  first  to  Paris.  His 
aim was  to  develop the  techniques and the  au thor i ty  of  this coun- 
t r y  and other  countries in the field of  the  air  and  the   atmosphere. 
“And  our  objective  in  making  this  effort,  which  we  hope  will 
place  one  of  our   citizens  on  the   moon,  is  to  develop  in  a  new 
frontier  of  science,  commerce  and  cooperation,  the   position  of 
the   United  S ta tes   and  the   free  world.  This  nation  belongs 
among  the   first  to   explore  it.  And  among  the   first,  if  not  the  
first, we  shall be. 
“We  are  offering  @ow-how  and  cooperation  t o   the   United 
Nations.  Our  s a t eh t e s   w i l l   soon  be  providing  other  nations

with  improved weather  observations.  And  I shall  soon  send  to  
the  Congress  a measure  to  govern  the  financing and  operation  of 
an   international  communications  satellite  system,  in  a  manner 
consistent with  the   public  interest  and   our  foreign policy.

J a n u a r y   11 :   USAF  B-52H  flew  nonstop  and  without  refueling  12,519 
miles  from  Okinawa  t o   Madrid,  breaking  by   1,283.4 miles  the  
1946 record  set by  Navy  P2V-1  “Trucu len t  Tur t le .”   Ma j .  C. E. 
Evely headed  crew of  eight making  the  21-hour-52-minute  flight. 
A t   SAM  symposium  on  aerospace  medicine,  L t .   Col.  Bu r t   Rowen 
(USAF) ,  Chief  of  Bioastronautics  a t   AFFTC ,   presented  hear tbea t  
and  breat,hing records of  Ma j .  Robert White  during X-15  record 
speed  flight  of  November  9,  1961. 
“When  the   President’s 
Scientific Advisory  Committee  f i s t   became  aware  of  the   high 
hear t   and   respiration  rates  [of  pilots  in  high-performance  air- 
craft] they  became  concerned  with  the   question of  success  of  the  
Mercury program.  .  . 
Bu t  now this has come  t o  be  regarded 
a s   normal.”  Dr .   Charies  Sandhous  of  the   University  of  Cali- 
fornia  warned  t h a t   an   as tronau t   caught  in  space  during  a  solar 
flare  might  age  three  years  or  more  as  a  result  of  the   radiation 
received. 
A t  E igh th  National Symposium  on  Reliability  and  Quality Control 
in  Washington,  W.  T.  Sumerlin  of  the   Philco  Corp.  estimated

engineering  graduates  was  small;  and  (4)  the   new  specialists 
trained in  the  space program during  the  next decade would be  an

seen  no  disposition  on  their  p a r t   t o   jus t   simply  throw  up   their

there  will  be  a  good,  strong,  vigorous  debate,  jus t   as  there  was 
when  this agency was formed, and t h a t  when  the  issues are clearly 
o u t  on the  table, and the  success of  the  very active flight program 
t h a t  we  are  now  conducting makes  itself  felt,  th a t   there  will  be

NASA’s views  of  solid-propellant Nova-class motors  in  a  le t ter   to  
John  H. Rubel, Depu ty  Director, Defense Research  and Engineer- 
ing: 
(‘NASA  has  a strong interest in the  technology of  solid-propellant 
rockets  and  hopes  to   make  use  of  them  in  NASA   vehicles  when 
the   appropriate  feasibility  is  demonstrated  . .  .”  NASA   interest 
was  expressed for motors with  thrus t   levels of  “about  2.5 million 
and  5  million  lbs.  and  burning  times  of  approximately  115 
seconds.” 
( (The  higher  thrus t   level produced  by  motors  about 240 inches 
in  diameter  by  about  100  feet  long  is  especially a t trac t ive   from 
a  long-range,  payload  growth  viewpoint. 
I n   addition,  the  
great*er thrus t   and  impulse  per  motor  results  in  designs  with 
fewer  motors  per  stage,  and  thus   with  greater  potential  for 
reliability.  . . .” 
Congressman  V.  Anfuso  and  Senator  H.  Humphrey  introduced

February   65:  Soviet  scientists  claimed  to   have  discovered  the   th ird  
radiation  belt  around  the   ear th   and  published  such  findings  two 
years  before  the   findings  of  EXPLORER   XII  were  made  public  by  
NASA   on  Janua ry   19,  1962.  Academician  Blagonravov,  Vice 
President  of  the   In terna t iona l   Committee  on  Space  Research, 
said  in  an   Izves t ia   interview  th a t   the   existence  of  a  dense  belt 
with  energies  of  200  to   20,000  electron  volts  a t   a  distance  of 
25,000  to   50,000  miles  was  recorded  by  Soviet  space  launchings 
in  1958.  Such  findings,  he  said,  were  published  by   Dr.  K .  
Gringauz  and  associates  in  the   February   and  April  issues of  the 
Soviet  A cad em y   of  Sciences  Proceedings  in  1960,  and  in  la ter  
publications.  Commenting on  the   view  th a t   the   three radiation 
belts  really  formed  a  single  large  pulsating  band  t h a t   might  be 
called  a  ‘imagnetosphere,” Blagonravov  agreed  th a t   the   bound- 
aries  might  be  arb i trary   b u t   t h a t   the   charged  particles  in  each 
belt  had   distinctive  characteristics  and  t h a t   it  would  be  “inex- 
pedient”  to  reject  t,he theory of  three belts. 
February   66:  John   Glenn  D ay   in  Washington,  D .C .   An  estimated 
250,000  persons  lined  the   rain-drenched  parade  rou te   from  the  
White House  to  Capitol Hill.  I n  20-minute  address  t o   the  joint 
session  of  the   Congress,  Astronaut  Glenn  paid  tr ibu te   to   the  
Project  Mercury  team  and  pointed  to   the   unbounded  fu ture   of 
space exploration: 
( ( .   . .  I feel  t h a t  we  are  on  the  brink of  an  area of  expansion  of 
knowledge  abou t   ourselves and  our  surroundings  th a t   is beyond 
description  or  comprehension  a t  this  time. 
“Our  efforts  today  and wha t  we’ve  done  so  far   are   b u t   small 
building blocks  on  a  very high pyramid  to  come  . . . 
“We’re  jus t   probing  the   surface  of  the   greatest  advancement 
in  man’s  knowledge  of  his  surroundings  t h a t   has   ever  been 
made  . . . There   are  benefits  to   science across  the  board.  Any 
major  effort such  as  this results  in research  by   so many  different 
specialties  th a t   it’s hard  to   even  envision  the   benefits  t h a t   will 
accrue in  many  fields. 
Th e   more  I  see,  the   more 
“Knowledge  begets  knowledge. 
impressed  I am  not  with  how  much  we  know  b u t  with  how  tre- 
mendous  the   areas are  th a t   are  ye t  unexplored  . . .”

ASTRONAUTICAL  AND   AERONAUTICAL  E V E N T S   OF  1 9 6 2  
February 26:  In  NAS lecture for Voice of  America broadcast, Dr. Joseph 
W.  Chamberlain  of  the  University  of  Chicago’s Yerkes Observa- 
tory  predicted  t h a t   space-age  research  techniques may  soon pro- 
vide final answers to  questions about  the  aurora t h a t  have eluded 
IhYsica1 
scientists  for  centunes.  “Better  understanding  of 
processes producing the  aurora,”  he said,  “should  allow t  e spec- 
troscopist  to  derive even more information from his observations 
of  the  auroral spectrum  about  the  physics and chemical processes 
in  the   high  atmosphere.”  H e  suggested  t h a t   space probes may 
detect  auroras  on other planets which will  provide  an entire new 
se t   of  d a t a   different  from  terrestrial  phenomena  with  which  to  
tes t  hypotheses for auroral bombardment mechanisms.

U.S.  and  other  member  nations  of  the   U.N.  Committee  on  the  
Peaceful Uses of  Outer Space meeting on March  19.  Zor in  said 
t h a t   he   hoped  t h a t   the   committee  would  be  able  to   agree  on  a 
work  program  for  “mutually  beneficial  and  advantageous 
coopera tion. ”

as  they  are  needed  on  the   current  program;  (5)  92%  of  NASA’s 
budget  will be  spent  through  industry  and  universities. 
Astronaut  Glenn  pointed  ou t   t h a t   the   Nation  “must  be  pre- 
pared”  for failures  in  fu ture   manned  space  flights.  “We  don’t 
envision  every  flight,”  he  said,  “coming  back  as   successfully as 
the  three we have had so far  . . . I hope we will always have  the  
confidence  in  the   program  t h a t   we  now  have  despite  the   fac t

I n   testifying  on  behalf  of  the   National  Science 
Foundation  appropriation,  Van  Allen  said  t h a t   the   U S .   should 
n o t   rush  into  a  cooperative  space .program with  Russ ia ;  failures 
would  worsen  relations  since Russia  has more  to   gain  from  such 
a  program.  Th e  U S . ,  he  said,  had  surpassed  Russia  “in  nearly 
all  areas  of  purely  scientific  investigation  of  outer  space”  but, 
some  American  scientists have  “an  uneasy,  creeping feeling  t h a t  
Russia  is  abou t   to   launch  a  manned  flight  around  the   moon.”

March 6 :   Each   of  the  series of  weather satellites, Tiros, Nimbus,  and 
Aeros, would not only provide an  advance in capability b u t  would 
extend  observations  in to   vital  new  areas,  Morton  J.  Stoller, 
NASA’s Director  of  Applications,  testified  before a subcommittee 
of  the  House Committee on Science and Astronautics.  Speaking 
of  Nimbus  and Aeros, he said : “With one Nimbus in orbit, abou t  
half a day  passes before we  again see the  same area.  This will be 
a reasonably satisfactory time for the  observation of  such systems 
a s  cyclonic storms  and   hurricanes  whose  normal life  is  consider- 
ably  greater  than   12  hours.  Bu t ,   if   we  a t temp t   t o   observe 
thunderstorm  cells  or  tornadoes,  systems  whose  life  is  apprec- 
iably  less  than   12 hours  and   often  less  than   6 hours will  usually 
form,  move  and  die  without  ever  being  detected.  It  is  for  this 
reason  t h a t   the  Aeros  satellite with  its capability  for focusing on 
small short-lived s torm  systems  and  tracking  them  continuously, 
is  considered  to   be  an   integral  component  of  the   eventual oper- 
ational system.” 
Secretary of  the  Air  Force Eugene M .  Zuckert,  speaking before  the  
Los Angeles Chamber  of  Commerce,  cited  Dr .  Hugh  L. Dryden’s 
summation  of  the  purposes  of  the   national  space program-‘‘(  1) 
insurance  of  the   nation  against  scientific obsolescence in  a  t ime  
of  explosive advances  in  science and  technology;  and   (2)  insur- 
ance  against  the   hazards  of  military  surprise  in  space.”  The  
Secretary  added :   “He  defined  in  these  two  purposes  the   peace- 
time role  of  NASA   in  the  national  space program,  and  the  defense 
role  of  the   Air  Force.  Th e   two  mus t   advance  in  harness,  and 
they  do.  They   are   interdependent.  One  cannot move  without 
the   other.  Furthermore,  the  nation  cannot s tand  for  any  diver- 
sion  of  the   efforts  of  either  toward  jurisdictional  conflicts which 
which  can rob  us of  the  most  precious ingredient-time.”

D.  Brainerd  Holmes,  NASA’s Director  of  Manned  Space  Flight, 
testified before  a subcommittee  of  the  House  Science and  Astro- 
nautics Committee  on  the  very  large and  complex manned  space 
flight  program.  The   most  impor tan t   s tep   in  space  capability 
in  1961, he  said,  “was not  t h a t   of  awarding particular  con trac ts  
or  making  technical  decisions, b u t   ra ther   Mr .   Webb’s  carefully 
planned  reorganization  of  the   National  Aeronautics  and  Space 
Administration.”  Speaking  of  fu ture   launch  sites  for  th e   Ad- 
vanced  Sa turn   vehicle  as   the   workhorse  of  the   manned  lunar  
program,  he   said:  “.  . . it  shows our  plans  for  an  entirely  new 
assem t ling or building  the   launch  vehicles on  the  pads   as we  do 
c om e   t of launching our large space vehicles.  Ins tead  of  literally 
a t   present,  this  arrangement  would  permit  assembly  and  tes t  
a t   a  location  remote  from  the   launch  pads  and  under  cover, 
protected  from  weather.  It  will  be   possible  to   have  vertical 
transfer  of  the   entirely  assembled vehicle to   the  launch  pad  in  a 
tested  condition.  This  arrangement  should  offer  many  ad- 
vantages  in  order  to   permit  be t ter   and  more  thorough  check- 
out,  and  to   assure more  rapid  launching  and  efficient utilization 
of  each  pad.  For  the   extremely  t igh t   schedules  t h a t   will  be 
required  for  launch  operations  in   support  of  orbital  rendezvous, 
th is  rapid  launch  capability  is highly desirable.”

“The  space  science  of  today  is  needed  to  sow  the   seeds  for 
th e  harvest  of  fu ture   applications of  space knowledge  and  tech- 
nology.  T h e  weather, communications, and  navigation  satellites

Generation,  testifying before  a  subcommittee of  the  House Com- 
mittee on  Science and Astronautics,  said:  ‘(. . . some of  the  new 
solid  propellants  promise  an   increase  in  performance  of  over  18 
percent.  . . .  If  applied  t o   our  new  Surveyor  spacecraft  de- 
signed  t o  land  instruments  on  the  moon,  this  18 percent  increase 
in solid propellant specific impulse could make possible an increase 
in  th e  weight  of  instruments  aboard  by  more  than   50  percent.”

March  14: NASA’s Director  of  Aeronautical  Research,  John   Stack, 
testifying  before  a  subcommittee  of  the   House  Committee  on 
Science and   Astronautics,  spoke  of  NASA   suppor t   of  DOD   missile 
programs:  “Included  in  this  work  are  such  as  Pershing,  Atlas, 
Nike, Nike-Zeus, Eagle, GAR-9 and  Skybolt.  The  NASA  contribu- 
tions have been  in  two  areas,  one providing  critical  aerodynamic 
information  for  performance  determination  and   control  system 
characteristics and  the  other in suggesting configuration improve- 
men ts  to  improve the  over-all characteristics.” 
NASA  announced t h a t  sea damage to  Wallops S ta t ion ,  Va., occurring 
earlier  in  the   mon th   was  no t   extensive,  and   th a t   rocket  firings 
would  be resumed  in a few days.  Although launch pads and  some 
tracking  gear  on  the   island  itself  had   been  damaged  by   water, 
the  more impor tan t  tracking and  da ta  acquisition facilities on  the  
mainland  were undamaged. 
EXPLORER   IX, launched  on  February  16,  1961,  provided  new  and  
refined  information  on  the   density  of  the   upper  atmosphere,  a 
press conference of  NASA   and  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa- 
to ry   scientists  reported.  They   confirmed  a  figure  previously 

35

the   density  of  the   atmosphere  a t  420 mi. was  3  x 
released-that 
lo-’’  g rams  per cubic centimeter, or  1/40 million millionth of  t h a t  
a t  sea  level.  EXPLORER  IX density  values  were  about  10  times 
lower than   those computed  in  1959 from earlier satellites.  Most 
of  this decrease is a t tr ibu ted  to  the  decrease in solar activity since 
the  peak  of  the  solar cycle in 1958 and   1959.  Changes were  also 
clearly related  to   the   27-day  rotational  period  of  the   sun  and  to  
the   occasional violent solar storms  t h a t   affect  the   earth’s  atmos- 
phere.  EXPLORER  IX ,   a  12-ft.  aluminum-foil sphere  painted with 
white  “polka  dots,”  was  expected  to   have  an  orbital  life  of  two 
more years.  As it spiraled  down  in to   denser  atmosphere,  it was 
expected to  provide much more information on density a t  altitudes 
down  to   100 mi. 
March 14:  United  Nations  opened  a  public  register  on  satellites  in 
orbit.  A t   the   time  of  opening, it contained  only  the  U.S.  report 
submitted  on  March  5,  which  reported  “72  US. space  vehicles 
and   associated objects  in  sustained  orbit  or  space  trans i t”   as  of 
February  15,  1962. 
0  NASA  and  th e   J e t   Propulsion  Laboratory  announced  the   selection 
of  Military  Electronics  Division  of  Motorola,  Inc . ,   aa  con- 
trac tor   to  manufacture  and  tes t   radio  equi  ment  in  the  f i s t  two

0  Walter C. Sco t t ,  Chief  of  NASA’s Space Power Technology Program, 
testifying  before  th e   House  Committee  on  Science  and  Astro- 
nautics,  said  one  of  the   promising  developments  in  solar  cells 
was  the   possibility of  producing  thin  strips  of  silicon solar  cells 
on some kind  of  subs tra ta .   If  this can be done,  the  “much lower 
cost,  lower  weight  and  improved  mechanical  properties  will  be 
a t trac t ive   to  the   space  indus try   and  for  t h a t   ma t te r   to   the  
civilian  economy.  Thin  films  of  cadmium  sulfide  have  been 
It 
roduced  in  small  areas  with  conversion  efficiencies of  3%. 
{as  been  s ta ted   t h a t   if   this  efficiency  could  be  increased  to   5%  
and  produced  in  large  areas,  solar  power  would  be  economically 
competitive with  conventional sources a t  ra tes   of  3  to  4 mils  per 
kilowatt hour.”

“erratic hear t  ra te ,”  after  the  medical  findings had  been  reviewed 
b y   an  Air  Force medical  board  and  a  board  of  civilian  cardiolo- 
gists.  Astronaut  Walter  M.  Schirra was  named  as  Carpenter’s 
backup pilot. 
Editorial  in  the   Royal  Aero  Club  magazine  Flight  claimed  th a t  
because  the  U.S. had made  “six major  launches  on  which  basic

President  Kennedy  wrote  Premier  Khrushchev  proposing  specific 
areas  of  peaceful  cooperation  in  space  t o   be  undertaken  by  the  
U.S.  and  U.S.S.R.:  (1)  in  furtherance of  an   operational  weather 
satellite system, proposed each country launch  a weather satellite 
in  near-polar  orb i t ,   disseminate da ta   t o   all nations;  (2)  in  space 
tracking,  proposed  each  country  build  a  tracking  station  in  the  
other’s territory  and  tra in  personnel of  the  host  country  to  main- 
tain  and operate the  s ta t ion ;   (3)  in mapping the  earth’s magnetic 
field,  proposed  each  country  launch  a  magnetic-measurement 
satellite,  one  in  near-earth  orbit  and  one  far ther   ou t ,   and  dis- 
seminate  da ta   to   all  nations;  (4)  in  communications  satellites, 
proposed  t h a t  U.S.S.R.  jo in   in  cooperative program  to  establish 
an  operational  communications  satellite  system,  to   be  made 
available to  all nations;  (5)  in manned  space flight, proposed  t h a t  
the   two  countries  pool  their  knowledge  of  space  medicine;  (6) 
proposed  general  continued  fu ture   cooperation,  as  in  joint  ex- 
ploration  of  the   lunar   surface o r   scientific investigation  of  Mars

March  20:  Premier  Khrushchev  replied  to   President’s  le t ter   of 
March  17  proposing  U.S.-U.S.S.R.  cooperation  on peaceful uses 
of  outer space by  accepting in principle  and  specificall  approving 
of  cooperation  in  certain  areas  (letter  released  on  L a r c h   21 ) :  
(1) communications  satellites ; ( 2 )  weat,her satellites ; (3 )  coordina-

international  search  and   rescue  opertltions  t o   recover  space 
crews  who  have  returned  t o   ea r th   outside  the   planned  recovery 
areas ;   ( 5 )  mapping  th e   earth‘s  magnetic  field  and  exchange  of 
information  on  space medicine;  (6)  joint  agreement  on  problems 
of  international law as related t o  space exploration, beyond  those 
points already agreed t o  in  t h e  U .N . ,   especially th e  prohibition  of 
space  experiments  t h a t   would  inhibit  the   space  experiments  of 
other  nations.  Premier  Khrushchev  warned,  however,  t h a t  
space  cooperation  would  “depend  t o   some  extent  on  the   settle- 
men t   of  the   disarmament  problem,”  since much  military  hard- 
ware  and   techniques  were  used  in  peaceful  space  exploration

possibility, estimated  t h a t   four  per  cent  of  the   billions of  s tars  in 
the  universe must have planets capable of  sustaining life.  Listen- 
ing for messages from other planets would not be worthwhile on a 
random  basis;  if  disarmament  came,  military  radar   might  be 
devoted  to   this  purpose,  he  said.

the   scientific  gains  the   joint  effort  would  offer  might  be  small 
compared  t o   the   gains  for  world  peace.  For  a  cooperative 
Soviet-American  effort  in  space  science  and  exploration  would 
emphasize the  interests t h a t  unite us instead  of  th e   conflicts t h a t  
divide us.  It offers  us an  area  in which  the   stale, sterile dogmas 
of  the   cold  war  can  be  left  literally  a  quar ter   of  a million miles

March 24:  Two-week meeting of  S tudy  Group IV  of  the  In terna t iona l  
Radio Consultative Committee  (CC IR )   of  the   In terna t iona l  Tele- 
communication  Union 
(ITU)  concluded  in  Washington,  D .C .  
S tudy  Group  IV  reviewed  technical phases  of  space communica- 
tions,  including  the   selection  of  frequencies  fo r   telecommunica- 
tions with  and between  space vehicles.  Over  200 representatives 
from  3 0   countries  participated  in  these  sessions,  D r .   John   P. 
Hagen serving as head of  the  U S .  delegation. 
Prof .  Auguste  Piccard,  pioneer  Swiss  explorer  of  the   stratosphere 
and  ocean  depths,  died  in  Geneva  a t   the   age  of  78 .   I n   1931 
Prof. Piccard  ascended  to  51,777 ft. in the  gondola  of  a balloon of 
his  own  design.  I n   numerous  balloon  ascents  in  the   1920’s and 
1930’s,  he  made  many   studies  of  radioactivity,  atmospheric 
electricity,  cosmic rays ,   and  other  scientific phenomena.  Turn-  
ing from  the   air  to   the   oceans, Prof.  Piccard  designed his  ba thy-  
scaphe  and  in  1953 he  and his  son reached  a  dep th  of  two  miles. 
I n   1960  the   U.S.  Navy   took  an   improved  version  of  his  craft 
down  to  37 ,800  f t .  
Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, executed in 1937 on Stalin’s 
orders and exonerated in  1956, was honored  in the  official military 
newspaper,  R ed   Star.  It  was  pointed  ou t   t h a t   in  1932  Tukha-  
chevsky  insisted  on  the   development  of  rocket  engines  and   t h a t  
he persisted  in  this  effort until  purged. 
March 25:  National Academy  of  Sciences announced t h a t  th e  John  J. 
C a r ty   Medal  would  be  awarded  Provost  Charles  H.  Townes  of 
MIT  for  his  pioneering  work  in  the   development  of  the   maser 
(microwave  amplification  by   stimulated  emission  of  rad ia t ion) .  
Dr. Townes was  credited with  the   conception  of  the   idea  for  the  
maser  in  1951,  which  was  subsequently  used  in  radio  astronomy 
in  recording  and  charting  minute  radio signals  emanating  from

March 26:  U.S.S.R.  submitted  information  on  16 Soviet s ace f igh t s  
Included  were  the   manned  orbital  flights  by   Majs.  Yuri  A. 
Gagarin and Gherman S. T i tov .   U.S.  submitted  a similar list to  
the  U.N.  on March  5, covering U.S.  space launchings to  Feb.  15,

Coordination  of  international  arrangements  for  exchange  and   dis- 
semination  of  weather  da ta ,   including weather  satellite informa- 
tion,. was  on  th e   agenda  of  the   th ird   session  of  the   U.N.’s  Com- 
mission  for  Synoptic Meteorology  as  it  opened  a  26-day  session 
in  Washington.  Technical  experts  from  more  than   100  nations 
had  been  invited. 
D r .   James  A.  Van  Allen,  Chairman  of  the   Depar tmen t   of  Physics 
and Astronomy a t  th e  S t a t e  University  of  Iowa,  summarized the  
satellite  and  space  probe  findings  about  the   s truc ture   of  the  
geomagnetic  field  surrounding  th e   earth.  Describing  the   inner 
zone  as   relatively  stable  in  intensity  of  charged  particles  and 
caused  by   a  combination of  internal  and  external  forces, he  said 
the   outer  zone  showed  fluctuations  in  intensity  “by  factors  of 
100  to   as  much  as   1,000,”  said  these  were  complexly related  to  
solar flares and geomagnetic storms.  T h e  only convincing expla- 
nation  for  the  origin  of  the   outer  zone ye t  made  is  “ the   capture 
of  ionized  solar  gas  which  sweeps  by   th e   ear th   in  F e a t   clouds 
from  time  to   time.  . . .  B u t   the   detailed  mechanism  for  pro- 
ducing  the   observed  energy  spectrum  remains  obscure  and  the  
na ture   of  this  mechanism  is  perhaps  the   most  interesting  unre- 
solved problem  in  the  subject of  trapped  radiation:” 
John   A.  Johnson,  General  Counsel  of  NASA,  testifylng  before  the  
Senate  Subcommittee  on  Monopoly,  s ta ted   t h a t   as   of  Feb.  28, 
1962, a  to ta l   of  297  inventions  had  been  reported  b y   NASA  con- 
tractors  under  the  pa ten t   provisions of  the  National  Aeronautics 
and  Space  Act  of  1958.  Of  these,  268  had   been  determined  to  
be  Government  property,  29  had  been  or  are   being  considered 
for waivers. 
March 27:  U.S.  and  U.S.S.R.  technical  representatives  held  the   f i s t  
of  a  series of  ta lks  on - th e  possibility of  joint  cooperation in space 
research and exploration.  Dr .  Hugh L. Dryden, Depu ty  Admin- 
is tra tor   of  NASA,  represented  the   U.S.;  Dr.  Anatoli  A .   Blagon- 
ravov,  of 
th e   Soviet  Academy  of  Sciences,  represented  th e  
U.S.S.R. 
NASA  fired  a  Nike-Cajun  rocket  from  Wallops  Station,  Va.,  which 
released  a  sodium vapor  cloud between  25  and   74 miles altitude. 
Rays   of  the  setting  sun   colored  the   sodium  cloud  red,  instead  of 
sodium vapor’s normal  yellow. 
In   address t o  th e   In s t i tu te   of  Radio  Engineers in  New  York,  NASA 
Depu ty   Administrator  Hugh  L.  Dryden  s ta ted :   “The  costs  of

sive  sounding rockets  prior  t o   use  on  th e  more  expensive satel- 
lites.  . .  . 
“To s ta te  the  ma t ter   another way,  we  desire assured  and  dem- 
onstrated  performances  and  reliability.  The   cost  of  the   neces- 
sa ry  engineering and  tes ts  is small compared  t o  the  cost of  a single 
i‘ailure.  We   do  no t   wish  t o   be  the   first  t o   use  the   newest  and  
most  advanced  device  nor  the   last  to   give  up  the   obsolete.  A 
moderately  conservative  engineering  approach  with  adequa te  
analysis  and  t e s t   is indicated  as the  best  design  philosophy.” 
March 27.- Dr. Edward  Teller, testifying before the  House Committee 
on  Science and Astronautics,  recommended  a  program  for  estab- 
lishing a large and independent colony on  the  moon, as a means of 
having  a  working  base  in  space and control of  near  space from  a 
standpoint  of  national security.  A  nuclear reactor should be  de- 
veloped  t o  operate  on  the  moon, eventually  t o  furnish th e  power 
t o  extract water  from  the  moon’s  rocks and  soil, he said. 
Ma rch   28:  U S .   submitted  t o   the   U .N .   a  supplemental  list  of  U.S. 
space  l au n ch ing ,   covering  th e   period  of  Peb.  15  t o   March  1 5 ,  
1962,  updating  the   coverage  of  the   first  U.S.  list  subm i t ted   on 
March  5 ,   1962 .   This  second  official  list  did  not  include  Astro- 
nau t   John  Glenn’s  3-orbit  flight,  since  the   U S .   contended  th a t  
the  U.N. roster was  supposed  t o  contain  only those space objects 
still  in  orb i t ,   not  those  t h a t   had  already  re-entered.  U.S.S.R. 
listed  all  its space  flights in  i ts   report  t o   the   U.N.  on  March   26 .  
Although MA-6  flight was  not  registered,  the  U.S. submitted  in- 
formation on the  Glenn  f i g h t  to  the  U.N. on April 3. 
U.S.  and  Soviet  space  officials ended  two  days   of  technical  discus- 
sions  in  New  York  on  possible  cooperation  in   outer  space.  No 
public announcements were made. 
Senate  Aeronautical  and   Space  Sciences  Committee  unanimously 
approved a bill  for ownership  and  operation of  the  Nation’s com- 
mercial  communications  satellites. 
I n  speech  a t  Worcester, Mass.,  Gen.  Cur t is  E. LeMay   s ta ted   t h a t  
the  U.S.S.R.  is  “moving  a t  full speed for  a  decisive capability in 
space”  and  t h a t   the  U.S.  could no t   afford  a  “fa ta l   technological 
surprise  in  the   1970’s.”  Gen.  LeMay   pointed  ou t   t h a t   many  
people  looked  a t  military  space operations  as  “merely  an   exten- 
sion  of  nuclear  weapons.  .  . . Th is  may   no t   be  the   case  a t  all. 
Our  national  security  in   the   fu tu re  may   depend  on  armaments 
vastly  different  from  any   we  know  today,  and  believe  me  they  
won’t  be  ultimate  weapons  either.” 
Dav id  Sarnoff, Chairman of  the   Board  of  Radio  Corp.  of  America, 
speaking to   the  In s t i tu te  of  Radio Engineers in New York,  called 
for  the   free  world  to   organize  an   international  community  of 
science, stnffed by  its best  scientific brains,  to   expand knowledge 
of  basic  science  and  to   a t tack   pressing  world  problems  such  a s

NASA  and  the   USAF,  and  the   national  requirement  fo r  military 
space  weapons  systems.  H e   pointed  ou t   tha t :   (1)  102  USAF 
officers were  assigned  full-time  with  NASA  as  well  as  23  Navy  
and  33  Army;  (2)  $49  millions  of  NASA  support  was  funded  by  
the   USAF  through  F Y   61   and  over  $200  millions  in  FY   6 2 ;   (3 )  
$270  millions  of  NASA  funds were  processed  under  cognizance of 
AFSC during  FY   6 1 ;   and  (4)  NASA  use  of  USAF   booster,  launch, 
and  tracking  capabilities  and  the   joint  x-15  program  fur ther  
demonstrated  “ the   work  NASA  and  the   Air  Force  are  doing  to- 
gether  as  a  team.”  Gen.  Schriever pointed  to   the   fundamental 
capabilities of  fu tu re  space  weapon  systems  and  the   assignment 
by   the   Secretary of  Defense  of  major  responsibility  for military 
space  systems  development  to  the   Air  Force.

performed  beyond  all  expectations,  operated  for  78  days,  trans- 
m i t ted   almost  23,000  cloud  photos,  of  which  some  19,000 were 
useful t o  meteorologists.  TIROS  11, launched November 23,  1960, 
transm i t ted  more  than   33,000 photos  and  one  year  after  launch 
was  still  occasionally taking  useful  photos.  TIROS  111,  launched 
Ju ly   12 ,  1961, took  24,000  cloud photos  and was most spectacular 
as  a  “hurricane  hun ter .”   TIROS   IV,  launched  February   8,  1962, 
has  averaged  250  operationally-useful  photos per  day .  
Senator Margaret  Chase  Sm i th ,  in  a  radio  interview with  Senator 
Kenne th   B.  Keating,  expressed  doub t   on  the   value  of  space 
cooperation  with  the   U.S.S.R.  A  member  of  the   Senate  Aero- 
nautical  and Space Sciences Committee, Sen. Smith said  the  U.S. 
had   “decided  superiority  over  Russia  on  really  impor tan t   space 
development.  Russia  has  the   edge over  u s   on  th ru s t   power  bu t  
when  i t  comes to  finer scientific space developments and informa- 
tion,  we  have  grea t   superiority  over  Russia.  Perhaps  one  of 
our greatest areas of  superiority is in the  development of  miniatur- 
ization.  I th ink  we  could learn something from Russia  bu t  there 
is a question  as to  jus t  how  far we  can t ru s t  her  and what we  get

Dr.  John   A .  Simpson,  of  the  University  of  Chicago’s Enrico  Fermi 
In s t i tu te   for  Nuclear  Studies,  said  in  a Voice  of  America  broad-

“It is now necessary  to  determine how long a man  can operate in

or more.  This is one of  the  main tasks before proceeding to  more 
complex flights to   the  moon, for example, or  to  the  establishment 
of  orbital  or  interplanetary  stations.”  H e   criticized  the   U.S.

U.N.  “The  best  information  about  outer  space  has   been  ob- 
tained  in  the  U.S.S.R.  The  Americans  can  benefit  more by   our 
experience than   we  by   theirs.  Some people  in  America  are  not

Soviet  con  uerors of  space reflect  the   great  achievements of  the  
of  our  homeland,  the   indisputable  advantages  of  socialism,  and

representatives  of  the   western  world  cannot  fail  to  admit  t h a t  
socialism, as  Comrade  Khrushchev  pu t   i t ,   is  indeed  the   reliable 
launching  pad  from  which  the   Soviet  Union  launches  its 
spaceships. 
“Only  a year  has passed since a Soviet man  heralded  the  dawn 
of  the   space  age  by   making  his  &st  flight  into  interplanetary 
space,  b u t   this  year  has  been  packed  with  great  events.  The  
22nd  CPSU  Congress adopted  a  pa r ty   program  which  gave wings 
to  the  Soviet people and marked  ou t  the  clear prospects for build-

of  their physical na ture ,  le t  alone the  mechanism  of  their  origin.” 
Crediting high-altitude rockets for initial detection and  occasional 
s tudy  of  hidden solar radiation, detailed s tudy  requires  continous 
observation  of  the   sun   on  a  24-hour  basis,  which  “can  only  b e

Section of  the   ARS. 
“The  true   mission  of  our  military  s treng th  
is  to  protect  the   peace,”  he  said.  “If  we  do no t   take   adequate 
care of  our national defense, we  will not  have  a chance to  do any 
of  the  other  things  in  space-at 
least  as  free men.” 
D.  Brainerd  Holmes,  NASA’s Director  of  Manned  Space  Flight, 
speaking  before  the   American  Management  Association  in  New 
York,  said:  “We believe  t h a t   the   soundness of  our  present  engi- 
neering  program  can  be  illustrated  by  the   correlation  between 
predicted  events  and  time  of  occurrence  in  John   Glenn’s  recent 
flight.  Indeed,  the   time  from  lift-off  to   impact  in  this  mission 
was  within  one second of  the  pre-flight  calculations.”

Three   experiments  measured  electron  density,  temperatures, 
and   composition  of  positive  ions  in  the   ionosphere,  while  two 
experiments were  designed  to   monitor  the   intensity  of  radiation 
from  the   sun  in  the   ultraviolet  and  x-ray  bands   of  the   solar 
corona.  The   sixth  experiment  was  designed  to   measure  cosmic

Apr i l   SO:  I n  address to  IAS  meeting in  St. Louis, George M. Low, NASA 
Director  of  Spacecraft  and  F l igh t   Missions,  concluded  with  a

A t   the   same  time,  the   committee  recommended  t h a t   s teps   be  
taken   to   improve  the   competence  of 
the   Government’s  own 
scientific staffs  and   laboratories  to   direct  research  programs. 
Late  April:  FAA  awarded first  seven  contracts,  totaling $2.66  million, 
for commercial  supersonic  transpor t   aircraft.  FAA  Administrator 
N.  E. Ha laby   said  th e   action  was  “ the   first  s tep   leading  t o   the  
development  of  a  safe,  practical,  economical  airplane  to   carry  
th e   traveling  public  beyond  the   speed  of  sound.” 
During  April:  Dr.  John  C.  Houbolt,  of  NASA’s Langley  Research 
Center,  writing  in  the   April  issue  of  Astronautics,  outlined  the  
ossible advantages of  lunar-orbit rendezvous for a manned  lunar  
k n d i n g   a s   opposed  to   direct  flight  from  ea r th   or  earth-orbit 
rendezvous.  Under  th is   concept,  an   Apollo-type  vehicle  would 
fly direct  to   the   moon,  g o   in to  orb i t   around  the  moon,  de tach   a 
small  landing  craf t   which  would  land   on  the   moon  and  then  
re tu rn   t o   the   mother  craf t ,   which  would  then  re turn   to   earth. 
Advantages would  be   the  much  smaller craf t   having  to   perform 
the  difficult lunar  landing and take-off,  the  possibility  of  optimiz- 
ing  the   smaller craf t   for  this one function,  the   safe re turn   of  the  
mother  craf t   in  event  of  a landing  accident,  and  even  the  possi- 
bility of  using two of  the  small craf t  to  provide a rescue capability. 
Mach   2.2 windowless  supersonic  transpor t   A-60  design  announced

frames  a t  a  r a t e  of  100,000,000 frames per  second  with  exposure 
times  as  brief  as  five  nanoseconds.  Designated  KFC-600,  the  
camera  may   have  wide  applications  in  aerospace  studies  of 
physical  phenomena  such  as  arc   and   plasma  gas  discharge,  ex- 
plosive detonation, hypervelocity impact, shock wave studies, and  
nuclear  instrumentation. 
TIROS  II  was  turned  on l a t e  in April  from unknown  spurious source. 
An engineering investigation was run  in early M ay  before turning 
it off  again.  An analysis of  the   d a t a   indicated  t h a t  a t  least some

M a y   1:  In terna t iona l  Committee on Space Research (COSPAR )   meeting 
1961 and p T ans  for  1962 by the  US. and U.S.S.R.  A. A. Blagon- 
in  Washin  on  received  summary  reports  of  accomplishments  of 
ravov  of  th e   Soviet  Academy  of  Sciences  reported  t h a t   the  
U.S.S.R.  planned  to   send  more  men  into  orb i t   th is   year  a s  well 
as  several  more  unmanned  scientific  satellites,  including  one  to  
s tu dy   “ the   distribution  and  production  of  cloud  systems  in  the  
atmosphere.” 
Dr .   Richard  W.  Por ter   of  the   U S .   delegation  specified  t h a t  
NASA   planned  to   launch  22  instrumented  satellites  and   space 
probes during the   year.  During  1961, Por ter  reported,  the  U S .  
had   launched :  over  300  high-altitude  research  balloons;  866 
weather  rockets; more  than   70 larger  rockets no t  mean t   to   carry 
payloads in to  orb i t ;  and 31 instrumented satellites and deep-space 
probes. 
British  scientists protested U S .  plans to   explode “rainbow”  bombs 
500  miles  above  the   Pacific  tes t   area  (called  “rainbow”  bombs 
because  high-altitude  nuclear  explosions light  up   th e   sky   thou- 
sands  of  miles  away).  Sir  Bernard  Lovell,  director  of  Jodrell 
Bank   Radio  Observatory,  Mar t in   Ryle,  radio-astronomer,  and 
Sir  Ma rk   Oliphant,  Australian  nuclear  physicist,  all  protested 
th e   “probable”  distortion  of  the  Van  Allen  radiation belt  by   the  
forthcoming U.S.  tests. 
Dr .   Richard  W.  Por ter ,   head  of  th e   U.S.  delegation  t o   COSPAR 
meeting  in Washington,  reported  t h a t   th e  moon  emits x-rays  a s  
a  result  of  solar  and  cosmic  r a y   bombardment.  Rockets  shot 
of  October 24,  1961, detected  x-radiation  from  the  lunar   surface. 
By  fu ture   studies  of  these  energies it  is  hoped  t o   determine  the  
composition  of  the  surface of  the  moon. 
Secretary  of  Defense  Robert  S. McNamara   announced  in  London 
t h a t   the  U S .  would  contribute over  $30 milIion  for  the  develop-

the  security  and  well-being of  the  United  S ta tes .”  
May  1 :  T h e   Television  Academy  announced  annual  Emmy   Award 
nominations.  T h e   orbital  flight  of  Astronaut  Glenn  and  Mrs. 
John  F .  Kennedy’s tour of  the  White House-regarded  as top T V  
events-were  no t  considered  because they had been cooperatively 
covered by   th e  three  major  networks. 
May  2:  D r .   James  A.  Van  Allen  termed  the   planned  U.S.  hydrogen 
bomb  explosion  high  over  the   Pacific  Ocean  as   a  “magnificent 
experimen t , ”  one  which  should  bring  new  knowledge  concerning 
the  origin  of  the  inner belt  of  high-energy  protons.  H e  disagreed 
with  scientists  abroad  who  object  to   the   tes t   as   a  unilateral 
military  experiment. 
NASA   scientists reported  to  COSPAR   session t h a t  d a t a  from  EX PLORER  
IX  indicated  t h a t   the  upper  atmosphere was  heated  by   sun  spo t  
ac t iv i ty .   I n   1957  and  1958,  when  solar  ac t iv i ty   was  a t   the  
maximum  of  i t s   11.1-year  cycle,  air  density  a t   a  height  of  350 
miles was  10 times  higher  th an  in  1961 when  ac t iv i ty  was  nearer 
i t s  minimum.  This  suggests  t h a t   “with  a  decrease  in  solar  ac- 
t iv i ty   the   upper  atmosphere  becomes  cooler  and   shrinks  to   th e  
ear th ,   so  t h a t   the   air  density  a t   a  given  a l t i tude   decreases.” 
Repor t   on  EX PLORER   IX,  the   12-ft.  inflated  satellite  sensitive  to  
density  changes,  was made b y  William  J. O’Sullivan,  Claude W. 
Coffee, J r . ,  and Gerald  M .  Keating. 
House  of  Representatives  defeated  b y   voice  vote  a  bill  sponsored

quisition  and Management  in  Today’s  Environment.” 
May  3:  Two  GSFC  scientific  sounding  rockets  launched  from Wallops 
S ta t ion .   An  Ir is  research rocket launched with tes t  instrumenta- 
tion  did  no t   achieve  programed  a l t i tude   and   landed  175 s t a tu t e  
miles downrange.  A  four-stage  Argo D 4  launch  vehicle  carried 
78-lb payload  to  an  a l t i tude  of  almost  530  s t a tu t e  miles  to  record

May 7:  I n  speech in New Orleans, NASA Administrator James E. Webb 
reviewed  the   National  Launch  Vehicle  Program,  which  “recog- 
nizes all the  re   uirements of  our nation in space, and includes the

NASA  announced a t  Cape Canaveral MA-7  launching, scheduled for 
May   15  or  afterward,  would  be  delayed  several days  because  of 
check-out problems with  the  Atlas booster. 
In  Voice of  America  broadcast,  Dr .   Christian J. Lambertsen  of  the 
University  of  Pennsylvania  said  t h a t   there  is  an  increasing 
recognition of the  role man  can play  in space exploration because 
“there  are aspects of  exploration which no machine yet  conceived 
can carry ou t .”   He  pointed ou t  tha t   ‘ ( the  only computer capable

events  is  man  himself.”  He  then  reviewed  the   medicophysio- 
logical  factors  to  be  overcome  fo r  manned  space  flight,  and  he 
warned  th a t   “even  the   practicability  of  truly  extended  flight

to  chide  U S .   space  program.  He   said  t h a t   if  he  was  asked  to 
join  a U.S. astronaut in  a cooperative space mission:  “I would be 
a bit  afraid becawe  there have been  quite a lo t  of  failures in your

rest  of  the   world.  And  i t   underscores our  determinatlon  to   see 
to  i t  t h a t  no  nation  is disfranchised  in space  . . . 
“The  primary  purpose  of  our  arms has  always been  peace, not

‘(Space is the  new measure of  our problems as well as our oppor-

program  are  vested  in  the   National  Aeronautics  and  Space Ad- 
ministration  and  the   Air Force.  We  work  together  as a  team, 
not  rivals.  And  together  we  are  doing  the   spadework  for  the  
space technology  of  tomorrow. 
“Today,  space  is  still free  and  open.  It must  s t ay   t h a t  way. 
We  can no t   allow it to  be  pre-empted tomorrow  for use  as a mili-

they  are  prepared  to  moderate  their  views  accordingly.”  When 
dealing  with  the   Soviet  Union  on  space  issues,  McCloy  s ta ted :  
“Questions  of  international  prestige  quickly  emerge  and  we  are  
still  plagued  with  the   almost  frenetic  an t ipa thy   of  the   Soviet

M a y  1.4:  I n  NAS   broadcast  fo r  Voice  of  America,  Dr .   Colin S. P i t ten-  
drigh,  Professor  of  Biology,  Princeton  University,  said  th a t   bio- 
logical  engineering for manned  space flight will  have  an  influence 
on  theoretical  physiology,  bu t   th a t   “space  technology  holds  far 
less  promise  of  any  revolution  in  biology  than   in  physics.”  Th e  
possibility  of  extraterrestrial  life,  he  described  as  (‘ the  most  ex- 
citing  scientific question  of  the   day .”  
Optimum  conditions  for  a  manned  spacecraft  with  regard  to  
else.”  He   pointed  to  the   possible  exc k usion  of  heavy  radiation 
temperature, moisture,  oxygen, and  carbon  dioxide can  be  speci- 
fied.  Bu t   “we  have  difficulty  in  bein  precise  abou t   anything 
by   means  of  an  intense  magnetic  field,  bu t   “can  man   perform 
normally in such intense magnetic fields?”  L i t t le  is known  abou t  
the   reliability  of  algae,  and  new  studies  of  photosynthesis  and 
techniques  of  algoculture  are  needed.  Rhythmic  inna te   oscilla- 
tions, previously  considered superficial to   t8he physiological archi- 
tec ture  of  organisms, are ( (  a highly significant parameter of  physio- 
logical organization.”  And  the  possible effect of  the  earth’s grav- 
itational field on normal physiological function is no t  fully known. 
Dr.  Pittendrigh  concluded : “Clean  questions  and  clean  answers 
are going t o  be  difficult for  some  time.  When  we p u t  organisms 
in to  space a t  present  and  detect deleterious effects, we  are simply 
unable  to   disentangle  the   many   variables  th a t   exist  there  and 
decide which  has  been  responsible.” 
U.S.  delegate  to   the   17-nation  disarmament  conference,  Charles 
C. Stelle, urged  early action  to  ban  outer space for nuclear arma- 
men ts :   “Th i s   conference  could  lead  to   measures  designed  to  
insure  th a t  outer space can  become  an  impetus  to  man’s  peaceful 
progress  and  no t   a  ba t t le   ound  in  the   future.”

May 81:  I n   concluding  lecture  in  a  Forum  series  on  Space  Science 
broadcast  on  the   Voice  of  America,  Dr.  Carl  E.  Sagen  of  the  
In s t i tu te  for Basic Research i n   Science a t  the  University  of  Cali- 
fornia  (Berkeley),  explained  th a t   “extraterrestrial  life  and   the  
origin of  life are questions intertwined.”  Recent s tudy  on  these 
issues related to  four  topics:  (1) the  origin of  life on ear th ;   (2)  the  
physical  environment  of  the   moon  and   planets;  (3)  the   present 
evidence  of  life  beyond  the   ear th ;   and   (4)  prospects  fo r   fu tu re  
ex  loration. 
&e  discussed the  chemical reactions which mus t  have existed in 
the   primitive  terrestrial  environment  and   produced  organic 
ma t ter .   The  critical event was  the   origin of  a molecular  system 
capable  of  synthesizing  itself,  and   “this  event-which 
occurred 
some  4,200 million  years  ago-can 
be  identified  with  the   origin 
of  life on  Earth.’’  From  then  on  the  long evolutionary  sequence 
from molecule to  Man  was  under way. 
Dr.  Sagen  asserted  t h a t   “through  the   interaction  of  organic 
molecules life mus t   arise  on  countless  other  worlds,  in  our  solar 
system,  and   other  solar  systems  . . .  [bu t]  the   forms  of  living 
organisms  on  other  planets  mus t   be  intriguingly  diverse.” 
Dr .   Sagen  reviewed  the   improbability  of  life  on  Venus,  th e  
possibility of  life on the  moon, and the  “favorable” environmental 
features  for  life  on  Mars.  It  is  not,  he  said,  a  closed  question 
with  regard  t o   life  on  Jup i ter ,   Sa turn ,   Uranus,  and  Neptune. 
The   presence  of  extraterrestrial  organic  ma t te r   in  meteorites 
“greatly  substantiates  the   belief  t h a t   organic ma t te r   is  an   abun- 
d an t   constituent  of  th e   solar  system.”  Detailed  characteriza- 
tion of  extraterrestrial organisms  likely t o  be found in exploration 
of  the  moon  and  the  planets  “mill  open  up  a new  era, no t  only in

I n   testimony  on  proposed  Federal  salary  reform  before  the   House 
Post  Office and  Civil  Service  Committee,  NASA  Administrator 
James  E.  Webb  stressed  the   requirements  of  the   national  space 
program for  adequately paid  scientific and  technical personnel in 
government.  He  pointed  ou t  t h a t   one  third  of  NASA’s personnel 
were professional scientists and  engineers, one  th ird  skilled crafts- 
men  and  research  mechanics  and  their  supervisors,  one  eighth 
were  engineering  and   scientific technicians,  and   one  sixth  were 
clerical  and   secretarial.  The   remainder  were  professional-level 
specialists in management, legal counsel, librarians, editors, etc. 
Mr.  Webb  said  t h a t   in  considering pay   raise  legislation  (H.R. 
10480) the   Federal  Government  must  be  able  t o   compete favor- 
ably  in  the   nation-wide  labor  market  and   t h a t   present  salaries 
must  be  raised  to   have  ‘(reasonable comparity”  outside  of  Gov-

the   U.S.  had  achieved  “notable  successes”  in  space  and  
saluted  the   courage  of  Mercury  astronauts  Glenn  and   Car- 
penter.  Commenting  on  M .   Scott  Carpenter’s  MA-7 
flight 
in  AURORA  7,  Khrushchev  declared: 
“I congratulate  him especially because  he  gave proof  of  great 
courage  in  a  s i tua t ion   in  which  he  could  have  been  burned  in 
his s h p  or drowned in th e  sea.  A l l   the  scientists could  do from

May 29:  M.  Scott  Carpenter  D a y  in Boulder, Colo.  Presented with 
an engineering degree from the  University of  Colorado, Astronaut 
Carpenter  said  t h a t   he  hoped  t h e   degree,  which  he  missed  in 
1949 because he failed a course in heat transfer, could be justified 
b y   th e   “unique”  education  in  th e   subject  received  during  his 
re-entry  in  AURORA  7.  At  a  news  conference,  Carpenter  said: 
“All  mankind  s tands   t o   gain more  as a  result  of  these  fights- 
and  mark   m y  words, man   w i l l  be  going  t o  the  moon  and   neigh-

launch when  i t  veered  off  course. 
U.S.S.R. charged  in newspapers  and  radio  broadcasts  th a t   purpose 
of  U.S. high-altitude  nuclear  tests over  the  Pacific was  to  prepare 
for  a  surprise  nuclear  a t tack   against  the   Communist  bloc,  con-

ASTBONAUTICAL  AND AERONAUTICAL  EVENTS OF  1983  
June 6:  NASA  explained  the  reasons for  t h e  250-mile  overshoot of  the  
landing by  AURORA   7, a t tr ibu t ing  most  of  th e  overshoot to   a  25’ 
error  in  th e   capsule’s  yaw  a t t i tude   a t   th e   t ime   th e   retrorockets 
were  C e d .   Th is   caused  the   th ru s t   of  th e   retrorockets  t o   be  
exerted on th e  capsule a t  an angle ra ther   than  in line and resulted 
curve  than   p 7 anned.  Th is   accounted  for  some  175   miles  of  th e  
in less slowin  of th e  capsule and consequently a shallower descent 
250-mile overshoot as well  as a deviation of  15  miles t o  the  no r th  
of the  orbital  track.  Other  factors tha t   contributed  t o  th e  over- 
shoot were the  retrorockets delivered about three per cent less than  
the  specified  thrus t ,   and  the  retrorockets  fired  about  three 
seconds  late. 
A   cooperative  program  for   testing  Relay  and  Telstar  communica-

the  3-day  “Scientists  for  Survival”  meetiny  in  New York. 
June  17:  Testimony  by   NASA   Administrator  Webb  before  House  Ap- 
propriations  subcominittee  was  released  in  which  he  declared 
t h a t  the  U.S. has given  far  more  than  i t  has received  in exchanges 
of  space  flight  findings  with  the   Soviet  Union.  B y   publicly 
releasing  information  gained  from space flights, the  U.S. is  ‘ I   . .  . 
cooperating  with  them,  b u t   no t   ge t t ing   very  much  in  the   way 
of  return  cooperation,”  he  said.  Webb  defended  U.S.  policy 
of  making space research  results  generally  available : 
“We  are,  in  this  open  way,  exposing  the   problems  jus t   ahead 
of  us  to   the   largest  number  of  able minds  all  around  the  world. 
This  is  really  the  way  mankind  has  made  i ts   forward  advance. 
No  one can  tell from which mind  comes the  solution  to  a problem. 
“I think  the   progress  which  can  come  from  this  can  never  b e  
matched  by   Russia  and  the   nations  which  do  these  things  in  
secret. ” 
USAF   announced launching of  an unidentified  satellite with  an  Atlas-

Praeda  reported:  The   “United  S ta tes   thus   had  left  the   door 
open  for  carrying  the  armament  race  in to  outer  space.  I t  seems 
t h a t  American  representatives  have come to  Geneva no t  so much 
to  negotiate  on  the   peaceful exploration  of  space as  to   jus t ify  by  
legal  pettifogging  th e   Pentagon’s militaristic  plans  in  space  and 
these plans  already  are too  well  known.” 
Dr.  Wernher  von  Braun ,   MSFC   Director,  presented  cash  invention

I n   extended  action  on  the   floor  of  the   Senate, Senators Russell  B. 
Long,  Albert  Gore,  Es tes  Kefauver,  and  Wayne Morse  opposed 
the   passage  of  the   Administration’s  amended  communications 
satellite  system  bill  (S.  2814)  previously  brought  ou t   of  the  
Committee  on  Aeronautical  and   Space  Sciences.  Senator Long 
charged  th a t   the   Sena te   had   been  subjected  to   lobbying  “ the  
like  of  which  the  Congress  had  never  seen before”  on  the  private 
ownership  of  the   proposed  communications satellite system,  and 
he  was  questioned  by   Senator  John   0. Pastore,  the   bill’s  floor 
manager. 
I n  an  address before  the  American  Management Association Forum 
in New  York, Ma j .   Gen.  Rober t  J. Friedman,  AFSC   Comptroller, 
spoke  on  ‘(Management of  the   Decision-Making  Process.”  H e  
pointed o u t  t h a t  the  Air Force Systems Command was an organi- 
zation  of  60,000  employees  with  an   annual  budget  of  seven 
billion  dollars  to   administer.  AFSC   has,  he  said,  over  33,000 
active contracts involving  companies  of  all sizes and  in all states. 
Gen.  Friedman  discussed the   “boundaries”  within  which  AFSC 
mus t   manage  i t s   decision-making  processes:  (1) actions  of  the  
military  competitors  of  the   U.S. ; (2 )   the   constraints  of  limited 
funds ;   ( 3 )   the   number  of  alternative  courses  available  in  the  
solution  of  technical,  strategic,  and  tactical  military  problems; 
(4) limitations of  t ime ;  and   (5) the  availability of  information and  
competence  a t   various  organizational  levels  within  one  juris- 
diction.

Analysis  of  da ta   from  sensors indicated  the   radiation  is  in  form 
of  soft  x-rays  t h a t   do  not  penetrate  earth’s  atmosphere  below 
50-mi. altitude.  D a t a  also seem to  indicate the  sensors may have 
detected  a  second  x-ray  source  on  the   galactic  rim.  A FCR L

posium  a t  San  Diego,  Gen.  Bernard  A.  Schriever  (USAF) s ta ted  
t h a t   i t   had  become  clear  th a t   “performance  has  outstripped 
reliability  in  a  number  of  areas”  and  t h a t   this  “imbalance” 
needed  correction  since  “overaU  systems  effectiveness  implies 
considerably  more  than   performance.”  H e   pointed  ou t   t h a t  
AFSC  had  attacked  this problem  by  setting up  reliability offices in 
AFSC  headquarters,  in each of  the  four development divisions, and  
in  the   three  contract  management  regions.  Representatives 
from  each of  the   offices  serve  on  the  Reliability  Task  Force  to  
achieve AFsc-wide focus and  action.  The  publication of  Military 
Specification  ( ~ 1 ~ - ~ - 2 7 5 4 2 )  on  “Reliability  Requirements  for 
Aerospace  Systems,  Sub-systems,  and  Equipments”  replaced 
previous documents and  as  a s tandard   section in  all new  systems

Ju ly   11:  NASA   press  conference  explained  basic  decision  on  Apollo 
manned  lunar  exploration  program:  to  base  th e  next  phase of  i t s  
planning,  research  and  development,  procurement,  and   space 
flight  program  on  th e   Sa tu rn   (C-5)  to   accomplish  th e   initial 
manned  lunar landing  and  recovery,  using  th e  lunar orb i t  rendez- 
vous  a s  th e  prime  mission mode.  Based  on more  than   a  year  of 
intensive  s tudy ,  t h e  basic  decision on  th e  lunar  orb i t  rendezvous 
(LOR )   mode  enables  immediate  industrial  consideration  of  th e  
lunar  excursion  vehicle  and  firm  planning  on  early  employment 
of  two-stage  Sa tu rn   (C-IB)  to   test-flight  th e  Apollo  configura- 
tion  in  ea r th  orbits. 
It was also announced:  (1) an  in-depth  s tudy  of  an  unmanned 
lunar  logistic  vehicle  would  be  undertaken;  (2)  continued  feasi- 
bility  studies  would  be  made  of  th e   earth-orbit  rendezvous 
mode  using  Sa tu rn   (C-5)  with  a  two-man  spacecraft,  with  t h e  
possibilities  of  a  direct  flight  with  th is   spacecraft;  (3)  continued 
s tu dy  would  be  made  of  th e   Nova   vehicle  (two  to   three  times 
capability  of  C-5). 
NASA  Administrator  Webb  said:  “We  are   pu t t ing   major 
emphasis  on  lunar  orb i t   rendezvous  because  a  year  of  intensive

s tudy   indicates  t h a t   it  is  most  desirable,  from  th e   s tandpo in t  
of  time,  cost  and   mission  accomplishment. 
I n   reaching  th i s  
decision,  however,  we  have  acted  to   re ta in   the   degree  of  flexi- 
bility vital to  a research and development program of  th is  magni- 
tude   . . .” 
LOR   was  unanimously recommended  b y  NASA’s Manned  Space 
Flight  Management  Council  because  it : (1)  provides  highest 
probability  of  mission  success  with  essentially  equal  mission 
safe ty ;   (2)  provides  mission  success  mon ths   earlier  th an   o ther  
modes;  (3)  will  cost  10 t o   15 per  cent  less  than   o ther  mode;  and  
(4)  requires  least  amount  of 
technical  development  beyond 
existing commitments.

Leading editorial of  New  Yo r k   Times said,  “The   tendency  of  man’s 
technological  progress  to   outdistance  his  institutions  for  coping 
with t h a t  progress is strikingly indicated b y  current developments 
in  space.  . . .”  Pointing  to   the   “brilliant  initial  successes” 
of  TELSTAR,  it  s ta ted :   “The   clear  lesson  of  these  technological 
accomplishments  is t h a t  space is now a full-fledged  area of  human 
ac t iv i ty   for  a wide  var ie ty   of  purposes,  and   will  increasingly  be  
employed  for  men’s  ends  in  the   years  immediately  ahead.  Ye t  
the  cosmos  today  is a lawless dimension  and  there is no universal 
agreement  even  on  so   elementary  a  question  as  where  Space

Walter  C. Williams,  associate  director  of  NASA  Manned  Spacecraft 
Center,  defended  orbital  flights  b y   as tronau ts   t h a t   apparently 
are   duplicates  of  previous  flights,  saying  t h a t   the   only  way  the  
U.S.  can have  a  space program  in  dep th  is  to  repea t   some  of  the  
operations.  H e   s ta ted   t h a t   new  d a t a   were  gathered  from  each

mission  (MA-7). 
S ta temen t   issued  by   the   European  Broadcasting  Union  declared 
t h a t   France   had   “contravened”  an  international  agreement  by 
transmitting  the   first  television  broadcast  from  Europe   to   the  
United  S ta te s  via  TELSTAR.  Under  an   agreement  including  the  
French,  “no  television material  of  entertainment  o r   informative 
character’’  was  to   be  broadcast  to   the   U.S.  before  the   joint

Isadore  Harris  (TN-D-1443)  and  D r .   Wolfgang  Priester  (TN- 
D-1444)  of  Goddard  Space  F l igh t   Center  proposed  th a t   cor- 
puscular  radiation  (i.e.,  solar  wind)  in   association  with  hydro- 
magnetic waves may  be the  energy  source required  to  explain the  
results  obtained  from  orbiting  satellites.  Harris’  note  provided 
for  the   first  time  a  diurnal  picture  of  the   thermosphere  (120  to  
2,050  kilometers  above  the   earth’s  surface).  Priester’s  note

I n  reviewing  technical  considerations leading  to   NASA’s selection of 
the   lunar  orbital  rendezvous  mode  (LOR)   for  Pro’ect  Apollo, 
D.  Brainerd  Holmes,  Director  of  Manned  Space  b l igh t ,   told 
ARS   lunar  conference in  Cleveland: 
“The mission  I have described has  been  widely reported  in  th e  
newspapers  and  technical  journals,  with  a  liberal  use  of  super- 
latives in  assessing its magnitude  and  complexity.  I n  this  case, 
resort  t o   superlatives  is  well-advised-this 
is  tru ly   a  staggering 
undertaking.  Entirely  new  concepts  of  component  and  system 
reliability must  be  developed  and  proven.  Extensive  tes ts  must 
be  carefully  planned  and  conducted,  and  results  must  be  ex- 
haustively  studied.  Crew  capabilities  must  be  developed  and 
meshed  with  proven  automatic  systems  so  t h a t   the   two  work 
together  with  Swiss-watch precision. 
“It   is  a  challenging  task,  studded  throughout  with  difficult 
decisions which  mus t   be soundly based  and  properly made.  . . . 
“W i th   the  decision as  to   the  method  by  which we w i l l  go  to the  
moon we  th ink  we  have  taken  a g ian t  step forward.  Essentially, 
we  have  now  ‘lifted off’ and  are on ou r  way.  . . .” 
I n   Cleveland,  Dr.  Joseph  E’.  Shea,  NASA’s Depu ty   Director  of 
Manned  Space  Flight  for  Systems,  told  ARS   conclave  t h a t   the  
manned  lunar   landing was  greatly  dependent  upon  information 
acquired  by   the   unmanned  Ranger  and  Surveyor  payloads. 
The   landing  zone  for  Apollo  flights  (strip  20’  wide  along  lunar  
mile  to an inch are required, which mus t   be  i ased on photographs

July  17: I n  address  to   ARS   lunar  meeting in  Cleveland,  D r .  James  A. 
Van  Allen  said t h a t  protons  of  the  inner radiation belt  could be  a 
serious hazard  for extended  manned space flight, and  t h a t  nuclear 
detonations  might  be  capable  of  cleaning  ou t   these  inner  be l t  
protons,  perhaps  for  a  prolonged  period,  for  making  manned 
orbits  abou t   aOO-mi.-high above  the   ear th .   Van  Allen  said  t h a t  
the   recent  sho t   over  Johnston  Island  was  far   too  small  and   too  
low  t o  have  such an  effect. 
Subcommittee of  the  House Committee on Science and Astronautics, 
headed  by   Rep.  Victor  AnCuso,  opened  hearings  on  the   role  of 
women  in  the   space  program.  Jane   B.  H a r t   and   Jerrie  Cobb, 
representing  the   13 women who  completed  unofficial  space  quali- 
fication  tests  a t   the   Lovelace  Foundation,  testified  th a t   women 
had  a real  contribution t o  make  and  were  qualified as astronauts. 
Jacqueline Cochran, well-known flier, said t h a t  (‘there is no doub t  
in  the  world  t h a t  women  will go  in to  space.” 
British  astrophysicist,  Zdenek  Kopal,  suggested  in  ARS  lunar   con-

Chairman  of  the   Committee  on  Science  and  Astronautics,  said 
t h a t   (‘the national  space  program  continues  to   fire  the   imagina- 
tion  of  the   American  people.  Th e   spectacular  space  achieve- 
men ts   are  b u t   the   top   of  the   iceberg.  Underneath  is  a  rapidly 
growing  base  of  solid scientific knowledge  which  will  benefit  the  
Nation in thousands of  different ways.  T h e  agency  spearheading 
the   massive  scientific  effort  is  the   National  Aeronautics  and 
Space Administration  . . .” 
I n   speech  to   the   National  Rocket  Club,  Senator  Ba r ry   Goldwater 
said:  “I am  convinced  t h a t   the   American  people  fully  endorse 
space preeminence  for  the  United S ta tes .   Th is  is our long-range 
goal  as  a  nation.  . . . Space  superiority  in  all  i t s   scientific, 
technological,  and  military  aspects  is  fundamental  to  the   fu ture  
the   United  S ta te s   . . . 
well-being,  security,  and   prosperity  of 
“As a new agency, NASA   ha s  picked up  a momentum, a direction 
and  a  purposefulness  directed  toward  long-range  research  and 
development which  is one of  impressive merit  . . . 
“From all I can observe, the  relationship between  NASA  and  the  
Air Force in  the  space program has  proceeded  fairly well  to  da te .  
B u t   I  would  point  ou t   t h a t   the   Depar tmen t   of  Defense  is  re- 
sponsible  for  military  affairs, no t   NASA.  NASA  is  no t   a  military 
service, and  i t s  broad-based  program will undoubtedly contribute 
greatly  to   our  own  national  military  requirements.  . . . T h e  
point I am  trying  to  make is t h a t   the  requirements of  the  United 
S ta te s  for military  programs  in  space should no t   be  neglected  in 
any  vital  aspect  . . .” 
France  announced plans  to  establish rocket launching facility along

Astronauts John   Glenn  and  Sco t t   Carpenter,  and  George  M.  Low, 
NASA  Director  of  Spacecraft  and  Flight Missions,  testified  before 
House Subcommittee on qualifications for astronauts.  Low testi- 
fied  t h a t   qualifications  would  be  raised  ra the r   than   lowered  for  
Project  Apollo,  t h a t   the   sex  of  pilots  had   never  been  a  require-

space  effort  “we  would  have  t o   slow  down  on  ou r   national  goal 
of  landing a man  on the  moon  in this decade.”  Astronaut  Glenn 
said on women  astronauts:  “I couldn’t  care less who’s  over  there  
[in the   next  seat]  as  long  a s   it’s  the   most  qualified  person.  . .  . 
I wouldn’t  oppose  a  women’s  as tronau t   training program;  I ju s t  
see no requirement for it.” 
NASA  had   no t   found  one  woman t o  da te  who me t  all as tronau t

0  DOD   canceled  construction  of  Navy's  600-ft.-diameter  radiotele- 
scope a t  Sugar Grove, West Virginia, because  major  and  unfore- 
seen  scientific  advances  provided  be t ter   methods  to   acquire 
information.  In i t ia ted   in  1954  and  costing  $17  million  to  da te ,  
the   Sugar  Grove  dish  had   as  i t s   primary  purpose  military  re- 
search in  ionospheric physics,  space communications,  navigation, 
and  radio  astronomy.  Since  then,  parametric  amplifiers  and 
masers  revolutionized  space  communications,  while  more  in-

would  receive  the   highest  Government  award,  the   1962  Presi- 
dent’s  Award  for  Distinguished  Federal  Civilian  Service.  Di- 
rector of  NASA  Manned Spacecraft Center and of  Project Mercury 
since i t s  inception, Gilruth,  the  announcement said,  “successfully 
carried ou t  one of  the  most  complex tasks  ever  resented  to  man 
in  this  country-the

Egyptian  armed  forces  test-fired  fou r   single-stage  rockets,  which 
witness  President  Nasser  said  could  h i t   any   targe t   in  Israel. 
Two of  the  rockets, named  (‘El Zahir”  (Victorious), had a reputed 
range  of  222  miles;  the   other  two,  named  “El  E a h e r ”   (Con- 
queror), were claimed to  have a range of  360 miles.  Rockets were 
launched  from  a  secret  base  48  miles  nor th   of  Cairo,  and  were 
built  entirely  by   Egyptian  technicians,  according  to   President 
Nasser.  After  the  firings, Cairo Radio  announced:  “The  U.A.R.

stretching it  a b i t ,   although  the   technology  certainly will  permit 
us  to   have  a  working  communications  satellite  system  within 
three o r  four years.  This is the  reason why we  are  are  pushing  to  
have legislation passed-it  has  passed the  House and  is now pend- 
ing  in  the   Senate-to 
determine  national  policy  as  to   how  th e  
communications  system  will  work.  As  always  in  this  coun try  
technology is  ahead of  public policy.  This time we wan t   t o  keep 
our national legislative polic  abreast of  science.” 
United Auto Workers  (UAW)   o rN o r t h  American  and Ryan  Aviation

J?L~IJ  23 :   TELSTAR   relayed  two  20-minute  live  TV   shows,  the   first 
formal exchange  of  programs  across the  Atlantic.  The  first  U S .  
program  to   the   Eurovision  network  of  s ta t ions   in  18  nations 
included  sequences  on  the   S ta tue   of  Liberty,  a  major  league 
baseball game in Chicago, President  Kennedy’s  news  conference, 
Astronaut  Walter  M .   Schirra  from  Cape  Canaveral,  and  the  
Mormon  Tabernacle  Choir  from  M t .   Rushmore.  Three   hours 
la ter   on  another  orbit,  the   Eurovision  program  was  beamed  to  
the  U.S.  where  it was  carried  by   all  three networks.  It included 
scenes of  Big Ben in London, the  Colosseum in Rome, the  Champs

t h a t   pa r t   of  today’s  press  conference  is  being  relayed  by  the  
Telstar  communications  satellite  to   viewers  across  the   Atlantic, 
and  this is another indication of  the  extraordinary world  in which 
we  live.  Th is   satellite mus t   be  high  enough  to   carry   messages 
from  both  sides of  the   world, which  is  of  course  a  very  essential 
requirement fo r  peace,  and  I th ink   this  understanding which  will 
inevitably  come  from  the   speedier  communications  is  bound  t o  
increase  the   well-being  and  security of  all people here  and   those

NASA   General Counsel John  A.  Johnson, speaking before the  Ameri- 
can B a r  Association’s Section  on  In terna t iona l   and  Comparative 
Law  in San Francisco, s ta ted :   “It appears t h a t   the   existing s t a t e  
of  the   law  is  t h a t   we  have  an   area  of  space  extending  upward 
from  th e  surface  of  th e   ear th   for  a n  indefinite  distance  which  is 
exclusively  controlled  by   the   underlying  S ta te ,   and   above  t h a t ,  
beginning  a t   some  undefined  point,  lies  th e   ‘free’ realm  of  outer 
space.  Whether there is or should be a n  intermediate third realm

extend,  bu t   in which  the   full freedom  of  outer  space m ay  no t   be 
enjoyed, is a n  interesting item  for  speculation.  . . .”

“It would be  most unwise to  a t t emp t  to  reach  a solution  t o  the  
so-called  ‘boundary’  problem  on  the   basis  of 
th e   difference 
between  th e  regimes of  aerial  flight  and   space  flight.  B u t   even 
if  it were possible t o  define a boundary between  those  regimes on 
scientific  and   technical  grounds,  it  would  bear   no   necessary 
relationship  t o   th e   national  interests  which  th e   principle  of 
territorial  sovereignty is  designed  to   serve. 
“I th ink  i t  is  evident  t h a t  if  this problem  is  to  be solved i t  will

August 4:  James  A. Ma r t in ,  NASA  X-15  Program Manager, in le t ter  to  
the Washington Evening  Star  clarXed th e  method  of  computing 
mach  number  in  high-speed  flight.  “Mach  number  is  a  direct 
function  of  atmospheric  tempera ture  a t  th e  a l t i tude  a t  which  th e  
vehicle  is  0ying.  This  tempera ture   varies  from  day   to   d ay   for 
th e   same  altitude.  Because  of  this,  it  is possible  t h a t   th e  same 
number  of  feet  per  second  a t   th e   same  altitude  can  be   more  or 
less  than   a given Mach  number.”

August  is: Soviet  scientist  R am   Bayevsky,  writing  in  Pravda,  said 
t h a t  miniaturized  equipment  was  recording  brain  and   eye  reac- 
tions  of  Cosmonauts  Andrian  Nikolayev  and  Pave1  Popovich. 
O ther   instruments  reported  were  two  recorders  to register  infor-

to  record  hear t   reactions  and  to  follow eyeball muscles. 
John   Hodges,  director  of  Canada’s  Regina  Observatory,  said  in  
an   interview  t h a t   VOSTOK  111  and  IV  were  orbiting  in  space  a t   a 
time  when  millions  of  meteorit,es were  bombarding  the   earth’s 
atmosphere  in  an  unusually  heavy  concentration,  and   t h a t  scien- 
tists  and  astronomers  were  keenly  interested  in  the   outcome  of 
meteorites  colliding with  the  Soviet spacecraft. 
Despite  Soviet  announcement  t h a t  U.S.S.R.  had  developed  i~ “new  
calculation  technique”  for  launching  space vehicles  as “a m a t t e r

U.S.S.R.  had  no t   surpassed  the   U.S.  in  application  of  electronic 
comput,ers t o  space  technology. 
NASA  Manned  Spacecraft  Center  officials  commented  t h a t   flights 
of  Soviet  spacecraft  VOSTOK  111  and  IV  would  no t   affect  pro-

comparable to  wha t   we  achieve  in  o u r  Mercury  flights.  To  me 
the  significant element here  is t h a t  on  the  second flight they  were

Russians  a s  well  as ourselves. 
“Ever   since  the   Space Agency  h a s  been  formed  we  have  been 
waiting  fo r   this  o ther   shoe  to   be  dropped.  People  have  told  us 
every  month,  the   Russians  are going  to  produce  this  big  booster 
in  th e  next  few months.  Now four years  have  gone b y  and  they 
have  no t  y e t  shown us this big booster.  To the  best of  our  knowl- 
edge  they   have  developed  lighter-weight  nuclear  weapons  and 
ballistic  missiles r a th e r   th an   bigger  space  boosters.  This  is  no t  
to   say   t h a t   they  may   no t   be  doing  this.  All  I am  saying  is  t h a t  
they  will require  a bigger  booster  to  land men  on  the  moon.” 
August  16: Former President Dwight D .  Eisenhower,  in London press 
conference,  said  he  did  no t   believe  th e  U.S.S.R.  was  leading  th e  
U.S.  in space exploration. 
“We  have  been  pu t t ing   all  kinds  of  satellites  in  the   air  for 
meteorological  readings  and   other  scientific  information,  . . .” 
b u t   the   U.S.  has   no t   been  indulging  in   “ th e   same  kind  of  spec- 
tacular”  a s  the  U.S.S.R. 
“I  think  we  should  develop  achievement  upon  achievement 
until  it  should  be  almost  a  m a t t e r  of  course for us  to   go  to   the  
moon, ra ther   th an  indulge in  the  spectacular.” 
D r .   Wernher  von  Braun,  Director  of  NASA  Marshall  Space  F l igh t  
Center,  said in  Blacksburg, Va.,  t h a t  dual  space flight  of  VOSTOK  
111  and  IV  “was  impressive  from  the   standpoint  of  the   whole 
operation,  . . . [but] it does no t   look like  the  Russians used  any  
new  equipment.  I  don’t  think  there  was  a  technical  break- 
through.  . . .” 
When  asked  t o   comment  on  U S .   prospects  of  being  first  to  
reach  the   moon,  D r .   von  Braun   said  t h a t   manned  lunar   flights 
would  require rockets  bigger  th an   any  used  either b y   the  U S .  or 
U.S.S.R.  so  far.  “We  have  such  rockets  under  development, 
and   the   Russians  also  have  to   develop  a  new  rocket  to   do  this 
job   . . . . Therefore  I  don’t  th ink   we  have  any   serious  handi- 
caps  to  overcome so f a r  as  the  lunar  program  is involved.” 
Sir Bernard  Lovell,  director  of  Jodrell  Bank   Experimental  S ta t ion ,  
England,  said  t h a t   flights  of  VOSTOK  111  and   IV   indicated  “ th e  
Russians have  a  clear space superiority  in  the  military, if  no t   th e  
scientific, sense.”  H e  urged  t h a t  the  U S .  and  U.S.S.R.  join  each 
other  in  a  cooperative  a t t emp t   to   explore  the   solar  system  with 
manned  space ships. 
Congratulating  the   U.S.S.R.  fo r   success  of  i t s   VOSTOK  111  and  IV

NASA  announced  t h a t   a  second  a t t emp t   to   send  a  Mariner  probe

Mariner  probe,  which  had   to   be  destroyed  shortly  after  launch  
on J u l y  22,  1962, because of  a deviation from planned  flight p a t h .  
Soviet  press  agency  Tass   said  t h a t   the  cosmonauts  traveling  in

“Well, we  are  second  to  th e  Soviet Union  in  long-range boosters.

and  development;  b u t   we  jus t   might  as  well  realize  t h a t   when 
we  started-we 
s t a r t ed  late. 
“Last year,  as you h o w ,  we made a decision to  go to  the  moon, 
with bipartisan  support,  and it’s going to  take  us  quite a while  to  
catch  u p   with  a  very  advanced  program  which  the   Soviets  are

we  are making  a  tremendous  effort.

creased  the   budget  Tor  space  b y   50  per  cent  over  t h a t   of  my

“Th a t   is  far  from  being  the   case.  The   enterprise  requires

September  4:   British  physicist  Dr .   E r i c   Mendoza  of  University  of 
Manchester  explained  superconductivity  principle  a t   British 
Association for  the  Advancement of  Science meeting.  H e  s t a t ed  
th e  problem  as why several superconducting metals  (such as lead 
and   aluminum)  a t   extremely  low  tempera tures  suddenly  lose  all 
traces  of  electrical  resistance  and   are  able  t o   conduct  currents 
w i thou t  producing hea t .   Normal electrical resistance is produced 
when  electrons  are  knocked ou t   of  their  pa th s   by  collision  with 
heavy  metallic atoms. 
I n  superconductors, he said, th e  electrons 
get  pas t   t h e   a toms   without  being  deflected,  because  “electrons, 
instead  of  moving as individuals,  move  in  pairs.”  Vibrations  of 
th e   metallic  atoms  in  superconductors  are  so  slowed  down  by 
extremely low  tempera ture   (minus 273’  C)  t h a t   they   are unab le  
t o   break   the  pairs,  so  current  flows  w i thou t   friction.

September 6:  Congressman  George P. Miller,  chairman  of  th e   House 
Committee on Science and Astronautics,  defended  th e  U.S. space 
program  in  speech  or]  floor  of  the   House.  Arguing  t h a t   Soviet 
VOSTOK  111  and  IV  manned  orbital  flights did  no t   justify  changes 
in  th e  U.S. program,  he  said: 
‘(Certainly I will no t  s t and  here  and  say  t h a t  more  and  b e t t e r  
military  space  programs  should  no t   be  undertaken.  Wh a t   I do 
say  is t h a t  a  considerable  effort in  this  field has  long been  under- 
way  and  t h a t   the   Monday-morning  quarterbacks  whose  tee th  
s t a r t   chattering  after  every  Russian  ‘spectacular’ might  exhibit 
a  b i t   more  fa i th   in  those  who  have  the   ac tua l   responsibility  for 
th e  defense of  the   country.  . .  . 
“[We should  no t   overlook]  . .  . th e  fact  t h a t   the  Soviets have 
now  demonstrated  two  impor tan t   capabilities : F irs t ,   t h a t   th ey  
have  sufficient  launch  facilities  and  rocket  reliability  to   launch 
two  manned  spacecraft  within  a  shor t   time,  and  second,  t h a t  
they   have  th e   ability  t o   t ime   launches  with  grea t   precision. 
These capabilities  are  an  impor tan t  s tep  toward  the  development 
of  th e  rendezvous  and  docking  technique  which  will  be  of  grea t  
value  in  achieving  many   advanced  objectives  in  space  explora- 
tion,  some of  which may   have  potential military  value. 
“These,  I think,  are  the  formidable  implications  of  their recent 
feat.  B u t   these  implications  are  no  reason  f o r   us  t o   p u t   our 
program  in  a  constant  s t a t e   of  flux,  with  projects  s tar t ing ,  
stopping,  and  shifting  in  response  to   each  new  Soviet  develop- 
ment.  Our  undertaking  is  gigantic,  immensely  complex.  It 
cannot  be  assembled  and  disassembled  and  redesigned  and  re- 
assembled  without  losing  its  direction  and  momentum,  and  th e  
space contest  itself.  .  . . 
“There is a suggestion t h a t  the  military services should duplicate 
work  now  in  progress  under  the   civilian  agency.  There  is 
nothing particularly military abou t  solutions t o  problems involved 
in the  effects of  long-term weightlessness, radiation,  and isolation. 
T h e   capabilities  of  bo th   civilian  and  military  research  agencies 
should  be  brought  t o   bear  on  these  problems  in  a  coordinated 
manner.

has  ever undertaken,  the   Nation  has made  four  crucial  manage-

September  13:  Back  in  Washington  after  two-day  tour  of  U.S.  space 
facilities,  President  Kennedy  held  news  conference.  Asked  why 
decision was made   to   extend  U.S.  atmospheric  nuclear  tests,  the  
President said : 
One is  th a t ,  a s  you  know, because  of 
“There are   two reasons. 
the   blow-up  in  the   pad  a t  Johnston  Island  and  because  of  th e  
earlier  failures  of  th e   communication  system  in  the   missile,  we 
were no t  able to  carry o u t  these tes ts  which were  . . . among th e  
most  impor tan t ,   if  no t   the  most  impor tan t   of  o u r  series. 
“So we  are going. to  finish those. 
I n  addition, a s  a result of  the  
earlier  tes ts   of  this  Dominic  series,  there  were  certain  things 
learned  which  we  would  like  to   prove  ou t .  
“So we  have  agreed  to  a  limited  number  of  tes ts  in  concluding 
the  Dominic  series, and  also we  have taken  some s teps  to  prevent 
a repetition of  the  incident which caused a n  increase in th e  number 
of  electrons in  th e   atmosphere,  b y   lowering  the   a l t i tude   and   the  
yield  so  t h a t  lunar   flights will  no t   be  fur ther   endangered.” 
Asked  whether  U.S.  position  of  refraining  from  competition 
with  U.S.S.R.  military  space  vehicles  would  condemn  U.S.  t o  
“No, hr. Alexander.  As I said las t  week, in the  first place we 
second 
lace  in  the   military  field,  President  Kennedy  replied: 
are   spending  $1.5  billion  a  year   on   our   military  space  program. 
W h a t   is  th e   key  for  the   success bo th   of  peaceful  exploration  of 
space a s  well  as  th e  military  mastery  of  space  are  large boosters, 
effective  control  of  the   capsule,  and  the  ability  to   rendezvous, 
and   all  of  th e   rest,  so  t h a t   there  is  an   obvious  usefulness  if   the  
situation  should  require,  military  usefulness  for  our   efforts, 
peaceful  efforts,  in   space. 
“ I n   addition,  as you  know,  very   recently  we  determined  t o  go 
ahead with the  T i t an  111, which gives th e  United S t a t e s  Air Force 
a  very  strong weapon  if  t h a t  should become  necessary.  So  t h a t  
the   work  t h a t   NASA   is  doing  on  Sa turn   and  the   work  the   Air 
Force  is doing  on  T i t an   and  the   work  being  done  on  th e   Apollo 
program  and  Gemini  and  th e  others,  all have  a  national  security 
factor  a s  well  a s  a  peaceful factor.  . . . 
“I think  the  United S t a t e s  is a t temp t ing ,   and   th is  Administra- 
tion,  as you  know,  is making  a very  massive  effort  in  space.  As 
I  said, we  are  spending  three  times  wha t   we  spen t   l a s t   year   in 
space,  and  more  in  this  year’s  budget  th an   th e   eight  previous 
years,  so  t h a t   this  is  a  tremendous  effort,  $5 .5   billion  a s  well  a s  
th e  money t h a t  we are  spending for the  military  use of  space. 
“As  I say,  the  size of  th e  booster  and  the   capsule  and  the   con- 
trol  all  would  have,  if  the   situation  required  it,  a  military  use. 
We hope it does n o t ;  we hope  t h a t  space will be used  for peaceful 
purposes.  T h a t   is  the   policy  of  th e  United  S t a t e s  Government, 
b u t  we  shall be prepared  if it does n o t ;  and  in  addition,  a s  I said 
from  the  beginning,  bo th   the  Soviet Union  and   the  United S t a t e s  
have   a  capacity  to   send  a  missile  to   each  other’s  coun try  with  a 
nuclear  warhead  on  it, so  t h a t  we  mus t   keep  some perspective  a s  
to  where  the  danger may  lie.  B u t  the  United S ta tes ,  in  the  effort

it is making  bo th   in  the   peaceful  program  and   th e  military  pro- 
gram,  all  of  this  will  increase  our   security  if  the   Soviet  Union 
should  a t t emp t   to  use  space fo r  military  purposes.” 
Asked  if  he  were  hopeful  t h a t   US -U .S .S .R .   cooperative  ven- 
tures in space exploration were likely in th e  near fu ture ,  he replied: 
“NO.  A s   you  know,  D r .   Dryden  had   some  conversations  in 
Geneva with  regard  to   the  ma t ter ,   and  some progress was  made, 
b u t   it  is  limited  in  its  scope  and  we  would  hope  more  could  be 
done and more, perhaps,  could be done if  the  atmosphere between 
th e   two  countries should b e  improved.”

Review  in  Red   S t a r   b y   General  Pave1 Kurochkin,  commenting  on 
new  Soviet  textbook  on  strategy,  s ta ted :   “The   Soviet people  are  
engaged  in  the   peaceful  conquest  of  space.  B u t   it  is  perfectly 
clear t h a t  if  the  imperialists continue to  conduct research for means 
of  using  cosmic  space  for  military  goals,  then  the   interests  of 
guaranteeing  the   security  of  the   Soviet  s t a t e   demand  definite 
measures  from  our  side.’’  Doctrinal  textbook  was  written  b y  
several  of  Russia’s  top  military  leaders  under  the   direction  of 
Marsha l   V.  D .   Sokolovsky,  and  was  said  to   b e   th e   first  serious

Israel Finance Minister, Levi Eshkol, speaking in  Washington, D.C.,

covered with semiconductors and photo-elements  of  high efficiency 
solar  energy falling on  the  moon  could be  converted  to  electrical 
power far  exceeding t h a t  produced on ear th .   H e  also proposed the

owerful light  sources  in  Australia  and  South Africa,  during  his 
LA -8   orbital  flight.  NASA   said  experiment  was  to   determine 
how well  a space traveler  could see light sources of  known  density 
on  earth.  Three   high-intensity  flares would  burn   a t  Woomera, 
Australia,  and   electric  lamps  a t   Durban ,   So.  Africa.  Schirra 
would  t r y   to   determine  effects of  atmosphere  on  light  observed 
from orbital altitude and  t o  establish which light source was more 
readily  visible.  Other  scientific experiments  of  the   MA-8  flight 
would  be  studies  of  cosmic radiation,  search  for  rare   particles  in 
space, and   effects of  re-entry  heating on  new materials. 
Reported  th a t ,  if  Astronaut  Schirra’s six-orbit  flight  (MA-8)  is fully 
successful,  NASA   would  conclude  Project  Mercury  with  one  18- 
orbit, 24-hour flight.  Present plans called f o r  four %-hour  flights

and  Dr.  Carl  Sagan,  former  University  of  California  professor, 
wrote  in  September  Proceedings  of 
the  National  Academy  of 
Sc ience s   t h a t   large  amounts  of  moisture  may   be  frozen  into  th e  
subsoil of  the   planet Mars.  From  openings  in  the  planet’s  crust, 
s team   and  gas may   escape  and   create  ho t   spo ts   t h a t   would  b e  
“favorable  microenvironments  f o r   life.”  They   said  t h a t   re- 
current  clouds  detected  b y   telescope  “may  be  symptomatic  of 
this  local outgassing of  water  vapor.” 
D r .   John   W.  Pindlay,  depu ty   director  of  the   National  Radio 
Astronomy Observatory  a t  Green  Bank ,  W.  Va.,  said  Echo-type 
reflective  orbiting  balloon  and   West  Ford-type  copper-needle 
belts  were  potential  threa ts   to   science  of  radio  astronomy. 
Writing in Science magazine, Dr. F ind lsy  said  these objects would 
contribute  t o   llnoise”  in  radiotelcscope  reception  and   (‘would 
cu t  down sharply on a11 antenna’s  ability to  receive fa in t  signals.” 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers  announced  t h a t   Launch  Complex  12  a t  
Cape  Canaveral  would  be  modified  to   service  larger  and   more

Secret  of  radio  emissions  from  planet  Jup i ter   was  proposed  b y  
physicists  D r .   Leon  Landovitz  of  Yeshiva  Univ.  and   D r .  Leona 
Marshall,  New  York  Univ.  They   suggest  t h a t   perhaps  Jup i ter  
acts as a gigantic maser, using  energy from  the  sun as i ts   ‘(pump- 
ing”  energy,  to  produce  the  decameter  waves.  T h e y   proposed 
t h a t   Jupiter’s  decameter  radiation  was  based  on  principle  t h a t  
th e   change of  s t a t e  of  an   electron with  respect  to  s t a t i c  magnetic 
field  results  in  either  emission  or  absorption  of  electromagnetic 
energy,  such  as  light  or  radio  waves,  a t   frequency  t h a t   depends 
upon  the   magnetic  field.  There   may   be  a  “cascading”  of  such 
stimulated  emissions  from  th e   electrons  as  th e   disturbance 
propagates  through  the   electrically  charged  layer  of  Jupiter’s 
atmosphere,  D r .   Marshall  s t a t ed .   Jup i ter’s   emission  of  radio

Oc tober   1:  Fo u r th   official  anniversary  of  NASA ,   charged  by   th e   Na- 
tional Aeronautics and Space Act of  1958 to  organize and conduct 
U.S.  space  exploration  for  peaceful  purposes.  No  new  agency 
of  the  Executive  Branch  of  the   Federal  Government  was  created 
b y   the   transfer  of  so many  units  and   programs  of  other  depart-

Project  Mercury  flight  officials  studied  tropical  storm  “Daisy,” 
which  continued  moving  westnorthwest  abou t   300  mi.  east  of 
Puerto  Rico,  the  general landing  area fo r  th ird  orbit of  Astronaut 
Walter  M .   Schirra’s  six-orbit  MA-8 
flight  planned  Oct.  3 .  
Mercury  Operations  Director  Walter  C.  Williams,  indicating 
continuing  surveillance  of  “Daisy,”  ordered  preparations  for  the  
launch  a t t emp t   to   continue. 
NASA   Administrator  James  E .  Webb,  addressing  the   Greater  H a r t -  
ford  (Conn.)  Chamber  of  Commerce,  said  t h a t   the   “habit  of 
oversimplifying  has  carried  over  into  the   evaluation  and  under- 
standing  of  our  objectives  in  space.  . . .  Many   of  our  citizens 
believe  our major,  and  in  some cases, our  only  purpose  in  space, 
to  be  one of  winning,  in  a  contest  with  the   Soviet  Union,  ‘a race 
to   the  moon.’  . . .  [This concept]  overlooks  the   significant  and 
seldom  appreciated  fac t   t h a t   learning  how  to   get  to  the   moon, 
developing  the   technology  which  will  be  required  to   get  there, 
and  employing  this  technology  for  many  purposes  in  space,  is 
more  impor tan t   th an   the   lunar  landing  itself.  . .  . 
“Characterization  of  our  effort  solely  as  a  ‘space race  to   the  
moon’  also  leads  to   the   mistaken  notion  t h a t   the   nation  first  to  
conduct  a  lunar   exploration  will  have  assured  itself  of  u l t ima te  
and  enduring  superiority  in  space.  Th e   fact  is  overlooked  t h a t  
landing men  on  the  moon,  although  a great  and  challenging goal, 
is  only  one  of  many   goals  in  space.  . . . 
“With  the   resources  which  are  being  applied,  and  knowledge 
of  how  those  resources  are  being utilized  t o  mobilize our  nation’s 
scientific,  technical  and   industrial  s treng th ,   I am  confident  t h a t  
we  will  achieve  a  space posture  satisfactory  to   the   United  S ta tes  
given  a  continuation  of  ou r  present  efforts  and  suppor t  for  those 
planned  for  fu ture  years.  On  the  basis  of  what  we  know  now  of 
the   scope  of  the   Soviet  Union’s  efforts,  and  of  what  is  required 
to  do  the   job,  this  country has  a be t ter   th an  even  chance  to   con- 
duc t   the   first  manned  exploration  of  the   moon.  For  these  rea- 
sons, I have said  I believe we will be  there first. 
“ B u t   in   saying  this  I  do  not  want  to   fall  in to   the   same  t r a p  
which has  snared  too many  of  us-that  of  again inviting a charac- 
terization  of  this  broad  and  vital  national  effort  as  a  spectacular 
(race  to  the  moon.”’ 
H e  pointed  ou t  t h a t  President Kennedy did no t  se t  the  national 
goal of  “landing  the  first man  on  the  moon.”  Ra ther ,   the  Presi-

apogee, perigee, inclination, and period.  U.S.  repor ts  also iden t i-  
fied  satellites  in  one  of  four  categories:  development  of  space- 
flight  technology;  space  research  and   exploration; practical  a p -  
plications  of  space  technology;  and  non-functional  objects. 
USAF  announced launching of  a n  unidentified satellite using a Thor-

John   Rubel,  DOD   Depu ty   Director  of  Research  and   Engineering,

iden t if iab6  military  needs  and  requirements”  and   the   o ther ,  Iess 
well  defined, designed  to  provide “building blocks”  as “insurance 
against  an  uncertain  future.”  Replying to   charges t h a t  military 
space activities should  be  expanded, he noted  t h a t  DOD’S  military 
space  program  exceeded  $1 . 5   billion  this  year  and  probably 
would  be  greater  next  year;  DOD   expenditures  on  space develop- 
men ts   were  “remarkab ly   high  in  relation  t o   viable  concepts  for 
military  applications  in  space.”  H e  concluded  t h a t   the  military 
space  program  was  adequa te   and  well  balanced,  although  “we  
probably  err   on  the   side  of  allowing  too  generous  a  margin  of

minimum  solar  activity  and   relatively  thick  during  periods  of 
maximum  solar  activity.  Dr.  Bauer   feels  th e   layer  will  no t   be

“Two  things  a re   appa ren t .  
One,  t h a t   th e   present  outlook  is

well  as   in   th e   atmosphere.  . . . T h e  need  for  pilots  will  no t   be  
confined  t o   th e   cockpit.  Engineers  with  pilot  tra in ing   have   a

understanding  of  the   cockpit  problem  in   operations,  in   main- 
tenance  and   repair,  in   management  and   in  planning.  Beyond

Programs, summarized results obtained  from MAR INER   11  scientific 
experiments, a t  E igh th  Tri-Service Conference on Electromagnetic 
Compatibility  in   Chicago:  “One  of  the   primary  scientific  objec- 
tives  in  measuring  magnetic  fields  in  interplanetary  space  is  t o  
determine  the   magnitude  and  direction  of  the   s teady   field  com- 
ponent.  . . . The   Mariner  has 
indicated  a 
typical  s teady  
s t a t e   transverse  component  of  ten  gamma  or  less,  and  it  has  
clearly  shown  how  the   transverse  field  becomes  large  (as high  as 
25  gamma)  during geomagnetic storms. 
I n  addition  to   this,  the  
Mariner  2 has  provided  information  on  the  s teady  interplanetary 
field  indicating  t h a t   the   radial  component  is  apparently  more 
stable,  even  under  s torm   conditions,  and   t h a t   there  are  quiet 
constant.  . . . Measurements  from  the   ion  chamber  [onboard 
times  when  the  radial  component  from  the   sun   is  essentially 
MARINER  111  have indicated  an average radiation level as expected, 
corresponding  to   abou t   1 .1   milli-roentgen  per  hour  (about  100 
times  the  cosmic r a y  intensity  a t  the   surface  of  the   ear th) .   . . . 
It has been reported b y  measurements  [of the  probe’s cosmic du s t

a t   least  one  thousand  times  less  in  interplanetary  space  th an   in  
the   near   vicinity  of  the   ear th .   The  cause  of  this  is  unknown. 
. . . Preliminary  d a t a   from  the   [solar  plasma  detector  in  the] 
Mariner  indicate  ab rup t  changes  in  the   velocity  and  intensity  of 
solar winds, and  correlated effects on  the  magnetic fields in space. 
Measurements  show  t h a t   the   particle  energies  generally  range 
from  abou t   750  electron  volts  to   2500  electron  volts,  although

0  USAF  announced completion  of  network of  71  “grav i ty   base  meas- 
uring  s ta t ion s”   throughou t   the  U S .   Exceedingly  accura te   and  
sensitive  grav i ty  meters  a t   each  location  would  establish  a   base

0  USAF  prepared  proposed  FY  1964  budget  requesting  $23.5  billion, 
including  funds  for  construction  of  eight  RS-70  reconnaissance 
bombers and  for  expanded development of  space weapons.  Also 
considered  in budget  preparation  was  long-range proposal  t o  use 
NASA’s Gemini  two-man  spacecraft  as  a  stepping  s tone   toward  
developing military manned space flight  capability. 
0  Space  General  Corp.  reported  development  of  aspect-insensitive 
an tenna   sys tem   for  satellites  and   spacecraft.  System,  which 
automatically  points  toward   its  transmission  source  on  ea r th ,  
could  reduce  number  of  communications satellites  in  worldwide

30 f t .  t o  300 ft. in diameter  pass within 20 million mi. of  t h e  ea r th  
each year,  and   t h a t  a good  number of  them  probably come much 
closer-perhaps  within several thousand miles.  H e  called for  (1) 
careful  search  for  closer  asteroids  with  special  electronic  tele- 
scopes;  (2)  landing  unmanned  spacecraft  on  asteroids;  and  (3) 
steering asteroids in to  ea r th  orb i t ,  t o  be  hollowed ou t  and  used  a s

observatory  for two-month  orbit  in  1965-66. 

NOVEMBER  1962 
November  1:  U.S.S.R.  announced  it had   launched  MARS   I,  a  1,970-lb. 
space probe  on  seven-month  flight  to   Mars.  Launched  with  an  
“improved  booster”  in to   parking  orbit  around  the   ear th ,   MARS   I 
was hurled  in to  escape trajectory when vehicle engines re-ignited. 
Tass reported  MARS   I  was  flying  as planned  on  i ts   course  toward 
Mars.  “All  systems  are  functioning normally  and orders s en t  to  
the   s ta t ion   [i.e.,  probe]  are   well  received  and  obeyed.”  Main 
tasks  of  the  probe were interplanetary  exploration,  establishment 
of 
interplanetary  space  radio  communications,  photographing 
the  Mar t ian   surface and  relaying  the  photographs  back  to   ear th  
b y   radio.  “Telemetric,  measuring,  and  scientific  instrumenta- 
tion will be  automatically activated  in  conformity with  the  flight 
program  b y   radio  commands  from  the   ear th ,”   Tass  said.  T h e  
flight  had  been  preceded  by   an   unsuccessful  launch  a t t emp t   the  
previous  week,  unidentified  D O D   sources  said. 
(NASA   Adminis- 
t r a to r   James   E.  Webb  s ta ted   in  September  t h a t   two  Soviet 
a t t em p t s  to   launch  Mars  probes  had  failed  in  October  1960.) 
NASA   reported  radiation  satellite  EXPLORER   xv ,   launched  Oct.  27, 
was  spinning  a t  r a t e  of  7 3  rpm   instead  of  desired  10 rpm  because 
of  failure  of  despin  weights  to   deploy.  Preliminary  d a t a   indi- 
cated all experiments  were functioning  and  t h a t   all received  d a t a  
were  of  good  quality.  Effect  of  high  spin  r a t e   on  experimental 
results was under  analysis. 
High-altitude  nuclear  tes t   in  U.S.  Operation  Dominic  was made  in 
Pacific  tes t   area,  the   sub-megaton  device  carried  b y  Thor   rocket 
to  estimated  a l t i tude  of  30  to  40 miles.  A EC  reported  two Soviet 
nuclear  explosions  also  occurred,  one  a  high-altitude  tes t   over 
central Asia  and  the  other an  atmospheric tes t  over Soviet Arctic. 
Development  of  new  type   of  laser  b y   General  Electric  and  In ter-  
national Business Machine  researchers  was reported  in American 
Physical Society’s Physical  Review Letters  and American  In s t i tu t e  
of  Physics’  A p p l i e d   Phy s ic s   Letters.  Called  “injection  laser,” 
new  crystal  laser  was  powered  by   electrical  curren t ;   previous 
solid  lasers  used  strong  flash  lamps  as  energy  source.  A t   least 
10  times  more  efficient  than   existing  lasers,  injection  laser  was 
expected  to   enable engineers  to  broadcast  audio messages on  the  
beams of  light  and  to  modulate the  brightness of  the  light  accord- 
ing  to   voice,  television,  or  other  p a t t e rn .   Researchers  antici- 
pa ted   t h a t  single  laser  beam  could  transm i t   a million  telephone 
messages o r  a  thousand  television  channels. 
Ten   years  ago  the   U.S.  exploded  a  hydrogen  device  (fusion) a t  the  
Eniwetok  atoll  in  th e   Pacific,  the   first  full-scale  thermonuclear 
explosion in history  and  th e  dawn of  th e  so-called “H-bomb  era.” 
Dr.  Lev  Davidovich  Landau ,   member  of  the   Soviet  Academy  of

ASTRONAUTICAL   AND   AERONAUTICAL   EVENTS  OF  1 0 6 2   229 
November  1-3:  First  NASA-University  Conference  on  th e  Science  and  
Technology  of  Space  Exploration  held  in  Chicago,  with  1,181 
educators  and  scientists  representing  NASA   Headquarters,  NASA 
field  installations,  and   other  Government  agencies,  as  well  a s  
more  th an  300 colleges and universities. 
November  1 :   Dr.  Hugh   L.  Dryden,  NASA  D epu ty   Administrator, 
speaking  a t   NASA-University  Conference  in  Chicago,  said  NASA 
needed  help  from universities  in four main  areas:  space sciences, 
manned  space flight,  applications of  ear th   satellites  to   communi- 
cations  and  meteorology,  and   advanced  research  and   technology. 
“Our  educational  institutions  bear  a major  responsibility  for  th e  
success of  our  national  effort  t o  explore space.  Our  universities 
and   colleges are  called  upon  t o  produce  a  body  of  scientists  and  
engineers  of  u n ex c e l l~ d  competence.  Some  of  these  gradua tes  
w i l l   enter  governmental  service  with  NASA   and  other  agencies 
participating  in  t h e   space  program;  some  w i l l   join  pr iva te   re- 
search organizations and  industrial  corporations. 
“Bu t  some mus t  remain  a t  th e  universities where they  continue 
to   advance  knowledge  and  produce  new  talent.  Th is   las t   func- 
tion  should  receive  high  priority.  Th e   government  laboratory, 
industry,  and  research  foundation  all  are  users  of  creative  and  
talented  men  without  reproducing  this  vital  national  resource. 
T h e  university  alone  is  the   producer  of  new  engineers  and  sci- 
entists.” 
Dr .   Homer  E.  Newell,  NASA  Director  of  Space  Sciences,  addressed 
NASA-University  Conference  on  th e   Science  and  Technology  of 
Space Exploration,  Chicago:  “During  th e   first  four  years  of  th e  
existence of  t h e  National  Aeronautics  and Space Administration, 
157  sounding  rockets,  55  satellites,  and  9  space probes have been 
launched  and   have  yielded  a  tremendous  amount  of  information 
i n  all of  the  areas of  interest.  Many  hundreds of  research  papers 
have  appeared  in  th e  open  scientific l i tera ture  and  a considerable 
portion  of  th e   scientific  community,  bo th   national  and  interna- 
tional,  h a s  become involved  in th e  effort to  make  t,he most  of  the  
opportunities  afforded  b y   th e   space  program  for  th e   conduct  of 
impor tan t   research.  It is hoped  t h a t   th e  university  community 
will  continue  to   find  new  and  challenging  opportunities  and   will 
continue  to   increase a n d   strengthen  its  participation  which  has  
already become a major  element  in  th e  success of  th e  program  so 
far .”  
Dr. T. L. K. Smull, Director of  NASA  Granbs and Research Contracts, 
addressed  NASA-University Conference on policies and procedures 
of  NASA-University  gran ts   and  research  contracts:  “The   basic 
principle  of  all  NASA  policy  regarding  i t s   relationships  with  uni- 
versities  is  t h a t   NASA  wishes  to  work  within  th e  s truc ture   of  the  
universities in  a way t h a t  will strengthen  the  university  and  a t  the  
same  t ime   make   i t   possible  fo r   NASA  to   accomplish  its  mis- 
sion.  . . .  NASA  hopes  to   conduct  i t s   joint  activities  in  a 
manner  t h a t   will  preserve  and   strengthen  th e   universities’ 
educational  role.  This basic  policy  is interwoven  in  t,he policies 
and  procedures of NASA  support of  research, facilities, and training. 
‘(. . . NASA  suppor t  of  activities  in th e  universities h a s  approx- 
imately  doubled  each  year   since  NASA  was  organized.  During 
Fiscal  Year  1962  some  $40  million  were  committed  for  these 

230  ASTRONAUT ICAL   A N D   AERONAUT ICAL   E V E N T S   O F   1 9 6 2  
activities.  Of  this  $40 million,  $ 2   million was utilized  to  in i t ia te  
th e   training  gran t   program;  $6)4  million was used  t o  in i t ia te   th e  
facilities  gran t   program;  and   some  $3)4  million  was  utilized  for 
th e   special  purpose  research  grants.  T h e  rest  of  th e   funds  sup- 
ported  project  typ e  research.  . . . 
“It  is   expected  t h a t   th e   university  involvement  in  NASA 
activities  during  the   current  fiscal year will be more  th an   double 
t h a t   of  F Y  1962.  . .  .

November  2 :   James  E.  Webb,  NASA   Administrator,  and   th e   NASA 
astronauts were honored  a t  Explorers Club’s Night of  Exploration 
dinner in New York.  Addressing th e  club on NASA  programs and  
goals, Mr.  Webb  said:  “Curiosity-the  driving  human  th irs t   for 
knowledge-is  only  one  reason,  of  course,  for  undertaking  space 
exploration  on  the   scale  and   a t   th e   pace  which  our  coun try  has  
established.  . . . 
“F irs t ,   we  seek  for  mankind  the   benefits  inherent  in  the  
scientific  and   technological  knowledge  and  dexterity  t h a t   will 
emerge  from  this  dynamic  effort  to   conquer  th e   most  hostile 
environment  t h a t  man   has   ever  entered-and 
to  use  t h a t  knowl- 
edge and  technical  skill  as a n  impor tan t   new resource  for human  
progress. 
“Second, we  seek to  maintain  our position  as leader of  the Free 
World,  through  continued  superiority in  science and   technology. 
‘(And,  finally,  we  seek  space  power  as  a  deterrent  to   any  
potential  adversary  who  might  a t t em p t   t o   exploit  space  as  an  
avenue of  aggression against us  . . .  . 9 1  
0  Transa t lan t ic   use  of  TELSTAR   communications  satellite  was  dis- 
continued  for  abou t  seven weeks.  During  this  period,  TELSTAR’S 
orbit  brought  it  too  briefly  on  line  of  sight  with  No r th  America 
and   Europe   for  useful  transmission.  AT&T  said  th e   s i tua t ion  
would  recur  every  six  months.  Domestic  transmissions  would 
be  suspended  only  from  Nov.  26  to   Dec.  2 ,   during  which  time 
ground  equipment  would be  “tuned  up.” 
Unnamed  NASA  spokesman  said  MA R IN E R   11 was  sending  “about  90 
kinds  of  information”  from  interplanetary  space,  despite  power 
drop of  Oct.  31 .   Officials were  “p r e t ty  optimistic”  Venus-bound 
probe  could  renew  experiments  turned   off  because  of  drop  in  
voltage of  the   spacecraft’s  power  system. 
DOD  announced A N N A  geodetic satellite was functioning properly and  
i ts   orbit  was  “near  perfect.”  ANNA’S  flashing  light  system 
would  be  tested  Nov.  4 with  single series of  five flashes triggered

Fou r   “ho t   spo ts”   on  th e  moon  were  reported  discovered  by   Bruce 
M u r r ay   and   Rober t   Wildey  of  Cal  Tech,  using  new  telescope 
with  heat-sensitive,  gold-plated  mirror  to   detect  infrared  radia- 
tion.  Th e   two  space  scientists  speculated  t h a t   ho t   spo t s   could 
indicate  large  areas  of  bare  rock  exposed  on  the   luna r   surface. 
Spo ts   were  discovered  during  survey  of  th e   moon  which  also 
revealed  t h e   lunar   surface  gets  colder  a t   night  than   previously 
believed,  -270OF 
recorded  by   earlier 
compared  to   -243OF 
heat-measuring  devices.  Mu r ray   said  th e   new  evidence  could 
mean  there  are  prominences of  heat-retaining  rock  pro trud ing

NASA  Depu ty   Administrator  Hugh  L.  Dryden ,   addressing  General 
Session  of  U.S.  Savings  and   Loan  League  in  Washington,  said: 
“.  . . Wha t   we  a re  buying  in  our  national  space  program is  th e  
knowledge,  th e  experience, th e  skills, th e  industrial facilities, and  
the  experimental hardware t h a t  will make  th e  United S ta te s  first 
in  every  field  of  space  exp lo r a t ion s c i en t i f i c  and   practical  uses, 
including  military  applications.  And  t o   accomplish  this  result 
we  mus t   make  advances  a t   th e   frontiers of  knowledge  in  nearly 
every field of  science and  technology which will project new ideas 
in to  our  whole  industrial  system.  . . . 
“The   success  of  th e   National  Space  Program  hinges  on  the  
ability  of  th e   American people,  through   their  government, their 
industry,  and  their  privately  endowed institutions,  t o  implement 
many  difEcult  tasks.  No t  one or two men will make th e  landing

mous  undertaking.  An  important  (bu t   certainly  not  determin-

cementing  friendly  relations  with  our  allies  in  the   Free  World 
and   among  the   uncommitted  nations.  This  we  do  b y   demon-

what  we  learn  from  space  exploration  with  the   scientific  com- 
mun i ty   the   world  around.  . . . 
“The  investment in space progress is big and  will  grow, bu t   the  
potential returns on the  investment are  even larger.  And because 
it  concerns  us  all,  scientific  progress  is  everyone’s responsibility. 
Every   citizen  should  understand  what  th e   space  program  really 
is  about  and  what  i t  can do.  . . .

“This  kind  of  man   not  only  combines  general  and   scientific 
training  and   general  management  with  technical  experience, b u t

D r .  Vernov  believes the   particles  acquire  their  energy within  the  
b e l t t h r o u g h   some  as  y e t   unknown  accelerating  mechanism. 
He  believes  there  are  two  such  means  of  acceleration,  one  sus- 
taining  the  day-to-day  energy level  and  the   other  accounting for 
i ts  increases when  a  cloud of  erupted  solar gas reaches  vicinity  of

bombardment  b y   cosmic  r ay s ;  some  of  the   high-energy  protons 
are  trapped   b y  earth’s magnetism  to  become  the   inner radiation 
belt.

Conference  on  Science, Technology,  and   Space  in  Boston,  spon- 
sored  by   MIT  and   NASA .   Dr.  Howard  W.  Johnson,  Dean  of 
MIT  School  of  Industrial  Management,  told  conference  t h a t   the  
“impact  of  space  is  largely  th e   impac t   of  space  research  and

November 14: NASA   announced  Ma j .   L.  Gordon  Cooper,  Jr.  (USAF ) ,  
had   been  selected  for  18-orbit  Project  Mcrcury  flight  MA-9. 
T h e   day-long  space  flight  would  be  made  no  earlier  than   April 
1963.  Astronaut  Cooper,  youngest  of  original  seven  astronauts, 
was  back-up  pilot  and   technical  adviser  for  Astronaut  Walter 
M .   Schirra  in   flight  MA-8.  Back-up  pilot  for  MA-9  would  be 
Cdr.  Alan  B.  Shepard,  J r . ,   who  made  first  U.S.  manned  space 
flight  (suborbital  flight, MR-3)  on M a y  5,  1961. 
I n  news  conference a t  MIT,  Dr. James A.  Van  Allen  said  the   radia- 
tion  caused  by   U S .   atmospheric  nuclear  tes t   in  Ju ly   would  be 
“undetectable”  by   Ju ly   1963.  Dr.  Van  Allen  reported  signals 
from  INJUN ,   TELSTAR,  EXPLORERS   XIV   and   x v   showed  the   elec- 
tronic s tream  had disappeared within  a few days of  U.S.  explosion 
and  t h a t  the  electrons  a t  600-mi.  a l t i tude  were now undetectable. 
Electrons  a t   900-mi.  altitude  were  still  creating  radioastronomy 
interference,  he  acknowledged,  bu t   this  would  be  gone  by   next 
July. 
Speaking  a t   New  England  Regional  Conference  on  Science, 
Technology,  and  Space  held  a t  MIT,  Dr. Van  Allen  reviewed  sug- 
gestions made  by  panel  of  scientists which m e t   las t   July-August 
under  National  Academy  of  Sciences  auspices  a t   Iowa  City. 
Panel  reviewed  NASA  program  and   recommended  t h a t   NASA  (1) 
send scientists with as tronau t  training along with  test-pilot  astro- 
n au t s  on  early  lunar   and  planetary  flights;  (2)  establish  an   acad- 
emy within  a year  to  tra in   scientist-astronaut volunteers,  located

contaminated  with  terrestrial  organisms  until  question  of  exist- 
ence  of Mar t ian   life is  resolved;  (5 )   make  more  use  of  university 
facilities;  and   (6)  reduce  time  lag  between  concept  of  a  space 
experiment  and   i t s   execution.  Spokesman  in  Washington  said 
complete  report  of  the   panel  would  be  issued  by   early  J anu a ry .  
West  Side  Association  of  Commerce  (N.Y.C.)  presented  National 
West  Side  Award  to   NASA .  
I n   accepting  the   award,  NASA  
Administrator  James   E.  Webb  said:  “Except  in  war  time,  no 
large  national  effort  has  had   such  a  rapid  buildup  as  the   space

“It  is  the   contribution  of  all  the   forces,  in  industry,  gov-

development  or  preflight  preparations,  Dr.  Gilruth  said:  “ I n  
manned  flight, we cannot  afford to  regard  any  of  these equipment 
malfunctions  as   a  ‘random’ failure.  We mus t   regard  every mal- 
function  and,  in  fac t ,   every  observed  peculiarity  in  th e  behavior 
of  a  system,  as  an  impo r tan t  warning of po ten t ia l  disaster.  Only 
when  th e  cause  is thoroughly  understood,  and  a  change  t o  elimi- 
n a t e  i t  has been made, can we proceed with  th e  flight program.  . . . 
“Rapid  corrective  response  to  malfunctions  throughout  system 
development  and   preflight  preparations  is  a  critically  impo r tan t  
requirement  of  our  programs  if  we  a re   to   meet  schedules  with

of  1963.  There  is  virtually  no  possibility  of  a  manned  flight 
before  1964  . .  . . [Slippage  was]  simply  because  of  the   time 
it takes  to  do  this  very  complicated  job.” 
Dr.  Hugh   L.  Dryden ,   NA SA   D epu ty   Administrator,  said  in  first 
annual  Theodore  von  K&rm&n  Lecture  of  the   American  Rocket 
Society:  “The   costs  of  the   presently  approved  [space] program 
increase  next  year  to   abou t   six  billion  dollars  if   current  time

the   development  of  a  [manned]  space  station  now  without  still 
larger  resources  assigned  t o   the   space  program.  I  personally 
believe  t h a t   the   next  large  manned  space  flight  project  [after 
Project Apollo manned  lunar  landing] will be  this one ra ther   th an  
extensive  exploitation of  the  moon  o r  manned  expeditions  to   the

Relationship  between  very  low  frequency  (VLF)   hiss  and  aurora 
australis  (Southern  lights)  was  c o n b e d   after  six  months  of 
research  by   two  scientists,  it  was  reported.  Ward  Helms  and 
John   Tur t le ,   working  a t  Byrd   S ta t ion ,  Antarctica,  believe  they 
have  confirmed the   theory  of  Henry   Morozumi,  Stanford  Univ. 
scientist, when  they   found  peaks  of  auroral  display  and   VLF  hiss 
were identical in intensity  and coincided repeatedly.  Helms said 
he  was  “no t   certain  t h a t   VLF  hiss  is  p a r t   of  the   aurora,  per  se, 
b u t  I’m sure t h a t  since the  aurora and hiss peaks are simultaneous 
there  is reason  to   th ink   the   same  particles  generating  the   aurora 
also generate  the  hiss.”

physical Union meeting.  Experiment measured velocity, density, 
and  temperature  of  solar  plasma  using  electrostatic  analyzer 
onboard  the   probe.  Results  showed  energies  of  gas  atoms  in 
solar wind  are very  low  as  compared to  cosmic-ray particles,  bu t  
number  of  solar-wind  particles  is  about  a  billion  times  greater 
than  number of  cosmic rays, making  to ta l  energy content of  solar 
wind much greater than  of  cosmic rays.  Solar flares eject plasma 
clouds which may have  higher velocity, density, and  temperature 
than   undisturbed  solar wind-which  MAR INER  11 found to be l i t t le  
less  than   250  mi.  per  sec.  velocity,  10-20  particles  per  cu.  in. 
density,  and  few hundred  thousand  deg.  temperature.  MAR INER  
11  also  found  solar wind  appears  to  be  “supersonic”-and 
super- 
sonic effects  such  as plasma  shockwave  ahead  of  the   earth  and 
other  planets  would  be  objects  of  s tudy   of  fu ture   NASA  space

Interaction  of  winds  in  lower  atmosphere  and   turbulence  in  upper 
atmosphere  was  reported  a t   AAAS  meeting  by   Univ.  of  Chicago 
scientist  Colin  0. Hines.  Hines  said  wave  motions  (“internal 
av i ty  waves”)  from  ear th   appear  to   generate  whirlpool  turbu-  
Cnces u p  to   50 mph  and  sweeping upward  as high  as  50 mi.  As 
strength  of  upper  atmosphere  varies,  so  too  does  its  chemical 
composition;  changes  may   react  back  to   lower  atmosphere. 
Hines  said  turbulence  seems  t o   provide  heat  to   upper  air  a t  
perhaps  as high  as  10 degrees  a 
rate  of  one  degree  a  day-and 
day.  He   also  noted  t h a t   turbulence  ends  ra the r   abrup t ly   a t  
altitudes  from  60  to  70  mi.,  the   ab rup t   change  altering  upper 
air’s chemical composition:  whereas presence of  turbulence mixes 
chemicals in  atmosphere,  absence  of  turbulence  separates  chemi- 
cals into distinct layers.  Hines concluded fur ther  s tudy  of  turbu- 
lence could  contribute  to   be t ter   long-distance radio  communica- 
tions which use  ionospheric irregularities, partially  produced  and 
controlled  by  the  whirlpools.

D r .   Freeman  H.  Quimby,  Chief  of  Exobiology  Programs  in  NASA  
Office of  Space Sciences, announed U S .  plans  to  land  life-detect-

we’re working  on  the postulate  there may  be  some forms of  life,” 
Dr. Quimby  told  the  American  Association for  the  Advancement 
of  Science meeting in  Philadelphia. 
Addressing  American  Association  for  the   Advancement  of  Science, 
D r .   Loren  K .   Eiseley,  anthropology  prof.  a t   Univ.  of  Pennsyl-

monstrous; t o  reduce  them  t o  normal size becomes  difficult if no t  
impossible.  . . .”  D r .   Eiseley  predicted  the   massive  emphasis 
on  space  and  armaments  might  lead  to  downfall  of  modern 
civilization; he  compared  the  preoccupation with  space and   arm- 
amen ts   to  Imper ia l   Rome’s  colonialism, Ancient  Egypt’s  tomb 
and  pyramid building,  and  India’s  elaborate  caste  system  which 
contributed  to   downfall of  those  ancient  civilizations.

D r .   James   A.  Van  Allen,  S t a t e   University  of  Iowa  physicist, 
criticized  Government  report  on  atmospheric  radiation  resulting 
from  U S .   high-altitude  nuclear  explosion  in  Ju ly ,   which  s t a t ed  
radiation  levels  were  much  higher  th an   had   been  predicted  and  
would  las t   longer  t h a n   h ad   been  predicted.  Dr.  Van  Allen 
charged  th e  Government  report  was  a  “has ty   and  ill-considered” 
interpretation  of  the   fac ts ;   h e   predicted  th e   bulk  of  artificially 
formed  radiation  would  no  longer  be  detectable  by   summer  of 
1963.  D r .   Van  Allen  said  Presiden.t’s  Science  Advisory  Com- 
m i t tee   ignored  findings  from  INJUN   satellite  (which  he  used  t o  
s tud y   effects  of  the   explosion)  and  relied  instead  on  d a t a   from 
TELSTAR  satellite,  launched  af ter   th e   nuclear  test.  Scientist 
James   W.  Warwick  of  University  of  Colorado,  basing  his  con-

“I canno t   help  b u t   wonder  abou t   the   sincerity  of  our  entire 
space effort  in  view  of  th e   trends which  I see in  our  curren t  pro- 
gram.  It  appears,  increasingly,  t h a t   our  goal  is  gravitating  to- 
ward  a  one-shot  manned mission  to   the  moon. 
“This  effort  is  centered  around  the   development  of  chemical 
rockets  whose  limitations,  compared  to   nuclear  propulsion,  a r e  
severe. 
(‘. . . T h e  leader  in  space  cannot  afford  to   be  so  lacking  in

Sir  Bernard  Lovell  of  Jodrell  Bank   in  an   interview  with  London 
Daily  Telegraph:  “.  . . Although  the  Russians may  have  [space] 
superiority  purely  in  the   sense  of  rocketry,  the   Americans  have 
tremendous  superiority  over  the   Russians  in  their  ability  to  
instrument  their  space  vehicles  and   in  the   extraction  of  space 
informa tion. 
“If  you  made  an   assessment  of  the  scientific  information  we 
have obtained abou t  the  earth’s environment from space vehicles, 
you  could find  t h a t   this was  very heavily  biased  in  favour of  the 
Americans.  They  have mounted more sophisticated experiments 
in  their  satellites  and   space  probes  and   they   have  made  them  
work  much  better.” 
During  1962:  D r .   Louis  Smullni  of  MIT’S Lincoln  Laboratories  suc-

Operations  Control  Center  a t   Goddard  Space  Flight  Center,  public

agencies,  and   th e   President’s  Repor t   to   the   Congress  on  U.S. Aero- 
nau t ic s   and   Space  Activities-1962. 
Russian  d a t a  are  from  th e  U.N.

Satellite S i tu a t io n   Report  af ter  launch.  D a t e  of  launch is t h a t  of  local 
launch  s i te  time.  After  all available  sources had   been  checked,  there 
still  remained  six  gaps  in  th e   In terna t iona l   Code  Name  Greek-

1962 Be ta-The ta ,   1962 Be ta-Io ta ,   1962 Beta-Nu,  and   1962 Beta-Xi. 
Three of  these can be accounted for as known b u t  undesignated  Soviet 
launches ; th e  o them  remain  unknown. 
Even  though  the  tempo of  space flights  continued  t o  increase, valid 
interpretation  of  th e  scientific results of  m any   satellites  and   probes  is

APPENDIX  B 
CHRONOLOGY  OF  MAJOR  NASA  LAUNCHINGS 
OCTOBER  1,  1958,  THROUGH   DECEMBER  31,  1962 
This chronology  of  major NASA  launchings is intended t o  provide an  
accurate  and  ready   historical  reference,  one  compiling  and   verifying 
informa tion  previously  scattered  over  several  sources.  It  spans 
NASA’s first  four  years.  It includes  launchings  of  all vehicles  larger 
than   sounding  rockets  launched  either  by   NASA  or  under  “NASA 
direction”  (e.g.,  ABMA   served as launching  ageot for  the   early Jup i te r  
C and  Juno   I1 shots,  and  AFBMD  for  the  Thor-Able  shots). 
An  a t temp t   has been  made  t o  classify the  performance of  both  the 
launch vehicle and  the  payload and  of  to ta l  results in  terms  of  primary 
mission.  Three   categories  have  been  used  for  vehicle  performance 
(S) , partially  successful  (P) ,  and  
and   mission  results-successful 
unsuccessful  (U).  A  four th   category,  unknown  (Unk),  has  been 
provided  for payloads  where  launch vehicle malfunctions did not Cgve 
the   payload  a  chance  t o   exercise  i t s  main  experiments.  These 
im- 
sions  are  necessarily  arb i trary ,   since  many   of  the   results  cannot  be 
nea t ly   categorized.  Also  they  ignore  the   fact  t h a t   a  grea t   deal was 
learned from sho ts  which  may  have been  classified  as unsuccessful. 
A  few  unique  items require  separate  trea tmen t .   Their  da tes  have 
been kep t  in sequence, bu t  their history has  been relegated to  footnotes. 
Da te s  of  launchings  are  referenced  to  local  time  a t  the  launch site. 
The   original  tab le   was  prepared  by   Rober t   Rosholt  of  the   NASA 
Historical  Office,  who  made  a  comparative  analysis  of  the   several 
general chronologies prepared  by   the   NASA  Historical  Office,  the   first 
six  semiannual  reports  of  NASA ,   and  the   Space Activities  Summary  
prepared  b y   the   NASA  Office  of  Public  Information.  Additional 
information  and   guidance  was  received  from  Headquar ters   Offices, 
from  Launch Operations Cen ter ,  and  from  the   very  useful  comments 
received  on  the   October  1962  version.  For  fur ther   information  on 
each  item,  see  Appendix  A  of  Aeronauiics  and  Astronautics  (1916- 
1960), Aeronautical and  Astronautical  Events o f  1961, and  this volume.
