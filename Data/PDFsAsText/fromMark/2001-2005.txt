JANUARY 2001 
 
3 January 
Using data from the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Infrared Space Observatory, a team of 
NASA and university researchers identified three stars that they believed contain enough 
hydrogen to create a Jupiter-like gas planet. The scientists, from Italy, the Netherlands, and the 
United States, indicated that the stars Beta Pictoris, 49 Ceti, and HD1235344 have particularly 
fertile environments, which might eventually form planets. Perhaps most significant, the 
researchers found a “thousand times more hydrogen” in several stars than scientists had 
discovered in earlier studies.1 
 
8 January 
NASA astronomer Gerard M. Williger announced the discovery of a massive cluster of quasars 
and galaxies, a concentration presumed to be the largest structure ever observed in the universe. 
Collaborating with fellow NASA astronomers Luis E. Campusano, Roger G. Clowes, and Chris 
P. Haines, Williger had located the body approximately 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth, 
in the heart of the constellation Leo the Lion. Not prepared to state with certainty that the find 
was the largest ever discovered, Williger clarified, “We have found nothing bigger in the 
literature and nobody has brought to our attention anything bigger.” Moreover, he speculated that 
the enormous gathering of quasars might be “an artifact of the Big Bang.” Articles in scientific 
journals and in popular publications expressed excitement at the find.2 
 
9 January 
A team of astronomers led by Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley and 
R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington announced that, during a long-term 
project to search for planets that orbit stars residing within 300 light-years of Earth, they had 
discovered two new planetary systems. Astronomers had already discovered dozens of planetary 
systems, but Marcy and Butler had found the first and second examples ever observed of systems 
with more than one planet orbiting a star. Furthermore, one of the planets discovered was so 
massive that it defied the parameters that scientists had previously used to define planets. In 
response to the discovery, one of Butler’s colleagues stated simply, “I am astonished.” Marcy 
admitted that he and his team did not know how to classify their discovery, saying, “The outer 
companion (of this star) is so massive, between 17 and 40 times the mass of Jupiter, that it seems 
too large for a conventional planet. We frankly don’t know what name to give it!”3 
 
10 January  
At the American Astronomical Society convention, astronomers Victoria M. Kaspi and Mallory 
S. E. Roberts of McGill University presented evidence dating a known pulsar to 386 AD. 
Because scientists consider it quite difficult to determine the age of particular pulsars or of any 
astronomical body, the scientific community regarded the find as especially significant. The

researchers had used NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to locate the pulsar exactly at the 
center of a supernova remnant known as G11.2-0.3, which astronomers had already definitively 
dated. Scientists believed that both the pulsar and the supernova had formed during an explosion 
in 386 ADan event that early Chinese astronomers had recorded. Astronomers have 
experienced difficulty tracking and interpreting the patterns of pulsars, because the formations 
spin and move rapidly. In light of the successful dating, many scientists hoped that the discovery 
might help them understand how pulsars develop.4 
 
11 January 
The People’s Republic of China launched a robotic spacecraft from the Gobi desert, a significant 
step in the country’s long-term plan to join the United States and Russia as one of the only 
nations capable of sending humans into space. The Shenzhou 2 craft reached orbit about 10 
minutes after launch. China had shrouded its 31-year-old space program in secrecy, releasing 
few details about funding or about China’s future goals. People’s Daily, however, called the 
launch “an important step in realizing manned spaceflight.” President Jiang Zemin urged 
Chinese space officials to further accomplishments, saying, “I hope you will work persistently 
and unremittingly to achieve even greater victory.” Space experts speculated that a successful 
Shenzhou 2 mission could mean that China would be ready to send a man or woman to space in 
the next two to five years. Chinese officials remained circumspect regarding their exact plans.5 
 
20 January 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin became NASA’s first head to serve three different presidents 
when George W. Bush assumed the presidency of the United States. Although some had 
speculated that Goldin’s tenure would end when President William J. Clinton left office, 
President George W. Bush asked Goldin to remain in his position indefinitely, while the new 
administration reviewed possible candidates to replace him. Originally appointed by President 
George H. W. Bush in 1992, Goldin had instituted vast changes at NASA with his “faster, better, 
cheaper” approach. During his tenure, Goldin had reduced the number of NASA employees from 
24,000 to 18,000 while overseeing the successful building and deployment of the International 
Space Station (ISS).6  
 
24 January 
The Russian Space Agency launched a cargo ship headed for the aging Mir space station. The 
mission’s aim was simple: to remove the 15-year-old space station from orbit safely, by 
propelling it into Earth’s atmosphere. To accomplish the task, Russia selected an unpiloted 
Progress M1-5 cargo ship, carrying enough fuel for its own journey and to fire Mir’s thrusters. A 
series of mechanical problems, including a fire and a collision with another cargo craft in 1997, 
combined with Russia’s shortage of funds for space endeavors, had led to the Russian 
government’s decision to end Mir’s successful run. With the launch of the Progress craft, some 
cosmonauts and Russian space officials protested the destruction of the last remaining symbol of

the space heyday of the Soviet Union. Amateur astronomers aimed their telescopes toward the 
skies to glimpse Mir one last time as it orbited Earth.7 
 
DiversityBusiness.com named NASA one of the United States’ top 50 organizations for 
providing multicultural business opportunities. Sparked by the efforts of its Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization, NASA had awarded more than US$2 billion in contracts to 
minority-owned and women-owned businesses during 2000. NASA joined companies such as 
Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. among those honored. 
NASA’s hiring of disadvantaged businesses had more than doubled during Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin’s tenure.8 
 
Michael A. Chowdry, the founder and chairperson of Atlas Air Inc., and Jeff Cole, the aerospace 
editor for the Wall Street Journal, died in a plane crash, which occurred minutes after takeoff 
from the Front Range Airport in Watkins, Colorado. Chowdry had formed Atlas Air in 1992, to 
lease jumbo cargo jets and to provide flight crews to the airfreight industry. Since 1999, readers 
of the Wall Street Journal had known Cole for his detailed and insightful coverage of the defense 
and aerospace industries. After interviewing Chowdry, Cole had accepted his invitation to ride 
aboard a Czech fighter jet. Chowdry was piloting the jet when it crashed.9 
 
25 January 
NASA made available the first large-scale images revealing a tail of electrified gas streaming 
from Earth toward the Sun. One of the images, which NASA’s Imager for Magnetopause to 
Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft had produced, appeared on the cover of Science. 
The IMAGE technology had captured new views of previously unverifiable gas trapped within 
Earth’s magnetic field, known as the magnetosphere. The images placed in the context of the 
solar system the vast reach of the region affected by Earth’s magnetosphere, which extends past 
the Moon on the night side of Earth. Astronomers compared the perspective the new images 
provided them, to the perspective satellite images of Earth provide to scientists researching 
hurricanes.10 
 
30 January 
Presiding over the launch of a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite, Major Nina M. 
Armagno became the first female launch director at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 
Armagno assumed responsibility for a 400-person crew and for making the final decision about 
whether to proceed with launch plans.11

NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft completed its primary mission, having collected more 
information about Mars than all of the previous missions combined had acquired. “By any 
conceivable measure the scientific impact of Mars Global Surveyor has been extraordinary,” said 
Global Surveyor Project Scientist Arden L. Albee. Since reaching the Red Planet in 1998, Global 
Surveyor had gathered data on Mars’s climate, topography, and geology, as well as mapping the 
entire planet. The orbiter, which launched in November 1996, had provided a steady stream of 
invaluable data. Among the most significant findings of the primary mission had been the 
detection of significant evidence of liquid water, the detection of a magnetized crust on the 
planet’s southern hemisphere, and the discovery of new information about seasonal changes on 
the planet. The spacecraft had gathered the data in the course of more than 8,500 orbits of the 
planet, during which it had collected 58,000 images. With Mars Global Surveyor still functioning 
effectively, NASA planned to extend its mission and continue its research.12 
 
NASA’s Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) Shoemaker spacecraft completed its primary 
mission to the asteroid Eros. NEAR was the first spacecraft successfully to orbit an asteroid and 
to provide detailed data about it. Even in its first year, the NEAR spacecraft had exceeded 
expectations, gathering 10 times more data than scientists had forecast. Traveling more than 2 
billion miles (3.2 billion kilometers), NEAR had captured 11 million laser pulses; x-ray, gamma-
ray, and infrared readings; and approximately 160,000 images of Eros. With its initial objectives 
accomplished, the NEAR team focused on accomplishing another firsta controlled descent of 
the spacecraft onto the asteroid. Astronomers hoped that the landing would gather close-up 
images, otherwise impossible to obtain. With the low-cost and efficient spacecraft nearly out of 
fuel, NEAR Mission Director Robert W. Farquhar explained that NEAR’s landing was a final 
attempt to glean as much as possible from the endeavor. Said Farquhar, “With the spacecraft just 
about out of fuel and our science objectives met, this is a great way to end a successful mission. 
It’s all bonus science . . . at this point the only real risk is not taking one.”13 
 
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) announced that Charles Elachi would become Director 
of its 5,000-employee, US$1.3 billion research facility in Pasadena, California. Elachi, an expert 
in the field of remote sensing best known for developing radar systems, had assumed JPL’s top 
post after 30 years of service with NASA. JPL had interviewed more than 70 candidates over 
eight months before selecting Elachi. Concerning JPL’s challenge to encourage further 
exploration while meeting tight budgets, Elachi remarked, “It’s basically striking a balance 
between faster implementation and cheaper implementation and making sure we have success.” 
Having lost two separate spacecraft headed for Mars in 1999, JPL stood at a critical juncture as 
Elachi assumed control.14

2 February  
NASA opened a new command and control center that would allow researchers on Earth to 
participate in scientific research conducted aboard the ISS. The new facility, located at NASA’s 
Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, featured state-of-the-art 
communication and research technologies. Director of MSFC Arthur G. Stephenson described 
the new center as a significant part of NASA’s ongoing plan to make space research more 
efficient and useful: “From this facility we will manage fundamental scientific research that can 
only be done in spaceresearch that will lead to knowledge to benefit all humanity here on 
Earth.” NASA planned to staff the 13,000-square-foot (1,200-square-meter) facility 24 hours per 
day to support research aboard ISS. In addition to its link to the ISS, the new facility was 
equipped to monitor payload resources, facilitate data transfer, and communicate with 
universities and research centers throughout the world. The new command post opened only days 
before Space Shuttle Atlantis’s scheduled trip into space to carry the Destiny research laboratory 
module to the ISS.15 
 
7 February 
Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-98/ISS-5A lifted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 
Cape Canaveral, Florida, carrying the most expensive and crucial component of the ISSthe 
United States–built Destiny science laboratory. Mark Stephenson of the Boeing Company, which 
had built the US$1.4 billion research module, called the vessel “the crown jewel” of the ISS. 
NASA had set high stakes on the Destiny laboratory, which was so expensive and complicated to 
build, that NASA could not afford to assemble a backup module. Therefore, any problem in the 
transport and connection of the Destiny module would set back the ISS several years. NASA had 
delayed Atlantis’s mission for three weeks when engineers discovered evidence that faulty 
wiring might compromise the Shuttle’s safety. The vital mission brought the ISS closer to 
becoming the permanent and highly functional research station that NASA and the international 
space community had long awaited. The Destiny laboratory measured 28 feet (9 meters) long, 
weighed more than 30,000 pounds (13,600 kilograms), and held 13 computers. NASA expected 
to control the ISS using the computers and communications equipment built into Destiny. 
Because of the Space Shuttle’s cargo, some officials speculated that Atlantis’s mission was the 
most important for NASA’s research agenda ever undertaken. One NASA spokesperson called 
the Destiny module “the cornerstone for space-based research aboard the orbiting platform.” The 
STS-98 crew consisted of Commander Kenneth D. Cockrell; Pilot Mark L. Polansky; and 
Mission Specialists Robert L. Curbeam Jr., Thomas D. Jones, and Marsha S. Ivins.16

Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed a new director of Russia’s largest manufacturer of 
spacecraft and rockets, the Khrunichev State Research and Production Company. Putin selected 
Alexander I. Medvedev to succeed Anatoly Kiselyov, who had headed the company for 26 years. 
At the time of the change in leadership, Kiselyov had reported failing health. Companies with 
interests in Russian space exploration continued to adjust to postcommunist operations. The 
Khrunichev State Research and Production Company, providing much of the revenue to keep 
Russia’s space projects alive, manufactured Proton booster rockets used to launch commercial 
and communication satellites.17 
 
9 February  
Lieutenant Governor of Florida Frank T. Brogan and Roy D. Bridges Jr., Director of NASA’s 
KSC, broke ground on a new research facility located just south of KSC. The new project, 
officially named the Space Experiment Research and Processing Laboratory (SERPL), joined 
researchers from the state of Florida, NASA, the Florida Space Research Institute, and the 
University of Florida. The research center would devote significant resources to ISS research and 
to examining the commercial potential of space-related research. Bridges described the venture 
as widely beneficial, saying, “SERPL and the unprecedented opportunities for collaboration that 
it represents are key to Kennedy’s evolution to a recognized center for technology development. 
We expect this partnership to pay dividends to NASA, the State of Florida, and the space 
industry well into the future.18 
 
10 February  
The crew of Space Shuttle Atlantis successfully installed the Destiny laboratory on the ISS. 
Using the Shuttle’s robotic arm, astronaut Marsha S. Ivins moved the module from the Shuttle’s 
payload area to its place on the side of the ISS. After patching up a small leak from one of the 
module’s coolant lines, two spacewalking astronauts connected electrical, fluid, and data lines 
between the ISS and the Destiny laboratory. After carefully completing the installation, 
astronauts opened a hatch connecting the new module to the rest of the ISS. The additional 3,750 
cubic feet (106 cubic meters) of space made the ISS the largest spacecraft ever. Astronaut 
Kenneth D. Cockrellalong with William M. Shepherd, the first to enter the Destiny 
modulereported, “The lab looks and feels and smells great, and looks like all the hard work 
has really paid off. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware in here.”19 
 
12 February  
The NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft landed on the 433 Eros asteroid, becoming the first probe ever 
to accomplish such a feat. The landing was a bonus. NEAR had already successfully completed a 
1 billion-mile mission, which had provided pictures of Earth, comet Hoylake, and the asteroid 
253 Mathilde. After a carefully scripted 5-hour descent, NEAR touched down safely, traveling at 
about 4 miles (6 kilometers) per hour. The spacecraft, which engineers had not designed for the 
impromptu landing mission, did not have a parachute to lessen its impact on the asteroid’s

unknown surface. By firing the spacecraft’s engines five times during descent, NASA controllers 
were able to slow the craft to a safe landing speed. As NASA’s Chief Scientist Edward J. Weiler 
explained, “If you were an Erosian watching this thing come in, it should have a velocity about 
that of a walking individual.” Scientists landed the craft to demonstrate that the landing was 
possible, as well as to gather additional information. NASA engineers reported detecting a faint 
signal from the probe even after it had landed. The environment is harsh on the asteroid, which 
measures 21 miles (34 kilometers) long and 8 miles (13 kilometers) wide. Moving through space 
at more than 40,000 miles (64,300 kilometers) per hour, Eros reaches a temperature of 400°F 
(204°C) daily and has only weak gravity. Researchers believed that the asteroid is composed of 
material older than Earth and might have been part of another planet at one time.20 
 
14 February 
Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam Jr. made their third and final spacewalk 
from Space Shuttle Atlantis, finishing the installation of the ISS’s science laboratory Destiny. 
The spacewalk was the 100th in the history of U.S. space exploration. Two days earlier, Jones 
and Curbeam had conducted a spacewalk to install a window shutter for Destiny, allowing the 
astronauts residing inside the ISS an unparalleled view of Earth. Overall, the mission to install 
the vital and expensive Destiny module went smoothly. Atlantis’s crew worked quickly to 
connect the necessary cables, hatches, and wires to equip the new research center. The successful 
installation also allowed NASA to accept a transfer of leadership from the Russian Space 
Agency. Using the newly installed computers in the Destiny module, U.S. flight controllers took 
control of the ISS on 13 February 2001.21 
 
NASA announced that it would extend the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft mission by 10 days to 
make the most of the first successful landing of a spacecraft on an asteroid. After conducting a 
complicated landing sequence and arriving safely on the surface of the asteroid Eros, the NEAR 
spacecraft relayed its signal to excited scientists on Earth. Called the “Surprisingly Sturdy Little 
Spacecraft” by the New York Times, NEAR survived its landing mission, surprising space 
officials and enthusiasts. NEAR had already spent a year orbiting the Eros asteroid, when the 
craft had run low on fuel. NASA’s mission team directed it to land on the asteroid’s surface. 
After NEAR’s successful landing, mission managers determined that the spacecraft merited 
additional funding. Although the details about where NEAR would touch down remained in 
doubt until the last moment, the craft had landed at a location ideal for Earth controllers to send 
and receive signals, facilitating an extended mission.22

Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-98 landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California after three days of 
bad weather had prevented its planned landing at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The 
crew received a congratulatory call from President George W. Bush, praising their successful 13-
day mission. By the time that Atlantis and its crew departed the ISS, the Shuttle had significantly 
boosted the space station’s orbit, leaving the ISS orbiting at about 237 miles (381 kilometers) 
above Earth. While attached to the space station, Atlantis had used a series of engine bursts to 
push the ISS approximately 16 miles (26 kilometers) higher than its previous position. Shuttle 
crew had also unloaded food and supplies, including an enormous Russian carbon-dioxide 
removal unit, for the use of the three-person ISS crew during their visit.23  
 
On the 15th anniversary of the launch of the Mir space station and with its doom imminent, 
Russian scientists and other space enthusiasts protested the plan to use a controlled descent to 
destroy the aging vessel. Once a point of pride for the Soviet space program, Mir had remained 
in use far beyond its planned lifespan and had fallen into disrepair. Russian Space Agency Chief 
Yuri Koptev attempted once again to explain why Mir had to come down: “The Mir has lived a 
wonderful life and must end it in a graceful way. We must discard it while we are still capable of 
controlling it, not turn its descent into roulette that threatens the entire global community.” 
Russia had planned to initiate Mir’s final descent in mid-March 2001.24 
 
22 February  
A team of scientists led by Luann Becker of the University of Washington presented new 
evidence explaining what had precipitated the Permian-Triassic extinction of 250 million years 
ago, when 90 percent of life disappeared from Earth. Confirming a long-held hypothesis, the 
team of researchers had discovered, in ancient sediments spread across the planet, molecules of 
stardust that only could have come from space. This discovery led scientists to conclude that the 
impact of a massive comet had triggered the onset of dormancy of life on Earth. The scientists 
had examined samples from China, Japan, and Hungary, seeking to explain what had happened 
on Earth. NASA, which had contributed funding for the project, announced the team’s findings 
at a panel presentation in Washington, DC.25 
 
25 February  
NASA’s Ultra-Long Duration Balloon (ULDB), a huge research balloon designed to ascend to 
altitudes of more than 20 miles (32 kilometers), took off from Alice Springs, Australia. The size 
of a domed football stadium, the vessel was constructed of ultra-thin plastic material, enabling it 
to float above 99 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. Scientists controlled the research craft from the 
ground, hoping that if it succeeded, this new type of balloon would provide a cost-effective 
method of gathering data. However, after a launch delay of several weeks, because of turbulent

weather, the research balloon lasted aloft only a few hours before a leak forced it back to the 
ground. Once the balloon had reached 85,000 feet (26,000 meters), the flight controllers initiated 
a controlled descent, minimizing further damage to the craft and to the research instruments 
aboard. Engineers were optimistic that they could fix the balloon and that, once they had repaired 
and deployed it, the balloon would fly higher and longer than any previous research balloon. 
However, when the balloon landed approximately 132 miles (212 kilometers) away from its 
takeoff site, the launch-station director and crew remained uncertain of the nature and extent of 
the problem.26 
 
MARCH 2001 
 
1 March 
NASA announced that it had canceled the X-33 rocket development project, an endeavor that 
many in the space industry had hoped would produce a vehicle to replace the Space Shuttle. 
NASA ended the five-year program after having invested nearly US$1 billion in developing a 
reusable launching vehicle. The X-33 program, contracted to Lockheed Martin Space Systems 
Company, had sought to build the world’s most technologically advanced space vehicleshaped 
like an arrowhead and protected by a heat-resistant metallic covering. Because of its capability to 
ascend to space without having to drop weight by discarding boosters after launch, the new 
vehicle would have significantly improved on the Shuttle. NASA officials had hoped that the X-
33 would lead to development of the VentureStar vehicle, for transporting people and cargo into 
space. Operating at considerably less expense to NASA than the Space Shuttles, the VentureStar 
would permit more space missions per year. NASA’s decision to cut funding for the X-33 was 
part of its general effort to reduce its budget. NASA officials in charge of the Space Launch 
Initiative (SLI) had determined that, although the X-33 program had yielded significant new 
knowledge, it had not advanced to a point at which NASA engineers could readily implement the 
new technology. Arthur G. Stephenson, the Director of NASA’s MSFC, which had managed the 
program, called the decision to deny further funding “a very tough decision.”27 
 
2 March 
Wallace D. Hayes, an aeronautical engineer and longtime Princeton University professor, died at 
age 82 after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. His colleagues referred to Hayes as “a giant 
in his field,” Hayes had helped design the first planes that could safely break the sound barrier. 
Hayes’s 1959 book Hypersonic Flow Theory had outlined the scientific principles behind 
hypersonic flight, as well as the necessary technology to accomplish it. Although decades passed 
before his theories produced functional aircraft, many consider Hayes the father of high-speed 
flight. According to Robert Probstein, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
“Every supersonic aircraft, in my opinion, owes to him their design.” Hayes had worked with 
NASA and a handful of elite American universities during his stellar career. In his association

with NASA, he had worked to limit sonic booms from supersonic jets, an achievement that 
enabled supersonic jets to travel freely over populated areas.28 
 
7 March  
In preparation for the final descent of the Mir space station, the Russian Space Agency 
negotiated a US$200 million insurance policy covering any damage that might occur if pieces of 
the craft landed in populated areas. Russian officials planned to fire the engines of the cargo ship 
attached to the space station, thereby pulling Mir from orbit and sending the space station 
hurtling into Earth’s atmosphere. Scientists predicted that intense heat would destroy most of the 
station during reentry, but that some fragments would hit Earth. Although space agencies had 
successfully deorbited many rockets and satellites to final resting places in the ocean, Russia 
faced increasing international consternation regarding the damage Mir’s reentry might cause. 
Japan was at higher risk from fragments of Mir than other countries, because the space station 
would pass over Japan in its final, low orbit.29 
 
8 March 
Space Shuttle Discovery STS-102/ISS-5.A.1―comprising Commander James D. Wetherbee, 
Pilot James M. Kelly, and Mission Specialists Andrew S. W. Thomas and Paul W. 
Richards―launched from NASA’s KSC carrying the three-person crew of Expedition 2 to the 
ISS for their four-and-one-half-month stay. The members of Expedition 2―Russian cosmonaut 
Yury V. Usachev and NASA astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms―would replace the 
first ISS research team. The transfer also entailed a change of command aboard the orbiting 
research center. American William M. Shepherd, Commander during the first research period, 
had led a crew of two Russian cosmonauts in installing and calibrating ISS equipment. With 
many of the initial installation problems resolved, the second crew planned to devote more time 
to research. The Russian cosmonaut who was to take command aboard the ISS had plenty of 
space experience. Commander Usachev had spent 376 days on Mir and had performed numerous 
spacewalks. Although Voss and Helms had both flown on Shuttle missions before, this voyage 
was their first time traveling to space for a significant research period. The primary purpose of 
the Shuttle’s 14-day mission was to deliver the new crew, but Discovery also carried, for the first 
time, the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The Italian Space Agency had 
constructed the module to serve as a “moving van” for carrying experiments and supplies back 
and forth between Earth and the ISS.30 
 
11 March 
Astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms conducted the longest spacewalk in NASA 
historynearly 9 hours. After working to install hardware and equipment, the pair had to remain 
outside the ISS until NASA flight controllers had determined that the Italian module filled with

supplies had found an ISS docking port. Voss and Helms spent 8 hours and 56 minutes on their 
spacewalk, eclipsing the record of 8 hours and 29 minutes set in 1992. The U.S astronauts 
conducted complex work, involving a series of slow, deliberate maneuvers. NASA’s flight 
director commented that the lengthy endeavor required stamina, remarking that the spacewalk 
pushed the two astronauts “right to the edge” of what they could handle. Early in the spacewalk, 
Voss and Helms each mishandled pieces of equipment, causing one device to float off into space 
and slowing the process by about 1 hour.31 
 
13 March 
A team of astronomers released images taken by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, revealing 
that black holes are present throughout the universe, across space and time, more pervasively 
than previously estimated. The researchers had found that black holes were even more common 
millions of years ago than they are today. The scientists had used new x-ray technology to 
examine galaxies several billion years old. The research had focused on a small sliver of the 
skya deep fieldthat the Chandra X-ray Observatory had probed looking for black holes and 
other bodies. Based on the findings in the relatively small sampling, the researchers had 
estimated that the universe might contain as many as 300 million black holes. Chandra had 
captured images using exposure times of up to 10 days and focusing on the same region of the 
sky for more than one year. The astronomers believed that their new images had exposed the 
early history of the universe, perhaps traveling as far back in time as 90 percent of the way to the 
Big Bang. In examining this distant patch of sky, the researchers had discovered black holes of 
all types and masses.32 
 
14 March  
The first changing of the guard took place aboard the ISS Discovery when the crew of 
Expedition 2, which included astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms and cosmonaut Yury 
V. Usachev, replaced the first ISS research team, Expedition 1. The new crew planned to spend 
four and one-half months aboard the space station, with Usachev serving as the outpost’s 
Commander. With the official beginning of her mission on the ISS, Helms became the first long-
term female occupant of the space station. The new crew anticipated working well together, 
having trained as a unit for nearly four years. Because the first crew had completed many of the 
ISS’s final construction tasks, crew of Expedition 2 looked forward to having more research time 
than their predecessors had enjoyed.33 
 
NASA astronomers linked the world’s two largest telescopes, both located at the W. M. Keck 
Observatory in Hawaii. Using a process known as interferometry, the scientists used the two

telescopes to capture images of a faint star in the constellation Lynx. According to Anne L. 
Kinney, Director of NASA’s Astronomical Search for Origins program, “combining the light 
from the two largest telescopes on Earth is a fabulous technical advancement.” Using a tunnel 
that collects light waves that the telescopes have captured, to combine the images, the two 
telescopes worked together to allow astronomers to peer farther and more clearly into space than 
ever before. Scientists hailed the achievement as a significant step toward creating a new class of 
astronomical telescopes.34 
 
16 March  
NASA commemorated the 75th anniversary of the first successful launch of a liquid-fueled 
rocket. On 26 March 1926, Robert H. Goddard had launched a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long) 
rocket fueled by gasoline and liquid oxygen. The rocket flew just over 40 feet (12 meters) high 
using the same technology that would one day launch massive rockets carrying Space Shuttles 
and other research craft into space. NASA had named Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) after 
Robert H. Goddard. At the anniversary celebration, NASA’s Chief Historian Roger D. Launius 
called Goddard the forefather of American space exploration: “Dr. Goddard was a true visionary, 
having already visualized flight in outer space by the time he was 21.” Goddard had turned 21 in 
1903, some 50 years before space exploration began in earnest. Even 75 years after Goddard’s 
successful test, NASA continued to use liquid-propulsion systems to launch most of its 
spacecraft and satellites.35 
 
17 March 
Responding to the ongoing reductions in the budget for NASA and for the ISS, the Boeing 
Company announced that it would lay off 400 workers who had been working on the 
development of ISS modules, including those workers who would have built the living quarters 
for the space station’s researchers. At the time of Boeing’s cuts, NASA had trimmed nearly 
US$1 billion from its ISS funding.36 
 
19 March  
Russian cosmonauts training at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, staged 
a one-day walkout to protest NASA’s rejection of millionaire Dennis A. Tito as a member of the 
Russian crew that would travel aboard the Soyuz to the ISS on 30 April. Space enthusiast Dennis 
Tito had paid the cash-strapped Russian Space Agency a reported US$20 million to make the 
trip. Russia’s agreement with the untrained Tito had sparked debate over the proper use of the 
ISS and over so-called space tourism. Talgat A. Musabayev, the Kazakh cosmonaut who was to 
command Tito’s crew, removed his men from the training program in Houston after learning that 
NASA would not allow Tito to participate in the exercises. NASA argued that allowing a person 
who had not trained as an astronaut to travel to space would pose safety risks, especially since 
the ISS remained a work-in-progress. Russian officials contended that they had the right to

transport aboard their spacecraft any person they deemed fit for the mission. Both sides pledged 
to find a resolution to the disagreement.37 
 
21 March  
NASA announced that its X-40A aircraft, built by the Boeing Company and on loan from the 
U.S. Air Force, had successfully passed a test flight, giving the X-37 program a major boost. 
NASA had designed the X-37, a reusable craft that could launch into space and return safely, for 
use in testing NASA technologies. To test the flight-control system planned for the X-37, an 
Army Chinook helicopter lifted the X-40A aircraft to 15,000 feet (4,570 meters) and then 
released it to a safe landing. NASA’s director of the X-37 program called the successful test, “a 
cause for celebration,” saying that incremental tests on prototype airplanes would ultimately 
make the X-37 program both cost-efficient and successful. Scientists hailed the safe landing of 
the X-40A as a triumph of cooperation among the U.S. military, NASA, and the Boeing 
Company, with each of the three playing a vital role in the development of the successful craft.38 
 
Space Shuttle Discovery landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, returning to Earth 
the crew of Expedition 1―Commander William M. Shepherd, Flight Engineer Sergei K. 
Krikalev, and Soyuz Commander Yuri P. Gidzenko. The Expedition 1 crew had lived and 
worked aboard the ISS since 31 October 2000. Commander James D. Wetherbee and Pilot James 
M. Kelly guided Discovery to a smooth night landing, the 17th night landing in the history of the 
Space Shuttle program and the 12th in the history of KSC.39 
 
22 March  
Members of the Landsat 7 project, involving scientists from NASA and the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS), announced that, in the course of mapping Antarctica, the team had discovered a 
giant new crack in one of the world’s largest ice sheets. The team believed that the crack, formed 
within the past five weeks, would result in the calving of the Pine Island Glacier, creating a 
major new iceberg within 18 months. NASA had obtained the image from the Landsat 7 satellite, 
which had passed over Antarctica 16 times daily since its 1999 launch.40 
 
23 March  
After months of debate over whether Russia should bring Mir out of orbit and what damage the 
space station might cause when it fell to Earth, the 15-year-old Mir space station plunged into 
Earth’s atmosphere, spraying some of its remnants into the Pacific Ocean. The splashdown 
marked the end of a 2.2 billion-mile journey for Mir. Witnesses in Fiji reported seeing streaks of 
gold and silver lights across the sky when Mir fell, but nobody reported any damage from pieces 
of the falling space station. U.S. officials at the Pentagon tracked the descent, while Japan’s

public safety chief urged people to stay indoors to avoid falling debris. Anatoly Y. Solovyev, a 
Russian cosmonaut who had spent 651 days aboard Mir, remarked that he was sad to see the end 
of the pathbreaking space station: “An entire era of our Soviet space program is ending, into 
which we invested not only our money, but what is more important, our intellectual potential.” 
Once Mir had descended safely, officials of the Russian Space Agency praised the precise 
sequence of maneuvers that had brought the space station safely from orbit.41 
 
30 March  
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin received the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy 
presented by the National Space Club, one of the United States’ most prestigious space awards. 
Leaders from the aerospace industry, governmental space programs, and academics had selected 
Goldin for the award. “I am both honored and humbled by the award which validates and 
supports NASA’s continuing mission to pioneer the frontiers of space,” Goldin remarked upon 
receiving the honor.42 
 
APRIL 2001 
 
2 April 
NASA announced that astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) had discovered a 
supernova blast located farther away from Earth than any previously observed object. The 
discovery provided support for the theory that the universe might be expanding more rapidly 
than in the past. The supernova, approximately 10 billion light-years away from Earth, was 
relatively bright. According to Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute, the 
researcher who made the find, the discovery was significant because scientists would now be 
able, not only to observe the activities of the universe, but also to understand why it behaves as it 
does. “This supernova shows us the universe is behaving like a driver who slows down 
approaching a red stoplight and then hits the accelerator when the light turns green,” Riess 
explained.43 
 
3 April 
At 4:51 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), the Sun released one of the most powerful flares of 
the past 25 years. The flare originated from a region of the Sun known as active region 9393 and, 
almost immediately after its generation, began orbiting with the Sun. The flare, equal to the well-
known X-20 flare of 16 August 1989, resulted from an explosion within the Sun’s atmosphere. 
Both the 1989 and 2001 solar flares disrupted radio communications. The flare of 3 April 2001 
caused an R4 radio blackout on the sunlit side of Earth and released energy equal to 1 billion 
megatons (907 trillion tonnes or 907 quintillion kilograms) of TNT. Had it occurred on the side

smaller X-class flares, which occurred during the following days.44  
 
7 April  
The Mars Odyssey spacecraft launched successfully aboard a Delta 2 rocket. The craft, built by 
Lockheed Martin Space Systems and controlled by scientists at NASA’s JPL, had headed to orbit 
Mars in search of evidence of water on the Red Planet. NASA officials expected the trip to Mars 
to take more than six months and the data collection to continue for more than two years. NASA 
had designed Mars Odysseyequipping it with a thermal-emissions imaging system, a gamma-
ray spectrometer, and a radiation monitorto investigate further the question of whether Mars 
might have once supported life. By collecting data about the climate and geology of Mars’s 
surface, scientists hoped to explore theories regarding the planet’s seemingly harsh climate 
change. NASA and members of the scientific community watched the US$300 million craft 
closely, hoping for success. In 1999 Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander had both failed 
to accomplish their missions. Upon the successful launch, NASA’s chief Mars program scientist 
celebrated: “We’ve got a program! This is the next step . . . It’s kind of like setting off on the 
Lewis and Clark voyage across North America. We’re bound for a new frontier.”45 
 
18 April 
India successfully launched its first experimental geosynchronous satellite (GSAT-1) aboard the 
Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). The successful test suggested that India was 
poised to launch its own communication satellites. In a previous trial, India had halted a GSLV 
launch only moments before liftoff, when sensors indicated that the booster had insufficient 
power. Subsequent tests remedied the problem, enabling the successful 18 April launch. The 
Indian government praised the mission as the culmination of a decade of research and 
development aimed at achieving Indian launch capability.46 
 
19 April  
Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-100/ISS-6A launched into orbit carrying a Canadian-built robotic 
arm for the ISS and one of the most diverse crews ever assembled. The Canadian Space Agency 
had developed and built Canadarm2 at a cost of nearly US$1 billion. With a reach extending to 
57 feet (17 meters), Canadarm2 was the centerpiece of Canada’s contribution to the ISS. Once in 
place, the new robotic arm would allow the ISS crew to lift spacewalkers to every part of the 
ISS’s exterior to perform maintenance and repairs. During the mission, the crew planned to 
install the arm, as well as to transport to the ISS a logistics carrier developed by the Italian Space

Agency. The seven-person crew―Commander Kent V. Rominger, Pilot Jeffrey S. Ashby, and 
Mission Specialists Chris A. Hadfield, Scott E. Parazynski, John L. Phillips, Umberto Guidoni, 
and Yuri V. Lonchakov―included astronauts representing the space agencies of Canada, 
Europe, and Russia. STS-100 was the Shuttle’s fifth flight in six months, setting a record for the 
most spaceflights performed during such a short period in NASA’s history.47 
 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and President of the Italian Space Agency Sergio DeJulio 
signed a framework for cooperation agreement for the construction of the habitation module for 
the ISS. The ISS partners planned the module to house the ISS crew, providing a galley and a 
Treadmill Vibration Isolation System among other features. In exchange for designing and 
manufacturing the habitation module, the Italian Space Agency received a commitment from 
NASA to provide Italian astronauts with access to the Shuttle and the ISS, as well as to help train 
Italian astronauts for their time in space. The bilateral agreement continued the trend of 
cooperation among nations, making the ISS a truly international endeavor.48 
 
23 April 
The crews of Shuttle Endeavour and the ISS conducted the first successful test of the massive 
Canadarm2. Because of the size and weight of the robotic arm, the crew had never moved the 
completely assembled Canadarm2 until its arrival at the ISS. However, they installed the arm, 
composed of high-strength metals and weighing 3,618 pounds (1,640 kilograms), without any 
problems. Astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms, both in the middle of a four-month stay 
aboard the ISS, led the test of the new instrument. Voss explained that the robotic arm was vital 
to the station: “This was one of those linchpins that had to work, and it looks like it’s going to 
work. We’re looking forward to using it to keep building the station.” As testing continued, the 
ISS crew was troubled with some computer malfunctions. However, cooperating with NASA’s 
engineers, the astronauts eventually solved the problems.49 
 
NASA released the first images taken by the recently launched Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Headed 
for the Red Planet, Odyssey pointed its camera Earthward to take calibrating shots as it traveled 
around the South Pole. Among the first images the vessel captured were the first thermal-infrared 
views ever taken of Earth and its Moon. The photographs demonstrated the technological 
sophistication of the instruments for the mission to Mars, which allowed close observation, 
producing images even with very little available light. The clarity of the images of Earth, 
particularly those of Antarctica, boded well for the success of the Mars mission. Mars Odyssey

The ISS Partnership agreed to allow space tourist Dennis A. Tito to travel to the ISS aboard the 
Russian Soyuz TM-32, scheduled to launch at the end of April. The agreement among the space 
agencies of Canada, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States followed months of 
disagreement regarding the safety and propriety of allowing the wealthy American businessman 
to purchase passage into space for US$20 million. Without conferring with NASA or with other 
members of the ISS Partnership, the Russian Space Agency had made an agreement with Tito 
permitting him to take a place on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. NASA had protested against 
including an individual who was not a trained astronaut on the spaceflight at such an early point 
in the ISS’s development. After Russia had reached the agreement with Tito, he had undergone 
months of training. The ISS Partnership required Tito to sign a waiver absolving NASA of any 
liability for his safety and required him to promise that he would pay for anything he damaged. 
The ISS Partnership also announced plans to formalize the criteria for future visits to the 
station.51  
 
26 April 
Engineers at NASA’s KSC completed the installation of a new main engine for Space Shuttle 
Atlantis. Modifications of previous engine designs included a new high-pressure fuel turbopump, 
strengthened and made more durable by a casting process, rather than by welding. During the 
roughly 8½ minutes that the engines operate during a Shuttle launch, they must perform at 
temperatures reaching 6,000°F (3,300°C). The improvements continued NASA’s practice of 
regularly updating the Shuttle’s components.52 
 
28 April 
The Russian spacecraft Soyuz lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan propelled 
by a Soyuz-U rocket. The spacecraft carried one of the most controversial space travelers in 
historyAmerican businessman Dennis A. Tito. Tito had paid the Russian Space Agency for the 
opportunity to accompany cosmonauts Talgat A. Musabayev and Yuri M. Baturin on the mission 
to the ISS. Many space officials, regarding the endeavor as unsafe and capricious, had opposed 
Tito’s presence on the flight. Only days before the launch, Tito had gained the final approval of 
the consortium of nations building the ISS, becoming the highest profile space tourist to fly into 
orbit.53

At the American Physical Society Spring Meeting, a team of cosmologists announced that they 
had discovered the “music of creation,” using an extremely sensitive microwave telescope. The 
researchers presented their discovery of the sound waves that had rippled through the universe 
some 14 billion years ago. The team of the Balloon Observation of Millimetric Extragalactic 
Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) project had gathered the data from a telescope 
aboard a balloon, which circumnavigated Antarctica at an altitude of 23 miles (37 kilometers). 
According to Team Leader Paolo deBernardis, the beginning of the universe left behind a residue 
of light and sound, providing scientists with hints about the details of the Big Bang: “The early 
universe is full of sound waves compressing and rarefying matter and light, much like sound 
waves compress and rarefy air inside a flute or trumpet.” The BOOMERANG team’s findings 
provided a new means of examining the early universe and new evidence to use in calculating 
how it changed. Scientists praised the discoveries as “stunning and humbling” evidence that 
cosmologists were using the correct model to describe the early universe.54 
 
30 April 
The Soyuz spacecraft, carrying space enthusiast Dennis A. Tito, arrived safely at the ISS, having 
completed a two-day journey from Kazakhstan. The successful docking took place only 14 hours 
after Shuttle Endeavour left the ISS, with the crew having completed its mission of installing a 
Canadian-built robotic arm. Tito arrived at the ISS in good health. Appearing through grainy 
footage provided by the Russian Space Agency, Tito floated into the space station with arms 
outstretched and proclaimed, “I love space.” The Soyuz mission mandated that the Russian-
American crew remain aboard the ISS for six days.55

Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-100 landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California, when wind 
and rain caused the diversion of the Shuttle and its seven-person crew from its planned landing at 
NASA’s KSC in Florida. The completed mission had been unique, with NASA deliberately 
paring down its research goals because of the anticipated arrival during Endeavour’s stay at the 
ISS of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying space tourist Dennis A. Tito. Shuttle Commander 
Kent V. Rominger greeted the press upon landing, commenting on the crew’s installation of the 
ISS’s robotic arm and the computer problems that had plagued the space station during the visit. 
Rominger explained that he and the other astronauts had worked with 500 computer experts on 
the ground to achieve partial restoration of the ISS’s hard drives and software applications.56

A research team led by John Bally of the University of Colorado and Henry Throop of the 
Southwest Research Institute announced that the team had used the HST to observe the first 
direct evidence of the snowballing theory of planet birth. According to the scholars’ findings, 
later released in Science, dust grains in the midst of a cloud of dust and gas located in the Orion 
Nebula, which is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth, had accreted into a single nucleus 
of gas and dust, thereby forming an embryonic planet. The researchers observing the occurrence 
speculated that a similar process might have formed the known planets of the universe. In 
describing the volatile environment in which the snowballing process occurs, Throop used the 
analogy of “trying to build a skyscraper in the middle of a tornado.” The researchers surmised 
that, although snowballing may have caused many embryo planets to begin forming, the 
complete process of forming a full-fledged planet might have occurred more rarely than 
scientists previously had speculated.57 
 
8 May 
The American geosynchronous relay satellite XM 1, often referred to as Roll, launched into 
space aboard a Russian Zenit rocket, from a floating launchpad in the Pacific Ocean. The launch 
of Roll followed on the heels of the March 2001 delivery to space of XM 2, known as Rock. 
With both Rock and Roll in orbit, XM Satellite Radio became available to subscribing listeners 
in the United States. The president of the company XM Satellite Radio, based in Washington, 
DC, called Rock and Roll the “newest power couple” in Washington, DC, declaring that his firm 
was ready to compete with Sirius Radio for subscribers. Boeing Satellite Systems had designed 
and built the satellites.58 
 
NASA collaborated with George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute to host a 
symposium commemorating 40 years of human spaceflight, an era that had dawned with Alan B. 
Shepard Jr.’s 15-minute suborbital flight on 5 May 1961. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 
opened the conference, followed at the speaker’s podium by astronauts and space experts. The 
conference, “Looking Backward, Looking Forward,” provided a valuable forum, not only for 
discussing the accomplishments of the United States’ space program, but also for considering 
space exploration’s possible future evolution.59

soil. Using a system developed at NASA’s JPL, farmers would be able to access GPS data to 
locate points as small as 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide. Specifically, according to the 
agreement, NASA and John Deere’s NavCom Technology Inc. had created a partnership to 
explore further the uses of GPS in farming. Scientists in NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise 
believed that GPS might prove especially useful in the area of natural hazard monitoring, 
providing farmers with images of their land in the event of a tornado, fire, or other disaster. The 
pathbreaking agreement resulted from the activities of the Commercial Technology Office at 
JPL, which focused on exploring new ways that technologies developed by American space 
programs could benefit other American industries.60 
 
11 May  
With resident astronaut James S. Voss performing most of the work, the ISS crew completed 
repairs on the space station’s computers and installed a replacement for the most damaged of the 
three command and control machines. With the repairs completed, the ISS regained the 
unfettered ability to steer, regulate, and communicate for the first time since the computer 
breakdown had occurred during the installation of the Canadian robotic arm in April 2001. 
NASA experts believed that the complex computer problems had stemmed from a failed hard 
drive but could not rule out software problems as the root cause. The computer outages had 
delayed testing of the new 57-foot (17-meter) arm; NASA resumed the testing only after officials 
had determined that they had corrected the computer malfunctions.61 
 
17 May 
NASA announced the first significant group of awards for its Space Launch Initiative (SLI)a 
program dedicated to finding safer and more cost-effective modes of sending humans into space. 
NASA’s SLI board had awarded a total of US$767 million in contracts to 22 groups. NASA 
clarified that the purpose of the contracts was to find a long-term solution to replace the costly 
Shuttle program. Therefore, NASA intended that grantees focus on conceptual designs rather 
than on vehicle specifics. NASA had designed the program to facilitate the development of a 
new space vehicle by the middle of the 21st century. Those receiving the funds had to meet 
ambitious standards; NASA wanted awardees to design a craft that would be 10 times safer than 
the Space Shuttle, with 100 times higher rates of crew survival, at a 10th of the cost of the 
current Shuttle program. The SLI board had consulted more than 100 experts to determine which 
proposals should receive funding.62 
 
Continuing its effort to support science-related education, NASA announced that in May 2001 it 
would welcome to its facilities the first participants in the Undergraduate Student Research 
Program (USRP), designed to expose 100 students, selected from a pool of more than 1,000 
applicants, to the level of math, science, and technological research necessary to propel new 
discoveries in space exploration. The Virginia Space Grant Consortium coordinated the pilot

program would fuel increased interest in vital scientific fields.63 
 
An international team of astronomers presented compelling new evidence that comet impacts had 
played a significant role in the formation of life on Earth. The researchers, led by Michael J. 
Mumma of NASA’s GSFC and Hermann Boehnhardt, working at the European South 
Observatory in Chile, presented their findings in an issue of Science devoted to the burgeoning 
field of comet research. The astronomers had used orbiting space telescopes, as well as 
telescopes throughout the world, to provide unprecedented coverage of comets passing Earth. In 
the course of their observations, the team had witnessed the breakup of the Comet LINEAR, 
thereby gaining new knowledge about the organic materials contained in comets. This new 
understanding of the composition of comets led to new information about the impact of comets 
on Earthespecially during the collisions between comets and planets that occurred long ago. 
Mumma explained the significance of the new discoveries about the composition of comets: 
“The idea that comets seeded life on Earth with water and essential molecular building blocks is 
dramatic, and for the first time, we have seen a comet with the right composition to do the job.” 
The researchers concluded that comets had formed from dust, ice, and glass, and that, in 
colliding with other celestial bodies, comets had transferred fundamental building blocks to 
them.64 
 
21 May  
The Russian cargo craft Progress M1-6 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, 
carrying 2.5 tons (2.3 tonnes or 2,300 kilograms) of supplies for the ISS crew. Along with food, 
research materials, and a new computer system to replace the damaged control machines, the 
cargo carrier also hauled 1 ton (0.9 tonnes or 907 kilograms) of extra fuel to the space station, so 
that Progress M1-6 could push the ISS into a higher orbit. Russian Space Agency officials 
planned for the spacecraft to dock with the ISS two days after launch. The launch was the first 
using the newly improved Soyuz-FG rocket, a booster designed to use 5 percent less fuel than 
previous models.65 
 
24 May 
NASA announced the inauguration of a program focused on designing a probe that could collide 
with a comet traveling at speeds of more than 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) per hour. 
Researchers had created the Deep Impact Mission program in the belief that the collision might 
enable measurement of the materials comprising the comet. The plan called for a 770-pound 
(349-kilogram) impactor, featuring cameras and an infrared spectrometer, to collect data from 
the comet. NASA selected Michael A’Hearn of the University of Maryland as Project Leader, 
with NASA’s JPL and Ball Aerospace Technology Corporation as the designers of the probe. 
The effort targeted Comet Tempel 1, discovered in 1867, which orbits Earth every five and one-
half years. Following in the wake of several comet-related discoveries, the Deep Impact Mission

25 May 
Continuing to gather data long after it had completed its original mission, the Galileo spacecraft 
made the closest ever pass of Jupiter’s largest moon, Callisto. Although regarded as the ugly 
duckling of Jupiter’s moons because it does not appear to have ever had liquid water present, 
Callisto still interested scientists who hoped to gather enough data to determine the size and 
number of craters on the moon’s surface. In the days leading up to the close pass of Callisto, 
problems with Galileo’s cameras had worried NASA controllers. Galileo scientists had 
anticipated the complications, however, predicting that the flyby, within 100 miles (161 
kilometers) of the moon, would expose the probe to strong gravitational pulls and radiation belts. 
Galileo had originally begun orbiting Jupiter in 1995 and had already made 30 flybys of Jupiter’s 
largest moons.67

For the first time, NASA and the Canadian Space Agency made available the data gathered by 
the Terra spacecraft, carrying the technologically advanced Measurements of Pollution in the

meeting, revealed more clearly than any previous readings the presence of immense clouds of 
carbon monoxide over Africa and South America. The readings also charted dense air-pollution 
plumes over Southeast Asia. The MOPITT data pointed to natural factors such as forest fires, as 
well as human contributors such as industrial pollution, as causes of the increased carbon-
monoxide readings. The scientific community greeted the release of the new data, and the 
promise of more to come, with excitement, because the MOPITT data would be vital in the quest 
to understand Earth’s changing climate. According to one researcher who was already mining the 
MOPITT data for an extensive study, the new data had the potential “to improve our 
understanding of the linkages between air pollution and global environment change.”68

NASA announced that it would delay Shuttle Missions STS-104 and STS-105 for several weeks 
because of a series of computer problems on the ISS. The computer difficulties had limited the 
control of the new robotic arm delivered to the ISS in April 2001. Despite the efforts of the 
astronauts aboard the ISS and of hundreds of experts on the ground, the malfunctions had 
continued to render control of the Canadian-built robotic arm impossible. NASA officials had 
determined that, until the situation was resolved, NASA would have to delay an Atlantis mission, 
scheduled for 20 June, and a Discovery mission, scheduled for 12 July, both carrying cargo that

the arm must move. The delay also meant that the ISS crewYury V. Usachev, James S. Voss, 
and Susan J. Helmswould remain aboard ISS longer than originally planned.69 
 
Abe Silverstein, the former Director of NASA’s Lewis Research Center (LeRC), died at age 92. 
Silverstein’s work in the aerospace industry predated NASA itself; he had begun his research 
career in 1929, working for NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for 
Aeronautics. After serving in World War II, Silverstein had played a leading role in constructing 
the United States’ first supersonic propulsion wind tunnel. He had contributed to the Mercury 
and Apollo missions before 1969, when he assumed the head position at LeRC, today known as 
Glenn Research Center (GRC). During his career, Silverstein had received the Guggenheim 
Medal for “technical contributions and visionary leadership in advancing technology of aircraft 
and propulsion performance.” NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin called Silverstein one of 
NASA’s “true founding members,” who had made possible NASA’s robotic and human space 
programs. NASA also remembered Silverstein for his naming of the Mercury and Apollo 
missions. In addition, Silverstein had successfully promoted the liquid propulsion techniques 
pioneered at LeRC for use in the Apollo missions. Two sons and five grandchildren survived 
him.70 
 
2 June 
NASA, conducting a test over the Pacific Ocean, aborted a planned attempt at the speed record 
for aircraft when the Pegasus rocket carrying a prototype X-43A jet veered out of control. NASA 
had employed a B-52 to carry the X-43A and the Pegasus rocket to 45,000 feet, where the test 
was to begin. According to the plan, the plane would release the Pegasus, which would then 
carry the X-43A to 100,000 feet (30,500 meters) before releasing the jet. Instead, however, the 
Pegasus rocket had gone out of control almost immediately after its release. NASA spokesperson 
Alan Brown explained: “The Pegasus went out of control. It appeared parts were breaking off of 
it.” NASA ordered the Pegasus destroyed after only a few seconds, and the ensuing explosion 
resulted in the loss of the scramjet as well. NASA officials and flight enthusiasts had hoped that 
the US$185 million experimental plane would top speeds of Mach 7. Instead, engineers 
scrambled to determine the cause of the accident.71 
 
5 June 
At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, NASA scientists Patricia T. Boyd and Alan 
P. Smale, both working at NASA’s GSFC, announced that they had uncovered a predictable 
mathematical pattern governing the release of x-ray light from binary star systems. Boyd and 
Smale had tracked the emission of x-rays from three binary star systems over a period of several 
years, determining that the number of days between the low points of emission in each binary 
system was always based on multiples of a single constant number. The discovery countered the 
common perception among scientists that flares and bursts happen completely at random,

suggesting that a repeatable process occurs when swirling matter pours into a black hole, thereby 
creating an emission. According to Smale, the ongoing challenge would be to combine this 
knowledge of a pattern, while still considering the many random factors. “The interplay between 
periodic and random components in these systems is a puzzle,” Smale concluded.72 
 
6 June 
NASA announced several new findings made possible by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. 
Farhad Zadeh of Northwestern University had used Chandra to locate “a cauldron of 60 million 
degree gas enveloping a cluster of young stars.” The discovery marked the first time that 
scientists had located such high-energy x-rays surrounding young stars. Zadeh also noted that the 
newly discovered cluster, located some 25,000 light-years from Earth and estimated at 1 to 2 
million years old, had provided evidence in support of the theory that stellar winds generated by 
stars can produce very hot gas. In addition to Zadeh’s find, Andreas Zezas of the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced that his team of scientists had found new 
midmass black holes in several starburst galaxiesregions where stars form and explode 
frequently. Researchers had long hypothesized that such an environment might exist but had 
previously been able to locate only a few midmass black holes. Zezas credited the powerful 
Chandra X-ray Observatory with allowing astronomers to examine far-flung galaxies more 
closely than before. Kimberly A. Weaver of NASA’s GSFC, who had contributed to Zezas’s 
project, hypothesized that the concentration of midsize black holes could possibly lead 
eventually to the formation of a single, massive black hole.73 
 
7 June 
After months of deliberation and years of planning, NASA gave the official approval for 
developing a spacecraft for the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and 
Ranging (MESSENGER) mission. The plan called for the MESSENGER to launch in March 
2004 and to begin orbiting Mercury in April 2009. NASA selected Sean C. Solomon of the 
Carnegie Institution of Washington as the “principal investigator and lead scientist” for the 
mission, choosing the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University to build and 
operate the MESSENGER spacecraft. Preparations for the new mission had begun 26 years after 
NASA’s last spacecraft had circled the Mercury in a 1975 flyby producing data for half of the 
planet. Moreover, some officials viewed the MESSENGER mission as the resumption of a long-
stalled research endeavor. Solomon described the task ahead as “an opportunity to complete the 
detailed exploration of the inner solar system, on a planet where we’ve never even seen half the 
surface.”74 
 
NASA named Nelson H. Keeler Director of its Independent Verification and Validation Facility 
(IVVF) in Fairmont, West Virginia, giving Keeler the responsibility for safeguarding the 
facility’s mission-critical software. Keeler also assumed the task of evaluating the cost-
effectiveness of NASA’s technology and software. Before joining NASA, Keeler had served in

the U.S. Coast Guard, amassing more than 6,000 flight hours in search-and-rescue and law-
enforcement missions. During a stint at the U.S. Coast Guard’s Research and Development 
Center, he had won the Legion of Merit medal. Keeler had served in NASA’s Space Station 
Freedom program, in the NASA Office of Space Flight’s Advanced Launch Technology and 
Advanced Flight Systems programs, as well is in private industry, before becoming Director of 
the IVVF.75 
 
14 June 
Herbert V. Frey of NASA’s GSFC revealed a fundamental new finding about the complexion of 
Mars’s surface. According to Frey and his team of researchers, data gathered by Mars Global 
Surveyor had corrected a commonly held belief about the topography of the Red Planet and the 
age of its crust. Most scientists had believed that the crust covering the relatively smooth 
northern lowlands of the planet was much younger than that of the rest of the planet. However, 
Frey’s research using Surveyor’s pathbreaking instruments had shown that the lowlands are not 
actually smooth at all. Using the measurements obtained by the spacecraft’s laser altimeter, Frey 
and his team had documented more than 600 ancient craters lying just beneath a layer of dust on 
the lowlands, many of the craters larger than 30 miles (48 kilometers) in diameter. From this 
finding, the team had concluded that the crust of the northern lowlands is older than scientists 
had expected. According to James W. Head of Brown University, who was not a member of 
Frey’s research contingent, the findings would “push the reset button” on ideas about how Mars 
had evolved as a planet.76 
 
15 June 
Shang-Ping Xie of the University of Hawaii’s International Pacific Research Center and 
Meteorology Department and W. Timothy Liu of NASA’s JPL published in the journal Science 
the results of their study of Hawaii’s so-called tail, demonstrating that a strong ocean current 
connects Hawaii with Asia. The researchers had concluded that the current was the result of the 
wind whipping around the small Pacific Islands and creating wakes eastward toward Asia. 
Scientists had long recognized that the Hawaiian Islands cause an eastward current, but common 
knowledge had suggested that the current’ reaches less than 200 miles (322 kilometers). 
However, using data from NASA’s QuikSCAT satellite, the European Sensing Satellites, and the 
United States-Japan Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, Xie and Lie had traced the eastward-
flowing current farther, discovering that it actually extends nearly 5,000 miles (8,000 
kilometers). From an historical perspective, the discovery provided evidence in support of the 
tradition that early Hawaiian settlers had sailed to the islands from the Far East.77

Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES)which revealed shrinking glaciers, as well as the

most accurate global radiation measurements ever captured. Launched in December 1999, Terra 
monitored most of the world’s major glaciers. The CERES instruments had captured the high-
resolution images from 440 miles (708 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. Initial analysis of the 
new data had revealed that most glaciers had shrunk considerably since previously measured. For 
example, the glaciers in the mountains of Patagonia had receded about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) 
over the course of 13 years. CERES had also provided the first complete year of radiation 
readings since 1987, capturing readings from the May 2001 heat wave, which had produced 
record temperatures in the United States.78 
 
27 June 
An international team of astronomers led by Kailash C. Sahu of the Space Telescope Science 
Institute reported the discovery of what appeared to be planet-like celestial bodies clustered 
around a group of 10 million stars some 8,500 light-years from Earth. The team had used the 
HST to make their discovery, which formed the basis of their hypothesis that the strong 
gravitational force of the dense star cluster might have pulled the quasi-planets away from their 
parent stars. The researchers’ article in Nature prompted both skepticism and praise. Stephen P. 
Maran, an American Astronomical Society spokesperson, summarized the reason for the 
excitement surrounding the find: “If it is confirmed, the finding suggests there is something big 
here that we don’t understand.” In addition, Sahu’s research team reported that they had 
observed six microlensing events during their study, thereby focusing the attention of the 
scientific community on Albert Einstein’s theory of microlensing that the gravity of a celestial 
body can bend the light of a more distant object, thereby acting as a magnifying glass for space 
exploration.79 
 
John F. Yardley, who had worked at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, serving as the Launch 
Operation Manager for the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft and the Technical Director for the 
Gemini program before joining NASA in 1974, died at the age of 76. NASA had awarded 
Yardley its Public Service Medal in 1963 and in 1966 for his work on the Mercury and the 
Gemini. From 1981 to 1989, Yardley had been President of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics 
Company. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin called Yardley “as responsible as any 
individual for getting the Space Shuttle Program off the ground.80

The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) launched aboard a Delta 2 rocket from Cape

6 July 
Researchers based at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center announced that they had delineated 
the mechanism by which the universe favors matter instead of empty space. The team of 
scientists had used Stanford University’s 1,200-ton (1,090-tonne or 1.1 million-kilogram) 
particle detector to study the process of charge-party violation (CP violation) the interactions 
and relationships between matter and antimatter. Although scientists had long believed that 
matter and antimatter are distinctly different, obtaining proof of this had proved difficult. The 
new discovery provided significant support for the hypothesis, exciting the scientific community. 
As physicist Stewart Smith, spokesperson for the research group, explained: “After 37 years of 
searching for further examples of CP violation, physicists now know that there are at least two 
kinds of subatomic particles that exhibit this puzzling phenomenon, thought to be responsible for 
the great preponderance of matter in the universe.”82 
 
11 July  
NASA announced that images provided by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite 
(SWAS), which NASA had launched in December 1998, showed new evidence that extra-
planetary systems contain water. In particular, astronomers had studied the giant IRC+10216 
star, also known as CW Leonis, and had located water vapor surrounding the celestial body. 
Scientists had never considered the giant star, located some 500 light-years from Earth, as a 
likely host of water because of its high levels of carbon. Gary Melnick of the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led the SWAS study, which concluded that the most viable 
explanation for the “substantial concentrations of water vapor” around the star was that the star’s 
gravity had pulled the water vapor from the icy surfaces of nearby comets. The discovery had 
broad implications for scientists’ theories about how Earth might eventually end. “We think we 
are witnessing the type of apocalypse that will ultimately befall our own planetary system,” said 
one SWAS researcher. “Several billion years from now, the Sun will become a giant star and its 
power output will increase five thousand fold. As the luminosity of the Sun increases, a wave of 
water vaporization will spread outwards through the solar system, starting with Earth’s oceans 
and extending well beyond the orbit of Neptune.”83 
 
12 July 
Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-104/ISS7A lifted off from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
bound for the ISS. Steven W. Lindsay served as Flight Commander, Charles O. Hobaugh piloted 
the spacecraft, and Mission Specialists Janet L. Kavandi, Michael L. Gernhardt, and James F. 
Reilly rounded out the crew. The launch was the first using NASA’s upgraded hydrogen 
turbopumps in the Shuttle’s three main engines. The pump was the last in a series of Shuttle 
improvements that NASA had made to reduce maintenance and improve safety of the Shuttle.

The mission called for the astronauts to attach the new American-made Joint Airlock to the ISS 
and to conduct important repairs to the station during three separate spacewalks. The design of 
the new airlock permitted the ISS crew access to and from space, wearing either Russian or 
American spacesuits. During the days leading up to the launch, Mission Specialist Michael L. 
Gernhardt explained: “The term Joint Airlock means that it’s applicable to both the U.S. 
[space]suit, the EMU [Extravehicular Mobility Unit], and to the Russian suit, the Orlan suit. The 
main objectives of our flight are to install four High Pressure Gas Tanksthat would be two 
oxygen, two nitrogento activate and check out the airlock and then to make the first spacewalk 
from the Joint Airlock and demonstrate the viability of the whole process and sort of usher in the 
space station era of EVA.”84 
 
16 July 
Crew members of Space Shuttle Atlantis accomplished the primary objective of Mission STS-
104, successfully installing the Joint Airlock on the ISS. The crew used the space station’s 
massive, Canadian-made robotic arm, which had not operated properly for several months, to 
hoist the enormous entryway out of the Shuttle’s cargo bay and to move it into position for 
installation. Astronaut Susan J. Helms commanded the robotic arm, while spacewalking 
astronauts Michael L. Gernhardt and James F. Reilly helped line up the hatch for its final 
installation. The robotic arm successfully accomplished its first construction task, drawing 
applause from NASA’s Mission Control, as did the opening of the US$164 million Joint Airlock. 
Although the ISS Partnership planned improvements and additions to the space station far into 
the future, the mission marked the end of a major stage of assembly for the ISS.85 
 
19 July 
Daniel Wang, a University of Massachusetts professor and leader of a study team of 
astronomers, announced that his team had discovered a giant halo of hot gas spiraling a galaxy 
similar to the Milky Way and relatively near Earth. The researchers had used the Chandra X-ray 
Observatory and the HST to observe galaxy NGC 4631, some 25 million light-years from Earth. 
The discovery not only revealed the increasing power of the astronomical tools at the disposal of 
scientists, but also contributed to astronomers’ knowledge about the structure and evolution of 
galaxies. Wang explained the significance of the discovery: “Scientists have debated for over 40 
years whether the Milky Way has an extended corona, or halo, of hot gas . . . by studying similar 
galaxies like NGC 4631, we can get an idea of what’s going on within our own galaxy.” The 
study’s results also provided new information about how energy and mass spin around galaxies, 
as well as about the possible effects of rapid star formation.86 
 
Arthur F. Davidsen, an astrophysicist who had helped found the Space Telescope Science 
Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, died at age 57. Davidsen had

of his research on the missing mass or dark matter of the universe. His findings had led to the

development of the theory that, because of the reflecting light of other bodies, we are able to 
observe only about 1 percent of the universe’s matter. Davidsen’s work indicated that, although 
the remaining matter exists, it remains hidden from us. Not only had Davidsen led his colleagues 
in establishing the Space Telescope Science Institute, but he had also encouraged the Institute to 
participate in operating the HST. In his later years, Davidsen had even begun planning for the 
instrument that would eventually supplant the HST as the world’s foremost astronomical tool. 
Davidsen had trained at Princeton University and at the University of California at Berkeley. In 
1979 he had won the American Astronomical Society’s Helen B. Warner Prize for his work 
using a rocket to obtain the first ultraviolet spectrum of a quasar.87 
 
20 July 
NASA commemorated the 25th anniversary of Viking 1 Lander’s safe descent to the surface of 
Mars. The successful mission, marking the first time that humankind had sent a spacecraft to the 
Red Planet and the first landing of an American probe on another planet, inaugurated a series of 
research-oriented missions to Mars. In celebrating this banner day in its history, NASA looked 
forward to new challenges and opportunities for the study of Mars. NASA Administrator Daniel 
S. Goldin delivered a keynote address, “Continuing the QuestCelebrating Viking and Looking 
to the Future of Mars Exploration,” at the National Geographic Society’s Grosvenor Auditorium 
in Washington, DC. Viking 1 Lander had remained on Mars for six years, gathering images and 
data invaluable for scientists. Following up on the success of the first probe, Viking 2 Lander had 
arrived on Mars’s Plain of Utopia in September 1976. The two probes had taken more than 4,500 
pictures while slowly crawling over Mars’s surface. Perhaps as significant as the finds of Viking 
1 and 2 on Mars was the fact that the probes did not find any evidence of life on the Red Planet. 
NASA’s Langley Research Center (LaRC) had equipped both probes with biological sensors, 
setting a precedent for future probes to other planets to continue the search for signs of life 
outside of Earth. As NASA celebrated the pathbreaking Viking missions, the 2001 Mars 
Odyssey traveled toward the Red Planet to continue the tradition of exploring Mars’s hostile but 
fascinating landscape.88 
 
23 July 
In the midst of increased concerns over the long-term effects of the depletion of Earth’s ozone 
layer and concerns over global warming, scientists learned that Mars’s average global 
temperature had increased 50°F (10°C) in one month. A research team at Arizona State 
University analyzed and made public data that Mars Global Surveyor had collected, indicating 
the planet’s drastic change in climate. Scientists concluded that a massive dust storm, originating 
in Mars’s lower latitudes, had caused the increase in temperature. The researchers believed that 
the dust had trapped sunlight, eventually causing a heat wave to envelope the Red Planet; they 
predicted, however, that the planet’s temperature would cool when the dust particles began 
reflecting sunlight.89 
 
Diplomats from 178 nations reached a compromise agreement to enact the Kyoto Protocol, a 
pact designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, which scientists believed

were contributing to global warming. The United States, represented by Undersecretary of State 
Paula J. Dobriansky, had rejected the final agreement. Calling the agreement “fatally flawed,” 
President George W. Bush expressed concern over the effect of the treaty on the U.S. economy. 
Although Russia and Japan had also expressed major reservations, the two countries had 
eventually signed the Kyoto Protocol when negotiators included language in the final draft 
delaying the date of compliance. The treaty called for industrialized nations to limit the 
emissions released by automobiles, plants, and factories, but the mechanisms for enforcement 
defied easy solutions. However, according to final rules, each nation must reduce its carbon-
dioxide emissions or pay fines for violations. Nations throughout the world criticized the United 
States’ rejection of the treaty. For example, the chief negotiator for the European Union 
expressed disappointment at the United States’ decision, saying, “Almost every single country 
stayed in the protocol. There was one that said the Kyoto Protocol was flawed.” Although an 
international consensus had emerged, the treaty still required the ratification of the 55 nations 
responsible for 55 percent of the world’s carbon-dioxide emissions in 1990.90

After a one-day delay because of rain, Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-104 landed safely at KSC in 
Cape Canaveral, Florida, having completed its mission successfully. The crew had installed a 
new hatch, allowing spacewalkers easier access in and out of the ISS. Officially called the ISS 
Airlock and also known as the Joint Airlock, the new pressurized unit gave ISS spacewalkers a 
portal that oxygen-nitrogen tanks could quickly pressurize. NASA planned for all future 
spacewalks on ISS to begin and end at the new site. In addition to installing the airlock, 
Atlantis’s crew delivered to the ISS the EarthKAM, a new camera that U.S. high school and 
middle school students could direct from the ground, enabling them to take pictures of some 
2,000 points of interest on Earth, thus, participating in ISS research.91 
 
25 July  
Scientists at NASA’s JPL became the first researchers to observe a star spinning so rapidly that 
its midsection had stretched out. Using an ultra-high–resolution telescope located at Palomar 
Mountain in California, the JPL team measured the shape of the star Altair and found that it was 
not round. Although scientists had often suspected that the revolutions of a star might cause its 
shape to change, the JPL team was the first to take measurements to confirm the hypothesis. 
Altair’s diameter at its equator measured about 14 percent greater than the diameter at the poles. 
The findings had implications far beyond determining the shape of one star. As Charles A. 
Beichman, Chief Scientist on the project explained, “Determining the shape of another star helps 
us learn about the forces that control the shape and structure of all stars, including our star, the 
Sun. This tells us more about the Sun’s behavior and ultimate fate.”92

researchers had pioneered a new approach to stabilizing particles in fluids, a process they termed 
nanoparticle haloing. By suspending movement of fine particles in fluids such as paint, Lewis 
and her colleagues had succeeded in manipulating the complexion of the liquid. Perhaps of 
greater significance, they had been able to ensure that the fluid did not break down as quickly as 
it would have done otherwise. The researchers believed that nanoparticle haloing would have 
wide application, such as in making the fluids more useful and long lasting. As Lewis said, “This 
designer capability will assist us in developing improved materials.” NASA’s Office of 
Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) made the project possible, offering grants for studies 
that might benefit from the use of a microgravity or low-gravity environment to examine the 
fundamental states and characteristics of materials.93 
 
Russia launched the Coronas-F solar observatory satellite aboard a Tsiklon 3 rocket. The launch 
took place from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. Engineers had designed the 
satellite to monitor light intensity, solar bursts, and several solar radii. The satellite carried 13 
separate instruments, to gather data as the spacecraft orbited while pointing toward the Sun. The 
Coronas-F satellite was Russia’s second attempt to place in orbit such a complicated research 
craft. The Coronas-I, launched in 1994, had operated for only a couple of months before a 
control failure had caused it to lose its functionality.94

NASA and the National Commission for Space Activities of the Argentine Republic signed a 15-
year extension of an existing agreement on cooperation in civil uses of space. Originally signed 
in August 1991, the accord had established the framework for the United States and Argentina to 
collaborate on space research projects in fields such as Earth science and global climate 
change.95

NASA announced the selection of six new members and eight new consultants for the Aerospace 
Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP). The U.S. Congress had created ASAP to advise NASA on ways 
it could improve its safety performance, tasking ASAP with submitting annual reports of its 
findings to both NASA and Congress. The six newly selected members of the panel were Otto K. 
Goetz, Sidney M. Gutierrez, Shirley C. McCarty, J. Paul Reason, Roger D. Schaufele, and 
Robert B. Sieck. The new consultants were Wanda M. Austin, Richard R. Bruckman, Ulf G. 
Goranson, Bernard A. Harris Jr., Nancy G. Leveson, Forrest S. McCartney, and C. Julian May.96

NASA launched the Genesis solar research spacecraft from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 
Florida. Genesis would collect samples of solar wind to assist scientists in studies of the 
formation of Earth’s solar system. Scientists believed that the plasma in solar wind might contain 
material similar to or identical with the material that formed the solar system. The 633-kilogram 
(1,400-pound) spacecraft was equipped with four instruments: a wide-angle ion collector, a 
concentrated ion collector, an ion spectrometer, and an electron spectrometer. Donald S. Burnett 
of California Institute of Technology was Principal Investigator and Project Scientist for 
Genesis.97 
 
NASA suspended indefinitely the launch of the climate-monitoring satellite Triana, which 
NASA had designed to provide imagery of entire hemispheres from nearly 1 million miles away 
in space. By contrast, weather satellites often remain in low Earth orbit and, therefore, are only 
able to provide images of continents. Triana was also called GoreCam or GoreSat, because 
former Vice President Gore had originated the project. Gore had conceived of the satellite in 
March 1998, choosing to name it in honor of Rodrigo de Triana, the sailor on Columbus’s ship 
who had first sighted land. NASA had planned to launch the US$120 million Earth-observation 
satellite by the end of 2001. However, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives 
had voted to eliminate the project’s funding from NASA’s fiscal year (FY) 2000 appropriation. 
A conference committee of the House and the Senate had later agreed to suspend funding for 
Triana and to delay its launch, so that the National Academy of Sciences could review the 
project’s merits. Although the National Academy of Sciences had strongly endorsed the project, 
NASA had decided to shelve the satellite project indefinitely, as part of its effort to prioritize 
scientific expenditures and concentrate its resources on projects such as the HST and the ISS.98 
 
9 August 
NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed to allow the transport of space tourists to the ISS. 
Although the two agencies did not sign a formal agreement on the matter, media reported that 
they had agreed to the procedures and standards that spaceflight participantsindividuals who 
are not professional astronauts or cosmonautsmust satisfy when they visit the space station. 
NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed that such visitors must demonstrate foreign 
language ability, undergo specified physical training, and pass a personal suitability test. The 
issue of spaceflight participants had become a source of contention between NASA and the 
Russian Space Agency after American businessman Dennis A. Tito had paid the Russian Space 
Agency to transport him to the ISS in April 2001.99

10 August 
NASA launched Space Shuttle Discovery STS-105/ISS-7A.1 at 4:10 p.m. Central Daylight Time 
(CDT). Shuttle crew consisted of Mission Commander Scott J. Horowitz, Pilot Frederick W. 
“Rick” Sturckow, Mission Specialists Daniel T. Barr and Patrick G. Forrester; and Expedition 3 
crew members, Frank L. Culbertson Jr., Vladimir N. Dezhurov, and Mikhail Tyurin. One of the 
main purposes of the mission was to transport the Expedition 3 crew to the ISS, returning 
Expedition 2 crew members to Earth. Another objective was to use an Italian-built, 9,000-pound 
(4,100-kilogram) Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) called Leonardo to deliver supplies 
to the ISS. Leonardo would deliver six resupply stowage racks, four resupply stowage platforms, 
and two scientific experiment racks for the station’s laboratory. Discovery’s payload also 
included NASA’s scientific project, the Materials International Space Station Experiments 
(MISSE).100 
 
Gerard A. Kriss of Johns Hopkins University led a group of astronomers using NASA’s Far 
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite to obtain the best observations to date of 
helium gas remaining from the Big Bang. The observations provided information about the 
universe’s architecture millions of years ago, giving empirical support for theories about how 
matter in the expanding universe had condensed into a structure that permeated space between 
galaxies. The FUSE satellite had observed the light of the distant quasar HE2347-4342, and 
scientists had used the data it produced to make comparative analyses of the light’s absorption by 
helium and hydrogen gas on its trajectory to Earth. The astronomers had compared the ionization 
of the helium and hydrogen, the result of the gases’ absorption of light, to determine the most 
likely source of the energy that had heated the universe during its early formation. They 
concluded that, most likely, a combination of quasars and newly formed stars had produced the 
ionization of helium and hydrogen gases. Moreover, the presence of helium, in regions with no 
hydrogen, supported the theory that the universe’s architecture resulted from extensive 
gravitational instabilities during the chaos after the Big Bang.101 
 
14 August 
NASA’s Helios aircraft set a world record for the highest altitude ever attained by an aircraft 
without rocket power. The solar-powered, propeller-driven aircraft reached an altitude of 96,500 
feet (30,000 meters), eclipsing the previous record by more than 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). The 
remotely piloted aircraft took off from the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in 
Hawaii at 8:48 a.m. local time on 13 August, staying aloft for nearly 17 hours before landing at 
1:43 a.m. on 14 August. Fuel cells on the aircraft’s wings provided electrical power during the 
daylight hours, when the aircraft achieved the record altitude; at night, the plane’s propellers 
acted as generators, providing electrical power to control the aircraft. According to NASA, an 
aircraft operating at such an altitude would be able to monitor the environment, improve

15 August 
Astronomers led by Debra A. Fischer of the University of California at Berkeley announced the 
discovery of a planetary system similar to Earth’s solar system, located in the Big Dipper. The 
team of astronomers had found a planet about the size of Jupiter, orbiting the star 47 Ursae 
Majoris. Scientists had already known about one planet orbiting 47 Ursae Majoris, but the 
second planet’s discovery provided the first example of two planets orbiting in near-perfect 
circles around a single star outside of Earth’s solar system. Astronomers had previously 
discovered other planets orbiting stars outside of Earth’s solar system, but those planets either 
were orbiting perilously close to the host star or had eccentric orbits. The astronomers had used 
University of California’s Lick Observatory near Santa Cruz, California, to find the planets, 
which they had detected by observing the planets’ gravitational effects upon the star 47 Ursae 
Majoris.103 
 
16 August 
During the first spacewalk for Mission STS-105, astronauts Daniel T. Barry and Patrick F. 
Forrester affixed an ammonia coolant canister and two boxes containing hundreds of samples of 
prospective spacecraft materials to the exterior of the ISS. The ammonia canister would function 
as a backup coolant system in the event of a problem with the ISS’s primary coolant system. The 
samples, part of the MISSE experiment, would remain attached to the ISS for almost two years, 
so that scientists could examine how the materials performed during prolonged exposure to solar 
storms, cosmic radiation, and other aspects of the space environment. The experiment was a 
cooperative research effort of Boeing Phantom Works, the Materials Laboratory at the U.S. Air 
Force Research Library, and several NASA centers.104 
 
17 August 
NASA announced the selection of crew members for three missions to the ISS scheduled for 
2002. Mission STS-112, scheduled for launch in July 2002, would comprise Commander Jeffrey 
S. Ashby and crew members Sandra H. Magnus, Pamela A. Melroy, Piers J. Sellers, David A. 
Wolf, and Fyodor N. Yurchikhin. The crew for STS-113, scheduled to depart in August 2002, 
would consist of Commander James D. Wetherbee and crew members John Bennett Herrington, 
Michael Lopez-Alegria, and Christopher J. Loria. The mission would also transport Expedition 6 
crew members Valery G. Korzun, Sergei Y. Treschev, and Peggy A. Whitson to the ISS, 
returning to Earth Expedition 5 crew members Kenneth D. Bowersox, Nikolai M. Budarin, and 
Donald A. Thomas. Finally, the crew of STS-114 would include Commander Eileen M. Collins 
and crew members James M. Kelly, Soichi Noguchi, and Stephen K. Robinson. STS-114,

During the second spacewalk for Mission STS-105, astronauts Daniel T. Barry and Patrick G. 
Forrester attached two 45-foot (13.7-meter) power cables and two handrails to the exterior of the 
ISS’s Destiny laboratory module. The cables would provide a secondary power supply for a 44-
foot (13.4-meter) external truss, scheduled for installation in 2002. The truss, which would 
contain a satellite navigation system and other electronic components, would be the first of 
several parts of the ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure, which would support new components, such 
as solar arrays.106 
 
21 August 
The ISS Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force (IMCE) held its first meeting on 20 and 
21 August at NASA Headquarters. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had created the IMCE 
in July 2001 to consider the ISS program’s budget and management challenges and to determine 
a more efficient and effective method for NASA and its partners to construct the orbiting space 
station. Goldin had appointed A. Thomas Young, former president of Martin Marietta, to chair 
the 20-member Task Force, composed of Nobel Laureates and a highly regarded surgeon. In 
addition, a Financial Management Team and a Cost Analysis Support Team would support the 
IMCE in its efforts. On 1 November 2001, the Task Force would report its findings to the NASA 
Advisory Council, which would, in turn, present its recommendations to the NASA 
Administrator for NASA’s official response.107 
 
The Russian Space Agency launched a crewless logistics and resupply mission to the ISS. The 
Progress automatic cargo spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 
9:32 a.m., Universal Time (UT),108 on a Soyuz-U rocket. The mission, officially designated as 
M-45, carried to the ISS 2.5 tonnes (2,500 kilograms, 2.8 tons, or 5,512 pounds) of fuel, oxygen, 
equipment, and other supplies.109

Patrick G. Forrester had each performed two spacewalks to attach equipment to the exterior of 
the ISS, spending a total of 11 hours and 45 minutes outside the space station. STS-105’s total 
duration was 11 days, 21 hours, and 13 minutes.110 
 
29 August 
Japan’s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) launched the first of its HII-A vehicles 
at 4:00 p.m., Japan Standard Time (JST), from Tanegashima Space Center. The HII-A carried 
two payloads, the Doppler Ranging Equipment and the Laser Ranging Equipment, both 
instruments designed to monitor the rocket during and after launch. Observers regarded the 
launch as a major success for the Japanese space program, which had designed the rocket as the 
country’s primary large-scale launch vehicle.111 
 
31 August 
Scientists led by Ken Ebisawa of NASA’s GSFC published research that helped resolve a long-
standing question about whether the emission of x-rays from the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy 
was truly diffuse or derived from numerous discrete sources. The scientists had used the Chandra 
X-ray Observatory to carry out an unprecedented survey of a region of the galactic plane that had 
no known x-ray point sources, in the deepest examination ever made of hard x-rays in the region 
referred to as the zone of avoidance. Chandra had revealed 36 new x-ray point sources and an 
area of diffuse emission. Properties of the new point sources had indicated that they were 
probably located outside the Milky Way. In addition, Chandra’s survey had indicated that the 
diffuse x-ray emission revealed the galactic omnipresence of hot plasma with a higher energy 
density than any other substance in interstellar space.112

The National Academy of Sciences released a report criticizing a White House proposal 
directing NASA to assume responsibility for research in astronomy and astrophysics managed by 
the National Science Foundation (NSF). The White House had made the proposal as a cost-
reduction measure in its proposed budget for FY 2002. At the request of NASA and the NSF, a 
National Research Council (NRC) panel had assessed the proposal and concluded that NASA 
should not assume this responsibility. According to the panel, the NSF’s relations with the 
academic community and its commitments to investigator-initiated and interdisciplinary research 
made the NSF better suited than NASA to sponsor ground-based astronomy and astrophysics 
research. The panel also concluded that the federal government could maximize the benefits of 
astronomy and astrophysics research by creating an interagency astronomy and astrophysics 
planning board to develop an integrated research strategy. The NRC panel’s report suggested that 
such a strategy should include ways of supporting ground- and space-based facilities and

For the first time, astronomers detected a supermassive black hole consuming material in the 
Milky Way. Frederick K. Baganoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a team of 
scientists using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe a source of radio emissions 
called Sagittarius A* had noticed a rapid rise and decline in x-ray emissions in its vicinity. The 
scientists, who believed that Sagittarius A* is connected to a black hole in the center of the 
galaxy, speculated that the emissions emanate from matter falling into the black hole. The 
Chandra observations had provided the best view yet of the area just outside of the black hole’s 
event horizon―the point of no return for all matter falling into a black hole. The discovery 
added significantly to previous research indicating that the Milky Way Galaxy contains a black 
hole or some other large, dark object.114 
 
6 September 
Lockheed Martin confirmed that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) had decided not to fund 
the company’s development of the X-33 space plane, a possible replacement vehicle for the 
Space Shuttle. Since 1996, Lockheed Martin had been developing a pilotless prototype of the X-
33, a reusable spacecraft that would be able to launch without shedding fuel tanks or boosters 
and to land like an airplane. However, the development of lightweight fuel tanks had taken the 
project off schedule and over budget, and NASA had decided in March 2001 to forego continued 
funding for the X-33, although it was, reportedly, 75 percent complete. When Lockheed Martin 
had subsequently attempted to secure another government sponsor for the project, the U.S. Air 
Force had expressed interest in the project and submitted to the Pentagon a proposal to fund the 
space plane. However, the DOD had since determined that the project was too costly to 
undertake.115 
 
The U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Science, Technology, 
and Space held a hearing on safety and workforce issues related to NASA’s Space Shuttle 
Program. According to newspaper reports, much of the testimony addressed the effects of budget 
cuts on the safety improvements for the Space Shuttles. Subcommittee members and witnesses 
reportedly were critical of the budget cuts and concerned about their possibly detrimental effects 
on Shuttle safety. Individuals providing testimony at the hearing were NASA Deputy Associate 
Administrator William F. Readdy, Allen Li of the General Accounting Office (GAO), Michael 
James McCulley of United Space Alliance, Richard D. Blomberg, chair of the ASAP, and Bryan 
D. O’Connor, former chair of the NRC’s Committee on Space Shuttle Upgrades.116

11 September 
Terrorists hijacked four U.S. planes, subsequently crashing them in New York City, 
Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC. The incidents led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 people. The 
federal government immediately responded by grounding all commercial air traffic, and NASA 
closed its major facilities throughout the country.117 
 
13 September 
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta allowed commercial aircraft to resume 
flying in the national airspace system, the first time that the Department of Transportation had 
permitted aircraft to fly since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. However, Secretary 
Mineta also announced that the government would permit airports to reopen and flights to 
resume only on a case-by-case basis, pending airports’ implementation of stricter security 
measures. Before reopening, airports would have to clear all individuals from terminals and 
conduct security searches. After reopening, airports would have to increase the number of law 
enforcement personnel at their facilities. Secretary Mineta had made the decisions after 
consulting with the White House and with intelligence and law enforcement officials. On the 
previous day, he had only allowed aircraft to use the nation’s airspace if flight controllers had 
diverted them from their original destination or had repositioned them so that they could resume 
flying upon government approval.118 
 
14 September 
The Russian Space Agency launched a module of the ISS designed to expand the space station’s 
size and provide other capabilities. The module, called Docking Compartment One (DC-1) or 
Pirs (Russian for pier), launched at 11:44 p.m. (UT), on a Soyuz-U rocket, from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A cargo craft called Progress M-SO1 would transport the module to 
the ISS. The Russian Space Agency intended the DC-1 to provide additional stowage space for 
the ISS, an airlock for spacewalks, and an additional docking port for future Soyuz and Progress 
vehicles. The 8,000-pound (3,600-kilogram), 16-foot-long (4.9-meter-long) module would 
increase the total mass of the space station to 303,500 pounds (138,000 kilograms).119 
 
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta allowed privately owned and operated 
aircraft to use the nation’s airspace as part of a phased restoration of the national airspace 
system. However, the Department of Transportation would allow this category of aircraft―often 
referred to as general aviation―to resume flights only if they complied with certain restrictions. 
For example, general aviation flights would have to operate according to the Instrument Flight 
Rules, which required certified pilots to operate under direction from air traffic controllers 
subsequent to filing specific flight plans with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

In addition, the Department of Transportation would not permit general aviation flights to fly 
within 25 nautical miles of New York City or Washington, DC.120 
 
16 September 
A group of scientists led by Liming Zhou of Boston University published research indicating that 
substantial portions of the northern hemisphere had experienced effects of global warming. The 
scientists, who were studying the responses of vegetation to temperature changes, had used 
satellite data collected from July 1981 to December 1999 and had found a persistent increase in 
the length of the growing season in the majority of vegetated areas in the northern latitudes of 
Asia and Europe. A similar trend was evident in North America, but in a relatively lower 
proportion of land area. The data had also revealed declines in vegetated area in Alaska, Canada, 
and some parts of Asia, which may have resulted from temperature-induced drought in those 
areas. In addition, the scientists discovered a statistically significant relationship between 
changes in vegetated area and increasing land surface temperatures, indicating that climatic 
changes may have led to changes in vegetative activity in much of the world.121 
 
21 September 
A rocket carrying a NASA satellite and other payloads failed to reach orbit. The 91-foot (27.7-
meter) Taurus rocket launched at 11:49 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in California, and within minutes, NASA observed indications of problems with the 
rocket, including a skewed trajectory near the time of the first-stage separation. The rocket’s 
manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation was uncertain about the exact details of the launch 
problem but presumed that the rocket had not reached orbit. The rocket was carrying NASA’s 
ozone-analyzing Quick Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (QuikTOMS) satellite, a private 
imaging satellite called OrbView-4, and a private payload with the cremated remains of 
individuals who had paid to have their remains launched into orbit.122 
 
26 September 
At a news conference, NASA scientists announced the preliminary findings of Deep Space 1’s 
22 September flyby of Comet Borrelly, a type of comet that originates in a region near Pluto. 
NASA’s Deep Space 1 spacecraft, operating two years past its planned mission duration, had 
passed within 1,400 miles (2,250 kilometers) of Borrelly, returning the best images and data of a 
comet ever captured. The encounter was only the second time that a spacecraft had come within 
such a distance of a comet’s nucleus, as well as the first close flyby of a comet of Borrelly’s 
type. In 1986 ESA’s Giotto spacecraft had flown within 373 miles (600 kilometers) of Halley’s 
comet, which belongs to a category of comets that originate from outside Earth’s solar system. In 
addition, NASA scientists reported that the data captured by Deep Space 1 had substantially 
enhanced existing scientific knowledge of comets. Scientists found a number of Deep Space 1’s 
observations surprising, including the discoveries that the comet’s icy jets discharge in tall

27 September 
The New York Times revealed that, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the U.S. 
government had changed the rules of engagement regarding the circumstances in which the U.S. 
military could shoot down civilian aircraft. The newspaper had interviewed U.S. Air Force 
General Ralph E. Eberhart, who had provided some cursory details of the military’s rules of 
engagement for civilian aircraft. Before 11 September, the DOD had no formal rules concerning 
military engagement of a hijacked airplane when the flight had originated within the United 
States. However, on an unnamed date after 11 September, White House officials and the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff had approved new rules, stipulating that the U.S. military could down an aircraft 
that presented a security threat, but that the President of the United States or one of four specified 
U.S. Air Force generals must authorize such an action. The new rules also detailed measures 
taken by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the FAA for better 
joint surveillance of the nation’s airspace. Those measures included NORAD’s positioning of 
mobile ground radars around the country and a direct telephone line between the two agencies.124 
 
29 September 
NASA launched the Kodiak Star from Kodiak Island in Alaska at 2:40 a.m. (UT), NASA’s first 
mission ever launched into Earth orbit from that location. The Kodiak Star’s payload consisted 
of four small satellites: PCSAT, PICOSat 9, Sapphire, and Starshine 3. The PCSAT and 
Starshine 3 would serve amateur radio operators; Sapphire carried a voice synthesizer to convert 
text messages into human voice; and PICOSat 9 would test electronic components and systems 
in space conditions. NASA had funded the Starshine 3, and the DOD had sponsored the other 
three satellites.125

NASA announced the selection of Lockheed Martin to construct Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 
(MRO), scheduled to launch in August 2005. Under the US$145 million contract, Lockheed 
Martin would be responsible for building the orbiter and for integrating and testing six scientific 
instruments and two engineering payloads. In addition, Lockheed Martin would provide 
operations support for spacecraft during its five and one-half year mission. Odyssey, designed 
for low-altitude remote sensing of Mars, would include an atmospheric sounder; a context 
imager; a high-resolution camera; a shallow, subsurface, sounding radar; a visible, near-infrared 
imaging spectrometer; and a wide-angle color imager. NASA engineers planned to use 
Odyssey’s images to help determine landing sites for future Mars missions. NASA also planned

8 October 
Russian cosmonauts Vladimir N. Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin performed a spacewalk outside 
of the ISS, the first time ISS crew had walked in space without a Shuttle present. Two tethers 
attached each cosmonaut to the ISS as the pair departed and reentered the station through the 16-
foot (4.9-meter) Russian module Pirs, added to the ISS in September 2001. During the 5-hour 
spacewalk, the two cosmonauts hooked up a 40-foot (12.2-meter) crane, a ladder, handrails, and 
other equipment to the exterior of the ISS. American astronaut Frank L. Culbertson Jr. monitored 
the two cosmonauts’ work from inside the station, and Mission Control Center in Moscow 
supervised the spacewalk.127 
 
9 October 
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to former NASA 
scientist Wolfgang Ketterle and two other scientists, Eric A. Cornell and Carl E. Wieman. 
Ketterle was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Principal Investigator 
for NASA’s Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) in Washington, DC. The three 
scientists received the Nobel Prize for their work in discovering a new state of matter called 
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), named after the two physicists who had made the initial 
theoretical calculations of such matter. BEC consists of atomic particles that all have the same 
energy and that researchers can oscillate in a controlled manner. Cornell and Wieman had 
created a pure condensate of rubidium atoms, and Ketterle had independently produced BEC 
with sodium atoms. However, Ketterle’s condensates had also enabled further investigation of 
the new type of matter, because his condensates contained more atoms than those of Cornell and 
Wieman. In addition, Ketterle had produced other research that further advanced understanding 
of the phenomenon.128 
 
11 October 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced that, to honor the victims of the 11 September 
terrorist attacks, NASA would carry American flags into space and give the flags to survivors of 
the attacks and families of the victims. NASA called the memorial to the people who had lost 
their lives in the events of 11 September “Flags for Heroes and Families.” Space Shuttle 
Endeavour, scheduled to launch on 29 November 2001, would carry nearly 6,000 flags. NASA 
would later have the flags mounted on specially designed memorial certificates and would 
distribute them to survivors and to victims’ families.129

NASA revealed time-lapse images of the biggest dust storm on Mars to occur in nearly 30 years. 
The HST and Mars Global Surveyor had captured the images, which showed that the storms had 
begun as a local event in the Hellas region of Mars and had rapidly propagated throughout the 
planet. The storms had obscured the surface of Mars and dramatically affected temperatures in 
the planet’s atmosphere, including heating the upper portions of its atmosphere to as much as 
80°F (26.7°C). NASA scientists hoped that data about the storms would help them learn more 
about sediments on Mars, as well as helping them plan future missions to the Red Planet.130 
 
17 October 
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin announced his resignation, effective 17 November 2001. 
Goldin, who had become the head of NASA on 1 April 1992, was NASA’s longest-serving 
Administrator. During his tenure, Goldin had overseen numerous successes for NASA, including 
the launch of Mars Pathfinder, the repair of the HST, and the redesign of the ISS. Goldin stated 
that he was leaving for personal reasons and that he had accepted an interim position at the 
Council on Competitiveness, an organization promoting U.S. economic competitiveness, both at 
home and abroad. However, newspapers noted that Goldin had made the announcement during a 
time of budgetary difficulties for NASA. Moreover, media reported that White House officials 
had already sought candidates to replace Goldin, although, according to NASA, President 
George W. Bush had not yet selected his replacement.131 
 
NASA formally accepted the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite–H (TDRS-H) from Boeing 
Satellite Systems. TDRS-H was part of a constellation of satellites that formed a communication-
signal relay system, providing tracking and data-acquisition services between low Earth-orbiting 
spacecraft and ground-based control and data-processing facilities. The TDRS satellites served 
the HST, the ISS, and other NASA programs. Boeing had built TDRS-H under contract from 
NASA, which had launched the satellite in June 2000. However, NASA had delayed its formal 
acceptance of the spacecraft, after Boeing engineers had found that the satellite’s multiple-
access, phased-array antenna did not meet contractually specified performance standards. On 10 
August 2001, NASA and Boeing had announced that they had tentatively agreed to a settlement 
and were finalizing negotiations for NASA to accept the satellite.132 
 
20 October 
Scientists reported that, for the first time, they had used an innovative technique known as 
gravitational lensing, combined with data that telescopes had obtained, to observe light from 
extremely distant stars, which may have formed in the early stages of the universe’s creation. 
Gravitational lensing is a technique of detecting distant and otherwise unobservable objects by 
observing light from these distant background objects, while the gravity of galaxy clusters in the 
viewable foreground magnifies the background objects’ emitted light. The team of scientists, led

by Richard S. Ellis of the California Institute of Technology, had combined the natural 
magnifying power of galaxy cluster Abell 2218 with observations from the HST and the W. M. 
Keck Observatory in Hawaii to execute the technique successfully. As a result, the team had 
been able to detect faint light emitted by a small cluster of stars located nearly 13.4 billion light-
years from Earth. Based on detectable characteristics of the stars, the scientists believed that a 
star cluster in its early formation stages had produced the detected light, and that, during the 
early formation of the universe, the infant star cluster may have combined with other star groups 
to create galaxies.133 
 
21 October 
The Russian Space Agency launched the Soyuz TM-33 to the ISS on a Soyuz-U rocket from 
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 4 a.m. (CDT). The mission’s crew members consisted 
of Russian cosmonauts Viktor M. Afanasyez and Konstantin M. Kozeev and French astronaut 
Claudie André-Deshays Haigneré; Afanasyez was also Mission Commander. The spacecraft 
carried supplies and equipment for the ISS. The crew members planned to conduct joint 
operations and scientific research with the crew of Expedition 3. In addition, one of the main 
purposes of the mission, designated Soyuz 3 Taxi Flight, was to deliver the Soyuz spacecraft to 
the ISS, so that the ISS crew could use it as an emergency escape vehicle. The new Soyuz would 
remain at the ISS, and the spacecraft’s crew would return to Earth in the older Soyuz TM-32, 
which was already docked at the station.134 
 
22 October 
A team of European and American astronomers announced that they had obtained the first 
observations of energy leaving a black hole. The scientists, who had used ESA’s XMM-Newton 
satellite to observe a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxy MCG-6–30–15, had 
detected an x-ray glow emanating from iron gas that was moving at half the speed of the light 
that was close to the black hole. The scientists believed that the x-ray glow resulted from friction 
produced by matter rotating around a black hole before falling into it. Because the black hole’s 
gravity is sufficiently intense to wrap magnetic field lines around it, the entwined magnetic fields 
tighten around the black hole, slowing its rotation, and, as a result, increasing the temperature of 
the region surrounding the black hole. Observed gravity-stretching particles of light in the iron 
gas, the scientists had discovered unexpectedly that the total energy output of the gas was too 
high for only gravity and the descent of matter into the black hole to be providing the power 
source. The scientists had concluded that an additional power source must be increasing the 
energy output of the gas to the observed intensity.135

NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft maneuvered into Mars’s orbit after a six-month, 286 million-
mile (460 million-kilometer) voyage from Earth. Newspapers described the event as a major 
success for NASA, which had lost three previous spacecraft destined for Mars during the years 
from 1993 to 1999. NASA planned for Odyssey to orbit Mars for two and one-half years, 
mapping the mineral composition of Mars and searching for evidence of water ice beneath the 
planet’s surface. Toward the end of Odyssey’s orbital reconnaissance mission, the spacecraft 
would also function as a communications satellite for two robotic landers that NASA planned to 
launch to Mars in 2003.136 
 
26 October 
Spain’s Prince of Asturias Foundation granted the Prince of Asturias Award for International 
Cooperation to the ISS partnership, in recognition of the cooperation among the partnering space 
agencies that had created the orbiting space station. The Prince of Asturias Felipe de Borbón was 
the heir to the throne of Spain. The foundation granted the Award for International Cooperation 
to recognize the cultural, humanitarian, scientific, social, and technical efforts of individuals, 
groups, and institutions. The prince presented the award to officials representing the space 
agencies participating in the ISS, namely the Canadian Space Agency, ESA, NASA, Japan’s 
NASDA, and the Russian Space Agency. Earlier in the day, the prince had called the astronauts 
at the ISS to congratulate them on their efforts.137 
 
The Pentagon selected an international team of contractors, led by Lockheed Martin, to build the 
Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), a multi-role fighter plane that the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and other countries planned to use. The Pentagon planned for the JSF to function as a single, 
fungible, low-maintenance replacement for the various aircraft that different military branches in 
the United States and elsewhere had been using. The program, valued at approximately US$200 
billion, included three versions of the JSF, to fulfill the different requirements of the various 
military branches in the United States and Europe. All of the versions would have stealth and 
supersonic capabilities. BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman would initially 
produce 22 aircraft during the system design and development phase; the companies expected to 
construct nearly 3,000 aircraft under the program.138

The government of France named NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin as Officer of the 
Legion of Honor, the country’s highest award. Napoleon had created the Legion of Honor in 
1802 to honor civil and military service to France. The award honored Goldin for his 
contribution to the cooperation of France and the United States in space endeavors. NASA and 
the French space agency, Centre National d’Études Spatiales, had collaborated on Earth 
observation and Mars exploration, and French astronauts had flown on the Space Shuttle. 
Ambassador François Bujon de l’Éstang presented the award to Goldin at the residence of the 
French Ambassador.140

The Task Force assigned to assess NASA’s management of the ISS program released a report of 
its findings and recommendations. NASA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had 
established the ISS Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force to analyze the space 
station’s cost, budget, and management and to recommend how the numerous space agencies 
supporting the project could derive maximum benefit from their investment. The Task Force’s 
report stated that, although the ISS program’s technical achievements to date had been 
extraordinary, problems concerning the program’s budget, management, and other matters 
threatened future development of the ISS. In addition, the IMCE Task Force recommended 
numerous changes to establish a core-complete program for the ISS, including altering program 
management; identifying and applying additional funding; and implementing more clearly 
defined programs to build the ISS so that its crew would be able to conduct high-priority 
research at the space station. With regard to maximizing research under the proposed FY 2002 
budget, the Task Force recommended establishing research priorities, implementing a plan to 
execute them, and allocating more ISS crew time to high-priority research.141

increased, and the United States’ average temperatures had declined. Using data from satellites 
and 7,200 weather stations worldwide, NASA and NOAA scientists had found that the global 
mean surface air temperature had increased by 1ºF (0.6ºC) during the 20th century. However, 
temperatures had not increased consistently but had undergone successive periods of warming 
(from 1900 to 1940), cooling (1940 to 1965), and warming again (1965 to 2000). The evidence 
also indicated that these temperature changes had not been uniform throughout Earth. For 
example, although the average surface air temperature in the United States had increased during

the latter part of the 20th century, it had remained at a level comparable to average U.S. 
temperatures during the 1930s. In addition, the researchers had discovered evidence that humans 
had influenced surface air temperatures on a local scale in large urban areas, suburbs, and even in 
small towns. However, the data also indicated that this effect had been of modest magnitude and 
might reflect problems with data measurement.142 
 
6 November 
A group of scientists from Stanford University and NASA’s GSFC published research providing 
the first clear evidence of the causes of sunspots. Sunspots are large dark areas on the surface of 
the Sun that can last for weeks or longer. The scientists had used the Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory (SOHO)―a project of NASA and ESA―to conduct an acoustic tomography of a 
large sunspot on 18 June 1998. This technique, much like medical ultrasound diagnostics, had 
enabled the scientists to conduct subsurface observations of the sunspot, whereas previous 
research had relied only on surface observations. Researchers had already known that material 
flows out of sunspots and that the magnetic field below sunspots obstructs the upward flow of 
energy from the solar interior, thus making the sunspot cooler than its surroundings. However, 
the SOHO data revealed that material also flows into sunspots, because the cooler material at the 
sunspot’s top condenses and flows downward, pulling the surrounding plasma and magnetic field 
inward with it. This concentration of material leads to further cooling of plasma, which, in turn, 
flows downward and draws in more plasma in a self-perpetuating cycle. These findings also 
clarified the previously unexplained attraction of magnetic fields with like polarities in sunspots. 
This characteristic had puzzled scientists because such magnetic fields generally repel rather than 
draw towards each other.143 
 
7 November 
Scientists announced the first confirmed observation of the optical afterglow of a gamma-ray 
burst (GRB). GRBs are the most energetic phenomenon in the universe. NASA’s High Energy 
Transient Explorer (HETE) had observed a GRB―dubbed GRB 010921―occurring nearly 5 
billion light-years from Earth in the constellation Lacerta. The astronomers had coordinated the 
HETE data with observations that Italy’s BeppoSAX satellite and ESA’s Ulysses spacecraft had 
captured, enabling them to find the afterglow in optical light and to measure its redshift―the 
warping of electromagnetic radiation by gravity. The measurement of the redshift helped them 
determine the GRB’s distance from Earth. The observation was a special opportunity to obtain 
information on GRBs. Scientists hoped that with additional observations they could begin to 
understand the causes of this frequent, but enigmatic phenomenon.144

Maxwell W. Hunter II, one of the world’s leading rocket designers and space engineers, died at 
the age of 79. Hunter had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1944 and 
had worked for Douglas Aircraft. While at Douglas, he had designed several of the company’s 
missiles, including the Nike and the Thor, as well as many of its space projects, including the 
Delta rocket and the Saturn S-IV stage of the Apollo Moon rocket program. Hunter had later 
worked for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. Among his achievements with Lockheed 
was the design of the Space Shuttle. Hunter had also advised Presidents John F. Kennedy and 
President Lyndon B. Johnson on space programs and space policy and had been a noted 
proponent of nuclear-powered spacecraft and a space-based laser defense program. In addition, 
Hunter had authored nearly 60 technical papers and had received the National Space Society’s 
Wernher von Braun Memorial Award in recognition of his contributions to the development of 
missiles, rockets, and spaceflight.145 
 
12 November 
Two members of the ISS crew performed a spacewalk to complete installation of the Russian 
Pirs docking compartment. During the 5-hour spacewalk, American astronaut Frank L. 
Culbertson Jr. and Russian cosmonaut Vladimir N. Dezhurov connected communications cables 
between the Pirs module and the adjoining crew-habitation and command module. The pair also 
tested an external construction crane and photographed an askew solar array attached to the 
crew-habitation module, so that ground-based experts in Russia could determine whether the 
array would require repair in the future.146 
 
14 November 
President George W. Bush nominated Sean O’Keefe to succeed Daniel S. Goldin as NASA’s 
Administrator. At the time of his nomination, O’Keefe was Deputy Director of OMB and had 
previously served as Secretary of the Navy for former President George H. W. Bush. Major 
newspapers emphasized that O’Keefe had received the nomination because of his experience in 
financial management and that, during his tenure at OMB, O’Keefe had worked on a task force 
that had recommended scaling back the ISS because of NASA’s inability to manage the project 
within budget. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, O’Keefe, who was 45 years old at the time of the 
nomination, would be the youngest person to serve as NASA Administrator.147 
 
15 November 
Roy Estess, Acting Director of NASA’s JSC, appointed Randy Stone as Deputy Director of JSC. 
As Deputy Director, Stone would be responsible for planning, organizing, and controlling 
activities necessary to meet the Center’s goals and objectives. Stone had worked for Mission 
Control in Houston and for JSC for 34 years and, before his appointment as Deputy Director, had 
served as JSC’s Acting Associate Director of Management. He had begun his career with NASA 
in 1967, developing equipment for the lunar landings of the Apollo program. During his tenure

with NASA, he had worked on numerous programs, including Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and the 
ISS.148 
 
19 November 
NASA named Daniel R. Mulville as Acting Administrator, to serve until the U.S. Senate had 
officially confirmed a new Administrator. Mulville was to replace previous NASA Administrator 
Daniel S. Goldin while Sean O’Keefe―President George W. Bush’s nominee for the 
position―was awaiting Senate confirmation. Before becoming Acting Administrator, Mulville 
had served as Associate Deputy Administrator for NASA since the beginning of 2000. Mulville, 
who had a PhD in structural mechanics, had begun working at NASA in 1986.149 
 
26 November 
The Russian Space Agency launched an automatic cargo carrier to the ISS from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 6:24 p.m. (UT). A Soyuz-FG booster lifted the Progress M1-7 
cargo carrier. Progress M1-7 was to deliver 2.5 tonnes (2.8 tons or 5,511 pounds) of equipment, 
food, and fuel to the space station, as well as a microsatellite called Klibri, which the crew would 
release after the carrier had docked with the ISS.150 
 
27 November 
A team of astronomers using the HST published results of the first direct detection and chemical 
analysis of the atmosphere of a planet located outside of the solar system. The scientists had used 
Hubble to examine the planet’s atmosphere as it passed in front of its parent star―called HD 
209458―a technique that enabled them to see the star’s light filtered through the planet’s 
atmosphere. During the analysis, the astronomers had detected sodium in the planet’s 
atmosphere. They hoped that the observation was a harbinger of a new phase in analyses of 
extrasolar planets, often referred to as exoplanets. Scientists also hoped that this type of analysis 
would enable them to measure any unusual abundance of atmospheric gases created by living 
organisms, thereby offering them a method of acquiring direct evidence of life on other 
planets.151 
 
The GAO released a generally positive assessment of NASA’s efforts to meet its FY 2002 
performance planas required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 
1993and to overcome its major management challenges, which GAO and NASA’s Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) had previously identified. The GPRA required each government agency 
to develop an annual plan, which must include its performance goals, the resources required to 
achieve them, and the measures it would use to assess its performance. In its examination of 
NASA’s FY 2002 performance plan, GAO had determined that NASA had successfully met its 
stated goals. NASA’s goals for the fiscal year had included expanding commercial development 
of space and deploying and operating the ISS safely and cost-effectively. However, GAO’s

report also stated that NASA’s performance plan had not explained the reasons that NASA had 
changed its previous performance goals to those stated in the FY 2002 performance plan. In 
addition, GAO questioned NASA’s measurements of its performance in meeting the stated goals 
and gave mixed assessments of NASA’s performance in the areas of human-capital management 
and information security. In its response to the report, NASA concurred with GAO’s findings but 
it also defended the explanations and measurements of its performance goals, as outlined in its 
FY 2002 performance plan.152 
 
29 November 
Konrad Dennerl, of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, and his 
team of astronomers announced that they had performed the first x-ray observations of the planet 
Venus. The team had used NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to conduct the observations, 
which revealed new information about the planet’s atmosphere. The x-ray observations of Venus 
were different from views of the planet made in visible light, because fluorescence, rather than 
reflection, produced the x-rays from the planet. Most of the fluorescent x-rays come from oxygen 
and carbon atoms located 120 to 140 kilometers (74 to 87 miles) above the surface of Venus, 
whereas clouds that are 50 to 70 kilometers (31 to 43 miles) above the surface reflect optical 
light. The observations represented a technological breakthrough. Other x-ray astronomy 
satellites had been unable to point steadily in the direction of Venus, because the planet’s relative 
proximity to the Sun had prevented them from locking onto guide stars that were visually distinct 
from the Sun.153

3 December 
Cosmonauts Vladimir N. Dezhurov and Mikhail Tyurin performed a spacewalk outside of the 
ISS to clear an obstruction that had prevented the pilotless Progress Russian supply ship from 
docking securely to the space station. The crew believed that the obstruction was a rubber seal 
from a supply ship that had left the ISS on 22 November. NASA had delayed the launch of 
Space Shuttle Endeavour for five days because of concern that Endeavour’s arrival at the space 
station could cause the insecurely docked supply ship to wobble, possibly damaging the ISS. 
However, Dezhurov and Tyurin were able to remove the obstruction during their 3-hour 
spacewalk, thereby clearing the way for Endeavour to launch on 5 December.154 
 
5 December 
Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-108/UF-1 launched at 5:19 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) 
from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The crew members were Commander Dominic 
L. Gorie, Pilot Mark E. Kelly, and Mission Specialists Linda M. Godwin and Daniel M. Tani; 
and ISS Expedition 4 crew members, Daniel W. Bursch, Carl E. Walz, and Yuri I. Onufrienko. 
One of the main objectives of the mission was to transport the Expedition 4 crew to the ISS and

return Expedition 3 crew members to Earth. Another mission objective was to transport 
approximately 3 tons (2.7 tonnes or 2,700 kilograms) of supplies to the ISS. Much of the payload 
was contained in an Italian-built Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) called Raffaello. In 
addition, Endeavour carried a host of scientific payloads, including some experiments created by 
schools and universities in the United States and numerous other countries.155 
 
7 December 
NASA launched the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) 
spacecraft on a Delta 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The purpose of the 
mission was to study a region called the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere/Ionosphere 
(MLTI), located 40 to 110 miles (60 to 180 kilometers) above Earth. The Johns Hopkins 
University Applied Physics Laboratory had designed the spacecraft to produce the first set of 
comprehensive, global measurements of the MLTI, a region that scientists had not yet 
thoroughly analyzed, in which electrical currents surge and auroras create a glow over the 
northern and southern hemispheres of Earth. TIMED, which launched on the same rocket as the 
Jason-1 oceanography satellite, was the first in a series of six spacecraft that NASA intended to 
send to observe the MLTI from a 388-mile (625-kilometer) orbit of Earth. NASA’s GSFC would 
manage the TIMED spacecraft for the Office of Space Science in Washington, DC; the Johns 
Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory would operate the spacecraft for NASA during 
the mission.156 
 
NASA launched the Jason-1 oceanography satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California. The satellite launched on the same rocket as the TIMED spacecraft, but the two 
spacecraft were part of separate missions. Jason-1 belonged to a joint U.S.-French mission to 
monitor global climate interactions between Earth’s atmosphere and seas, continuing the mission 
that the TOPEX/Poseidon spacecraft had begun in 1992. The 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) Jason-
1 weighed about 1/5th of the TOPEX/Poseidon and carried its predecessor’s main 
instrument―the Poseidon 2 altimeter―as well as other, more advanced instruments that would 
provide Jason-1 with improved operational utility.157 
 
NASA researchers with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California 
at San Diego published research indicating that particles from human-produced pollution might 
significantly contribute to weakening the planet’s hydrological cycle. The hydrological cycle is 
the circulation of water between Earth’s atmosphere and its surface water and soils. Specifically, 
water precipitates from the atmosphere into surface water or soils and later evaporates from 
surface water, soils, and plants back into the atmosphere. The researchers had examined satellite 
data indicating aerosol distribution in the Indian Ocean region and had found that the aerosols,

primarily composed of black carbon, could weaken the hydrological cycle in two ways. The 
aerosols could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ocean, thereby decreasing the amount 
of water evaporating into the atmosphere. In addition, when particulates enter clouds, they 
reduce the size of cloud droplets, thereby reducing the amount of rain over polluted regions. The 
particulates in aerosols comprise a mixture of substances formed by the burning of fossil fuels 
and rural biomass. The new research was significant because it suggested that aerosols might be 
more environmentally harmful than scientists had previously understood and that air pollution is 
both an urban and a rural phenomenon.158 
 
10 December 
Endeavour crew members Linda M. Godwin and Daniel M. Tani completed a 4-hour spacewalk 
to repair the rotating mechanisms on the solar arrays attached to the outside of the ISS. The 
solar-powered module provided electrical power for the space station’s communications, life-
support, and steering systems, as well as for scientific experiments conducted aboard the ISS. 
However, flight-control personnel had found that the solar arrays were consuming more 
electrical power than expected. Project engineers attributed this to temperature-induced 
contraction and expansion in the bearings within the motors that rotated the solar arrays. 
Contraction and expansion was occurring because of the temperatures outside of the ISS, which 
ranged from 200ºF to 200º below 0ºF (93.3ºC to -128.9ºC), during each orbit of Earth. Therefore, 
Godwin and Tani were installing insulation around the motors in an effort to stop the bearings 
from undergoing contraction and expansion.159 
 
11 December 
Crew members aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour and the ISS held a brief ceremony to mark the 
three-month anniversary of the 11 September terrorist attacks. The tribute included playing both 
the Russian and U.S. national anthems in the Space Shuttle and at ISS Mission Control Centers 
at NASA’s JSC in Houston. Moreover, Endeavour carried U.S. flags and Marine Corps flags that 
had flown at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania State Capitol; shields 
and patches worn by New York City police officers; a New York Fire Department flag; and a 
poster with pictures of the firefighters who had died in the attacks. Also aboard the Shuttle were 
6,000 American flags, which Endeavour would return to Earth, and NASA would distribute to 
the victims of the 11 September terrorist attacks and their families.160 
 
17 December 
Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 12:55 p.m. 
(EST), bringing to an end Mission STS-108. During the mission, Endeavour had transported 
crew members of Expedition 4 to the ISS to begin their residency on the orbiting space station 
and had returned to Earth the Expedition 3 crew members, ending their 117-day stay aboard the 
ISS. In addition, astronauts Linda M. Godwin and Daniel M. Tani had completed numerous tasks 
during a 4-hour spacewalk, including installation of insulation on mechanisms that rotated the

station’s main solar arrays. The crews of Endeavour and the ISS had collectively transferred 
more than 5,000 pounds (2,270 kilograms) of crew provisions, experiments, and other supplies to 
the ISS from Endeavour’s mid-deck and from the Raffaello MPLM. The mission’s total duration 
had been 11 days, 19 hours, and 55 minutes.161 
 
18 December 
NASA officially ended the operation of spacecraft Deep Space 1 when engineers at NASA’s JPL 
sent a signal to the spacecraft to shut down its engine and cease communications with Earth. 
NASA had launched Deep Space 1 in October 1998, to test 12 technologies for use in future 
spacecraft. Although NASA had planned for the spacecraft’s mission to conclude in September 
1999, NASA had continued operating Deep Space 1 for more than two additional years with 
results that were highly beneficial and sometimes unexpected. Most notably, during a close flyby 
of the Comet Borrelly on 25 September 2001, Deep Space 1 had provided the most detailed 
pictures ever taken of a comet. In addition, experts stated that, at a cost of approximately 
US$160 million, the spacecraft’s mission had been the least expensive interplanetary mission 
ever conducted by the United States.162 
 
Researchers published findings from an unprecedented analysis of NASA-produced satellite data 
of carbon absorption by northern hemisphere forests. The researchers had used the satellite data 
to study the extent to which forests had absorbed carbon released into Earth’s atmosphere in the 
form of carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel combustion. Many scientists consider atmospheric 
accumulation of carbon dioxide to be a primary cause of global climate change, because forests 
act as “sinks,” absorbing carbon dioxide, thereby reducing its atmospheric accumulation. The 
researchers had found that forests in Europe, Russia, and the United States annually absorbed 
almost 700 million tonnes (771 million tons or 1.5 trillion pounds) of carbon from 1981 to 1999. 
They had also found geographic variations in carbon absorption, with Russian forests accounting 
for nearly 40 percent of the carbon sink and Canadian forests losing carbon. The findings were 
significant, because they indicated which forests had lost carbon and which had stored it. The 
findings also validated relationships between satellite measurements and ground-based 
measurements of carbon absorption, demonstrating the crucial importance of satellites in 
monitoring forests. NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise, dedicated to understanding human-
induced and natural changes in Earth’s environment, had funded the research.163

In a letter to Acting NASA Administrator Daniel Mulville, NASA Advisory Council (NAC) 
issued its recommendations on the management and future development of the ISS. NAC 
provided the recommendations two weeks after it had received an assessment created by the ISS 
Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force. NASA and the OMB had created the 
IMCE to perform an independent external review of the ISS. In its letter, NAC stated that NASA 
needed to resolve budgetary and management problems with the space station. NAC also

recommended that NASA clarify its scientific priorities for the ISS and focus on a reduced 
configuration of the ISS that could serve three crew members. However, NAC also 
recommended that NASA continue funding components of the ISS that could serve a larger 
crew, such as a lifeboat vehicle and crew quarters.164 
 
20 December 
The U.S. Senate confirmed Sean O’Keefe as NASA’s Administrator. With the confirmation, 
O’Keefe replaced Daniel S. Goldin as Administrator and, at the age of 45, became the youngest 
person ever to lead NASA. Before becoming NASA’s Administrator, O’Keefe had served as 
Deputy Director of OMB, a post he had held since March 2001. O’Keefe had also served as 
Secretary of the Navy under former President George H. W. Bush.165 
 
21 December 
NASA announced the selection of two missions as part of its Discovery Program, which had as 
its objective low-cost, highly focused scientific missions using innovative methods to enhance 
scientific understanding of the solar system. One of the missions NASA had selected was Dawn, 
a spacecraft that would orbit the solar system’s two largest asteroids, Vesta and Ceresto, to help 
scientists understand early planetary formation in the solar system. The other mission, Kepler, 
was a space-based telescope that would search for Earth-like planets outside of the solar system, 
to help scientists learn more about planetary formation and the possibility of life on other planets. 
NASA had selected the missions―both scheduled to launch in 2006―from a pool of 26 
proposals made earlier in 2001.166

Arnold Torres retired as Senior Manager of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) and Director 
of NASA’s GSFC Suborbital and Special Orbital Projects Directorate, positions that he had held 
since January 1995. Among the changes that had occurred under Torres’s tenure, WFF had 
begun to manage small payloads for Space Shuttles and had developed the Ultra-Long Duration 
Balloon (ULDB), capable of flying for 100 days. Torres had begun working at NASA in 1978 as 
an atmospheric scientist, and in 1985 GSFC had awarded him an Exceptional Achievement 
Award.167

Applications from 1982 to 1986, and in 1987 NASA had awarded him its Exceptional Service 
Medal. He had helped to establish and direct several programs at NASA, including missions to 
explore Mars and a program developing instruments for the HST. After leaving NASA, Edelson 
had managed the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite program, which had received 
international acclaim when it began measuring radiation from the Big Bang. Edelson had won 
several major awards, as well as the high regard of his peers and the public, for founding 
international space programs such as the Japan-United States Science Technology and Space 
Applications Program.168 
 
8 January 
Using images from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists found evidence that an 
ancient eruption had burst through a cluster of galaxies, which could explain why those galaxies 
act like massive magnetic fields. Scientists believed that the universe’s largest known structures 
bounded by gravity―called galaxy clusters―might be the source of highly energetic and 
recurring explosions, which cause the clusters to behave like huge cosmic magnets. Chandra’s 
images of the galaxy cluster Abell 2597 had revealed a cloud of hot gas with two dark circular 
cavities called ghost cavities, containing little x-ray or radio emissions. The images suggested 
that powerful explosions around a black hole in the cluster’s center might have occurred when 
these ghost cavities expelled material from the black hole’s vicinity, creating gaps in the cluster’s 
hot gas. Scientists believed that these cavities might eventually move to the edge of the cluster, 
similar to the movement of air bubbles to the surface of water, thereby transporting magnetic 
fields to the cluster gas. The images suggested that these explosions are recurring. If the 
recurring explosions continue to create more cavities, this could explain the strong magnetic field 
of the extremely hot gas throughout the cluster.169 
 
Using the most sensitive images ever taken by the HST, scientists found new evidence of star 
creation, challenging the findings of much of the existing research on the origin of the universe. 
Although the HST had captured images of portions of the skies that appear empty to the naked 
eye, the images revealed nearly 5,000 galaxies. Led by Kenneth M. Lanzetta of the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook, a team of scientists had examined approximately 150 of 
those galaxies spectroscopically, inferring from color variations their actual distance from Earth, 
as well as the properties of less visible light from even fainter and more distant galaxies. The 
scientists had also conducted spectroscopic analysis of remote quasars to measure the early 
universe’s gas density, because high gas density implies high creation rates of stars, which are 
the building blocks of galaxies and the birthplaces of solar systems. The new images indicated 
that countless stars had begun forming at a period closer to the birth of the universe than 
previous research had suggested. Although the HST had captured the images in 1995 and 1998, 
using the most advanced available technology, the findings suggested that the peak of star 
creation had occurred earlier than Hubble’s ability to detect it. However, the scientists believed 
that they could date the peak of star creation to within a few hundred million years after the Big 
Bang.170

Researchers at NASA’s JPL successfully demonstrated the first use of robotic rovers capable of 
cooperating to perform tasks together while navigating uneven natural terrain. The researchers 
hoped that the rovers would be able to perform sustained research on Mars and to assemble and 
maintain orbiting spacecraft. In outdoor tests, JPL researchers had used two rovers to simulate 
the deployment of a solar power station. In these simulations, the two robots had grasped and 
carried a container measuring 2.5 meters (8 feet) long, for more than 50 meters (160 feet). The 
project had used new software called the Control Architecture for Multi-Robot Planetary 
Outposts, which equipped the rovers with a distributed and autonomous intelligence producing 
instinctively reactive behaviors, shared sense and control, and collective decision making. This 
new technology, along with other innovations, had developed rovers―referred to as the Robotic 
Work Crew―capable of sharing both work and thinking. Project scientists hoped these 
capabilities would enable the rovers to collaborate in performing designated tasks, while coping 
with the unknown and unpredictable surface of Mars and encountering other scenarios 
unforeseen by scientists on Earth.171

In an article in the journal Nature, scientists reported that they had used images from NASA’s 
Chandra X-ray Observatory to reveal how objects in the most active area of the Milky Way 
Galaxy affect each other and other parts of the galaxy. The scientists had used 30 separate 
images from Chandra to construct a montage of the Milky Way’s central regions, revealing 
hundreds of white dwarf stars, neutron stars, and black holes, shrouded by the extremely hot gas 
around a massive black hole. The researchers found that emissions from highly ionized iron, 
previously attributed to diffuse hot gas, had actually originated from discrete sources in the 
Milky Way’s white dwarf stars, neutron stars, and black holes. The findings helped clarify the 
relative contributions of diffuse and discrete sources of x-rays emitted from the galaxy.172

NASA appointed John H. Campbell as Senior Manager at WFF and Director of GSFC Suborbital

NASA’s Galileo spacecraft took its last pictures, images of Io, a planet-sized moon orbiting 
Jupiter. Galileo had launched in 1989 from Space Shuttle Atlantis and had entered Jupiter’s orbit 
six years later. The spacecraft had eventually made 33 orbits around Jupiter, capturing nearly 
14,000 images of the planet and the objects around it.175 
 
18 January 
NASA and the USGS announced a partnership to acquire data from the Earth Observing-1 (EO-
1) satellite and to provide that data to the private sector for applications such as land-cover 
analysis, ecosystem monitoring, and petroleum prospecting. NASA and the USGS made the 
announcement one year after the launch of EO-1, a year in which the spacecraft’s nine 
breakthrough instruments had all successfully satisfied test objectives. The instruments included 
Earth-viewing technologies, such as a hyperspectral imager that could view Earth’s surface with 
unprecedented spectral discrimination and an Advanced Land Imager that could provide better 
views of Earth than NASA’s Landsat, at a lower cost. Under the terms of the agreement, NASA 
would maintain command and control of the EO-1, and the USGS would take orders for 
spacecraft data at prices set to cover the nearly US$5 million annual cost of operating the 
satellite, processing data, and interacting with customers.176 
 
21 January 
A NASA scientific balloon established a new flight-duration record of 31 days and 20 hours in a 
flight that included two orbits of the South Pole. The previous record for long-duration balloon 
flight was 26 days. Weighing 3,687 pounds (1,670 kilograms) and expanding to a diameter of 
nearly 424 feet (130 meters), the balloon was larger than a football field and taller than the 
Washington Monument but constructed of a polyethylene material of the same thickness as 
ordinary sandwich wrap. The pilotless, helium-filled balloon carried the 2-ton (1.8-tonne or 
1,814-kilogram) Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder (TIGER) experiment to approximately 
125,000 feet (38,000 meters), traveling nearly 8,800 miles (14,000 kilometers) before landing 
284 miles (4,460 kilometers) from its launch point in McMurdo Station, Antarctica. NASA had 
designed TIGER to search for the origin of cosmic rays and their propagation throughout the 
galaxy.177

Scientists from NASA’s JPL announced the release of high-resolution topographic data of the 
continental United States acquired during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) on 
Space Shuttle Endeavour in February 2000. Project scientists planned to process the digital-
elevation-model (DEM) data, sampled at an interval of one measurement every 30 meters (98 
feet), into the most detailed three-dimensional topographic maps ever made of Earth. The SRTM 
data would eventually include 1 trillion measurements, representing nearly 80 percent of Earth’s 
landmass between 60° north and 56° south of the equator, a mapped area in which nearly 95 
percent of the world’s population resides. SRTM project scientists anticipated that the maps 
produced from the mission would provide the most valuable and universally beneficial data 
produced by any scientific mission. Scientists would be able to use the data in applications 
ranging from flood control to transportation and urban planning.178 
 
29 January 
In a meeting with reporters, newly appointed NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe emphasized 
that, although he wanted NASA to remain at the forefront of science and technology, he also 
wanted to address NASA’s financial and management problems. O’Keefe, who had received the 
U.S. Senate’s confirmation on 20 December 2001, said he would spend the next few months 
learning about NASA. Explaining that he wanted both to refocus NASA and to keep it within its 
budget, O’Keefe did not rule out the possibility of closing field centers and laying off employees 
to achieve his objectives. However, he stressed that he considered the budgetary problems of the 
ISS his immediate concern, and that he would first devote his attention to implementing the ISS 
Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force’s (IMCE’s) recommendation to scale back the ISS, 
at least temporarily, to reduce costs.179 
 
30 January 
GAO released a report examining NASA’s established mechanisms for learning lessons from 
past failures. The report, “NASA: Better Mechanisms for Sharing Lessons Learned,” noted that 
NASA’s investigations of its past failures and its evaluations of its programs had led it to 
establish various mechanisms to ensure that NASA’s personnel had learned from past successes 
and failures and had applied their knowledge to future programs and projects. These mechanisms 
included a Web-based database of lessons learned, program reviews, and the development of a 
business strategy called knowledge management. However, GAO’s report also noted that, 
according to interviews with NASA managers, NASA’s established policies, procedures, and 
systems were not facilitating the use of lessons learned. GAO indicated that this was largely 
because managers faced challenges, such as lack of time to note, submit, and share lessons 
learned, and cultural barriers, such as reluctance to discuss mistakes for fear of their colleagues’ 
disapproval. Among the report’s main recommendations were that NASA develop a strong

NASA’s Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) reentered Earth’s atmosphere nearly 10 years 
after its launch on 7 July 1992. NASA had initially planned for the spacecraft to operate for 
only three years but had extended the EUVE’s scientific mission twice, ending operations on 
26 January 2001. The EUVE did not have an on-board propulsion system, and NASA scientists 
had not designed it to survive reentry intact. Thus, in February 2001, mission engineers had left 
the spacecraft in a decaying orbit, so that it would destruct upon reentering Earth’s atmosphere. 
The EUVE, the first astrophysics mission to explore the extreme ultraviolet spectrum (the 
energy range between 70 and 760 Å), had examined nearly 1,000 sources near Earth, including 
three-dozen objects outside of the Milky Way Galaxy.181

The United States, Russia, and other partners and sponsoring agencies of the ISS released a nine-
page document, “Principles Regarding Processes and Criteria for Selection, Assignment, 
Training and Certification of ISS (Expedition and Visiting) Crewmembers,” defining the 
partners’ agreed-upon procedures for staffing the ISS. Among the acceptable categories of ISS 
crew members, the international partners included nonprofessional spaceflight participants, such 
as American space tourist Dennis A. Tito, who had reportedly paid the Russian Space Agency 
US$12 to US$20 million to visit the ISS. Tito’s visit had created tension among ISS partners, 
who hoped that the new agreement would clarify the selection criteria for individuals traveling to 
the ISS, while continuing to enable space programs to raise funds from nonprofessional space 
travelers.182

imaging and spectroscopic instruments. Solar flares can release in a few minutes, or even just a 
few seconds, an amount of energy nearly equal to that released by the explosion of 1 billion 
megatons (907 trillion tonnes or 907 quintillion kilograms) of TNT, disrupting communications

manage the US$85 million mission, had designed the 645-pound (290-kilogram) probe.183 
 
The Office of Space Flight at NASA Headquarters decided that Palmdale Manufacturing Facility 
in California would no longer perform major modifications to Space Shuttle orbiters. Instead, 
NASA’s KSC, already responsible for preparing the Shuttles for launching, would also provide 
the modifications. The Palmdale facility had served as the manufacturing site for all orbiters 
since the Space Shuttle program’s inception, as well as providing periodic maintenance and 
safety upgrades. Based on cost and risk assessments, the Office of Space Flight had determined 
that maintaining two modification facilities for four Shuttle orbiters was no longer financially 
feasible, and that performing such work at KSC would minimize associated costs and risks. The 
change was part of NASA’s effort to absorb President George W. Bush’s proposed budget cuts. 
Because it overhauled one of the four Shuttle orbiters every two to three years, NASA estimated 
that transferring this work to KSC would save approximately US$30 million per overhaul.184 
 
7 February 
NASA awarded Boeing Information, Space, and Defense Systems a US$936 million 
modification to its contract for the ISS. Under the contract, which had commenced in 1995, 
Boeing was providing construction, integration, and operations for the ISS. The modification 
extended Boeing’s integration and operation work until 31 December 2003 and increased the 
total contract value to US$10.7 billion.185

Administrator Sean O’Keefe selected astronaut Shannon W. Lucid as NASA’s Chief Scientist. In 
this post, Lucid became responsible for ensuring that NASA’s programs were of scientific merit. 
At the time of the selection, Lucid was a spacecraft communicator supporting the Space Shuttle 
and ISS missions. A veteran of five Space Shuttle flights, Lucid had been one of the first six 
women selected to become an astronaut and the only woman awarded the Congressional Space 
Medal of Honor. Lucid replaced Kathie L. Olsen, who had occupied the position since May 
1999. Olsen had accepted an appointment as the Associate Director of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President.186

Scientists found that a bright blue ring of dust surrounds Earth’s solar system, beginning outside 
of Saturn’s orbit and extending beyond the orbit of Neptune. However, viewed from outside the 
solar system, this band of dust appears to surround the Sun. The discovery of the dust ring 
provided empirical support for the idea that this feature around a mature star indicates that the 
star harbors a planetary system. Therefore, researchers planning missions would be able, based 
on whether the star has a dust ring, to narrow down the list of which stars to study in their search

The United States and Europe began incorporating data about wind speed and direction into their 
operational global weather analysis and forecast systems. NASA’s Quick Scatterometer 
(QuikSCAT) spacecraft had gathered the data, which forecasters would use to predict, 6 to 12 
hours earlier than before, hazardous weather events occurring over the oceans. QuikSCAT was 
orbiting Earth every 100 minutes, using its SeaWinds scatterometer to collect approximately 
400,000 measurements over 90 percent of Earth’s surface within each 24-hour period. Although 
the spacecraft had launched in 1999, a series of collaborative research efforts, among 
organizations including NASA, NOAA, and numerous European agencies, had only recently 
enabled scientists to take advantage of the data’s full potential. The QuikSCAT program’s

Technology concerning NASA’s FY 2003 budget. Administrator O’Keefe also reported a recent 
independent audit of NASA’s finances, which NASA planned to release to the public the next 
day. According to newspaper reports, the lawmakers questioned O’Keefe in a tone that was 
frequently skeptical and even critical. At the time of O’Keefe’s testimony, NASA was already 
under public scrutiny regarding its budget overruns and financial accounting procedures, and 
critics had proposed reductions in its budget for human space travel.192 
 
For the first time, scientists made combined internal and external observations of Jupiter’s 
magnetosphere, the biggest object with distinct boundaries within the solar system. In the first 
conjunction of two spacecraft at an outer planet, the Galileo spacecraft conducted observations 
from inside Jupiter’s magnetosphere, a comet-shaped region of space filled by the planet’s 
magnetic field. Meanwhile, on the outside of the magnetosphere, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft 
monitored the effects of solar windparticles that flow from the Sun through the solar system. 
Scientists augmented the data gathered during these observations with data from near-
simultaneous observations collected from radio telescopes on Earth and from spacecraft orbiting 
Earth, namely the HST and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Researchers found that, although 
Jupiter’s magnetosphere deflects solar winds, shock waves carried by solar winds compress the 
magnetosphere, stimulate radio emissions from within it, and brighten auroras at the planet’s 
poles. The observations helped bolster researchers’ confidence in their understanding of Earth’s 
own protective magnetosphere.193 
 
Researchers using data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory found a substantial, pulsating 
source of x-rays in Jupiter’s atmosphere near the planet’s north magnetic pole. Existing theories 
could not explain either the pulsations or the location of the x-ray source. Scientists had posited 
that energetic oxygen and sulfur ions steadily precipitate from Jupiter’s inner magnetosphere, 
entering the planet’s polar regions and producing a northern aurora of x-rays. However, images 
from Chandra revealed that most of Jupiter’s northern auroral x-rays originate at latitudes that 
only ions precipitating from Jupiter’s outer magnetosphere could reach. In addition, researchers 
found that the hot-spot source of the x-rays was pulsating at 45-minute intervals, contradicting 
scientists’ theory that the x-ray emissions originate from a steady precipitation of ions in the 
inner magnetosphere. Although this discovery invalidated previous theories, scientists were not 
yet able to explain the process they had observed. Specifically, according to Chandra’s 
measurements, the researchers found insufficient energetic oxygen and sulfur ions within the 
required distance of the ion source―at least 30 times Jupiter’s radius―to account for the 
observed x-ray emissions.194

NASA released two reports of an audit conducted by the independent firm Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers, noting several problems with NASA’s system of financial management and record 
keeping. In one report, PricewaterhouseCoopers stated that NASA had not provided auditors 
with timely and sufficient documentary evidence of its financial transactions. Thus, auditors 
could not determine the accuracy and completeness of NASA’s reported financial obligations, 
expenses, and equipment, including those related to the ISS and Space Shuttle programs. The 
audit did not state that waste or fraud characterized NASA’s financial management; rather, the 
report concluded that NASA’s incomplete financial records obviated any definitive assessment 
of its finances. In the second report, the auditors enumerated several problems with NASA’s 
internal controls over financial reporting, but also stated that they would not provide an opinion 
on the merit of those internal controls.195 
 
MARCH 2002 
 
1 March 
Space Shuttle Columbia launched from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 6:22 a.m. 
(EST). Weather, mechanical issues, and other concerns had prompted NASA to postpone 
Columbia’s launch several times, from its original launch date of 19 November 2001. Officially 
designated STS-109, the mission’s objective was to service the HST, the fourth such mission 
(designated Mission SM3B) for the HST. The payload consisted of various technology updates 
for the HST, including a new camera and solar arrays. In addition, Columbia carried seven crew 
members: Mission Commander Scott D. Altman and astronauts Duane G. Carey, Nancy J. 
Currie, John M. Grunsfeld, Richard M. Linnehan, Michael J. Massimino, and James H. 
Newman.196 
 
ESA launched the environmental satellite Envisat on an Ariane-5 rocket. The primary mission of 
Envisat, designed to provide continuous monitoring of Earth’s atmosphere, ice caps, and land, 
was to measure sea color in coastal areas and in oceans. To perform this monitoring, Envisat was 
equipped with 10 optical and radar instruments, including the Advanced Synthetic Aperture 
Radar and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. ESA planned for the satellite to orbit 
Earth every 100 minutes, examining each region of Earth once every 35 days.197 
 
Engineers succeeded in returning NASA’s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) 
spacecraft to full operational status. Some of the satellite’s guidance components had failed in 
December 2001, and engineers had feared that the mission would terminate prematurely. Mission 
engineers on Earth had been able to revive FUSE with a new, innovative guidance system, which

used the satellite’s electromagnets to push and pull on Earth’s magnetic field, thereby pointing 
the satellite in the desired direction. Engineers had originally developed the innovative guidance 
system as a contingency for a failure of this type, but NASA had never before used the system to 
navigate a satellite with the accuracy required for scientific observations.198 
 
2 March 
Scientists with NASA’s JPL made contact with Pioneer 10, the first object made by humans to 
leave the solar system. NASA scientists had last made contact with the space probe on 9 July 
2001 but had lost contact with Pioneer 10 from August 2000 to April 2001. Pioneer 10, launched 
on 2 March 1972, had been the first spacecraft to pass through an asteroid belt, the first to make 
direct observations of Jupiter, and in 1983, became the first object made by humans to leave the 
solar system. After Pioneer 10’s mission had ended on 31 March 1997, scientists with JPL’s 
Deep Space Network had continued to track the spacecraft’s signal as part of a study of 
communications technology. In addition, NASA had used the probe for training flight controllers 
in the acquisition of radio signals from space.199 
 
8 March 
James Bock, an astrophysicist at NASA’s JPL, received the Presidential Early Career Award for 
Scientists and Engineers. Bock had begun his career with JPL in 1994, developing detectors and 
instruments for far-infrared, millimeter-wave astrophysics. The award is the U.S. government’s 
highest honor for scientists and engineers commencing their careers.200 
 
NASA successfully launched the second spacecraft for its Tracking and Data Relay Satellite 
(TDRS) fleetcalled the TDRS-9 or TDRS-Ifrom Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:59 p.m. 
(UT). The TDRS satellite system provided tracking and data-acquisition services between low 
Earth-orbiting spacecraft and ground-based control and data-processing facilities. In addition, the 
TDRS satellite system served numerous NASA programs, including the HST, the ISS, and the 
Space Shuttle. NASA had launched the first TDRS satellite in 1983.201 
 
9 March 
Crew of Space Shuttle Columbia STS-109 finished installing several new instruments on the 12-
year-old HST and sent the observatory back into orbit. During a series of five spacewalks 
conducted in as many days, Columbia’s crew had installed a new power-shunting unit, an 
improved solar panel, and a cooling unit that would restore the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-
Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) to operational status. In addition, Columbia’s crew had installed

give the telescope unprecedented ability to observe distant galaxies and other objects.202 
 
12 March 
Space Shuttle Columbia STS-109 landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 4:32 
a.m. (EST). During the 11-day mission, the Shuttle crew had conducted five spacewalks and 
performed several significant modifications of the HST, including the installation of an ACS and 
an experimental cryocooler, which had restored the operation of the NICMOS. The mission’s 
total duration was 10 days, 22 hours, and 11 minutes.203 
 
13 March 
The White House informed NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe that it was withdrawing Major 
General Charles F. Bolden as its nominee for NASA’s Deputy Administrator. According to a 
White House spokesperson, President George W. Bush had withdrawn the nomination so that 
Bolden could serve the military in the war on terrorism. At the time of the nomination, Bolden, a 
former astronaut, was the commanding general for the Third U.S. Marine Aircraft Wing, which 
had nearly 11,000 U.S. Marines in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.204 
 
17 March 
Two spacecraft comprising the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) launched 
on a single rocket vehicle from Russia’s Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The five-year mission’s main 
purpose was to map variations in Earth’s gravity field, using the GPS and a microwave ranging 
system to measure the distance between the mission’s two identical satellites―nicknamed Tom 
and Jerry. The two craft were to monitor each other while flying in a polar orbit 500 kilometers 
(311 miles) above Earth. This mission, to study measurements of gravity variations, could help 
scientists understand better the changes in the transport of mass around the planet. Changes in 
mass, such as ocean currents, ground-water storage, and mass within Earth, can affect climate 
and other aspects of the planet’s environment. The GRACE mission was a partnership between 
NASA and the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (the German Aerospace Center).205 
 
18 March 
Citing terrorism concerns, NASA officials stated that NASA planned to change the manner in 
which it released information about launch times to the public. NASA officials said that NASA 
would no longer publicize launch times until 24 hours before liftoff, at which time NASA would 
announce a 4-hour time slot during which liftoff would occur. The change was a reversal of 
NASA’s previous practice of announcing specific launch times months in advance of liftoff.206

NASA announced the assignment of three crew members to begin training for the ninth 
expedition to the ISS. The three were Station Commander Gennady I. Padalka and crew 
members E. Michael Fincke and Oleg D. Kononenko. NASA assigned American astronaut 
Daniel M. Tani to serve as backup for his fellow compatriot Fincke and selected cosmonauts 
Alexander F. Poleschuk and Roman Y. Romanenko to serve as backups for fellow Russians 
Kononenko and Padalka.207

The U.S. House Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Efficiency, Financial 
Management, and Intergovernmental Relations held a hearing, “Financial Management at 
NASA: What Went Wrong?” Stephen Varholy and Alan Lamoreaux of NASA and Gregory D. 
Kutz and Allen Li of GAO provided testimony to the Subcommittee. The hearing focused on 
NASA’s methods of financial accounting and on the role of its former auditor, Arthur Andersen 
LLP, in assessing those methods. Kutz reported that NASA’s system of accounting had made it 
difficult for GAO to assess NASA’s financial records and questioned Arthur Andersen LLP’s 
ability to assess those records accurately.208

Thomas J. Kelly, designated by NASA as father of the lunar module, died at the age of 72 in 
Cutchogue, New York. Kelly had led a team of engineers at Grumman Aircraft Corporation in 
designing and building the Lunar Excursion Module known as the Eagle. Apollo 11 astronauts 
had used the Eagle to land on the Moon and to return to the orbiting command module for the 
trip back to Earth. In 1972 NASA had awarded Kelly with its Distinguished Public Service 
Medal for his work on the Apollo program. Kelly’s wife, six children, and 10 grandchildren 
survived him.209 
 
27 March 
The National Weather Service Aviation Weather Center in Kansas City, Missouri, placed in 
operation a computer-based warning system called the Current Icing Potential (CIP), designed to 
alert aviation controllers to the potential for icing along flight routes. The National Center for 
Atmospheric Research had developed the warning system with funding from the FAA. The CIP 
used information from satellite data, ground observations, and other sources to produce 
information on the likelihood of airplanes experiencing icing along flight routes. The FAA had 
supported the development of the CIP to improve flight planning and aircraft safety.210

expected the task force, designated the Research Maximization and Prioritization Task Force 
(ReMAP), to recommend strategies the OBPR could use to achieve its research goals and still 
remain within President George W. Bush’s requested budget. In addition, O’Keefe requested the 
task force to offer assessments and recommendations to guide NASA in maximizing the 
scientific returns of the ISS’s missions and of its other programs. O’Keefe selected Rae Silver, 
the Helene L. and Mark N. Kaplan Professor of Natural and Physical Sciences at Columbia 
University, as the chairperson of ReMAP.211

Jefferson Davis Howell Jr. became the eighth Director of NASA’s JSC, replacing Acting 
Director Roy S. Estess, who resumed his position as Director of NASA’s Stennis Space Center 
(SSC). Before assuming the post, Howell had worked for Science Applications International 
Corporation (SAIC) administering its safety, reliability, and quality-assurance contract with 
NASA, to provide safety and mission assurance for the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.212 
 
4 April 
In an article in the journal Nature, astronomers at ESA reported that they had found evidence 
indicating which specific type of stellar object produces gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the 
universe’s most energetic phenomena. Prevailing hypotheses had posited that, either GRBs 
originate from the merger of two neutron stars, or they form from the collapse of one massive 
star, but researchers had discovered no conclusive proof to support either of these ideas. 
However, based on their analysis of the speed, temperature, and chemical elements of a GRB 
that had occurred on 11 December 2001, ESA astronomers found evidence supporting the latter 
hypothesis. The research team examined two sequential observations of the GRB, both taken by 
ESA satellites: the BeppoSAX satellite had made the first observation, and, nearly 11 hours later, 
the XMM-Newton satellite had made the second. The team had found large quantities of argon, 
calcium, magnesium, silicon, and sulphur, moving at 1/10th the speed of light. These findings 
supported the idea that a supernova explosion from a single massive star produces GRBs. If the 
merger of two neutron stars had produced the burst, astronomers would have expected the stars 
to produce large amounts of elements other than those observed―particularly iron―and to emit 
those elements at a slower velocity.213 
 
5 April 
NASA’s JPL researchers identified a 1-kilometer-long (0.62-mile-long) asteroid that might 
possibly crash into Earth in the future―although such an event would be highly unlikely. In the 
report published in the journal Science, the scientists suggested that asteroid 1950 DA would 
come close to Earth in 2880, but that the probability of a collision would be low. The study had

incorporated radar and optical measurements of the asteroid collected over 51 years and had used 
analytical techniques unprecedented in asteroid-trajectory predictions and hazard studies. Based 
on their analysis, JPL scientists had identified a 20-minute window on 16 March 2880, in which 
“there could be a non-negligible probability of the 1-kilometer [0.62-mile] object colliding with 
Earth.” However, they clarified that the odds of a collision were at most 1 in 300 and possibly 
even more remote, considering how little they knew about the asteroid. The research results 
indicated that, despite the remote possibility of such a collision, 1950 DA poses a relatively 
greater potential hazard to Earth than any other known asteroid.214 
 
8 April 
Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-110 lifted off at 4:44 p.m. (EST) from NASA’s KSC in Cape 
Canaveral, Florida. The object of STS-110/ISS Assembly Flight 8A was to attach to the ISS a 
43-foot-long (13-meter-long) truss structure called the Starboard Zero (S Zero or S0). The 
mission’s payload included several science payloads, the S0 Truss, and the Mobile Transporter 
(MT). NASA had designed the MT to move the completed truss and to act as a work platform for 
a mechanical arm, which the crew would install in the future. The crew included Mission 
Commander Michael J. Bloomfield and astronauts Stephen N. Frick, Lee M. E. Morin, Ellen 
Ochoa, Jerry L. Ross, Steven L. Smith, and Rex J. Walheim.215 
 
10 April 
Two separate teams of astronomers reported that NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the 
HST had observed two stars, possibly composed of a form of matter unknown to scientists. 
Researchers examining data from Chandra and the HST had noted that the neutron star RX 
J1856.5–3754 was far smaller than expected and, therefore, had concluded that the star might be 
composed, not of neutrons, but of quarkscomponents of protons and neutrons that scientists 
had never before observed outside of the nucleus of an atom in laboratories on Earth. Another 
team of astronomers had analyzed Chandra’s observations of neutron star 3C 58 and had found 
that the star’s temperature was less than 1,000,000°C (1,800,032°F), a far lower temperature than 
scientists would expect for a star composed of pure neutrons. Thus, that star also appeared to be 
composed, either of quarks, or of another form of matter unknown to scientists.216 
 
In a letter to the congressional committees overseeing NASA’s budget requests, the GAO stated 
that it could not verify NASA’s accounting of amounts charged against cost limits for the ISS 
and Space Shuttle programs, as reported to Congress in NASA’s FY 2003 budget. Federal law 
required GAO to provide verification of these amounts to the U.S. House Committee on Science 
and Technology and to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
However, GAO said that NASA’s lack of an integrated financial management system had

prevented NASA from providing GAO with details of costs charged against these programs. 
GAO reported that NASA’s 10 centers operated separate accounting systems, each with its own 
policies and practices, and that some centers could not provide complete and detailed 
documentation of accounts covering several fiscal years. GAO also reported that NASA officials 
had responded that NASA’s accounts were verifiable, stating that the verification problems lay in 
GAO’s auditing methodology rather than in NASA’s system of accounting.217

Astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-110 attached a 44-foot (13-meter) truss, 
containing computers, coolant lines, electrical cables, and other components to the ISS. The 
27,000-pound (12,250-kilogram) beam, dubbed Starboard Zero or S0, was the first of nine truss 
segments that would form a 356-foot (110-meter) exterior spine, supporting new solar arrays, 
heat radiators, and laboratory modules. The installation, involving the first use of the 58-foot 
(18-meter), Canadian-built robotic arm designed for the station, required two separate 
spacewalks, performed by two different pairs of astronauts.218 
 
U.S. Navy officials announced that the Navy had been using NASA satellite data in combat, the 
first time the military had done so. The officials stated that the Navy had used unclassified 
NASA data to help guide ships and planes engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan. Major 
media reported that members of Congress had voiced mixed reactions to the announcement, with 
some members expressing their concern that the cooperation between NASA and the military 
would overstep the bounds of NASA’s civilian charter.219 
 
12 April 
In his first major speech as NASA’s Administrator, Sean O’Keefe announced his strategic vision 
for the future of NASA. In his speech, “Pioneering the Future,” at Syracuse University’s 
Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, O’Keefe stated that NASA’s new vision was 
“to improve life here, to extend life to there, and to find life beyond.” In addition, O’Keefe said 
that NASA’s mission was “to understand and protect our home planet, to explore the universe 
and search for life, to inspire the next generation of explorers . . . as only NASA can.” O’Keefe 
also emphasized that NASA would carry out its mission with a commitment to fiscal 
responsibility and to working with academia, government agencies, and private industry.220 
 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced that, after international partners had completed 
certain portions of the ISS, former schoolteacher Barbara R. Morgan would fly on a Space 
Shuttle mission to the station. NASA had selected Morgan as a mission specialist in the astronaut 
class of 1998. She had subsequently worked in ISS Mission Control, relaying instructions 
between ISS Mission Control and the crew of Expedition 4 aboard the ISS. Morgan had

James S. Martin, former NASA Manager of the Viking missions to Mars, died at the age of 81. 
Martin had led the nationwide team of 750 engineers, scientists, and technicians that had 
developed the Viking 1 and Viking 2 spacecraft. The two craft had launched in 1975 and landed 
on Mars a year later, making Viking the first mission to successfully soft-land on the surface of 
another planet. Martin had joined NASA in 1964 as an Assistant Project Manager for the Lunar 
Orbiter, and in 1967 he had received NASA’s Exceptional Service Medal for his contribution to 
that project. He had departed from NASA in 1976 to work for Martin Marietta Aerospace, and in 
2000 NASA had asked him to leave retirement to lead its effort to restructure its Mars 
Exploration Program.222

NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe testified before the U.S. House Appropriations 
Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, which has primary jurisdiction for 
setting NASA’s annual funding levels. The subcommittee hearing was held in preparation for 
markup of FY 2003 appropriations legislation. Major media reported that subcommittee 
members were critical of NASA’s plans to eliminate certain programs to achieve President 
George W. Bush’s proposed reduction of US$1 billion in funding from NASA’s human 
spaceflight programs. In response to the comments of some members of the subcommittee, 
O’Keefe noted that, because NASA planned to complete its review of human spaceflight 
programs later in the year, he could not yet identify the programs that the budget cuts would 
affect. O’Keefe also said that NASA would provide Congress with a review of its scientific 
priorities by June and an independent cost assessment by August.223 
 
18 April 
Using images from the HST, astronomers reported their analysis of a new class of objects in the 
solar system. The researchers reported that Kuiper Belt object 1998 WW31 is binarycomposed 
of two objects that orbit around a common center of mass as they both orbit the Sunwith a 
highly eccentric orbit and a long period. However, they had found that 1998 WW31 is very 
different from the Pluto/Charon system, which was previously the only known binary in the 
Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is the region of space that extends from Neptune, at 30 AU 
(astronomical units)the approximate mean distance between Earth and the Sun) to more than 
100 AU. Since its discovery in 1992, the Kuiper Belt has helped scientists understand the solar 
system’s formation. Although scientists had discovered 1998 WW31 in 1998, they had reported 
it as a single Kuiper Belt object. However, analysis of observations made in 2000 indicated that

19 April 
Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-110 landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:27 
a.m. (EST). While in orbit, the Shuttle’s crew had performed four spacewalks to connect the S0 
Truss to the ISS and to prepare the MTa track-mounted platformfor use. The crew had used 
the robotic arms of both Atlantis and the ISS to install the truss. STS-110 was the first mission in 
which the crew had used the ISS’s robotic arm to maneuver crew members around the station as 
they performed spacewalks. In addition, it was the first mission in which the crew’s base for all 
of its spacewalks was the ISS’s Quest Airlock. The Shuttle’s crew had also engaged in joint 
operations with the ISS’s Expedition 4 crew. The total duration of STS-110 was 10 days, 19 
hours, and 42 minutes.225 
 
24 April 
Scientists announced an estimate of the universe’s age based on new HST images of very faint 
white dwarf stars in Messier 4 (M4), a cluster of stars in the constellation Scorpius. The 
researchers had closely examined M4’s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted 
their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, 
enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making 
them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, 
which the astronomers discovered were M4’s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion 
years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed 
less than 1 billion years after the universe’s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers 
had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the 
universe’s age is 13 to 14 billion years old. The use of this new methodology to estimate the 
universe’s age represented a major departure from those used previously.226

The Russian Soyuz TM-34 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 6:27 a.m. 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)1:27 a.m. (EST). The mission, designated Soyuz 4 Taxi Flight, 
carried three crew membersCommander Yuri P. Gidzenko of Russia, Italian astronaut Roberto 
Vittori, and South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth. The mission’s main purpose was to 
deliver a new Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS for use as an emergency lifeboat for the ISS’s 
permanent three-member crew. In addition, major media noted that Shuttleworth had paid the 
Russian Space Agency a fee of approximately US$20 million to fly on Soyuz to the ISS.227

NASA released the first four images taken by the HST’s newly installed Advanced Camera for 
Surveys (ACS). During Mission STS-109 in March 2002, astronauts had installed the ACS, 
capable of providing images with double the area and resolution of those provided by the Wide 
Field Planetary Camera 2, which the ACS had replaced. The ACS had captured images of a 
turbulent galaxy, which scientists called Tadpole because of its long tail of stars; of two colliding 
spiral galaxies known as the Mice; of the Cone Nebula, which looks like a red volcano; and of 
the M17 Swan Nebula, a richly colored, cloudy-looking nebula containing newly forming 
planetary systems.228

NASA awarded a US$1.14 billion contract to the Boeing Company’s Rocketdyne Propulsion and 
Power division for maintenance and support of the Space Shuttle’s main engine during the 
ensuing five years. Under the terms of the contract, Rocketdyne was to provide flight and test 
engineering; engine refurbishment; and manufacture, assembly, test, and delivery of three 
additional Space Shuttle main engines. The contract also required Rocketdyne to provide 
engineering support for NASA’s main engine facilities at NASA’s KSC and SSC. From 1972 
until the company signed the contract, Rocketdyne had assembled 106 main engines for NASA’s 
Shuttles.229

The Earth observation satellite Aqua launched aboard a Delta 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in California. The satellite Aqua was a component of the Earth Observing System 
(EOS), which also included the Terra satellite launched in December 1999. Aqua’s primary 
purpose was to acquire information about the effects of climate change on the water cycle. The 
satellite would also collect data to help scientists examine biological systems dependent upon 
water and improve long-term forecasts of weather and climate. Brazil, Japan, and the United 
States planned for their joint project Aqua to continue for six years.230

In an article published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists using data from 
NASA’s high-altitude research balloon reported a discovery that, potentially, could improve the 
research methodology for studying gases that contribute to ozone-layer depletion. Although 
scientists already knew that reactive hydrogen gases destroy stratospheric ozone and were able to 
detect hydrogen peroxide from space, they had problems with computer models used to analyze 
hydrogen-peroxide concentration in the atmosphere. However, in the reported study, researchers 
funded by NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise had compared a new predicted rate of hydrogen-

peroxide formation with the levels of the gas measured by two instruments on board NASA’s 
high-altitude research balloons. The new data had revealed a high degree of agreement between 
the actual and the predicted measurements. The researchers noted that, although their newly 
discovered rate of hydrogen-peroxide formation had no appreciable impact on rates of 
stratospheric ozone loss, they expected the findings would help to analyze the deleterious effects 
on Earth’s ozone of other, less easily measured, hydrogen gases.231

The U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space began hearings 
on legislation to reauthorize NASA programs. Subcommittee chairman Ron Wyden (D–OR) 
expressed concern about the agency’s financial management, particularly cost overruns for the 
ISS. He also urged NASA to maintain the excellence of the Shuttle program while research 
continued on a next-generation space vehicle. Members of the subcommittee heard testimony 
from NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe, who addressed them for the first time, and from 
William F. Readdy, Deputy Associate Administrator of the NASA Office of Space Flight. The 
members of the subcommittee questioned O’Keefe about his vision for NASA and his plans to 
reduce NASA’s budget by ending particular programs. In his prepared statement, O’Keefe 
discussed the status of the ISS and Space Shuttle programs.232 
 
10 May 
Using data from NASA’s Deep Space 1, astronomers uncovered unexpected findings about the 
surface of comets, suggesting that comets might have brought to Earth material necessary for the 
beginning of life. The astronomers had examined images gathered in 2001, during the 
spacecraft’s flyby of the 8-kilometer-long (5-mile-long) comet 19P/Borrelly, the only other 
comet besides 1P/Halley that a spacecraft had examined at such close proximity. Borrelly, the 
first comet of its type examined in this manner, is a short-period comet of the Jupiter family, 
compositionally different from intermediate-period comets such as 1P/Halley. The research, 
published in the journal Science, revealed no water ice or hydrated minerals on the comet’s 
surface, which scientists had unexpectedly found to be hot and dry. Deep Space 1 had also 
revealed that a dark dust, possibly containing biological material, covered the comet, which had 
a far darker surface than most objects in the inner solar system. According to the scientists, this 
finding suggested that comets might have provided a transport mechanism, supplying the organic 
materials required for the beginning of life on Earth.233

themselves, but in equipment used to service and support the Shuttles. For example, NASA had 
purchased outdated medical equipment to acquire the increasingly scarce Intel 8086 computer 
chip, a variant of the chip used in IBM’s first personal computers in 1981. NASA had continued 
to use the Intel 8086 chip in diagnostic equipment for the Space Shuttle booster rockets, also 
developed in the early 1980s. Although NASA planned to develop various systems with new 
hardware, some crucial systems remained dependent on antiquated electronic parts.234 
 
14 May 
NASA selected the National Consortium for Aviation Mobility (NCAM)a consortium of more 
than 100 public and private entities involved in transportation issuesas its partner in a joint 
venture to develop air-mobility technologies for small aircraft and small airports. By mid-2005 
NASA and NCAM intended to create a flight demonstration, called a proof-of-concept, of 
NASA’s Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS). Engineers planned for the system to 
provide on-demand, point-to-point transportation with 4- to 10-passenger aircraft operating from 
nearly 5,400 public-use landing facilities. NASA officials hoped SATS would improve the 
affordability, efficiency, reliability, and safety of small aircraft servicing small communities 
throughout the United States. However, NASA wanted to determine the project’s feasibility and 
to share its costs through partnerships with public and private entities. NASA expected that 
funding from the Department of Transportation and other federal agencies, along with its own 
contributions, would total nearly US$40 million for research over four years.235 
 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe named Michael C. Kostelnik as Deputy Associate 
Administrator for the ISS and Space Shuttle, a newly established senior management position in 
the Office of Human Space Flight. Kostelnik assumed responsibility for corporate-level 
management of the two programs’ budgetary, performance, safety, and scheduling requirements. 
Before his retirement from the U.S. Air Force, Kostelnik had served as commander of the Air 
Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.236 
 
16 May 
The International Astronomical Union announced that astronomers had found 11 new moons 
around the planet Jupiter. The discovery increased the total number of known satellites around 
Jupiter to 39, more than any other planet in the solar system. Using the Canada-France-Hawaii 
telescope, astronomers from Cambridge University and the University of Hawaii had first 
detected the moons in December 2001. At 1- to 2-miles (1.6- to 3.2-kilometers) across, the newly 
discovered moons were far smaller than some of Jupiter’s other moons, which are thousands of 
miles (or kilometers) wide. In addition, the astronomers had discovered that the satellites have 
irregular orbits and, unlike the planet’s largest moons, spin in the opposite direction of Jupiter. 
The moons’ irregular orbits around Jupiter indicate that they may have originally orbited the 
Sun.237

NASA and U.S. Air Force officials announced that they had agreed with a study team’s 
recommendation that NASA and the Air Force continue to assess the construction of a joint 
reusable launch vehicle (RLV) demonstrator. After spending 120 days examining the two 
organizations’ shared requirements and their technologies to access space, the team’s most 
critical recommendation had been that NASA and the Air Force should cooperate in assessing 
the construction of an RLV demonstrator for their joint operations. In addition, the study team 
had recommended that engineers eventually develop the demonstrator into a crew-operated 
vehicle for NASA and a cargo vehicle for the Air Force. NASA and the Air Force also agreed 
that experienced Air Force personnel should continue to work with NASA in joint study efforts, 
to refine their concepts of operations, requirements, and figures of merit, and to design reference 
missions.238 
 
23 May 
In an article in the journal Nature, scientist Paul M. Schenk provided evidence that Jupiter’s 
moon Europa might not be able to support life, challenging many scientists’ previous 
assessments about the potential for life on the moon. Astrobiologists had theorized that Europa 
might be able to support life, based on the possibility that it might possess a heat source, liquid 
water, and organic material, all necessary for life to exist. However, researchers had also known 
that Europa is covered with a shell of ice, which might be sufficiently thick to prevent sunlight 
and oxygen from reaching water below the icy surface, thereby impeding Europa’s ability to 
support life. Using data obtained from NASA’s Galileo and Voyager spacecraft, Schenk had 
calculated the thickness of Europa’s ice shell by comparing the depths of impact craters on 
Europa with those on Callisto and Ganymede, two other moons of Jupiter. Schenk’s analysis 
indicated that Europa’s ice shell is at least 19-kilometers (12-miles) thick―nearly twice that 
suggested by previous studies and thick enough to prevent the existence of life.239 
 
24 May 
Radar images of near-Earth asteroid 2000 DP107 revealed that it is a binary system, composed of 
two objects orbiting each other. The finding suggested that many near-Earth asteroids could be 
binaries. The images, taken by NASA’s Goldstone telescope facility and the National Science 
Foundation’s Arecibo Observatory, revealed that the asteroid was not one, but two objects, a 
nearly 800-meter-diameter (2,625-foot-diameter) primary and an almost 300-meter-diameter 
(985-foot-diameter) secondary, revolving around their common center of mass. The researchers 
suggested that approximately 16 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters (655 feet) 
in diameter could be binary systems. In addition, the analysis suggested that binaries with similar 
orbits might result from a close encounter of an asteroid and a planet, in which the planet’s 
gravitational pull breaks off a portion of the asteroid. Scientists consider binary asteroids 
potential hazards to Earth and worthy of further study.240

Using data gathered by NASA’s Mars Odyssey spacecraft, scientists discovered direct evidence 
of water ice on Mars. NASA scientists were using the Odyssey to measure and map soils in 
Mars’s polar regions when the spacecraft’s gamma-ray spectrometer detected hydrogen, 
indicating the presence of substantial, subsurface water ice in the upper meter of soil in a region 
surrounding Mars’s south pole. Scientists had already suspected that Mars possessed large 
quantities of water near its surface, but the Odyssey’s new information was the first direct 
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Scientists also found that large areas in Mars’s low and 
middle latitudes contained “slightly enhanced amounts of hydrogen.” However, their report did 
not indicate whether the hydrogen was in the form of water ice or chemically bound to minerals 
in the soil.241

reaffirmed their commitment to work on developing, assembling, and using the ISS for both 
applied and scientific research. In addition, the agencies agreed on a timeline for the next

Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-111 launched from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 
5:22 p.m. (EDT). NASA had originally scheduled the mission to lift off on 30 May but had 
delayed the launch because of mechanical and weather concerns. The Shuttle’s crew included 
Commander Kenneth D. Cockrell and astronauts Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, Valery G. Korzun, 
Paul S. Lockhart, Philippe Perrin, Sergei Y. Treschev, and Peggy A. Whitson. Korzun, Treschev, 
and Whitson were also members of ISS Expedition 5, which was to remain at the ISS when 
Endeavour returned to Earth. STS-111 had several objectives. The Shuttle was transporting to 
the ISS the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), which contained racks for experiments, 
stowage, and resupply. The crew would also install a component called the Mobile Base System 
(MBS) to service the ISS’s robotic arm. Both the MPLM and the MBS were part of the payload 
of the mission, also designated ISS Utilization Flight 2. A further objective of the mission was to 
transport the crew of Expedition 5 to the ISS and to return the members of Expedition 4 to 
Earth.243

NASA announced the extension of its existing six-year contract with Lockheed Martin Space 
Systems to build 35 super-lightweight external tanks for the Space Shuttle program. The 
modified agreement extended the contract to September 2008, adding US$341 million to the 
original contract of US$1.15 billion, which NASA had awarded to Lockheed Martin in October 
2000. Under the contract, Lockheed Martin would construct, test, and deliver the tanks; maintain 
and operate NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans; and provide services at 
NASA’s KSC and its MSFC. Furthermore, under the terms of the extension, Lockheed Martin 
agreed to provide at least six tanks per year, instead of the eight tanks per year stipulated in the 
original agreement. 246 
 
13 June 
Scientists announced the discovery of a planetary system with architecture similar to Earth’s 
solar system, including multiple planets revolving around a parent star, at great distances and in 
nearly circular orbits. The discovery, the first confirmation that other planetary systems had 
evolved much like Earth’s solar system, also raised the possibility of the existence of other 
Earth-like planets in the universe. The scientists who had spearheaded the research 
effort―Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at Berkeley and R. Paul Butler of the

Carnegie Institute of Washington―announced the discovery of a planet nearly the size of 
Jupiter, orbiting a star at approximately the same distance as that of Jupiter from the Sun. Just as 
significantly, the astronomers reported that the planet was orbiting its parent star at a distance 
relatively farther than that of most planets previously observed. In addition, they had found that 
the newly discovered planet has a circular orbit like Jupiter, whereas most other planets observed 
had elongated, eccentric orbits. The planet was the second discovered orbiting the star 55 Cancri. 
The scientists explained that, although the planetary system they had observed was not directly 
analogous to Earth’s solar system, its discovery signaled that they were closer to finding a 
system similar to that of Earth.247 
 
Two astronauts from Space Shuttle Endeavour undertook an extravehicular activity (EVA) to 
repair the ISS’s robotic arm, Canadarm2. American astronaut Franklin R. Chang-Diaz and 
French astronaut Philippe Perrin replaced one of seven joints on the US$600 million, Canadian-
built robotic arm, which was critical to the continued construction of the ISS. To repair 
Canadarm2, the astronauts first removed its 450-pound (205-kilogram), hand-like, latching-end 
effector (LEE); loosened six bolts connecting the problematic “wrist roll” joint to the arm; and 
disconnected power, data, and video lines. They then installed the replacement joint, tightened 
the bolts to secure the new joint to the arm, restored the power and other lines, and reaffixed the 
LEE. Subsequent tests of the Canadarm2 confirmed the success of the repairs. The EVA, lasting 
7 hours and 17 minutes, was the third for Mission STS-111.248 
 
15 June 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe named Jeremiah F. Creedon, Director of NASA’s LaRC, as 
the new Associate Administrator for the Office of Aerospace Technology at NASA 
Headquarters. Creedon had begun working at LaRC in June 1963 as an engineer, eventually 
succeeding Paul F. Holloway to become LaRC’s seventh director. Delma C. Freeman Jr., 
LaRC’s Deputy Director, became its Acting Director.249 
 
19 June 
Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 2:58 p.m. (EDT), 
ending a mission of 13 days, 20 hours, and 35 minutes. During STS-111, the crew had used the 
ISS’s robotic arm, Canadarm2, to move the MBS from Endeavour to the Mobile Transporter 
(MT) on the ISS’s Destiny laboratory module. In addition, crew members Franklin R. Chang-
Diaz and Philippe Perrin had performed three EVAs lasting a total of 19 hours and 31 minutes. 
During the first EVA, the astronauts had installed a Power and Data Grapple Fixture to the ISS’s 
P6 Truss, the sixth truss segment on the port side of the ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure, and 
moved six micrometeoroid debris shields from the Shuttle to a portion of the ISS called the 
PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter-One) for eventual installation on the Russian-made Zvezda 
service module. During the second spacewalk, the crew had connected data, power, and video 
cables between the MT rail car and the MBS; positioned the Payload Orbital Replacement Unit

Accommodation (POA) on the MBS; and completed the installation of the MBS platform. In the 
final EVA, Chang-Diaz and Perrin had performed repairs on the ISS’s Canadarm2, restoring the 
instrument to full operational status. In addition, STS-111 had returned the members of 
Expedition 4Daniel E. Bursch, Yuri I. Onufrienko, and Carl W. Walzto Earth.250 
 
24 June 
NOAA’s Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES), NOAA-M, launched on a Titan 2 
rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. NOAA intended the satellite, which was 
renamed NOAA-17 upon reaching orbit, to collect meteorological data to improve weather 
forecasting. The satellite was the third in a series of five satellites collectively referred to as the 
POES system. NOAA planned to transmit the satellite’s data to its National Weather Service, as 
well as to organizations in other countries. Lockheed Martin Space Systems had built and 
launched the satellite for NOAA, with NASA’s GSFC managing the project and providing 
technical guidance.251 
 
25 June 
NASA announced that it had grounded all four Space Shuttles because of newly discovered 
mechanical problems, postponing indefinitely the launch of Space Shuttle Columbia. Previously, 
NASA had scheduled Columbia’s launch for 19 July 2002. According to NASA officials, 
engineers had found small fissures in metal liners within the fuel pipes of the main engines of 
Shuttles Atlantis and Discovery. If left unrepaired, the cracks could cause pieces of the liners to 
break off, possibly damaging a Shuttle’s engine while in flight.252 
 
27 June 
NASA’s Office of Space Science announced that it had selected one team to lead the 
development of an advanced ion-propulsion system and another to develop advanced ion optics. 
The Office of Space Science had selected NASA’s GRC to develop the NASA Evolutionary 
Xenon Thruster (NEXT) system, which would use xenon gas and electrical power to drive 
spacecraft. NASA intended the NEXT system as an alternative to conventional chemical 
propulsion systems. Furthermore, NASA had selected Boeing Electron Dynamic Devices to lead 
the development, fabrication, and testing of carbon-based ion optics, important components of 
ion engines, which, historically, had possessed limited thruster lifetimes.253

to update the country’s National Space Policy―last revised in 1996―to better address domestic 
and international developments affecting the nation’s space capabilities. The review provided 
recommendations in three specific areas: commercial remote sensing and foreign access to 
remote-sensing space capabilities; space transportation policy; and existing national policy 
statements related to space activities. The National Security Council (NSC) was to chair the 
review with support from the Office of Science and Technology Policy. In addition, the NSC had 
established the Space Policy Coordinating Committee (Space PCC), which would include 
representatives from federal agencies with roles in the formation of U.S. space policy, such as 
the International Trade Administration and NOAA.254 
 
JULY 2002 
 
1 July 
NASA announced the extension of its existing contract with ATK Thiokol Propulsion for the 
production and refurbishment of reusable solid rocket motors (RSRM) for the Space Shuttle 
program. Shuttle launches required two RSRMs and three main engines to provide sufficient 
thrust for the Shuttle to attain orbit. Under the modified agreement, ATK Thiokol would produce 
and refurbish 70 RSRMs and three flight-support motors. The US$429 million modification 
extended to May 2007 the original US$2.4 billion contract, which NASA and ATK Thiokol had 
agreed on in October 1998. The original contract had been the sixth agreement between ATK 
Thiokol Propulsion and NASA’s MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama.255 
 
The FAA announced a major operational enhancement to its Automatic Dependent Surveillance 
Broadcast (ADS-B), a surveillance technology enabling aircraft pilots and air flight controllers to 
share a common picture of airspace and air traffic. The FAA announced that it had selected new 
surveillance data links for the ADS-B, including a Universal Access Transceiver link for general 
aviation users and a 1,090 megahertz Extended Squitter ADS-B link for air carriers and for both 
commercial and private aviation operators. The FAA’s selection of these data links was part of 
an effort to coordinate ADS-B operations between the United States and Europe.256 
 
3 July 
NASA launched Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) on a Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral 
Air Station in Florida. NASA scientists had created CONTOURscheduled to make close 
approaches to comets Encke, Schwassmann-Wachmann-3, and d’Arrestto analyze the 
composition of comets. Engineers had designed the spacecraft to capture 4-meter-resolution (13-
foot-resolution) images of the comets’ nuclei during its encounters and to perform spectral 
mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of 100 to 200 meters (328 to 656 feet). Astronomers planned 
to supplement the data obtained through CONTOUR’s observations with data captured by Earth-

gas and dust from the environment near the comets’ nuclei.257 
 
9 July 
NASA announced the selection of two proposals for space missions for its Earth System Science 
Pathfinder small-satellite program, developed to research Earth’s carbon cycle and the 
relationship of climate change and oceans. Specifically, the selected proposals would support the 
Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), which would provide global measurements of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere, and the Aquarius mission, which would map salt concentrations on 
oceans’ surfaces to learn how they affect ocean circulation and global heat redistribution. NASA 
planned to provide up to US$175 million for each of the two proposals selected for the program. 
NASA appointed David Crisp of JPL as Principal Investigator for the OCO mission and Chester 
J. “Chet” Koblinsky of GSFC as Principal Investigator for the Aquarius mission. NASA had 
numerous university, corporate, and international collaborators for both missions, including the 
Argentine Space Program, a significant partner in the Aquarius mission.258 
 
ESA reported research indicating that the universe might be older than scientists had previously 
estimated and that a common method of estimating the age of celestial bodies might be incorrect. 
A group of scientists had analyzed the XMM-Newton satellite’s x-ray observations of the distant 
but exceptionally luminous quasar APM 08279+5255 and found that the quasar contains three 
times more iron than the Sun. Because exploding stars release iron, which increases across the 
universe over time, the scientists had expected APM 08279+5255 to have less iron than Earth’s 
relatively older solar system. The scientists noted that the surprising quantity of iron in the 
distant quasar could be the result of an unknown phenomenon that produces iron very efficiently. 
However, they suggested that the more likely explanation for the finding was that the 
conventional method of measuring the age of celestial objects by estimating the objects’ 
redshifta property of the light emitted by such objectswas flawed.259 
 
Data from NASA’s Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite provided support for a decades-
old, unproven theory that winds converge in two large areas near Earth’s equator, driving ocean 
circulation south of the equator. The two areas, known as the northern and southern portions of 
the Intertropical Convergence Zone, are part of a belt circling Earth near the equator, where trade 
winds of both the northern and southern hemispheres converge. The region affects north-south 
atmospheric circulation, significantly influencing precipitation and temperatures in many regions 
of the globe. Previously, researchers had identified the double Intertropical Convergence Zone as 
a limited seasonal phenomenon. However, since 1969 the zone’s existence, location, and 
seasonality had remained controversial. The QuikSCAT data confirmed, not only that the double 
Intertropical Convergence Zone exists all year long, but also that it is more extensive than 
scientists had suspected. The finding provided important information about how Earth’s

10 July 
The Research Maximization and Prioritization Task Force (ReMAP) presented the executive 
summary of its external review to the NASA Advisory Council. NASA Administrator Sean 
O’Keefe had created ReMAP in March 2002 to recommend strategies that NASA’s Office of 
Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) could use to achieve its research goals within 
budgetary limits. Among its recommendations, ReMAP suggested that the ISS include a chief 
science officer on board, and that NASA increase the ISS’s equipment, the ISS crew’s work 
time, and the frequency of Shuttle flights, to enable the crew to conduct first-rate research aboard 
the station.261 
 
11 July 
NASA signed an agreement with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) to provide 
researchers with mapping data collected during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 
in 2000. Specifically, the two agencies agreed to provide 90-meter-resolution (295-foot-
resolution), digital-elevation-model (DEM) data for areas outside of the United States and 30-
meter-resolution (98-foot-resolution) data for the continental United States. According to the 
agreement, only qualified researchers would have access to the DEM data, although the public 
would have access to certain selected data. NASA’s JPL would process the 90-meter-resolution 
(295-foot-resolution) data into DEM data, and NIMA would provide additional finishing before 
sending it to the USGS’s Earth Resources Observation Systems Data Center for archiving and 
distribution. In addition, NASA and NIMA would process requests for the data. With regard to 
the 30-meter-resolution (98-foot-resolution) data, the two agencies agreed that NASA would 
have access to the data for scientific research, and that NIMA, at its discretion, would make the 
data available to other agencies.262 
 
13 July 
NASA announced that it would keep all four Space Shuttles grounded until at least September 
2002 because of potentially dangerous fractures discovered in the fuel lines of all four Shuttles. 
NASA officials also reported that engineers now considered the cracks less of a safety concern 
than they had feared when NASA first discovered them in June 2002.263

substantially increased the program’s costs, and that NASA’s management had not taken steps to 
address cost growth. Consequently, the ISS’s scientific research capabilities had diminished, 
raising concerns among the station’s international partners. Although GAO made no formal 
recommendations, it cited NASA’s own newly established management and cost-estimation 
reforms, noted challenges NASA faced in implementing those reforms, and suggested that 
NASA develop a credible budget to complete the ISS. NASA formally responded that the report 
reasonably portrayed the problems with the ISS, as well as NASA’s efforts to address them.264 
 
18 July 
The House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearingNASA Workforce 
and Management Challengesto garner information about NASA’s efforts to address concerns 
regarding its human capital, competitive sourcing for the Space Shuttle program, and other 
matters. Committee members heard testimony from NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe; David 
M. Walker, Comptroller General of the United States; and Mark D. Roth, General Counsel of the 
American Federation of Government Employees. O’Keefe discussed NASA’s Strategic Human 
Capital Plan, a systemic method of managing human capital according to NASA’s vision and 
mission. In addition, O’Keefe announced the termination of the comprehensive Strategic 
Resources Review initiated during the Clinton administration to create a blueprint for NASA’s 
future facility, missions, and workforce requirements. Roth argued that, because NASA expected 
a high number of retirements in the near future, its existing and proposed personnel policies were 
inadequate to address the resulting loss in human capital. Walker discussed methods NASA 
could use to strengthen its human capital and to address its difficulties with contract 
management, as well as the increasing expense of the ISS program and of space exploration.265 
 
20 July 
NASA officials announced the delay of the launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-113, 
scheduled for 21 July. Engineers had discovered fuel-line cracks, the same problem that had 
previously led NASA to ground some Space Shuttles. At the time of the announcement, NASA 
officials remained uncertain of the new date of Endeavour’s launch, suggesting that, although the 
Shuttle would be ready to fly by September 2002, NASA might delay the launch until at least the 
end of 2002.266

NASA announced that Donald R. Pettit, a backup member of the crew of the Expedition 6 
Mission to the ISS, would replace Donald A. Thomas on the mission. NASA had reassigned 
Thomas, a veteran of four Space Shuttle flights, because of medical issues affecting his 
qualification for long-duration spaceflight. Pettit, a chemical engineer who had joined the 
astronaut corps in 1996, had previously served as a staff scientist at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico.268

The U.S. Senate confirmed Frederick D. Gregory as NASA’s Deputy Administrator, making 
Gregory the first African American to serve as NASA’s second-in-command. Before becoming 
Deputy Administrator, Gregory had served as NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Flight 
from December 2001 to August 2002 and as Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety 
and Mission Assurance from June 1992 to December 2001. In addition, Gregory had been an 
astronaut on three Shuttle missions and had served in the U.S. Air Force for 30 years.269 
 
Analyzing observations of the dwarf galaxy NGC 1569, a group of astronomers led by Crystal L. 
Martin of the University of California Santa Barbara found the first evidence that such galaxies 
produce most of the heavy elements in the universe. Heavy elements, defined as all elements 
other than hydrogen and helium, are essential for planet formation and can strongly influence 
astronomical phenomena such as the rate of galaxy formation. Scientists had theorized that, 
during the early development of the universe, heavy elements emanating from dwarf galaxies 
played a dominant role in enriching the intergalactic gas that formed other galaxies. Data from 
NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory enabled Martin and her team to test this idea. They found 
that NGC 1569 emitted large quantities of heavy elements in extremely hot x-ray winds, the first 
direct evidence of metal-enriched winds from dwarf galaxies. The researchers noted that the 
findings left open the question of whether or not dwarf galaxies or other galaxies dominate the 
intergalactic metallic enrichment process.270

geographic shift in the planet’s gravitational field, with a decline in upper latitudes and a 
corresponding increase in lower latitudes. However, NASA scientists Christopher M. Cox and 
Benjamin F. Chao discovered that the quantity, rate, and timing of atmospheric change and ice 
melt did not correspond to the magnitude and rate of gravitational shift. Based on their analysis 
of data that 10 satellites had acquired between 1979 and 2002, Cox and Chao found a more 
probable explanation of this phenomenon. The data suggested that the oceans had been rapidly 
transporting substantial quantities of water and ice from higher to lower latitudes, thereby 
shifting Earth’s mass and causing a corresponding alteration in the planet’s gravitational field 
from the higher to the lower latitudes. The scientists noted, however, that additional data and 
analysis were necessary to determine whether their interpretation of the data was correct.271

(20,440-square-meter) facility to commence operations by the end of 2002. Lockheed Martin 
announced that its new facility would include a center for production of propulsion and thermal 
systems for spacecraft, as well as an integrated metrology center. The company also announced 
that it would provide engineering and manufacturing services at the facility. Lockheed Martin 
officials cited the location of NASA’s Center of Excellence for propulsion testing at SSC as a 
critical factor in their decision to consolidate the company’s capabilities at the single facility.272 
 
NASA announced that its Stardust spacecraft had begun collecting interstellar dust 
grains―extremely small particles of solid matter that permeate the Milky Way Galaxy, 
providing clues to the galaxy’s formation and development. For use in comparative analyses, the 
spacecraft would collect both ancient dust grains, found in the interior of comets, and relatively 
young dust particles, produced by the current generation of stars. Stardust would encounter 
comet Wild 2 in early 2004. Project scientists, who planned to analyze the dust grains after the 
spacecraft’s scheduled return to Earth in 2006, hoped that their study would yield evidence about 
the composition of the early galaxy and its subsequent evolutionary changes.273 
 
15 August 
NASA announced that it had lost contact with the US$159 million comet-exploring spacecraft 
Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR), launched on 3 July 2002. Ground controllers had lost 
contact with CONTOUR after a scheduled ignition of its solid-propellant rocket engine, designed 
to propel the spacecraft out of Earth-orbiting space and into a heliocentric trajectory where it 
would eventually encounter comets Encke, Schwassmann-Wachmann, and d’Arrest. At the time

Boeing and the U.S. Air Force signed a US$9.7 billion contract for 60 C-17 Globemaster III 
transport aircraft. The contract, an extension of previous agreements between the Air Force and 
Boeing, would increase the number of C-17s in the Air Force fleet to 180. The Air Force had 
been using C-17s to transport personnel, equipment, and supplies in support of combat and 
humanitarian missions.275 
 
ESA announced that an international group of astronauts would attend a training session at the 
European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany, to prepare for missions to the ISS. The 
specific objective of the training was to prepare the astronauts for the tasks they would need to 
accomplish when a Japanese experiment module and ESA’s Columbus laboratory docked with 
the ISS. Upon completing the training, the international ISS partners planned to assign the 
astronauts to specific, long-duration ISS missions. The training session, scheduled to last from 26 
August to 6 September, would include ESA astronauts Pedro Duque, Léopold Eyharts, Paolo A. 
Nespoli, and Thomas Reiter; Japan’s NASDA astronauts Takao Doi, Satoshi Furukawa, Aikihiko 
Hoshide, and Koichi Wakata; and NASA astronauts Nicole Passonno Stott and Stephanie D. 
Wilson.276 
 
20 August 
NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft completed its 25th year of operation. As the probe reached its 
anniversary, Voyager 2 was 6.3 billion miles (10 billion kilometers) from the Sun and moving 
toward the edge of the solar system at more than 35,000 miles per hour (56,000 kilometers per 
hour). Since its launch on 20 August 1977, Voyager 2 had provided photographs of planets 
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their respective moons, as well as other data. At 25 years 
old, the spacecraft continued to send data to Earth. Scientists estimated that Voyager 2 could 
reach the boundary of the solar system in another seven to 21 years. However, they also expected 
that, by 2020, the spacecraft might not have sufficient power to maintain contact with Earth.277 
 
21 August 
The first Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), the product of a long-term program 
designed to provide military and other satellites with enduring, reliable access to space, launched 
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Lockheed Martin had developed the rocket, 
called the Atlas 5. The EELV placed the European television satellite Hot Bird 6 in its 
preliminary orbit 31 minutes after its launch, and the satellite’s thrusters later maneuvered it into 
its final orbit. The EELV program had resulted from the U.S. government’s research into the 
1986 Challenger disaster. The U.S. Air Force had reportedly paid Lockheed Martin and the 
Boeing Company more than US$500 million each to design an EELV. The U.S. Air Force had

requested an EELV that was an advanced version of existing rockets, rather than an entirely new 
system, estimating that, through 2020, the EELV could reduce the cost of placing military 
satellites into orbit by approximately US$10 billion. France-based Eutelsat (European 
Telecommunications Satellite Organization) owned the Hot Bird 6 broadcast satellite, which 
Alcatel Space had built.278 
 
A team of NASA scientists using uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) to research electrical 
storms achieved a flight-duration milestone. The research was part of the Altus Cumulus 
Electrification Study (ACES), a project that examined the causes of electrical storms and their 
effects on the planet. The ACES research team employed Altus II UAVs to study thunderstorms 
over Florida, capping off four weeks of research flights with the study’s longest flight, lasting for 
6 hours and 32 minutes and monitoring four successive thunderstorms. General Atomics 
Aeronautical Systems had built the Altus II, which could fly near thunderstorms for hours, at 
altitudes of up to 65,000 feet.279

William W. Parsons Jr. replaced Roy S. Estess as Director of SSC. Parsons had joined NASA in 
1990 as a Launch Site Support Manager at NASA’s KSC, later serving in various positions at 
NASA’s KSC, SSC, and JSC. Estess had come to SSC in 1966 as a test engineer and had served 
as the Center’s Director from 1989 to 2002.280 
 
29 August 
NASA’s KSC awarded the Boeing Company the checkout, assembly, and payload-processing 
services (CAPPS) contract for the Space Shuttle and the EELV. The CAPPS contract had a four-
year base period of performance valued at US$332 million. In addition, the contract had two 
three-year extension options, which could increase the contract’s total value to US$810 million. 
Under the contract, Boeing would perform payload-processing tasks, such as ensuring that 
payloads were compatible with launch vehicles and loading payloads into launch vehicles. 
Boeing had also held KSC’s previous payload-processing agreement, called the payload ground-
operations contract.281

but disagreed about the extent to which the thickness of the ice sheets was changing. Analyzing 
recent remote-sensing measurements of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, Rignot and 
Thomas discovered that the thickness of the ice sheets was changing more rapidly than 
previously thought. Although the data was indeterminate concerning changes in some parts of 
the ice sheets, Rignot and Thomas found clear evidence that large regions of the polar ice sheets 
were rapidly changing, with accumulation of ice in some areas and attrition in others. Despite 
such variations, the scientists found that, overall, the major polar ice sheets were losing mass. 
Specifically, Greenland’s ice sheet was losing 50 cubic kilometers (12 cubic miles) of mass 
annually, and the West Antarctic ice sheet appeared to be losing nearly 48 cubic kilometers (11.5 
cubic miles) of mass per year.282 
 
The ReMAP Task Force of NASA’s Office of Biological and Physical Research (OBPR) 
presented its final report to the NASA Advisory Council. NASA had charged the ReMAP Task 
Force with evaluating the research productivity and priorities of NASA’s OBPR and with 
providing a framework for prioritizing a research program for the OBPR and the ISS. ReMAP’s 
173-page report identified two major goals of these programs: research enabling human 
exploration of space and basic research of intrinsic scientific interest. In addition, the report 
made several recommendations, for example, that NASA increase the ISS’s facilities and 
equipment for scientific research, as well as the amount of time that ISS crew members dedicated 
to scientific operations. The report stated that, if NASA did not make these and other 
enhancements to the ISS, then NASA “should cease to characterize the ISS as a science driven 
program.”283

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded the Boeing Company a contract to 
design a fuel cell–based propulsion system for a pilotless, ultra-long-endurance UAV. According 
to Boeing, the UAV’s propulsion system would incorporate existing automotive–fuel cell 
technology, to create a vehicle with a variety of commercial and military applications.284

The FAA announced plans to establish public use of a new method of air navigation that would 
significantly increase the capacity and efficiency of airways in the United States. The Required 
Navigation Performance (RNP) method would rely upon aircraft’s use of advanced, automated 
guidance technologies, both in terminal areas and en route. Specifically, RNP would incorporate 
advanced technologies in areas within a 40-mile (64-kilometer) radius of an airport, as well as in 
high-altitude areas. The use of RNP would have several potential benefits, including precise 
approach and departure paths at airports, accurate vertical and lateral guidance, and increased 
airspace capacity. In the United States, Alaska Airlines had pioneered the use of RNP in air

The Russian Space Agency notified NASA that it had abandoned its plan to transport singer 
Lance Bass of the popular music group ’N Sync to the ISS. Television producers had intended to 
sponsor Bass, featuring him in a television documentary about his trip to the ISS. However, the 
sponsors had failed to raise the estimated US$20 million needed to cover the singer’s fare. 
Therefore, Russian officials had decided to withdraw Bass as a member of the Soyuz crew 
scheduled to leave for the ISS on 28 October 2002. If the 23-year-old Bass had gone on the 
Soyuz mission, he would have become the youngest person ever to travel in space, as well as the 
third space tourist.286 
 
10 September 
NASA announced the appointment of two senior managers as part of its new approach to 
program management. James W. Kennedy, Deputy Center Director of NASA’s MSFC, became 
Deputy Center Director of NASA’s KSC, and David A. King, Director of Shuttle Processing at 
KSC, assumed the post of Deputy Center Director of MSFC. The appointments were the result of 
Administrator Sean O’Keefe’s “One NASA” approach, a method of program management 
emphasizing enhanced collaboration, communication, and coordination among NASA’s 
facilities, to attain common goals. Deputy Center Directors Kennedy and King would share 
management responsibilities with the center directors of their respective facilities.287 
 
NASA scientist Zdenek Sekanina published new findings challenging existing ideas about 
comets. Existing theory had posited that comets rarely break up and that, when they do, the 
fragmentation usually occurs in close proximity to the Sun. However, basing his research on the 
analysis of images taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), operated jointly by 
NASA and ESA, Sekanina had discovered that comets fragment throughout their lifetimes, often 
at distances far from the Sun. Moreover, Sekanina had found that such fragmentation generally 
occurs in a somewhat orderly pattern, with a single comet fragmenting into clusters of smaller 
comets. Sekanina had analyzed a type of very small comet called a sungrazer and discovered that 
sungrazers are actually fragments of other comets that have broken apart during a previous 
encounter with the Sun. Moreover, he had found that sungrazers continue to break into pieces 
throughout their orbits around the Sun. Sekanina had also examined another type of 
comet―57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delaporte, finding that this type of comet shows the same pattern 
of fragmenting into smaller comets as it moves farther from the Sun.288

the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), in honor of former NASA Administrator James E. 
Webb. Under the US$824.8 million contract, TRW and its partner organizations would build an 
observatory capable of viewing deeper into space than the HST. The telescope’s main mirror 
would unfold to a diameter of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters), thereby providing six times more 
light-gathering area than the HST, which had an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror. The telescope 
would also have instruments highly sensitive to infrared light, which would help astronomers 
understand the universe’s creation and evolution. In addition, NASA planned for the new 
telescope to orbit 940,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, within the second Lagrange 
point or L2, where a spacecraft maintains a balance between the gravity of the Sun and of Earth. 
Although the L2 orbit would be too far from Earth to allow astronauts to service the observatory, 
it would enable the observatory to cool to very low temperatures without the use of complex 
refrigeration equipment.289 
 
12 September 
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced its first successful launch of a 
satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. ISRO launched METSAT, a meteorological 
satellite, from Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, using it own 
rocket, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). The new version of the PSLV reflected a 
significant enhancement of the rocket’s capabilities and a substantial improvement in ISRO’s 
overall launch capabilities. Previous versions of the PSLV had been capable of placing 900-
kilogram (2,000-pound) satellites in a 900-kilometer (560-mile), polar Sun–synchronous orbit, 
whereas the PSLV-C4 had placed the 1,055-kilogram (2,325-pound) METSAT in a highly 
elliptical orbit with an apogee (the farthest point from Earth) of 34,700 kilometers (21,600 
miles).290

The China National Space Administration’s (CNSA’s) Kaituozhe 1 rocket failed during launch, 
for reasons that remained unclear. Kaituozhe 1 was the first of the CNSA’s new all-solid-fuel, 
four-stage launch vehicles. CNSA and other Chinese government agencies apparently provided 
no information to the public about the event or about the reason the launch had failed.291 
 
16 September 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced that Peggy A. Whitson would be NASA’s first 
ISS Science Officer. In the future, NASA planned to assign one of its astronauts to the post for 
each ISS expedition crew. The objective of the assignment was to increase the ISS’s emphasis on 
research. According to NASA, the ISS Science Officer would focus initially on U.S. research 
conducted on the ISS. As the station’s research capabilities expanded in the future, NASA would 
discuss with the ISS’s international partners the possibility of expanding the ISS Science 
Officer’s role. NASA’s ISS Science Officer would be responsible for working with the U.S. 
research community on the requirements and objectives of ISS experiments, acting as the point-
of-contact between ISS crew and NASA-sponsored principal investigators, payload developers,

a PhD in biochemistry, would become the first resident scientist on the ISS.292 
 
17 September 
Observations from the HST revealed the existence of medium-sized black holes. According to 
scientists, the discovery provided important information about the creation of many types of 
celestial bodies. Scientists were surprised to find that the black holes in the cores of globular star 
clusters―bright clusters of stars that orbit galaxies, including the Milky Way―are nearly 10,000 
times less massive than galaxies. The HST data revealed that black holes in globular star clusters 
are proportionally smaller than massive black holes found in galaxies, demonstrating that the 
mass of a black hole is proportional to its stellar surroundings. The results also indicated that 
when the globular star clusters had formed they had black holes, suggesting that, to form large 
star clusters, black holes must act as gravitational anchors. Scientists believed these findings 
might illuminate the process by which galaxies and globular clusters formed. The discovery also 
suggested that black holes are more ubiquitous than scientists had previously thought.293 
 
The GAO submitted a report to the House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics on 
NASA’s progress toward developing a reusable launch vehicle (RLV), under the Space Launch 
Initiative (SLI) program, to replace the Space Shuttle. According to GAO, NASA needed to 
complete ongoing reassessment of its overall space transportation plans and of the future of the 
ISS. NASA also needed to determine whether it would develop the SLI program in cooperation 
with the DOD. To address these concerns, GAO recommended that NASA reassess the schedule 
for defining the SLI’s requirements and reach a consensus with the DOD on the program’s 
priorities and objectives. The report also recommended that NASA finalize the SLI’s basic 
requirements before implementing management controls on the program’s costs and risks. In its 
response, NASA concurred with GAO’s recommendations and outlined plans to implement 
them.294 
 
18 September 
The National Research Council (NRC), the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, 
released a report on the ISS, outlining NASA’s efforts to limit cost overruns on the project. The 
report concluded that, if NASA proceeded with its plans to halt construction, once the ISS’s core 
was complete, and to limit the station’s crew, equipment, and other components, the ISS would 
be unlikely to become a first-class laboratory. NRC reported that capping the crew to three 
persons would have a highly detrimental impact on the quality of scientific research conducted 
on board the ISS, because a crew of such a small size would have to devote most of its time to 
station maintenance and operation. In addition, NRC stated that NASA had made its decision to 
cancel or delay equipment for experiments without assessing scientific priorities or determining 
which research plans the curtailments would affect most. NASA’s official representative

Moreover, NASA intended to continue developing the ISS based on decisions concerning the 
station’s scientific priorities and planned to take any steps necessary to achieve those goalsfor 
example, increasing the size of the station’s crew.295 
 
19 September 
G. Scott Hubbard replaced Henry McDonald as Director of NASA’s ARC. Hubbard, ARC’s 
Deputy Director of Research at the time of the appointment, had served in a number of 
management roles at the Center since the beginning of his career with NASA in 1987. In 
addition, he had helped establish NASA’s Astrobiology Institute at ARC and had originated the 
Mars Pathfinder program. McDonald, who had served as Director of ARC from 1996 to 2002, 
had left the Center to become a professor of computational engineering at the University of 
Tennessee in Chattanooga.296 
 
The General Services Administration (GSA) presented the Federal Aviation Award to the 
Aircraft Operations Division (AOD) of NASA’s JSC. The AOD, which provided astronauts with 
spaceflight training, had an exemplary safety record. In addition, GSA gave Chief of AOD 
Robert J. Naughton an Honorable Mention for the Federal Aviation Professional Award. GSA’s 
awards recognized effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in federal aviation operations, in the hope 
that honoring outstanding federal aviation programs and professionals would promote excellence 
in government aviation.297 
 
23 September 
NASA awarded Boeing Space and Communications Group a US$200 million contract to 
perform payload and mission operations for the ISS. The contract, formally known as the ISS 
payload-integration contract (IPIC), stipulated that Boeing perform payload engineering 
integration, mission integration, and payload operations at NASA’s JSC and MSFC. Previously, 
Boeing had performed those operations under two separate contracts. The new IPIC contract 
covered operations until 30 September 2004, with an option to extend through 30 September 
2005.298 
 
26 September 
NASA announced an agreement with the National Institute of Aerospace Associates (NIAA), an 
organization of universities and nonprofit organizations engaged in aerospace research, to create 
the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) at NASA’s LaRC. NASA described the agreement 
with NIAA as a long-term commitment to expand its collaboration with universities, industry, 
and other entities. The new NIA would host advanced aerospace and atmospheric research and 
the development of related technologies, offering graduate degrees in engineering and science, 
facilitating the growth of new business opportunities, and stimulating the commercialization of

NASA awarded contracts to four companies to develop technology to prevent the flammability 
of airliner fuel tanks. The research plan was a response to the National Transportation Safety 
Board’s (NTSB’s) findings concerning the problem of flammability and explosiveness in the 
center wing tanks of airplanes, a vulnerability that had destroyed airliners such as TWA Flight 
800. NASA’s GRC awarded the contracts to Creare Engineering, Essex Cryogenics, Honeywell 
Environmental Controls Systems, and Valcor Engineering, stipulating that the companies 
research how they might replace the oxygen in fuel tanks with a noncombustible gas. The 
companies would determine the feasibility of improving the methods of on-board systems of 
inert gas generation and of on-board oxygen generation. If the researchers found potential means 
of improving the systems, the awardees would fabricate and test hardware during the contract’s 
second phase.300 
 
The FAA released an enhanced version of the Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System 
(EDMS), a computer program that the FAA had developed in the mid-1980s to assess the effects 
of aircraft, ground-support equipment, and other sources of airport emissions on air quality. The 
new version, referred to as EDMS 4.1, included a number of features enabling analysts better to 
examine local concentrations of pollutants, including diagrams of specific airports and 
mathematical models of aircraft-exhaust dispersion.301

Astronomers used images from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and Rossi X-ray Timing 
Explorer to observe, for the first time, the life cycles of x-ray jets ejected from a black hole. 
Scientists considered x-ray jets an extremely important phenomenon to understand, because they 
could reveal information about the dynamics of matter that accumulates in intense gravitational 
fields. From 1998 to 2002, the two satellites had collected the images showing the progressive 
changes of two jets of high-energy particles emitted from a black hole, microquasar XTE J1550-
564. The images revealed that the jets had initially traveled at nearly half the speed of light, later 
decelerating and eventually disappearing. Astronomers were surprised to discover that the x-ray

Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-112 launched from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 2:46 
p.m. (CDT). The Shuttle’s crew included Commander Jeffrey S. Ashby, Pilot Pamela A. Melroy, 
and crew members Sandra H. Magnus, Piers J. Sellers, David A. Wolf, and Fyodor N. 
Yurchikhin. STS-112’s major objective was to deliver and install the Starboard One (S1) Truss, 
the second segment of the ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure. Astronauts Sellers and Wolf planned 
to make three spacewalks during the installation missiondesignated ISS Assembly Mission 
9Ato install and activate the truss. Other mission objectives included transferring experiments 
and payloads from Atlantis to the ISS, deploying the station’s second S-Band communications 
system, and installing external camera systems.303 
 
Scientists from California Institute of Technology announced that they had used NASA’s HST to 
measure the true size of an orbiting, planet-like body beyond Pluto. The sphere was the most 
distant object that a telescope had measured within Earth’s solar system. Like its neighbor Pluto, 
the object, which is nearly 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth, lies in the Kuiper 
Belt, an icy debris field that extends 7 billion miles (11.3 billion kilometers) beyond the orbit of 
Neptune. Using the HST, scientists Michael E. Brown and Chadwick A. Trujillo were able to 
determine several properties of the sphere, including its diameter of 780 miles (1,250 
kilometers). Although too small to be a planet, the sphere, which Brown and Trujillo named 
Quaoarafter a creation deity of the Native American Tongva peoplehas planet-like traits that 
Pluto lacks. For example, Brown and Trujillo found that Quaoar has a circular orbit around the 
Sun and is in the same plane as the other planets in Earth’s solar system. Brown and Trujillo 
announced their findings at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s Division 
for Planetary Sciences.304 
 
8 October 
Astronomer Riccardo Giacconi received the Nobel Prize in physics for research on cosmic x-ray 
radiation. Giacconi’s projects had included NASA-funded research leading to his discovery of 
cosmic x-ray sources. A professor at Johns Hopkins University, Giacconi had been the first 
scientist to discover a source of x-rays outside Earth’s solar system and the first to prove that the 
universe contained background radiation of x-ray light. In addition, many astronomers believed 
that x-ray sources Giacconi had discovered contained black holes. Giacconi had also been 
responsible for the conception and design of the first x-ray satellite and the first operating x-ray 
telescope. Together with Harvey Tananbaum, he had proposed the design of the x-ray telescope 
that eventually became NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. Moreover, Giacconi had been the 
first Director of the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute and the Principal Investigator for

NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe and U.S. Air Force Undersecretary Peter Teets jointly 
announced that NASA and the DOD would have closer links, beginning with the FY 2004 
budget. Major media reported that the two officials had not provided specific details concerning 
the association between NASA and the DOD. Although O’Keefe remarked that the collaboration 
might not require a formalized plan, the two officials stated that NASA and the DOD would 
integrate research and development efforts on projects such as space-based radar, 
communications satellites, and the Strategic Launch Initiative (SLI) to develop a reusable launch 
vehicle (RLV) to replace the Space Shuttle.306

Crew members of Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-112 and the ISS installed the first Starboard truss 
segment, the S1 Truss, connecting it with the ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure. Installation of the 
45-foot-long (13.7-meter-long) S1 Truss was the mission’s main objective. Astronauts David A. 
Wolf and Piers J. Sellers accomplished the task during three spacewalks, with astronauts Peggy 
A. Whitson and Sandra H. Magnus operating the ISS’s robotic arm to attach the S1 to the central 
truss segment, the S0 Truss. The astronauts also installed the Crew and Equipment Translation 
Aid, a cart that runs on rails along the top of the truss.307

A Russian Space Agency launch failed, when an uncrewed Soyuz-U rocket exploded after the 
rocket’s engine automatically shut down, 29 seconds after liftoff from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in 
Russia. The rocket was carrying a Foton-M1 spacecraft with 44 microgravity experiments that 
ESA, Japan, Russia, and the United States had intended for the ISS. ESA stated that it planned to 
rebuild the Foton-M1 spacecraft for a later launch.308

NASA engineers completed a successful demonstration of a solar-powered UAV for remote-
sensing applications. Engineers with NASA’s Suborbital Airborne Sciences programs had 
guided the Pathfinder-Plus UAV throughout a flight lasting nearly 4 hours, during which the 
aircraft had captured more than 300 high-resolution digital images of a coffee plantation on the 
Hawaiian island of Kauai. NASA had developed the UAV for Earth science research, but project 
engineers described the flight demonstration as evidence that their integration of the UAV 
technology with decision-support systems would have additional practical applications. For 
example, project engineers hoped that the UAV technology might eventually enable farmers and 
ranchers to produce harvests more effectively and efficiently. The solar-powered UAV had a

ESA launched the International Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) observatory 
from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, at 10:41 a.m., local time12:41 a.m. (EST). ESA had 
designed the satellite, and Italy’s Alenia Spazio had developed it, with support from more than 
30 European firms. INTEGRAL would study dense objects that are sources of high-energy 
radiation, such as neutron stars and black holes. Project scientists hoped that INTEGRAL would 
produce images that would help confirm the presence of black holes at the center of galaxies, 
beginning with the Milky Way. INTEGRAL had two main instruments for analyzing gamma-ray 
sources: the Spectrometer on INTEGRAL, or SPI spectrometer, and the Imager on Board the 
INTEGRAL Satellite, or IBIS imager. The spectrometer and imager had an extremely sharp 
angular resolution, enabling them to conduct spectral analyses with an energy resolution 40 times 
better than that provided by any previous satellite. INTEGRAL also carried an x-ray imager and 
a charged-coupled device (CCD) imager that operated within the visible spectrum waveband. 
Using the combined data from the four instruments, project scientists would be able to make 
simultaneous observations of high-energy phenomena, from visible light to gamma rays.310 
 
NASA appointed Michael U. Rudolphi as Deputy Director for NASA’s SSC. NASA 
administrators stated that the selection was part of the “One NASA” initiative of enhancing 
partnerships among NASA’s various centers. Rudolphi would assume the post after the launch of 
Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-113, scheduled for liftoff in November 2002. Since January 
2000, Rudolphi had managed the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor Project at NASA’s MSFC. He 
had begun his career with NASA in 1998 as Facility Manager for MSFC’s Advanced Solid 
Rocket Motor Project. Before joining NASA, Rudolphi had been a manager of the contractor 
plant for the Solid Rocket Booster Project at NASA’s KSC.311

Space Shuttle Atlantis landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:44 a.m. (CDT), 
marking the end of STS-112. During the mission, Atlantis’s crew had conducted joint operations 
with the ISS Expedition 5 crew, including the installation of the S1 Truss to the ISS’s Integrated 
Truss Structure. Astronauts Piers J. Sellers and David A. Wolf had performed three spacewalks 
to install the truss. In addition, the Shuttle’s crew members had transferred cargo to the ISS and 
had used the Shuttle’s thruster jets to raise the station’s orbit. The mission’s total duration was 10 
days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.312

NASA announced that it would delay the selection of designs for the RLV that would replace the 
Space Shuttle under the US$4.8 billion SLI program. NASA had planned to select a pool of 
proposed designs in November 2002, eventually limiting the pool to two designs before 2006. 
However, a NASA official said that NASA had slowed the selection process while awaiting the 
results of studies on various unresolved issues with the SLI program. The results of those studies 
could affect the program’s objectives, as well as the design of the RLV that NASA planned.313 
 
25 October 
A group of astronomers, including NASA’s Christophe Dumas, announced the discovery of a 
new moon orbiting the planet Uranus. S/2001 U 1 was Uranus’s 21st confirmed moon, one of six 
Uranian moons with an irregular orbit on a different orbital plane from that of the planet’s other 
moons. Moons with irregular orbits are hard to find, because they tend to be very distant from 
the planet they orbit and are so faint that they are difficult to distinguish from stars. The six 
Uranian moons with irregular orbits were the planet’s smallest moons, ranging in size from 10 to 
20 kilometers (6 to 12 miles) in diameter. Scientists theorized that these smaller moons were the 
result of collisions that had occurred during the early stages of planetary formation.314 
 
28 October 
The ISS’s international partners made several decisions during a meeting held in Houston, 
Texas. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss the provision of crew return vehicles (CRVs) for 
the ISS and plans for the station’s construction, through 2008. NASA announced that the 
collaborating space agencies had agreed to a modified launch schedule for components provided 
by Canada, Japan, and ESA. In addition, they had discussed the possibility of Russia’s 
continuing to provide Soyuz CRVs until NASA had completed the construction of a replacement 
vehicle.315 
 
31 October 
The Russian Space Agency launched the Soyuz TMA-1 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, 
Kazakhstan, at 8:11 a.m., local time10:11 p.m. (EST). The launch was officially designated 
ISS Mission 5S. Soyuz TMA-1 was the first of a newly modified version of the Soyuz spacecraft, 
offering improved safety features and accommodation for crew members of a larger range of 
sizes. In addition, Soyuz TMA-1 was an automatic passenger craft intended to replace Soyuz TM-
34 as the ISS’s escape craft. The Russian Space Agency had been sending Soyuz vehicles to the 
ISS every six months as CRVs for scientists residing on the ISS. Soyuz TMA-1’s crew consisted 
of Commander Sergei V. Zalyotin and two crew members, Russian cosmonaut Yuri V. 
Lonchakov and Belgian ESA astronaut Frank De Winne. The mission’s primary purpose was to 
provide a CRV for the ISS; however, Soyuz TMA-1’s crew also planned to conduct scientific 
experiments with the ISS Expedition 5 members. ISS crew would conduct most of these 
experiments under a commercial contract between Russia and ESA.316

Scientists obtained the first measurements ever taken of the dimensions and compositional matter 
of a neutron star, providing important new information about the fundamental nature of matter 
and energy. Using ESA’s XMM-Newton space telescope, Jean Cottam of NASA’s GSFC and 
other researchers captured the first measurements of the gravitational redshift of a neutron star. 
Gravitational redshift occurs when an intense gravitational field such as that of a neutron star 
warps light or other electromagnetic radiation. Thus, by calculating the star’s redshift, the 
scientists were able to estimate its gravity, compositional material, and other characteristics. The 
researchers found that the star EXO 0748-676 is likely composed of normal nuclear matter, as 
scientists had previously theorized. The researchers’ observations regarding neutron stars, 
specifically, and matter and energy, generally, occurred under conditions that scientists are 
unable to replicate on Earth. The researchers thought that the findings might reveal new 
information about the creation of the universe, because, theoretically, the temperature and 
pressure of neutron stars is similar to the temperature and pressure that was present just one 
second after the Big Bang.317 
 
7 November 
George W. S. Abbey, Special Assistant to NASA’s Administrator and former Director of 
NASA’s JSC, announced his retirement from NASA effective 3 January 2003. Abbey had begun 
his career at JSC in 1964 as a U.S. Air Force officer. He had served as Director of JSC and had 
become a high-level manager for the ISS project. In 2001 he had left the post because of the 
soaring costs of the ISS.318

protected Aeronautical Radio Navigation System frequency band and secure operational military 
codes for military aircraft. The Air Force had also intended the GPS IIF to be compatible with 
the U.S. Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). Boeing had designed the 
GPS IIF to accommodate incremental technology upgrades, enabling the satellites to serve both 
the immediate needs of the GPS IIF program and the long-term needs of the planned next 
generation satellite system, GPS III.319

President George W. Bush released details of NASA’s new Integrated Space Transportation Plan 
(ISTP) in an amendment to his budget request for FY 2003. The ISTP included a number of 
changes in NASA’s spaceflight programs that, together, would encompass a comprehensive 
effort to coordinate NASA’s investments in the ISS, the Space Shuttle program, and the 
replacement vehicle for the Shuttle. The new plan would provide more resources for completing 
the assembly of the ISS, as well as an increase in the number of annual Shuttle flights to the ISS. 
Shuttle flights to the ISS would increase from four to five flights annually, enabling transport of 
more researchers and more science-based payloads. Moreover, the ISTP would restructure the 
Space Launch Initiative (SLI), making the program’s immediate objective the development of 
the Orbital Space Plane (OSP), rather than development of a replacement vehicle for the Space 
Shuttle. The OSP, which would be smaller than the Shuttle, would function as both the crew 
transport vehicle and the emergency escape vehicle for the ISS, and NASA would use the 
Shuttles for heavy cargo delivery. NASA stressed that, although the ISTP would change NASA’s 
five-year budget plan, the program’s costs would remain within the original FY 2003 budget.320 
 
18 November 
The Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry released its final report 
on the industry’s health and future well-being. President George W. Bush had created the 
Commission, composed of aerospace industry executives, lawyers, and policy analysts, to 
analyze the U.S. aerospace industry’s stability, financial health, and relationship to national 
security. The Commission had concluded that the United States should establish a national 
aerospace policy; create a government-wide framework to implement that policy; reduce legal 
and regulatory barriers, to enable the industry to grow and become more internationally 
competitive; and increase investments in the nation’s aerospace industrial base, infrastructure, 
personnel, and long-term research. In addition, the Commission’s report provided numerous 
recommendations to the industry concerning how to meet those objectives, such as increasing 
and sustaining public and private investment in the aerospace industry and aerospace 
technologies, transforming the nation’s air transportation system, and enhancing the defense 
industrial base.321 
 
19 November 
Astronomers discovered a phenomenon that they had previously postulated in theory, but had 
never actually observeda black hole in motion, likely propelled by the explosion of a 
supernova. Using the HST, I. Felix Mirabel, of France’s Atomic Energy Commission and 
Argentina’s Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics, and other scientists had determined that 
the black hole GRO J1655-40 was traveling toward Earth at approximately 250,000 miles per 
hour (400,000 kilometers per hour) as it consumed a companion star locked in gravitational orbit 
around the black hole. Although astronomers could not observe the black hole directly, they were

able to infer its velocity, orbit, and other characteristics by observing its companion star and the 
effects of the black hole’s immense gravity on that star. The scientists were able to use the 
calculations of the black hole’s velocity and orbit to determine that a supernova explosion was 
most likely the event that had propelled the black hole into motion.322 
 
20 November 
NASA awarded SLI contracts to Boeing and Lockheed Martin for flight-demonstrator 
technologies. The flight-demonstrator contracts would support development of the future OSP, 
which would serve as both the transport vehicle and the escape vehicle for astronauts assigned to 
the ISS. NASA awarded a contract valued at US$301 million (including options through 2006) 
to Boeing’s Phantom Works Division, to continue developing its X-37 test vehicle. The purpose 
of the X-37 was to test technologies that, eventually, NASA could use in the OSP. NASA 
awarded another contract worth US$53 million (including options through 2006) to Lockheed 
Martin, to develop a reusable, launchpad-abort demonstrator. The demonstrator, an escape 
module capable of recognizing problems and evacuating crew within seconds, would assist 
crews to escape emergencies occurring on the launchpad.323 
 
Boeing successfully launched its first Delta 4 rocket, which the U.S. Air Force would use in 
2003 in the EELV program. The purpose of the EELV program was to develop reliable and cost-
efficient launch capabilities for commercial and government payloads. The launch occurred at 
5:39 p.m. (EST) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Delta 4, a “Medium+” 
configuration of Boeing’s five-member Delta 4 family of rockets, deployed Eutelsat’s (European 
Telecommunications Satellite Organization’s) commercial telecommunications satellite W5 into 
geosynchronous transfer orbit. During the next scheduled Delta 4 launch―the first mission for 
the EELV program―the Air Force planned to use a Delta 4 Medium rocket to deploy the DSCS 
III A3 satellite for the Defense Satellite Communication System.324 
 
23 November 
Space Shuttle Endeavour STS-113 launched from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 
6:50 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST). The Shuttle’s crew members comprised Commander 
James D. Wetherbee and astronauts Kenneth D. Bowersox, Nikolai M. Budarin, John Bennett 
Herrington, Paul S. Lockhart, Michael Lopez-Alegria, and Donald R. Pettit. The primary 
objective of STS-113, also designated as Station Assembly Flight 11A, was to transport the crew 
of Expedition 6―Bowersox, Budarin, and Pettit―to the ISS and return the crew of Expedition 5

Integrated Truss Structure. The structure would eventually house the ISS’s solar arrays and 
would carry power, data, and temperature controls for the station’s electronics. In addition, STS-

NASA completed an agreement with California Institute of Technology for the university to 
continue operating NASA’s JPL. The cost-plus-award-fee contract, valued at approximately 
US$8 billion, extended an existing agreement with California Institute of Technology for five 
years beyond its planned expiration date of 30 September 2003. The agreement also contained a 
provision to extend the contract performance period for an additional five years based on 
performance reviews. In addition, NASA and the California Institute of Technology restored full 
management of the Deep Space Network to JPL, allowing JPL to review and comment on any of 
NASA policies that affected JPL’s performance. According to NASA, the new contract reflected 
its “One NASA” initiative, intended to align JPL’s policies and procedures more closely with 
those of other NASA centers.326

A Russian Kosmos-3M rocket launched the first Algerian spacecraft, AlSAT-1, from Plesetsk 
Cosmodrome in Russia. The Algerian Space Agency (Agence Spatiale Algérienne) had designed 
the 92-kilogram (202-pound), imaging microsatellite to provide multispectral, medium-
resolution images for remote-sensing purposes, particularly the monitoring of natural disasters. 
The Algerian Space Agency intended AlSAT-1 as the first of five microsatellites for a program 
called the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.327 
 
30 November 
Crew members of STS-113 completed the installation of the P1 Truss segment, attaching it to the 
ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure. The installation entailed the use of the Shuttle’s and the ISS’s 
robotic arms, as well as three spacewalks, which astronauts John Bennett Herrington and 
Michael Lopez-Alegria performed. STS-113’s crew attached the 45-foot-long (13.7-meter-long), 
14-ton (12,700-kilogram or 12.7-tonne) P1 Truss to the port side of the Starboard Zero (S0) 
Truss, the centerpiece of the Integrated Truss Structure. The P1 was the third segment of planned 
ISS equipment that would eventually include 11 contiguous truss structures. This particular truss 
segment contained the ISS’s Active Thermal Control System, scheduled for activation in 2003; 
one of two Ultra High Frequency Communications systems on the ISS; and a Thermal Radiator 
Rotary Joint intended to provide mechanical and electrical energy to rotate the ISS’s heat-
rejecting radiators.328

1 December 
The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Space Commercialization (OSC) published a 
report on potential markets for suborbital reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). The study was a 
follow-up to earlier OSC efforts concerning commercial space opportunities, efforts that had 
identified suborbital space transportation as a potentially viable market. The report examined 14 
different suborbital RLVs and the existing and emerging markets those systems could create. The 
authors had determined that the advent of an operational suborbital RLV could create numerous 
new markets in fields such as military surveillance and commercial Earth-imaging. In addition, 
the advent of suborbital RLVs with dual-use capabilities could serve multiple emerging markets, 
offering customers significantly lower costs. Moreover, the expansion of such markets could 
contribute to lower operating and manufacturing costs for RLVs. The Aerospace Corporation 
had written the report under contract with the OSC, submitting it in October 2002.329 
 
Astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the European Southern 
Observatory published research detailing their discovery of a diffuse emission of x-rays from a 
cluster of forming stars known as RCW 38. The new discovery contrasted with astronomers’ 
conventional understanding of bodies that commonly emit high-energy particles, namely 
supernovas and exploding stars in the intense magnetic fields surrounding neutron stars and 
black holes. The astronomers, using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, had discovered that 
neither type of body was evident in the RCW 38 stellar region, which is, instead, an area of 
active star formation. Although the scientists remained uncertain about the source of the x-rays, 
as well as the effects of the x-rays on the star cluster, they hypothesized that these x-rays could 
affect the chemistry of the bodies that would form planets around the stars in the cluster.330 
 
3 December 
NASA announced that Russian cosmonaut Alexander Y. Kaleri would replace Sergei I. 
Moschenko as a member of the ISS Expedition 7 crew. Russian officials had proposed the 
change to the Multilateral Crew Operations Panel, which formally certified and assigned ISS 
crew, and the panel had formally approved the proposal on 10 October 2002. Kaleri had served 
three separate missions on the Russian space station Mir between 1992 and 2000. In addition to 
Kaleri, the Expedition 7 crew would include U.S. astronaut Edward T. Lu and Russian 
cosmonaut Yuri I. Malenchenko.331

NASA successfully launched the third replenishment spacecraft for its Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite (TDRS) fleet. The TDRS-J satellite launched aboard an Atlas 2A rocket from Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, at 9:42 p.m. (EST). TDRS satellites comprised a communication-signal relay 
system providing tracking and data-acquisition services between low Earth-orbiting spacecraft 
and ground-based control and data-processing facilities. The TDRS satellite system served 
numerous NASA programs, including the HST, the ISS, and the Space Shuttle. NASA had 
launched the first TDRS satellite in 1983.332 
 
6 December 
The five partner space agencies of the ISSthe Canadian Space Agency, ESA, NASA, Japan’s 
NASDA, and the Russian Space Agency approved the 2002 Program Action Plan for the ISS 
at a meeting held in Tokyo, Japan. The partner agencies agreed to expand the station’s 
capabilities, to increase the number of permanent ISS crew members, and to provide additional 
crew rescue vehicles. They also agreed to a process for selecting an ISS configuration, once the 
ISS had accommodated the remaining components. In this process, each of the station’s partner 
agencies would make additional programmatic and technical assessments, cost estimations, and 
internal budget reviews. In addition, the agencies announced that they would approve a station 
configuration option by March 2003, select a revised configuration by June or July 2003, and 
agree upon a final configuration by December 2003.333 
 
NASA announced the selection of Boeing’s Delta 2 expendable launch vehicle to launch 
medium-class payloads between 2006 and 2009. The selection was part of an existing NASA 
launch-services contract with Boeing that had a maximum value of US$1.2 billion, if NASA 
exercised all options. The procurement contract called for 12 definite launches, with options for 
an additional seven. Boeing’s rockets would launch both NASA’s payloads and NASA-
sponsored payloads.334 
 
7 December 
Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 1:37 p.m. 
(CST), marking the end of Mission STS-113. During the mission, Endeavour’s crew had 
attached the Port 1 (P1) Truss to the ISS’s Integrated Truss Structure, in an installation that 
included three spacewalks by crew members John Bennett Herrington and Michael Lopez-
Alegria. Shuttle and Expedition crews had also transferred 4,340 pounds (1,969 kilograms) of 
cargo between the Shuttle and the ISS. In addition, Endeavour had transported the Expedition 6 
crew to the station, returning the crew of Expedition 5 to Earth. The total duration of STS-113 
was 13 days, 18 hours, and 47 minutes.335

NASA announced the selection of crew members for three ISS missions scheduled for 2003 and 
2004. The crew of STS-118 would include Mission Commander Scott J. Kelly and crew 
members Charles O. Hobaugh, Barbara R. Morgan, Lisa M. Nowak, Scott E. Parazynski, and 
Dafydd Rhys Williams. Morgan, who had trained as Christa McAuliffe’s backup for the ill-fated 
Challenger Shuttle, would be the first teacher in space under NASA’s new Educator Astronaut 
Program. NASA hoped that the program would inspire students to become space explorers. The 
second mission, STS-119, would comprise Commander Steven W. Lindsey and U.S. astronauts 
Michael L. Gernhardt, Mark E. Kelly, and Carlos I. Noriega. STS-119 would also include ISS 
Expedition 9’s Station Commander Gennady I. Padalka and crew members E. Michael Fincke 
and Oleg D. Kononenko. Crew for STS-120 would be Commander James D. Halsell and 
astronauts Michael J. Foremen, Wendy B. Lawrence, Alan G. Poindexter, Piers J. Sellers, and 
Stephanie D. Wilson.336 
 
17 December 
NASA announced that, although they were continuing inspections, technicians had found no 
similar cracks in other Shuttles after they had discovered a crack in one of Shuttle Discovery’s 
parts. Engineers had discovered the first crack during standard inspections of Atlantis and 
Discovery in June 2002. The fissures were in small metal balls, a component of a liquid oxygen 
line. According to a NASA spokesperson, engineers had completed inspections of Atlantis, but 
inspections of Discovery would remain on hold until inspectors had finished examining 
Endeavour. However, NASA had no plans to inspect Columbia.337 
 
20 December 
After several unsuccessful attempts to contact the Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) satellite, 
NASA and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory concluded that CONTOUR 
was lost. The objectives of the CONTOUR mission had been to maneuver to a distance of 60 
kilometers (100 miles) from at least two comets, capturing high-resolution images and 
performing various compositional analyses of the comets’ near-nucleus-environment 
compositional material. NASA had launched CONTOUR on 3 July 2002 but had lost contact 
with the satellite on 15 August 2002 after a maneuver intended to shift CONTOUR from Earth 
orbit to an orbit in which it would encounter the comet Encke.338

an overall C-5 modernization program to upgrade the plane’s communications, navigation, and 
air-traffic-control surveillance equipment. The program’s objectives were to improve the C-5’s 
reliability and to satisfy emerging air-traffic-management requirements, so that the C-5 would be 
able to operate in global airspace without restrictions. During the 5-hour test flight, the crew

demonstrated the craft’s basic flying qualities and navigational system, verified new primary 
flight displays, and engaged in initial testing of stability-augmentation operations. Lockheed 
Martin planned to introduce additional components of the new, automatic flight-control system 
and the Global Air Traffic Management–compliant systems. After completing installation of the 
AMP components, Lockheed Martin planned to commence the second phase of the C-5 
modernization, known as the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program.339 
 
23 December 
NASA announced the backup crew members for ISS Expedition 10, including Jeffrey N. 
Williams, acting as backup for the ISS station commander, Russian cosmonaut Konstantin M. 
Kozeev, and U.S. astronaut Sunita L. Williams. The primary crew members for Expedition 10 
were ISS Commander Leroy Chiao, U.S. astronaut John L. Phillips, and Russian cosmonaut 
Salizhan S. Sharipov.340 
 
With the aid of NASA’s High Energy Transient Explorer (HETE), scientists were able to capture 
the first images ever taken of an unusual gamma-ray burst (GRB) that signals the birth of a new 
black hole. With the exception of the Big Bang, GRBs are the most powerful type of explosion 
known. The bursts last for only a few seconds, yet their afterglows can last for days or even 
longer. However, scientists had been unable to detect an optical afterglow produced by a fast-
fading type of dark GRB―until the HETE indicated that such a burst was occurring. NASA had 
created the satellite to alert ground-based observatories to GRBs. On 11 December 2002, HETE 
had detected a GRB and, within 22 seconds, had notified observatories of the event’s location. In 
the following minutes, ground-based telescopes captured images of the burst’s afterglow, which 
disappeared in 2 hours. The event was a rare subcategory of dark GRBs known as a transitional 
bursta burst with an afterglow lasting longer than that of the short-duration type, but shorter 
than that of a long-duration burst. Moreover, these transitional bursts are the rarest type of GRB. 
Scientists hoped the images would help them learn more about the causes of GRB in general, as 
well as providing specific data indicating the reason that dark bursts have no detectable 
afterglow.341 
 
31 December 
The Space Shuttle Competitive Source Task Force released its final report on the potential for 
private-sector operation of the Shuttle program. NASA had commissioned the Task Force to 
analyze the roles of NASA and its contractors with regard to Space Shuttle operations. More 
specifically, the Task Force had assessed various scenarios in which NASA would focus 
primarily on spaceflight research and development, outsourcing to the private sector the 
operation of the planned replacements of the Shuttles for routine transit to low Earth orbit. The 
Task Force had concluded that, although NASA faced numerous challenges to competitive 
sourcing for the Shuttle program, it should pursue some form of this option. Moreover, the panel

suggested that the most likely scenario for successful private-sector involvement in the Shuttle 
program would not involve private operation of the program, but rather a transfer of program 
assets to private entities at highly deflated prices. Another option would entail the restructuring 
of existing contracts, perhaps taking steps to expand the pool of program suppliers beyond the 
existing duopoly of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. In addition, as a first step to privatization, 
NASA could establish a space authority to operate the Shuttle, as well as future human 
transportation vehicles.342

A reentry section of the People’s Republic of China’s Shenzhou 4 spacecraft landed in Inner 
Mongolia after Shenzhou 4 had orbited Earth for nearly a week. Phillip Clark, a U.K. observer of 
China’s space program, remarked that the Shenzhou 4 mission was key to flying Chinese 
astronauts in the future, noting that orbital control of the craft during this flight had been far 
tighter than in the two preceding tests. Furthermore, during two back-to-back Shenzhou launches, 
the Chinese had completed all the maneuvers necessary for a rendezvous and docking mission, 
indicating that China would progress quickly to an orbital docking. Clark predicted that either 
Shenzhou 7 or Shenzhou 8 would complete a nose-to-nose docking.343 
 
6 January 
After a series of delays, a Titan 2 rocket carried into orbit the U.S. military’s Coriolis research 
satellite, launching from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The refurbished Titan 2 
intercontinental ballistic missile placed the spacecraft in orbit 5½ minutes after launch, and the 
rocket’s second stage deployed its payload approximately 1 hour later. The US$224 million 
Coriolis mission carried the Navy’s Windsat microwave polarimetric radiometer and the Air 
Force’s Solar Mass Ejection Imager. The U.S. military had designed Windsat to measure wind 
speed and direction at or near the surface of Earth’s seas, providing improved weather 
forecasting to assist in planning naval operations. The Air Force intended the Solar Mass 
Ejection Imager to provide “an early warning of coronal mass ejections from the Sun that impact 
Earth, disrupting communications and power grids.”344 
 
The Arianespace Flight 157 Inquiry Board submitted its report to Arianespace, establishing the 
most probable cause of the failure of an Ariane 5 ECA on the night of 11/12 December 2002. 
The Board had analyzed all measurements recorded during Flight 157 and had reviewed all 
documentation concerning production, quality, and technical records for the Ariane 5 
ECA―which used a Vulcain 2 engine―as well as the documentation for all Ariane 5 flights to 
date. The Board had identified a leak in the Vulcain 2 nozzle’s cooling circuit during the first 
flight phase. The leak had caused critical overheating of the nozzle, a loss of integrity, and a 
major imbalance in the thrust of the Vulcain 2 engine, leading to the loss of control over the

launcher’s trajectory. The Board concluded that two aggravating factors, occurring 
simultaneously, had caused the failure: “degraded thermal condition of the nozzle due to fissures 
in the cooling tubes” and “non-exhaustive definition of the loads to which the Vulcain 2 engine 
is subjected during flight.” Although its review of the operating data from the Vulcain 1 engine’s 
successful flights identified no weakness in the functioning and resistance of the nozzle, the 
Board recommended a thorough review of the Ariane 5. Upon learning the factors involved in 
the failure of Ariane 5 ECA, Arianespace decided to create a board to study the upcoming 14 
January launch of Rosetta. ESA had timed the mission to enable Rosetta to rendezvous with the 
comet Wirtanen.345 
 
7 January 
NASA announced that the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the HST had used “a 
natural ‘zoom lens’ in space to boost its view of the distant universe,” revealing remote galaxies 
previously beyond HST’s reach. For more than 13 hours, the camera had concentrated on one of 
the most massive known galaxy clusters, Abell 1689, located more than 2.2 billion light-years 
away. In combination with dark matter, Abell 1689’s gravity behaves as a 2 million light-year–
wide lens in space, bending and magnifying the light of the galaxies behind it. The HST image 
captured hundreds of galaxies10 times more arcs than a ground-based telescope could 
reveal“smeared by the gravitational bending of light into a spider-web tracing of blue and red 
arcs of light.” Scientists intended to use the image map to study the distribution of dark matter in 
galaxy clusters and to trace the history of star formation in the universe over the past 13 billion 
years. NASA deemed the image “an exquisite demonstration of Albert Einstein’s prediction that 
gravity warps space and therefore distorts a beam of light.”346 
 
GenCorp Inc.’s company Aerojet, a member of the Rocket Based Combined Cycle Consortium 
(RBC3), announced that NASA and RBC3 had successfully completed the first in a series of 
tests of a full-scale rocket thrust. Conducted at Aerojet facilities in Sacramento, California, the 
test demonstrated the first successful hot fire of a thruster using a mix of decomposed peroxide, 
liquid peroxide, and JP-7 jet fuel to generate combustion―a key milestone in NASA’s Integrated 
System Test of an Air-breathing Rocket (ISTAR) program. The ISTAR program sought to flight-
test a self-powered hypersonic flight vehicle at more than six times the speed of sound by the end 
of the decade. The program was part of NASA’s effort to develop hypersonic technologies by 
2025, to create flight vehicles that could provide safe, routine, and affordable space access and 
air transportation to anywhere on the globe in less than 2 hours.347

infrared wavelengths, observing the cosmic backlight of the universe, as well as asymptotic giant 
branch stars. Although astronomers in the field had conducted significant research on the 
backlight data, they had done little with COBE’s infrared data on the stars.348 
 
12 January 
A Delta 2 rocket carried NASA’s Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) into orbit, 
launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. ICESat was one in a series of Earth 
Observing System (EOS) spacecraft to follow the Terra satellite, launched in December 1999, 
and the Aqua satellite, launched in May 2002. NASA had designed the 661-pound (299.8-
kilogram) craft to measure the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, so that scientists could 
determine whether global sea levels were rising or falling. The craft’s only instrument, the 
Geoscience Laser Altimeter System, would beam rapid pulses of laser light to the icy surface, 
and the ice sheets would reflect the light back to the satellite, acting like radar. The GPS would 
determine the ICESat’s location as it fired its laser, enabling program scientists to measure the 
ice sheets’ topography. The rocket also carried a second, smaller craft into orbitCHIPSat, 
NASA’s 131-pound (59-kilogram), University Explorer Class probe, the Cosmic Hot Interstellar 
Plasma Spectrometer. CHIPSat would gather data on the origin, physical processes, and 
properties of the hot gas between stars. The CHIPSat mission was the first U.S. mission to use 
end-to-end satellite operations over the Internet, treating the craft “something like a node on the 
Internet.”349 
 
13 January 
NASA announced that a two-year collaboration between researchers at Stanford University and 
NASA’s ARC had resulted in a successful test of an alternative paraffin-based rocket fuel 
intended to increase operational safety, reduce costs as compared to solid fuels, and, eventually, 
to provide the fuel in Space Shuttle booster rockets. The researchers had developed a nontoxic, 
easily handled fuel, producing as by-products carbon dioxide and water, rather than the 
aluminum oxide and acidic gases that conventional rocket fuel produces. Arif Karabeyoglu had 
led Stanford University’s contribution to the fuel research, developing the theory of a fast-
burning, low-cost, paraffin-based fuel in his doctoral thesis, which Stanford and NASA had 
partially funded. The testing series had begun on 24 September 2001 at ARC’s Hybrid 
Combustion Facility, a heavy-duty test chamber capable of accommodating pressures of up to 60 
atmospheres. The first phase of the testing program had consisted of approximately 40 runs.350

14 January 
Arianespace and ESA announced that, because of the failure of Ariane 5 Flight 157, they had 
postponed the launch of the Rosetta spacecraft. Arianespace had designed Rosetta to rendezvous 
with the comet Wirtanen, in a mission that would have included a journey lasting eight years, 
followed by a two-year study of the comet. Rosetta’s launch had presented several challenges, 
requiring the Ariane 5 rocket’s upper stage to “undertake its first-ever ballistic coast phase before 
being ignited, a [2]-hour-long sequence.” Although launch officials had not planned to launch 
the spacecraft aboard an Ariane 5 ECA, the type of rocket that had exploded shortly after launch 
in December 2002, Rosetta’s launch vehicle was not standard. Arianespace had modified its 
equipment bay and electrical system. The postponement would cause Rosetta to miss the launch 
window for the rendezvous with Wirtanen; therefore, mission scientists would search for a new 
comet for the study and would redesign the mission.351 
 
15 January 
NASA announced that scientist David Atlas of NASA’s GSFC and University of Colorado 
scientist Christopher Williams had created the first “full-body scan” of an evolving tropical 
thunderstorm, using data collected from an unusual storm over the Amazon rain forest, which 
had occurred in February 1999. At that time, a team of scientists from NASA, NOAA, the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, and several universities had used sensitive radar 
equipment, such as scanning Doppler and vertically oriented Doppler, to detect and measure 
different types of particles from the storm’s base to its top, approximately 8.7 miles (14 
kilometers) above the rainforest floor. Participants from the University of North Dakota had 
operated a jet aircraft to gather some of the data. One of the study’s goals had been validating the 
Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite measurements, to help plan the TRMM’s 
successor, the Global Precipitation Mission. TRMM had provided data about how such storms 
operate, thus enabling scientists to understand how wind circulates in the upper atmosphere. The 
research, which Atlas and Williams had published in the American Meteorological Society’s 
Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, provided new insight into the intense and hazardous conditions 
within storms. Scientists expected the research to improve forecasts, helping aircraft avoid 
dangerous storms and making air travel safer, and to improve satellite measurements of 
precipitation.352 
 
As part of Expedition 6, American astronauts Donald D. Pettit and Kenneth R. Bowersox 
undertook a spacewalk outside the ISS, each spacewalking for the first time, while their Russian 
colleague Nikolai M. Budarin monitored their work from inside the station. Pettit had replaced 
Budarin in the spacewalk lineup because NASA doctors were concerned about Budarin’s known 
cardiovascular issues. In the summer of 2003, Pettit had served as backup for another astronaut 
in an ISS mission, because NASA doctors were worried about that astronaut’s radiation 
exposure. NASA had decided to replace Budarin even though Russian doctors disagreed, 
because NASA was in charge of this spacewalk. During the 7-hour spacewalk, the two astronauts 
successfully completed their primary tasksreleasing locks on a recently installed radiator and

16 January 
Space Shuttle Columbia launched on STS-107 from NASA’s KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 
10:39 a.m. (EST). NASA had postponed the launch, originally scheduled for July 2001, because 
of technical and scheduling problems. Flying an orbital mission, a rare event since the ISS 
partners had begun construction of the space station in 1998, STS-107 was a “pure research 
mission.” The crew would conduct scientific investigations in two 12-hour shifts each day in the 
laboratory module of the Shuttle’s cargo bay. The crew included Shuttle Commander Rick D. 
Husband; Pilot William C. McCool; Payload Commander Michael P. Anderson; Payload 
Specialist Ilan Ramon, Israel’s first astronaut and a fighter pilot with the rank of colonel in 
Israel’s Air Force; Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, an aerospace engineer originally from 
India; and Mission Specialists David M. Brown and Laurel B. Clark, both physicians. The launch 
occurred under exceptionally tight security with more than 300 dignitaries and guests from Israel 
in attendance.354 
 
17 January 
The U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) announced that it had awarded a five-
year contract worth up to US$500 million to the Colorado-based companies Space Imaging and 
DigitalGlobe. Under the contract, which stipulated a base performance period of three years with 
two additional one-year options, NIMA agreed to purchase a minimum of US$72 million worth 
of data from DigitalGlobe and a minimum of US$120 million from Space Imaging during the 
first three years. The contract and accompanying agreements marked “the Pentagon’s strongest 
commitment yet to buy products and services from the U.S. commercial satellite imaging 
industry.” Space Imaging, based in Thornton, Colorado, operated the Ikonos satellite launched in 
September 1999, which was capable of distinguishing ground objects as small as 1 meter. 
DigitalGlobe, based in Longmont, Colorado, operated the QuickBird satellite, launched in 
October 1999, which, under certain conditions, was capable of distinguishing objects as small as 
0.61 meter.355 
 
21 January 
NASA launched a nationwide campaign to recruit elementary, middle, and high school 
classroom teachers for its astronaut corps, building on the legacy of its Teacher in Space Project 
of 1985. NASA had selected Christa McAuliffe and Barbara R. Morgan from among 12,000 
applicants for the first project, which had ended tragically when Space Shuttle Challenger 
exploded shortly after launching on 28 January 1986 with McAuliffe on board. McAuliffe’s

backup Barbara R. Morgan had rejoined NASA in 1998 to train and qualify as a mission 
specialist. In December 2002, NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe had announced Morgan’s 
assignment to a November assembly mission to the ISS. NASA planned for the new recruitment 
campaign to extend the legacy of McAuliffe and the work of Morgan, making future educator-
astronauts as much a part of the astronaut corps as test pilots, engineers, physicians, astronomers, 
geologists, and scientists from other disciplines. To accomplish this goal, NASA planned to train 
teachers with proven technical skills, making them eligible for missions ranging from 12-day 
Shuttle flights to months-long residencies aboard the ISS. Because of their ability to 
communicate with students in the classroom more effectively than traditional NASA astronauts, 
the educator-astronauts would be a critical part of an educational initiative to “make math and 
science as inspiring to youngsters as pop music and sports.”356 
 
23 January  
Officials from Boeing and Finmeccanica, an Italian aerospace corporation, signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in a joint ceremony held in Rome and at the Italian 
Embassy in Washington, DC. The purpose of the MOU was to explore joint initiatives and to 
pursue growth opportunities in aerostructures and commercial aircraft, aircraft modification, 
UAVs, satellite systems, navigation, launch services, missile defense, space infrastructure, and 
avionics. The MOU called for the creation of an executive steering committee to investigate the 
possibilities of collaborative activity in space navigation, satellite services, launch services, and 
services to the ISS. The committee would make the final decision about which activities the 
partnership would pursue.357 
 
24 January 
NASA launched SORCE―its Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment satellite―from a Pegasus 
XL rocket dropped from a jet plane 140 miles offshore over the Atlantic Ocean. On board the 
satellite were five instruments designed to help scientists better understand how the Sun affects 
Earth’s climate. SORCE’s high-precision instruments could measure total radiation from the 
Sun, and its spectrometers could analyze light in all its various wavelengths, capturing 
information that scientists hoped would help them build a long-term data set that future 
generations would use.358 
 
28 January 
The crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia joined Mission Control for a moment of silence at 
11:39 a.m. (EST), the exact time that Challenger had exploded after launch 17 years before. The 
astronauts also remembered the three astronauts killed in a launchpad fire in their Apollo 
spacecraft on 27 January 1967. Airwaves also fell silent on the ISS, as the crew of two American 
astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut aboard the space station paused to remember the 
tragedies.359

29 January 
Alain Bensoussan, president of the French space agency, announced that he was resigning from 
his post because he no longer had the support he needed to continue his job. Bensoussan had 
been the “target of increasingly bitter attacks” lodged by frustrated employees who no longer 
perceived a clear direction in the agency’s mission. Bensoussan had also faced the failure of a 
new Ariane 5 rocket and an agency budget that had decreased steadily since 1997, despite the 
addition of new programs. Moreover, the French government had commissioned a report 
evaluating the space agency’s current status and future direction, and the report had been 
“lukewarm in its assessment” of Bensoussan. Following the publication of the report, France’s 
space minister Claudie Haignere had stated that the agency had not yet made a decision about its 
future management. The commission’s findings and the space minister’s statement had not 
provided a strong message of support for Bensoussan’s leadership.360 
 
A Delta 2 rocket launched, carrying a GPS-2R8 satellite and an Experimental Spacecraft System 
(XSS-10) microsatellite into orbit. The U.S. Air Force was launching the GPS-2R8 to replace the 
22nd GPS satellite, which had launched 10 years earlier, joining a constellation of 26 operational 
GPS spacecraft. Although the military GPS created in the 1970s had generated a commercial 
industry with sales in excess of US$6 billion, the system had continued to exist primarily to 
serve the U.S. military. The U.S. Air Force was launching the 62-pound (28-kilogram) XSS-10 
spacecraft to test new guidance and navigation software and to demonstrate new technologies, 
such as a miniature communications system, a lightweight propulsion system, and advanced 
lithium polymer batteries.361 
 
NASA announced its collaboration with Japan’s NASDA and the Japanese Meteorological 
Research Institute to study snowfall over Wakasa Bay, Japan. The study would use NASA’s 
EOS Aqua satellite in conjunction with research aircraft, which would gather data for the study 
using the coastal radar systems. NASA had begun the Wakasa Bay Field Campaign on 3 January 
2003, scheduling the study to run through 14 February 2003. Although, historically, scientists 
had found it difficult to quantify contributions to the global hydrologic cycle from the northern 
Pacific Ocean, they expected that the new satellite instruments, which could detect precipitation 
over water, would provide data needed to interpret the effect of Pacific Ocean hydrology on the 
world.362 
 
30 January 
Israeli scientists announced that, while traveling aboard Space Shuttle Columbia, astronaut Ilan 
Ramon had successfully captured images of smoke from a burning rain forest, a dust storm 
above the Mediterranean Ocean, and a small dust plume off the African coast over the Atlantic 
Ocean. Operating a twin-camera multispectral instrument in Columbia’s payload bay, Ramon 
had scanned dust and other aerosol particles, which storms had blown from deserts and high 
winds had carried across the globe. The instrument had also operated during the night, capturing 
images of the tops of thousands of thunderstorms. The team of scientists from Tel Aviv

University’s Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) intended to use the images to 
develop a better understanding of climate change, one of the goals of Columbia’s research flight, 
which had encountered two years of delays. Joachim Joseph, a principal researcher on the 
project, remarked that the experiment had gathered “very good data, very unique data.” The 
purpose of the US$2 million experiment was to “provide a better understanding of how 
migrating dust plumes affect climate.” 363 
 
31 January 
NASA announced that it had settled negotiations with United Space Alliance, increasing the 
value of its two-year extension of the spaceflight operations contract (SFOC) by US$59.91 
million. The finalized SFOC extension supporting the Space Shuttle Program brought the total 
value of the two-year contract to US$2.90 billion. The extended contract would run through 30 
September 2004.364

1 February 
After completing a 16-day orbital science mission that NASA judged a success, the crew of STS-
107 perished when Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart above Texas during reentry. NASA’s 
Mission Control lost communication with Columbia at 9:00 a.m. (EST) and immediately 
switched to the contingency plan to preserve all flight-activity information. NASA had scheduled 
the landing for 9:16 a.m. (EST). NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe issued a statement 
describing all the steps NASA had taken after the loss of the Shuttle. NASA officials had spoken 
with President George W. Bush and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge; met with 
family members of the crew; assembled an internal mishap investigation team; and appointed a 
mishap investigation board. The board comprised an external group of people independent from 
NASA, charged with examining all the information that Mission Control had locked down when 
it lost communication with Columbia.365 
 
2 February 
Progress M-47 launched atop a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome one day after the 
loss of Space Shuttle Columbia “threw future missions to the orbiting complex in doubt.” The 
launch, scheduled long in advance, took place as “stunned Russian space officials offered 
condolences to their American colleagues.” Russian officials also expressed concern that the loss 
of Columbia and the ensuing suspension of Shuttle missions might place Russia’s “cash-strapped 
space program under more pressure to deliver crews and supplies to the station.” Sergei

Gorbunov, a spokesperson for the Russian Space Agency, explained that Russia had no reserve 
of Soyuz spacecraft. He pointed out that if the U.S. space program intended to use Russian craft 
to transport crews to the ISS, NASA would need to buy Russian Soyuz TMAs, the type of craft 
designed to carry cosmonauts to the ISS. Russia had routinely built only two Soyuz spacecraft 
per year.366 
 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced the members of the Space Shuttle Mishap 
Interagency Investigation Board, also known as the Gehman Board. To chair the Board, NASA 
had appointed retired U.S. Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman Jr., who had cochaired the 
independent commission that investigated the attack on the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, on 12 
October 2000. Other members included Rear Admiral Stephen A. Turcotte of the U.S. Naval 
Safety Center; Major General John L. Barry of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio; 
Major General Kenneth W. Hess of Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico; James N. Hallock 
of the U.S. Department of Transportation; Steven B. Wallace of the FAA; and Brigadier General 
Duane W. Deal of the 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. Several senior-
level NASA leaders were also named to the panel: G. Scott Hubbard, Director of NASA’s ARC; 
Bryan D. O’Connor, NASA’s Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance and a 
former astronaut; and Theron M. Bradley Jr., NASA’s Chief Engineer. NASA intended the 
Gehman Board to make a parallel investigation, complementing NASA’s own internal 
investigation. The Board would have access to the same scientific information and to the 
cooperation of the same agencies as NASA.367 
 
4 February 
Progress M-47/ISS-10P docked with the ISS, delivering 2.75 tons (2.5 tonnes or 2,495 
kilograms) of supplies, which would enable the Expedition 6 crew to remain at the station until 
June without Shuttle support. The crewRussian cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin and American 
astronauts Kenneth D. Bowersox and Donald R. Pettithad served at the outpost for 73 days, 
and NASA had scheduled their return to Earth on Shuttle Atlantis for 1 March. However, in the 
wake of the Columbia disaster, NASA had grounded all Shuttles indefinitely. Although the 
suspension of Shuttle flights did not place the ISS crew in danger, it did affect the schedule of 
space station construction and interrupted NASA’s plan to install a high-speed gyroscope at the 
station in March, to replace one that had broken down in June 2002. With only three operational 
gyroscopes, the ISS would continue to drift, but NASA did not consider the matter a time-critical 
problem.368 
 
Telesat Canada selected Astrium, Europe’s largest space company, to manufacture a replacement 
for its Anik F1 satellitethe Anik F1R. Engineers had determined that the Anik F1, based on the

NASA notified SPACEHAB Inc. that NASA had not renewed SPACEHAB’s contracts for 
building and maintaining the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF), the facility with ISS 
mockups at NASA’s JSC, and for operating the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) facility, 
where astronauts simulate spacewalks in a swimming pool. Instead, NASA had awarded the 
multiyear contract, valued at up to US$78.97 million, to Raytheon Technical Services of 
Houston. SPACEHAB’s subsidiary Johnson Engineering had operated the NBL for 
approximately 10 years. In 1998 SPACEHAB had acquired Johnson Engineering and had 
continued to operate the NBL. SPACEHAB had depended on Johnson Engineering and the 
NBL/SVMF contract for about half of its US$100 million in annual revenues. The loss of the 
contract followed SPACEHAB’s loss of one of its major flight articles, the Research Double 
Module, a pressurized science facility that had made its debut during STS-107 on the ill-fated 
Space Shuttle Columbia. SPACEHAB had insured the module for only US$17.7 million of its 
US$62.7 million value. SPACEHAB expected to contract with NASA to fly additional modules, 
which would enable the company to recoup its investment in the hardware.370

Senator John McCain (R-AZ), chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and 
Transportation, and U.S. Representative Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY), chair of the U.S. House 
Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, cochaired a joint hearing of congressional 
leaders, focusing on the Space Shuttle Columbia accident. Recommendations resulting from the 
hearing prompted NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe to issue a second amendment to the 
charter of the Space Shuttle Accident Investigation Board, an independent panel led by retired 
U.S. Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman Jr. and known as the Columbia Accident Investigation 
Board (CAIB) or, informally, as the Gehman Board. The amendment removed any requirement, 
real or perceived, instructing Gehman to “coordinate or await approval from NASA for any 
dimension of the panel’s investigation.”371

NASA announced that it had positively identified the remains of all seven members of STS-107 
at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and that officials in Angelina County, Texas, had signed 
the death certificates. Eileen Hawley, spokesperson for NASA’s JSC in Houston, said that 
officials had released the crew members’ remains to their families for private memorial services.

NASA had already returned the remains of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon to Israel, where burial 
services had taken place on 11 February.372 
 
NASA issued a statement on behalf of the CAIB announcing that preliminary analysis performed 
by a NASA working group indicated that the temperature level in Columbia’s left wheel well 
during reentry indicated the presence of plasma. Heat transfer related to a missing tile in the 
structure would not have been sufficient to elevate the temperature to the level revealed in the 
preliminary analysis.373 
 
18 February 
NASA announced the Level 1 requirements for the Orbital Space Plane (OSP) system, the next-
generation system of space vehicles designed to transport crews to and from the ISS and to 
provide rescue missions. NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe had proposed the concept in 
November 2002 “as a way to take some of the pressure off the aging space shuttle fleet.” NASA 
had envisioned a simple craft, easier to launch and with greater maneuverability in orbit. 
However, NASA had not intended the OSP system as a substitute for the Shuttle, the only U.S. 
spacecraft able to haul heavy cargo into space. The OSP concept was to include in its first design 
an escape pod for the ISS, ready for use by 2010. Its second version, intended for completion by 
2012 would be a craft capable of transporting people.374 
 
NASA released a newly revised charter for the CAIB, permitting the Board’s chairperson to 
replace its executive secretary with someone not working for NASA. The revision was the third 
attempt to quell congressional concerns about the Board’s independence. Legislators had mixed 
reactions to the new revisionsome saw it as an improvement, but others maintained that the 
charter did little to guarantee a credible inquiry and argued that its provisions might deter 
whistleblowers. U.S. Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN) remarked that the revision had not 
addressed the fundamental problems: NASA had appointed the commission members; NASA 
had staffed the commission; and the commission reported to NASA.375 
 
19 February 
NASA’s Deputy Chief of Staff Scott Pace announced that NASA would not seek a waiver to the 
Iran Non-Proliferation Act of 2000 (Pub.L.No.106-178) The law prohibited NASA from 
purchasing space hardware from Russia unless Russia certified that Russian aerospace 
companies had not aided Iranian missile programs for at least a year. If the White House did not 
grant a waiver, NASA would be unable to buy Russian Progress and Soyuz vehicles―the United 
States’ only viable means of reaching the ISS after the suspension of Shuttle flights. Pace 
explained that NASA would not press the White House for a waiver, because NASA did not

intend “to make foreign policy,” acknowledging that the White House or the U.S. Department of 
State was responsible for seeking changes in the Iran Non-Proliferation Act, if appropriate.376 
 
20 February 
President George W. Bush signed into law an omnibus appropriations bill (Pub.L.No.108-7), 
setting aside US$50 million to help NASA fund its investigation of the Space Shuttle Columbia 
disaster. Taking into account that NASA’s costs could exceed US$50 million to cover the 
investigation and to correct the problems with the Shuttle program, the law allowed NASA to 
seek additional funding if necessary. U.S. Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) initiated discussion about 
the need for additional funding for the Columbia accident investigation, urging senior members 
of the Senate responsible for appropriations to include enough money to help NASA avoid 
further erosion of the already depleted Shuttle funds. The Challenger accident investigation had 
cost the United States US$75 million.377 
 
25 February 
Having received a very weak signal from the Pioneer 10 spacecraft on 22 January 2003, NASA 
announced that it would make no further attempts to contact the craft. On 2 March 1972, NASA 
had launched Pioneer 10, built by TRW Inc., on a three-stage Atlas-Centaur rocket. In just 12 
weeks, Pioneer 10 had traveled beyond Mars, had become the first spacecraft to pass through the 
asteroid belt, and had continued to travel beyond Jupiter into deep space, “venturing into places 
where nothing built by humanity had ever gone before.” Pioneer 10 had last returned telemetry 
data on 27 April 2002. In the previous three attempts of JPL’s Deep Space Network to contact it, 
Pioneer 10 had emitted very weak response signals, and in the last attempt at contact on 7 
February, the Deep Space Network had detected no signal from the spacecraft. Engineers 
reported that Pioneer 10’s radioisotope power source had decayed. Originally, NASA had 
designed Pioneer 10 for a 21-month mission, but the spacecraft had lasted more than 30 years.378 
 
27 February 
NASA researchers announced that the ER-2, a modified U-2 aircraft, had collected tiny 
interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) in Earth’s stratosphere, which likely contained bits of ancient 
stars. The particles, collected over a period of two decades, included the only samples of comets 
that researchers were able to study in a laboratory. Lindsay Keller, a researcher in the Office of 
Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science at NASA’s JSC, remarked that the stardust 
grains were typical of the kind of dust available at the beginning of the solar systemthe 
building blocks of the Sun and planets. Scott Messenger, an astrophysicist at Washington 
University in St. Louis, Missouri, described the IDPs as rich in stardust and molecular cloud 
material, suggesting that the particles had remained essentially unchanged since the solar 
system’s formation. To detect the remnants of the early stars, scientists had used Washington 
University’s new type of ion microprobe, which measured isotopic ratios on scales much smaller 
than previously possible.379

28 February 
NASA released a flight-deck videotape, which the crew of STS-107 had recorded on 1 February 
between 8:35 and 8:48 a.m. (EST). NASA had recovered the videotape from the Shuttle’s crash 
site near Palestine, Texas. The video showed flight-deck activity as Columbia passed over the 
south central Pacific Ocean at an altitude of approximately 500,000 feet. Filmed with a small on-
board camera, mounted to the right of Pilot William C. McCool and then passed to Mission 
Specialist Laurel B. Clark, the videotape showed Commander Rick D. Husband, Pilot McCool, 
Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, and Mission Specialist Clark on the flight deck during 
reentry. The astronauts were conversing among themselves as they worked through routine 
checklist activities with flight controllers at NASA’s Mission Control.380 
 
MARCH 2003 
 
3 March 
Missile Defense Agency (MDA) officials announced that the flight test in December 2002 of the 
Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system had been unsuccessful, because a faulty 
computer-chip connection in the Raytheon exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV) had prevented the 
EKV from separating from its booster during flight. Although the MDA had not recovered the 
EKV, engineers had determined the problem with the chip’s connection using laboratory 
simulations, concluding that no significant underlying problem with the EKV technology had 
caused the failure. The December test, the third unsuccessful GMD intercept attempt, had been 
the second attempt in which the EKV had failed to separate from the booster. U.S. Air Force 
Lieutenant General Ronald T. Kadish, Director of the MDA, remarked that quality-control 
problems had likely caused the test failure and announced the formation of an office to improve 
the MDA’s performance.381 
 
5 March 
ESA formally opened its first deep space ground station in New Norcia, Australia. Construction 
on the US$47 million (EUR 28 million) facility had begun in April 2000. The key component of 
the station was a massive antenna, 40 meters (125 feet) high and weighing 600 tonnes (661.4 
tons or 600,000 kilograms), with a 35-meter (110-foot) dish. ESA had selected the New Norcia 
site because its distance from urban areas protected it from interference from other transmission 
devices, its latitude was perfect for deep space operations, and its weather was excellent. ESA 
had built and opened the station in time for it to play a key role in ESA’s Mars Express mission, 
scheduled for launch in June. The Mars Express craft would carry a lander dubbed Beagle 
2―named in honor of the ship that Charles Darwin sailed on during his search for the origins of 
life―which would map the surface, subsurface, atmosphere, and ionosphere of Mars.382

NASA announced that Administrator Sean O’Keefe had appointed three new members to the 
CAIB in compliance with a request from CAIB Chairperson Harold W. Gehman Jr. The new 
members were Douglas D. Osheroff, the J. G. Jackson and C. J. Wood Professor of Physics and 
Applied Physics at Stanford University and a 1996 Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics; Sally K. 
Ride, a physicist and professor of Space Science at the University of California, San Diego, as 
well as a former NASA astronaut and the first American woman in space; and John M. Logsdon, 
Director of the George Washington University Space Policy Institute. O’Keefe had also 
appointed NASA astronaut retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Michael J. Bloomfield, in response to 
Gehman’s request that Bloomfield replace former astronaut Bryan D. O’Connor as Astronaut 
Advisor to the Board. O’Connor would return to NASA Headquarters in his role as NASA 
Associate Administrator for Safety and Mission Assurance.383 
 
6 March 
Four witnesses appeared before the CAIB at its first public hearing. Director of NASA’s JSC 
Jefferson D. Howell Jr. and Space Shuttle Program Manager Ronald D. Dittemore spoke about 
workforce issues, particularly, about NASA’s concern regarding the erosion of its skill base. 
Keith Chong, a senior scientist at the Boeing Company, discussed Boeing’s work on the foam 
insulation applied to large propellant tanks such as the Shuttle’s external tank and the Boeing 
Delta 4 booster. Henry McDonald, former Director of NASA’s ARC, discussed the Space 
Shuttle Independent Assessment Team (SIAT), which he had led before leaving NASA. The 
SIAT report had identified problems within the Shuttle program. McDonald expressed 
disappointment that NASA had not implemented some of the SIAT’s recommendations. He said 
that he believed some of the recommended improvements, such as modernized records, could 
have significantly influenced decisions that NASA had based on risk assessments.384 
 
10 March 
The newest Boeing Delta rocket, the Delta 4, launched the USA 167also known as the 
Defense Satellite Communications Systems Phase 3 (DSCSIII-A3), or Discus satelliteinto 
orbit, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The American geostationary 
military communications satellite was the first U.S. Air Force craft launched atop Boeing’s 
newest Delta rocket, as well as the first mission for the U.S. Air Force’s Evolved Expendable 
Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program. The craft, a triaxially stabilized spacecraft with solar power of 
1.24 kilowatts, operating at six superhigh frequencies between 40 and 85 megahertz, joined the 
DSCS III constellation of eight similar craft to provide very secure global links to the U.S. 
military. The launch of the Discus satellite featured the smallest of the Delta 4’s several possible 
configurations, with two stages and no booster rocket.385

11 March 
NASA scientist Robert Michael Hornstein died of a brain tumor at the age of 57. Hornstein had 
worked for NASA since 1968, directing its worldwide network of antennas used for 
communicating with orbiting spacecraft. Hornstein, who had joined NASA during the Apollo 
program to design programs for ground tracking systems, was “recognized for helping save the 
Apollo 9 mission from being aborted shortly after launch when he modified tracking software to 
compensate for a computer malfunction in the launch vehicle.” As Ground Networks Director, 
Hornstein had helped administer network-tracking facilities during Space Shuttle orbits, the 
Voyager program, the Galileo recovery effort and mission to Jupiter, the Magellan program, and 
the international Halley’s Comet tracking program. He had helped manage the upgrade of Deep 
Space Network facilities in Australia, California, and Spain and had acted as NASA’s primary 
representative in arranging cooperative tracking efforts with other countries. NASA had awarded 
Hornstein its Outstanding Leadership Award and Exceptional Service Medal, and the Soviet 
Union had honored him with membership in its Federation of Cosmonautics.386 
 
NASA awarded Wyle Laboratories Inc. a five-year contract to perform a range of activities in the 
Office of Bioastronautics of the Space and Life Sciences organization at NASA’s JSC. 
Previously, NASA had relied on multiple contracts to perform these tasks. The contract was a 
cost-plus-award-fee contract with indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery and level-of-effort work. 
Although the base period of the contract was five years, two options could extend it to 10 years, 
bringing the total value to US$968.9 million.387 
 
13 March 
The U.S. Air Force Space Command announced its planned elimination of 1,125 positions over 
the next seven years, as part of a service-wide, post-September 11 initiative to reduce staffing 
levels. The move would free it to “pour more resources into the Air Force’s ‘highest priority 
missions’,” such as special operations and intelligence. The plan called for the elimination of 314 
civilian and 442 military positions by October 2004, at both senior and lower levels. U.S. Air 
Force Major Sean McKenna, a Space Command spokesperson, commented that the reductions 
did not indicate that the Air Force had assigned lower priority to space.388 
 
NASA announced its selection of the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during 
Substorms (THEMIS) project for the next mission of NASA’s Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) 
program. The mission would study the causes of auroras. THEMIS comprised five small 
satellites with identical suites of electrical, magnetic, and particle detectors. With a launch date 
set for 2007, NASA would place the craft in carefully coordinated orbits, where they would line 
up along Earth’s magnetic tail every four days, to track disturbances. THEMIS satellite data 
would combine with data gathered from a network of observatories across the Arctic Circle. 
NASA also announced that it had the opportunity to select an instrument for ESA’s Extreme

NASA awarded a contract valued at up to US$238.7 million to the Physical Science Laboratory 
at New Mexico State University, to operate and maintain scientific balloon facilities and to 
provide engineering support for the NASA Scientific Balloon Program. The four-year contract 
with two three-year options had a baseline value of US$39.8 million.390 
 
18 March 
In the CAIB’s second public hearing, expert witnesses discussed what they knew about the 
reentry of Space Shuttle Columbia on 1 February. William H. Ailor III, Director of the Center 
for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at the Aerospace Corporation, explained to the CAIB that 
part of the difficulty of deciphering the precise cause of the orbiter’s breakup was that space 
agencies had done little work over the past years in reconstructing spacecraft breakups. The lack 
of a systematic effort to retrieve debris from such incidents compounded the problem. R. 
Douglas White, Director for Operations Requirements, Orbiter Element Department for United 
Space Alliance, the prime contractor for NASA’s Space Shuttle Program, provided a “dramatic 
portrayal of Columbia’s troubled trajectory from orbit.” He drew attention to the behavior of 
Columbia’s aileron, the hinged control surface attached to the craft’s trailing edge, remarking 
that its behavior was a first indication that “something odd was happening to the space plane.” 
Paul Hill, Space Shuttle and ISS Flight Director at NASA’s JSC and leader of the team piecing 
together the still and video images of the Shuttle’s final minutes, told the CAIB about the work 
of the image analysts. Hill also expressed gratitude to the public for submitting amateur 
photographs and videos for analysis.391 
 
19 March 
NASA opened its inaugural annual Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Summit at the 
NASA Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans. SLEP was part of the new Integrated 
Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) established to “ensure the viability of the Space Shuttle 
Program.” NASA intended the annual summit to provide a forum to aid the U.S. spaceflight 
community in shaping long-range strategy, setting priorities, and determining the selection and 
recommendation process to sustain the Shuttle system. In the wake of the Columbia tragedy, the 
summit also addressed return-to-flight issues in its first meeting. The summit brought together 
approximately 200 government and aerospace industry professionals who heard from seven 
SLEP panels: Safety, Sustainability, Infrastructure, Aerospace Industry, Performance, 
Operations, and Resources. Panels consolidated and submitted their recommendations to 
NASA’s Space Flight Leadership Council (SFLC), which then identified 60 candidate projects 
for further consideration and chartered a team to prepare an internal submission, which SLEP

to refine its long-term strategy further at the following year’s summit.392 
 
21 March 
NASA announced the replacement of its Mishap Response Team with the newly formed NASA 
Accident Investigation Team (NAIT), which would continue to support the CAIB. NASA had 
formed the Mishap Response Team within hours of the Columbia disaster on 1 February but had 
drawn criticism for the team’s composition, which included staff that had directly overseen the 
Shuttle’s mission. Linda Ham had led the Mishap Response Team, even though, as a senior 
Shuttle program manager, she had assisted in making key decisions during the 16-day Columbia 
mission. NASA and the CAIB intended for the NAIT to support the CAIB, and they had 
organized the NAIT to mirror the CAIB’s structure, with three subsections: materials, operations, 
and engineering. NASA had appointed Deputy Director of JSC Randy Stone to chair the 
NAIT.393 
 
NASA officials and a CAIB spokesperson stated that NASA had recovered intact, from a field in 
Texas, the Orbital Experiment Support System, an electronic box containing vital information 
from Space Shuttle Columbia’s descent. NASA had designed the system to activate at about 
400,000 feet, when Earth’s atmosphere first affects the Shuttle. The box contained data that the 
Shuttle had not transmitted to NASA’s Mission Control via telemetry.394 
 
22 March 
A NASA four-engine, P3-turboprop, “flying laboratory” airplane flew its last flight in a two-
week-long series of flights scanning a section of Alaska’s coast. The scanning was part of a 
collaborative project between NASA, NOAA, and representatives from the University of 
Colorado and the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. The project, called Arctic 2003, had 
collected data about sea-ice variability for comparison with data that NASA’s Aqua satellite had 
collected. The Aqua had launched in May 2002 with a state-of-the-art radiometer for studying 
water systems. The P3 had carried equipment similar to Aqua’s radiometera Japanese-
developed microwave scannerbut because it had flown closer to the ground than the Aqua, the 
P3 had been able to collect sharper images. P3 flights had traveled over Norton Sound, St. 
Lawrence Island, St. Matthew Island, Point Hope, and Barrow. In addition to the P3 and Aqua 
data, ground crews had traveled to some areas to collect samples of ice and snow.395

In the CAIB’s third public meeting, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Aloysius G. Casey, a 
retired three-star general and former Director of the Space Division of Air Force Systems 
Command, presented his opinions about the Columbia disaster, based on his decades of 
experience with missiles and rocket systems. Casey shared with the Board his knowledge of 
high-speed impacts, referring to the insulating foam that had fallen from the Shuttle’s external 
tank 81 seconds after the 16 January launch. He also shared his knowledge of the level of testing 
necessary to determine whether a system is qualified to fly. Casey stated that NASA needed to 
“do a better job in quantifying the safety margins for all of the shuttle’s various systems and be 
more sensitive to clues the hardware may be offering when things don’t work as designed.” 
Board Chairperson Harold W. Gehman Jr., remarking that the “subject of ‘successful flights 
don’t re-establish margins’ has come back again and again,” called Casey’s insight very helpful. 
However, Roy D. Bridges Jr., Director of NASA’s KSC, noted that he had never considered 
falling foam to be a safety issue and that it had never caused “any significant damage in the 
program to date.” Rather than a safety issue, Bridges had considered the foam a maintenance 
concern. Bridges commented that if he had been aware of the safety implications, he would have 
recommended a stop to flying.397

NASA awarded its Commercial Invention of the Year to the Video Image Stabilization and 
Registration System (VISAR) and its Government Invention of the Year to the Computer 
Implemented Empirical Mode Decomposition Method, also known as the Hilbert-Huang 
Transformation (HHT) Method. David H. Hathaway, a solar physicist, and Paul Meyer, an 
atmospheric scientist, both of NASA’s MSFC, had created the basis for the VISAR technology, 
which turns dark, jittery images into clearer stable images. NASA had developed VISAR in 
response to an FBI request for assistance. The FBI first used VISAR in 1996 to analyze video of 
the bombing at the Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta. At the time of the award, investigators 
were using VISAR to help isolate images collected during the launch of the ill-fated Space 
Shuttle Columbia, images that they were examining to locate possible damage to the orbiter. 
Norden E. Huang, Director of the Goddard Institute of Data Analysis at NASA’s GSFC, had 
invented the HHT Method, which had applications in a variety of fields. Researchers could use 
the HHT Method in the study of topics as diverse as climate cycles, earthquake engineering, 
geophysical exploration, submarine design, turbulence flow, basic nonlinear mathematics, 
satellite data analysis, structural damage detection, nonlinear wave evolution, variations in solar 
neutrinos, blood pressure variations, and heart arrhythmias. NOAA had used the HHT Method to 
analyze sea-surface temperature data collected by Earth-orbiting spacecraft, successfully linking 
environmental changes with weather changes.398

27 March 
On the 35th anniversary of the accident that killed Yuri Gagarin, the Russian daily 
Komsomolskaya Pravda published extracts of a secret investigation of Russia’s KGB (the 
Soviet-era Office of State Security) into the cause of the Soviet cosmonaut’s death. Gagarin and 
his instructor had died on 27 March 1968, during a routine training exercise at the Chkalovsky 
Air Base outside Moscow. The government had ordered three official investigations, one by the 
civilian government and two military, but all three had ruled out sabotage. An inspection of 
Gagarin’s MiG-15 had identified no mechanical failures and investigators had concluded that the 
fighter “went into a spin after either hitting birds or suddenly swerving to avoid a weather 
balloon or another aircraft.” The circumstances of his death had since “been cloaked in mystery 
and rumours that the Communist Party had Gagarin killed because of his love of drink and 
women.” The KGB’s counterintelligence unit had conducted its own secret investigation, finding 
that ground staff’s actions had “amounted to a ‘dangerous violation’ of standing instructions,” 
leading to the death of Gagarin and his instructor.399 
 
Investigators of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident stated that the recently recovered Orbital 
Experiment Support System, which stored data about temperature, aerodynamic pressure, 
vibration, and other variables, appeared to contain information up to a fraction of a second before 
the orbiter broke apart over Texas. Technicians had located a time tag on the tape indicating that 
it had stored data until 9:00:18 a.m. (EST) on 1 February. 400 
 
28 March 
NASA announced the publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research of the conclusions of a 
research team that had used data spanning the years 1991 through 2000, which the Microwave 
Limb Sounder on NASA’s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite had collected. The team had 
found that ozone depletion over Earth’s Arctic region varies in amount, timing, and pattern of 
loss, confirming previous variations in Arctic ozone-loss estimates. The team’s findings provided 
the first “consistent, three-dimensional picture of ozone loss during multiple Arctic winters.” 401 
 
Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced an agreement between NASA and the National Imagery 
and Mapping Agency (NIMA), which provided for NIMA to capture detailed satellite images of 
Space Shuttles in orbit. NASA had sought this agreement with NIMA because of critics’ 
“pointed questioning” of NASA’s decision not to capture satellite images that it could have used 
to check for damage to Columbia’s heat shields while the Shuttle was in orbit. The agreement 
would enable NASA to “employ NIMA assets during targets of opportunity” without requiring 
NASA to make a specific request for imaging. Before the disaster, NASA had turned down a 
NIMA offer to capture images of Columbia, and NASA officials had withdrawn an unofficial 
request for U.S. Air Force telescopes to capture images. O’Keefe stated that the agreement did 
not represent any NASA decision “about whether those images might have helped determine 
damage” to Columbia.402

Japan launched two reconnaissance satellitesInformation Gathering Satellites (IGSs), IGS 1A 
and IGS 1Batop an H-2 rocket from Tanegashima Space Center. The pair, the first of at least 
four such spacecraft that Japan intended to place in orbit as part of a US$2.05 billion program, 
were capable of monitoring global natural disasters and hurricanes, as well as observing nuclear 
explosions and missile launches in nearby countries. Because the craft were able to monitor 
weather events, the launch did not violate the terms of the Japan-North Korea Declaration of 
September 2002. However, Japanese space officials acknowledged that Japan had developed the 
program in reaction to the “Taepodong shock,” when a North Korean Taepodong ballistic missile 
flew over Japan’s main island in 1998. North Korea protested the IGS program as a “‘hostile act’ 
that violates the spirit” of the countries’ bilateral agreement. One of the IGS craft carried optical 
cameras with 1-meter (3.3-foot) resolution and the other carried synthetic-aperture radar to 
capture images with resolutions of several meters. Japanese space officials provided no 
information about which craft carried which instrument.403 
 
31 March 
An American GPS satellite, GPS 2R-9, launched atop a Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air 
Force Station in Florida. The GPS 2R-9also known as NAVSTAR 52 and USA 168replaced 
the aging GPS 2-5, which had been in orbit since 1989. The fleet of GPS satellites consisted of 
28 spacecraft.404

1 April 
NASA named astronaut and veteran Shuttle Commander James D. Halsell Jr. to lead its Return 
to Flight Team, which would prepare for the first Shuttle launch since the loss of Columbia, to 
occur as early as September 2003. Halsell had logged more than 1,250 hours in space on five 
Shuttle missions and, most recently, had served as Manager of Shuttle Launch Integration at 
NASA’s KSC. Before the Columbia disaster, NASA had assigned Halsell to STS-118, a mission 
to the ISS scheduled for later in 2003.405 
 
2 April 
The Russian military successfully launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome a military 
communications satellite aboard a Molniya-M booster. The purpose of the satellite Molniya 1-92 
was to orbit above the far northern regions of Russia relaying commands and communications 
among military forces. At the lower end of its orbit, the craft would sweep quickly over the 
Southern Hemisphere, returning to orbit above northern Russia. From this position, the craft 
would serve users who were out of range of most communications satellites, which, traditionally, 
orbit at geostationary positions above the equator.406

Alex Roland, a history professor at Duke University and former NASA historian, and Brian E. 
Chase, Executive Director of the National Space Society and a former congressional aide, 
testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space 
concerning problems in NASA’s Space Shuttle Program. Roland stated that the Shuttle was not 
sustainable as a safe, reliable, and economical launch vehicle and recommended its phaseout. 
Roland faulted NASA for ignoring the findings of the Presidential Commission on the Space 
Shuttle Challenger Accident (Rogers Commission), which had paved the way for the Shuttle to 
return to flight after the Challenger disaster in 1986. The Rogers Commission had recommended 
that NASA begin developing a next-generation launch vehicle immediately. However, 16 years 
later, NASA continued to rely on the Space Shuttle and had no replacement in sight. Chase 
recommended the short-term maintenance of the remaining Shuttles and endorsed the George W. 
Bush administration’s plan to develop an Orbital Space Plane (OSP) ready to transport crews to 
the ISS by 2010. He also recommended that NASA use commercial heavy-lift launch vehicles 
for hauling cargo to the space station.407 
 
4 April 
Boeing announced that its Integrated Defense Systems unit had signed a contract with the Japan 
Defense Agency and the trading company ITOCHU Corporation to build the first aircraft of the 
Japan Air Self Defense Force 767 Tanker Transport Program, comprising four aircraft and 
support. For its 767 Tanker Transport, Japan had selected the military derivative of the 767-
200ER commercial aircraft, reconfigured with an advanced Boeing air-refueling boom and an 
advanced remote aerial refueling operator system. With its selection of the convertible freighter 
configuration, Japan would have the flexibility to carry either cargo or passengers. The 767 
Tanker Transport Program would enable Japan to meet its commitment to international 
cooperative efforts, such as delivering humanitarian aid and meeting the air-refueling needs of 
Japan and other countries around the world. 408 
 
NASA and industry researchers completed a series, begun on 1 April, of collision-avoidance 
tests between airplanes and remotely controlled UAVs. Although UAVs had achieved high-
profile military roles overseas, the United States had not yet approved the use of robotic drones 
within U.S. airspace. The collision-avoidance tests were part of the efforts of the FAA, NASA, 
and the DOD to determine what safety and reliability standards UAVs would need to meet. For 
example, the FAA sought to ensure that robotic drones could respond to instructions from air 
traffic controllers as quickly as human pilots of conventional aircraft could respond. Researchers 
had created 20 collision scenarios in restricted airspace over four days, using an F/A-18 jet and a 
propeller-driven Beechcraft. During the tests, ground-based pilots operating the experimental 
Proteus drone had only been able to see evidence of the other two planes in the form of a stream 
of radar and other data and had never actually observed the physical aircraft. Yet, in each 
scenario, the pilots had been able to maneuver the drone to avoid colliding with the other 
aircraft.409

7 April 
The CAIB questioned NASA flight managers and tank engineers about damage from launch 
debris―a key concern of the CAIB―during 4 hours of technical testimony at a public hearing. 
The CAIB sought to uncover why NASA officials had considered the recurrent problem of foam 
falling during launches a maintenance issue rather than a flight safety concern. NASA testimony 
included the description of the layers of checks, justifications, and paperwork required to certify 
a Shuttle for launch, as well as evidence of NASA engineers’ collective conviction that the 
shedding foam did not present a threat to flight safety and, therefore, was not a sufficient reason 
to cancel a launch. In October 2002, foam falling from the bipod area of its external tankthe 
area where two metal struts connect the fuel reservoir to the orbiterhad struck Space Shuttle 
Atlantis. The foam that had fallen from Space Shuttle Columbia striking its wing had come from 
the same area of Columbia’s external tank as the foam that had struck Atlantis. However, 
engineers and managers had examined Atlantis’s debris incident and had determined that falling 
foam did not present a safety-of-flight concern for Columbia. Nevertheless, because of the 
Atlantis incident, managers had requested that engineers responsible for the Shuttle’s external 
tank develop a plan to prevent debris from breaking away from the bipod area of the tank. 
Engineers had not completed the plan at the time of Columbia’s flight.410 
 
8 April 
The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin launched the Milstar II military communications 
satellite into orbit aboard a Titan 4B launch vehicle with a Centaur upper stage. The satellite 
joined four other Milstar satellites already in orbit, completing the constellation. The Milstar 
constellation provided secure, global communication links for U.S. military joint forces, 
transmitting voice, data, and imagery, as well as providing video-teleconferencing capabilities. 
Milstar II was the third satellite to carry the Boeing Satellite Systems–built, medium-data-rate 
payload, which had 32 channels, each capable of processing data at speeds of 1.5 megabits per 
second. The craft carried a low-data-rate payload as well, built by Northrop Grumman Space 
Technology.411 
 
American astronauts Kenneth D. Bowersox and Donald R. Pettit undertook a 6½-hour spacewalk 
at the ISS to finish preparing the station for the arrival of a new crew. In the second spacewalk of 
their four-month mission, Bowersox and Pettit worked on power connections, replaced lighting 
for a transport trolley, reconfigured cables on a navigational gyroscope, and secured covers on 
the station’s thermal control system. Cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin monitored the astronauts’

Research Organisation’s (ISRO’s) INSAT 3A satellite. The Ariane 5G standard version was the 
first launch of an Ariane rocket since the enhanced Ariane 5 ECA had failed in December 2002, 
a failure that had prompted a complete review of the Ariane 5 system, particularly its main-stage 
cryogenic engine. The 1.8-tonne (2-ton, 1,800-kilogram, or 3,968-pound) Galaxy satellite built 
by Orbital Sciences Corporation carried 24 C-band transponders to provide voice, video, and 
data transmissions to North America and South America from its position at longitude 72º west. 
The 3-tonne (3.3-ton, 3,000-kilogram, or 6,614-pound) INSAT 3A geostationary 
communications and weather-monitoring satellite carried 12 C-band, 6 extended C-band, and 6 
Ku-band transponders, to provide voice, video and data transmission to western Asia, eastern 
Asia, and India from its position at longitude 93.5º east. The ISRO satellite carried the typical

John E. Riley, a 33-year member of NASA’s Public Affairs Department, broadcast voice of 
NASA’s Mission Control for the Apollo program, and NASA spokesperson, died of cancer at the 
age of 78. He had begun working for NASA in 1959 and, as a member of the Apollo program 
team, had provided commentary during the first moonwalk. Riley had also initiated the practice 
of encouraging astronauts’ interviews with media and had traveled with astronauts 
internationally.417 
 
The CAIB released its first two official recommendations, suggesting that before resuming 
Shuttle missions, NASA should 1) improve its inspections of the leading edge of the orbiters’ 
wings, and 2) ensure that U.S. spy satellites would capture detailed images of the orbiters during 
each mission. Although the Board had not yet begun developing its final report, the CAIB 
released preliminary recommendations so that NASA could begin to implement them 
expeditiously. The CAIB made the first recommendation because it had found that inspection 
techniques in place did not enable engineers to assess the structural integrity of the orbiter’s heat 
shield, considered a “criticality one” item. The failure of the heat shieldcomprising the 
reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels that protect the front of the orbiter’s wings during 
reentry, the RCC panels’ supporting structure, and the attaching hardwarewould lead to the 
loss of the vehicle and crew. The CAIB made the second recommendation because it had 
discovered that NASA officials had cancelled an informal request that the U.S. military capture 
images of Columbia to check for possible damage caused by launch debris. NASA already had a 
new memorandum of agreement with the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) to 
provide NASA with images of orbiting Shuttles. Previously, NIMA had only made images 
available upon request, but the CAIB recommended that NASA and NIMA make imaging each 
Shuttle flight a standard requirement.418 
 
18 April 
At the Mojave Airport in California, aircraft designer Burt Rutan unveiled for the first time his 
White Knight launch system and SpaceShipOne spacecraft, which he had built in secret. Rutan 
had designed the White Knight, a type of aircraft, to carry the spacecraft to 50,000 feet, where 
the White Knight would release SpaceShipOne to launch like an aircraft into a steep climb. 
Rutan had begun testing the launch platform at lower altitudes in August 2002, also testing on 
the ground the release mechanism between the spacecraft and the launch platform. In the public 
unveiling, Rutan flew the White Knight only. The craft flew to an altitude of 9,000 feet (2,734 
meters) before spiraling down to make a soft but extremely short landing. Rutan demonstrated 
SpaceShipOne’s systems, explaining that the craft should land in the same manner as the launch 
system. The flight profile of the system allowed SpaceShipOne to reach 54 nautical miles (62 
miles or 99.8 kilometers) maximum altitude over a flight patch of 35 miles (56.3 kilometers).

23 April 
NASA announced the resignation of Space Shuttle Program Manager Ronald D. Dittemore. A 
26-year veteran of NASA, Dittemore had supervised the Space Shuttle Program for more than 
four years. Dittemore had joined NASA in 1977 as a propulsion-systems engineer, working on 
orbital maneuvering and reaction-control systems for the Space Shuttle before his selection as a 
Space Shuttle Flight Director in 1985. In 1993 NASA had appointed him Deputy Manager for 
the Space Shuttle Program Integration and Operations Office in the Space Shuttle Program 
Office. He had also served as Manager of Space Shuttle Program Integration and as Chairperson 
of the Space Shuttle Mission Management Team before his selection in 1996 to manage the 
Space Shuttle Vehicle Engineering Office. He had become Space Shuttle Program Manager in 
1999, assuming responsibility for the overall management, integration, and operation of the 
program. In announcing his departure, Dittemore remarked that, before the Columbia tragedy, he 
had been struggling over whether to leave NASA and had decided to resign in the spring of 
2003. However, after the Columbia accident, he had immediately postponed his departure. 
Deputy Associate Administrator for the Space Shuttle Program Michael C. Kostelnik and NASA 
Administrator Sean O’Keefe credited Dittemore with keeping communications open between 
NASA and the public in the wake of the tragedy. Dittemore planned to remain in his position 
until the CAIB had finished its work and established a return-to-flight program, to enable NASA 
to make a smooth management transition.420 
 
A panel of five retired NASA and contractor managers, whose expertise dated to the Mercury, 
Gemini, and Apollo programs, testified in a public hearing before the CAIB that engineers had 
never designed orbiters’ wings to sustain strikes from any form of debris. The panel members 
agreed that engineers had known in the 1970s that the RCC panels along the leading edge of the 
orbiters’ wings presented a technical challenge, and that NASA should have taken appropriate 
precautions against debris striking the RCC panels. Milton A. Silveira, who had helped design 
the orbiter, remarked that wings of airplanes were also incapable of sustaining such strikes. 
Robert F. Thompson, another designer of the orbiter, who had headed the Space Shuttle Program 
in the 1970s, added that providing an impenetrable wing edge was impossible. According to 
Thompson, if NASA had insisted on that standard, it would have had to abandon the Shuttle 
project. Diane Vaughn, a sociologist affiliated with Boston College, who in 1996 had published 
the book The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture and Deviance at NASA, 
spoke to the panel about NASA’s approach to risk-management and decision-making systems. 
Vaughn observed that NASA had failed to address institutional problems present at the time of 
the Challenger disaster, and that as a result, NASA decision-makers had remained unable to 
access the type of data they needed to assess risk accurately and to act on that knowledge.421

24 April 
The Russian military launched the geostationary Cosmos 2397 aboard a Proton-K rocket. 
According to rumor, Cosmos 2397, a classified spacecraft reportedly built by NPO Lavochkin, 
was an early warning satellite.422 
 
The NASA Accident Investigation Team (NAIT) presented to the CAIB the results of its 
ongoing analysis of the Columbia disaster. Ten members of the CAIB were either present or 
listening via telephone, and 30 to 40 NASA and contractor personnel participated in the private 
briefing. The CAIB indicated that the Space Shuttle Program required more work in four 
areas―aerothermal analysis, foam-impact testing, testing of flown RCC panels, and 
metallurgical analysis from debris. According to the CAIB, NAIT had “provided an overview of 
the latest data-recorder information, and the CAIB issued its guidance based on that data and 
board investigators’ continuing analysis of the latest orbiter debris.”423 
 
25 April 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe named the commander, the pilot, and a mission specialist of 
the next Space Shuttle mission, even though NASA had not selected any dates for future Shuttle 
missions since the suspension of Shuttle flights following the Columbia disaster. O’Keefe said 
that NASA’s target to resume Shuttle flights was the end of the calendar year. O’Keefe said that 
the crew―Commander Eileen M. Collins, Pilot James M. Kelly, Mission Specialist Stephen K. 
Robinson, and Mission Specialist Soichi Noguchi of Japan’s NASDA―would be “challenged 
with the opportunity to be the first crew to return to flight.” O’Keefe said that the ISS partners 
would probably fill the other three slots with a three-member crew headed for the ISS.424 
 
26 April 
Soyuz TMA-2 launched aboard a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, 
carrying one Russian cosmonaut and one American astronaut for a six-month stay at the ISS. 
American Edward T. Lu and Russian Yuri I. Malenchenko would replace the three-person crew 
that had lived at the space station since November 2002. An expert on solar flares, Lu had flown 
to Russia’s space station Mir in 1997 and to the fledgling ISS in 2000 on STS-106. Malenchenko 
and Lu had been fellow crew members aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-106. During that 
mission, Lu and Malenchenko had teamed up in a spacewalk to hook up exterior cables.425 
 
28 April 
In its first launch since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in February, NASA launched its 
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) research satellite aboard a Pegasus XL rocket released 
from an L-1011 cargo plane that had flown out of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. 
GALEX carried a telescope measuring 19.7 inches (50 centimeters) in diameter, designed to

provide a wide-angle view of the ultraviolet light that distant galaxies emit. NASA had planned 
the mission, which would survey the light emitted by a million galaxies over 28 months, to learn 
more about galaxies dominated by hot, short-lived stars that give off a great deal of energy as 
ultraviolet light. The mission cost US$103.7 million.426 
 
29 April 
The Dutch-Italian satellite known as BeppoSAX reentered Earth’s atmosphere and splashed into 
the equatorial Pacific Ocean seven years after its launch into orbit on 30 April 1996. The Italian 
Space Agency and the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace jointly operated the 3,086-pound 
(1,400-kilogram) x-ray satellite, best known for its discovery of 50 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). 
The Italian Space Agency had estimated that as much as 1,325 pounds (601 kilograms) of the 
craft could survive reentry, with individual pieces weighing 220 pounds (99.7 kilograms) and 
had, therefore, notified 39 countries that pieces of the spacecraft could potentially land in their 
territory. However, the debris falling closest to land splashed into the ocean 186 miles (299 
kilometers) northwest of the Galapagos Islands.427 
 
30 April 
Investigators announced their discovery that thousands of worms known as C. elegans―part of a 
science experiment aboard Columbia―were still alive, having survived the violent, high-velocity 
reentry and impact, traveling at least 120 miles per hour (193 kilometers per hour). The 
containers holding the worms had remained sealed for several weeks following their recovery 
while accident investigators at NASA’s KSC processed them. Terri L. Lomax, a NASA space 
biologist, remarked that, although it was unclear what scientists would learn from the worms, the 
fact that they had survived the accident was data in and of itself.428

3 May 
The National Inventors Hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio, inducted 17 aviation and aerospace 
inventors, among them Harold A. Rosen, recognized for his pioneering work in developing the 
world’s first 24-hour commercial communications satellite and for his subsequent contributions 
to satellite communications. Rosen had led the Boeing Satellite Systems team that had begun 
developing the geostationary Syncom in 1959. The team had planned for Syncom to 
communicate directly and continuously with any ground station in its line of sight, in contrast to 
the communications satellites in use at the time, which required expensive tracking computers. 
The first Syncom had failed to launch successfully, but Syncom 2 had reached its synchronous 
orbit on 26 July 1963. Later that year, Syncom 2 had relayed by satellite the first live two-way 
call between heads of state―a phone call between President John F. Kennedy in Washington, 
DC, and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubaker Balewa in Africa. Syncom 3 had brought live 
coverage of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics to U.S. viewers. The satellites had remained active 
through 1966, surpassing their one-year design life. David L. Ryan, Vice President and General 
Manager of Boeing Satellite Systems, remarked that contemporary satellites that deliver video,

voice, and data communications are all descendants of Syncom, and “when Harold Rosen and his 
colleagues launched Syncom, they launched a revolution and changed the world.”429 
 
4 May 
Returning from the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-1, American astronauts, Kenneth D. Bowersox and 
Donald R. Pettit, and Russian cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin, touched down in the steppes of 
Kazakhstan 276 miles (444 kilometers) off course. The landing was the first time American 
astronauts had returned to Earth in a foreign spacecraft. Budarin, Bowersox, and Pettit had 
arrived at the ISS in November 2002 aboard Endeavour, scheduled to return to Earth aboard 
another Shuttle flight on 11 March. However, the Columbia disaster in February had grounded 
the remaining three Shuttles in NASA’s fleet, prolonging the crew’s stay aboard the ISS. Russian 
search teams took 2 hours, using a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft, to find the crew. The last 
radio contact between the capsule and Mission Control Center in Moscow had occurred after the 
craft’s parachutes opened, about 15 minutes before landing. Failure to reestablish contact had 
caused concern for the trio’s welfare. Russian Space Agency spokesperson Sergei Gorbunov 
announced that a special commission would investigate the causes of the malfunctions during 
landing.430 
 
7 May 
Boeing announced the successful completion of Phase III testing of the X-31A Vector 
aircraft―the world’s only international experimental airplane in the X-plane series to receive 
international collaboration―demonstrating the use of thrust-vectoring technologies for 
performing extremely short takeoff and landing (ESTOL) operations. The U.S. Navy, Germany’s 
defense procurement agency, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, and 
Boeing Phantom Works had conducted the ESTOL demonstrations, carrying out the final flight 
on 29 April at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. The demonstrations had consisted 
of a series of fully automated ESTOL landings on an actual runway using a high angle-of-attack 
landing, proving that an integrated flight-and-propulsion control system had potential use in 
ESTOL. Such capabilities would give fighter aircraft greater operational flexibility and lower 
life-cycle costs.431 
 
NASA announced that it had selected several radioisotope-based, power-conversion technologies 
for research and development. The awards represented the first competitive technology 
procurement funded entirely by NASA’s Project Prometheus. The projects covered distinct areas 
in power-conversion technology: thermoelectrics, thermophotovoltaics, Stirling engines, and 
Brayton engines. NASA intended the awards to lay the foundation for technology development 
enabling new classes of missions, such as networked science stations on Mars and small 
spacecraft capable of complex maneuvers in deep space. Each award would cover three one-year 
performance periods with continued support from one period to the next, contingent on the 
program’s needs, availability of funds, and each team’s ability to meet milestones. The total

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the Geostationary 
Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)–D2 rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, 
Andhra Pradesh, India. The main payload was the GSAT-2, a geostationary communications and 
space-monitoring satellite, which carried four C-band and two Ku-band transponders that would 
provide voice and video transmissions to India and neighboring countries. The GSLV-D2 also 
carried into orbit experimental payloads: a Coherent Radio Beacon Experiment, a Solar X-ray 
Spectrometer, an external Total Radiation Dose Monitor, a Radiation Sensitive Field Effect 
Transistor, and a Surface Change Monitor. However, its main mission was to test the GSLV-D2, 
an improved version of the GSLV first launched in April 2001.433 
 
9 May 
The Japanese probe Muses-C―renamed Hayabusa (Falcon) after its deployment―launched 
from Kogoshima Space Center on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, aboard an M-5 solid-
fuel rocket. The probe’s mission was to rendezvous with the asteroid 1998 SF36, gather surface 
samples, and return to Earth. Japan’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science expected the 
510-kilogram (1,124-pound) spacecraft to arrive at the asteroid in June 2005. The craft would 
then skim the surface several times over three months, collecting 1 gram (0.04 ounces) of surface 
material from various sites. The Institute had designed the mission to return the samples to Earth 
in a capsule in June 2007. If the probe succeeded, the samples would be the first space rocks 
collected since the end of the U.S. Apollo Lunar Exploration Program 30 years before.434 
 
NASA announced the selection of William W. Parsons Jr., Director of NASA’s SSC, to succeed 
Ronald D. Dittemore as Manager of the Space Shuttle Program. Dittemore had announced his 
resignation on 23 April. NASA appointed SSC Deputy Director Michael U. Rudolphi to serve as 
interim Director of SSC.435 
 
12 May 
Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, and the Boeing Company formed a team 
to develop the U.S. Air Force E-10A Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft (MC2A), a 
next-generation aircraft that could replace the Airborne Warning and Control System and the 
Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft. The initial agreement called for the 
production of five MC2A craft for the U.S. Air Force, but the program could increase to allow

for production of as many as 50 such aircraft. Boeing would provide its twin-jet 767-400 
transport aircraft as a platform for powerful multifunction radar with the capability of detecting 
enemy forces on the ground, as well as low-flying cruise missiles. Northrop Grumman and 
Raytheon would develop a radar and electronic self-defense system to integrate with a Battle 
Management Command and Control System produced under a separate contract.436 
 
13 May 
The White House unveiled the U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy, which President 
George W. Bush had approved on 25 April to replace former President William J. Clinton’s 1994 
Presidential Decision Directive-23. The new policy loosened government restrictions on the 
collection and sale of commercial satellite imagery, directing military and civilian agencies first 
to approach the commercial sector to fulfill satellite imagery needs. The NSC had created the 
new guidelines as part of a review of U.S. national space policy, which the White House had 
directed the NSC to conduct in June 2002 with the support of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy. The new policy retained the government’s ability to restrict operations of 
commercial satellite imaging companies for national security reasons, but emphasized that the 
U.S. military should plan actions in the knowledge that adversaries also had access to 
commercial satellite imagery. The policy encouraged companies to use the most capable systems 
possible. However, at the same time, the government retained the right to restrict the sale of the 
most advanced imagery to U.S. government customers. The policy named the U.S. National 
Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) as the interface between government and industry for 
national security applications of commercial satellite imagery. The U.S. Department of 
Commerce, U.S. Department of Interior, and NASA would fulfill that role for civilian 
applications.437 
 
Hellas-Sat, a geostationary communications satellite jointly owned by Greece and Cyprus, 
launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida aboard an Atlas 5 rocket with a 
Russian RD-180 motor. The 3.45-tonne (3.8-ton or 3,450-kilogram) Astrium Eurostar 2000+ 
model carried 30 Ku-band transponders to provide voice, video, data, and broadcast services to 
Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The launch, the second for the Atlas 
5 series, was the 65th consecutive successful flight for the Lockheed Martin–built Atlas rocket 
and for mission provider International Launch Services (ILS).438

department that advises senior managers about shuttle safety.” He explained that the links of 
engineering specialists with NASA’s Space Shuttle Program had apparently been too close to 
permit independent review of the condition of the orbiters. In addition, he said that NASA’s 
Safety Organization lacked sufficient personnel. Gehman testified that, although NASA’s Safety 
Organization appeared perfect on paper, the procedures lacked substance in reality. NASA 
Administrator Sean O’Keefe, who appeared at Gehman’s side at the hearing, assured the Senate 
panel that NASA would hold its officials accountable, and that NASA would correct all faults in 
management that the CAIB identified. However, O’Keefe did not respond to Gehman’s criticism 
of NASA’s safety team.439 
 
16 May 
NASA’s ARC in Mountain View, California, closed three wind tunnels until the end of FY 2003 
because of budget cuts, fewer defense contracts, and the increased use of computer simulations. 
NASA reported that, unless it received major contracts from the DOD or from the private sector 
within a year from October 2003, ARC would close the wind tunnels permanently. Two of the 
wind tunnels, the largest and second-largest wind tunnels in the world, had operated for nearly 
six decades, testing dozens of aircraft and spacecraft, including Korean War–era fighter planes, 
helicopters, and the Space Shuttle. The largest wind tunnel, known as “80 by 120” in reference to 
its height and width, was the only wind tunnel in the world that could accommodate full-size 
aircraft. With the closure of the three tunnels, ARC dismissed 23 contractors and reassigned 23 
employees, changes that would save ARC US$12 million per year in operational costs.440 
 
NASA announced the selection of 15 organizations from industry, government, and academia to 
carry out 22 propulsion-technology research proposals in five areas of the In-Space Propulsion 
Program: aerocapture, advanced chemical propulsion, solar-electric propulsion, space-based 
tether propulsion, and solar-sail technologies. The goal of the program, under the management of 
the Office of Space Sciences at NASA Headquarters, was to make exploration of deep space 
more practical, affordable, and productive.441 
 
21 May 
Lockheed Martin announced it had teamed up with Argon Engineering to conduct a flight test 
and evaluation of Argon’s Lighthouse Communications Intelligence (COMINT) processing 
capability in a high-density urban environment. The test team had flown the Lighthouse 
COMINT sensor in the area of Phoenix, Arizona, for more than 24 hours, during eight flights 
ranging in altitude from 5,000 to more than 20,000 feet (1,524 to more than 6,096 meters). The 
series of flights confirmed that the sensor was “capable of handling the high dynamic signal 
densities of urban and military environments.” Wes Colburn of Lockheed Martin ISR Systems 
remarked that Argon’s open architecture Lighthouse COMINT system provided a dynamic 
sensor suite capable of meeting fighters’ needs in complex and modern electromagnetic threat 
environments. The flight tests had validated that the Lighthouse COMINT system was extremely

NASA announced the appointment of David A. King as the new Director of NASA’s MSFC in 
Huntsville, Alabama, effective 15 June. NASA would reassign Director of MSFC Arthur G. 
Stephenson, in preparation for his planned January 2004 retirement from NASA. King had been 
MSFC’s Deputy Director since November 2002, assisting Stephenson in managing a range of 
propulsion, space science, and materials research, as well as development work. NASA had also 
dispatched King to Lufkin, Texas, within hours of the Columbia disaster, to serve as the senior 
on-site NASA official in the search-and-recovery effort. In that capacity, he had created critical, 
initial work processes; established effective working relationships among federal and state 
government agencies; and set the foundation for the two subsequent NASA officials who would 
share responsibility for leading effective recovery efforts. Before serving as Deputy Director of 
MSFC, King had been Deputy Director of Shuttle Processing, Launch Director of six Shuttle 
missions, and Director of Shuttle Processing at NASA’s KSC. As Director of Shuttle Processing 
at KSC, he had managed and coordinated all Space Shuttle processing, launch, and landing 
operations and had made the final determination to launch during the three-day countdown 
process.443

Beidou 1C, a People’s Republic of China geostationary navigational satellite, launched from 
Xichang Satellite Launching Center in Sichuan province aboard a Long March 3A rocket, 
joining two other Beidou craft launched in 2000 to complete the satellite constellation. Xinhua, 
the Chinese national media outlet, reported that the transportation industry, telecommunications 
industry, weather forecasters, environmental planners, emergency personnel would be able to use 
the global positioning and navigational satellites. However, western analysts speculated that 
China was more likely to use the Beidou satellites’ capabilities to make its own military and 
weapons systems more precise.444

Nikolai I. Zelenschikov, who had led the investigation into the off-target landing of Soyuz TMA-
1, announced that a technical malfunction, rather than crew error, had caused the craft’s 
unexpectedly steep and off-course landing on 4 May, when the craft returned two astronauts and 
a cosmonaut to Earth. Zelenschikov, Deputy Chief Designer of RSC Energia (S.P. Korolev 
Rocket and Space Corporation), stated that specialists had found no problems with the new 
software on Soyuz TMA-1 and had discovered no errors attributable to the crew. Instead, 
investigators had found that a 25-year-old instrument had failed to control the spacecraft’s 
descent. Soviet engineers had a plan for modifying the instrument to ensure its reliability.

Investigators had also recommended that the Russian Space Agency position more airplanes and 
helicopters along the trajectory of landing Soyuz craft, but cosmonaut Pavel V. Vinogradov, a 
member of the commission investigating the accident, noted that chronic underfunding had led to 
a shortage of aircraft available for this purpose. The commission further recommended equipping 
Soyuz craft with satellite communication technology. Because several of the craft’s antennas had 
failed, the Soyuz TMA-1 crew had lost radio contact with Mission Control Center in Moscow 
during landing and had not regained it. Zelenschikov stated that the Russian space industry 
would make all necessary modifications to the Soyuz TMA-3 craft but could make no repairs to 
Soyuz TMA-2, which had already docked at the ISS. However, the Russian Space Agency 
planned to ferry a satellite phone to the ISS aboard a cargo mission, for use on the return flight of 
to TMA-2.445

NASA Chief of Staff and White House Liaison Courtney A. Stadd announced his resignation, 
effective 4 July 2003, to pursue opportunities in the private sector. NASA Administrator Sean

Stadd had led President George W. Bush’s NASA transition team and had worked with two 
NASA administrators to help cast NASA’s strategic direction. Schumacher brought invaluable 
experience and perspective to his new position. Since June 1995, he had served as NASA’s 
Assistant Administrator for External Relations, with responsibility for NASA’s interaction with 
Executive Branch offices and agencies, for international relations, and for administration of 
export and international technology-transfer control. In addition, he had served as a liaison with 
NASA’s History Office, advisory councils, and commissions.446 
 
European space ministers met at ESA headquarters in Paris to sign an agreement to save the 
Ariane 5 launcher program. The officials voted to re-obligate EUR 228 million (US$269 million) 
from an existing program to put the rocket’s new version back on track for commercial service 
by late 2004. Additionally, they agreed to reimburse Ariane 5 contractors for many fixed costs of 
maintaining their plants and equipment between 2005 and 2009, a measure expected to keep the 
industry afloat with the injection of EUR 960 million (US$1 billion) while waiting for the 
commercial launch market to improve.447 
 
Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, California, announced that 
it had won a US$48 million, four-year contract to support the development of NASA’s next-
generation space vehicle under NASA’s Space Launch Initiative (SLI) program. Under the 
contract, SAIC would provide vehicle and systems engineering as well as other services, such as 
scheduling, configuration management, risk management, and financial planning.448

The CAIB carried out preliminary tests at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, 
Texas, firing foam at a fiberglass replica of the wing of an orbiter. The impact of a 1.67-pound 
(0.76-kilogram) piece of foam fired at 533 miles per hour (858 kilometers per hour) created a 
narrow 22-inch-long (56-centimeter-long) gash in the fiberglass wings. The CAIB conducted the 
test in preparation for an official test with panels composed of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC), 
a material two and one-half times more resilient than fiberglass. In addition to determining 
whether foam could damage the fiberglass, the CAIB intended the test to calibrate the 
mechanism for testing the RCC without using up scarce RCC samples.449 
 
30 May 
Japan’s Unmanned Space Experiment Recovery System (USERS) capsule splashed down 620 
miles (1,000 kilometers) south of Tokyo, Japan, near the Ogasawara Islands, while the USERS 
Service Module continued to orbit Earth. Japan’s NASDA had launched the system aboard an H-
2A booster from the Tanegashima Space Center in September 2002, along with a Japanese Data 
Relay Test Satellite. The capsule contained a superconductive product, created within the capsule 
during its 10 months in space, using an electrically heated furnace. Japanese researchers were 
investigating contamination-free, high-quality crystals, created in a microgravity environment, 
for their potential use in the superconductive magnets needed in flywheel-type, electric-energy 
storage systems and magnetically levitated train transportation. Scientists planned to collect data 
from the USERS Service Module to use in the design and production of future satellite hardware. 
The Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer, a group established in 1986 to 
promote the industrialization of space, had initiated the USERS project.450

2 June 
ESA launched its Mars Express mission from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard a 
Russian Soyuz-Fregat rocket. Mars Express consisted of ESA’s Mars Orbiter and a 65-kilogram 
(143.3-pound) lander, Beagle 2, named in honor of the ship that Charles Darwin sailed on during 
his search for the origins of life. The orbiter, scheduled to reach Mars in December, carried 
multiple cameras, spectrometers, and radar equipment. Following the launch, ESA Director of 
Science David J. Southwood remarked that its success signified Europe’s official entry into the 
interplanetary travel club.451 
 
3 June 
The Canadian Space Agency awarded a four-year, US$116 million contract to MD Robotics to 
provide engineering services for robotic elements for the ISS. Under the contract, MD Robotics, 
a subsidiary of MacDonald, Dettweiler and Associates Ltd., would maintain and upgrade 
software for robotic components and would continue developing and testing a two-armed robot

called Dextre, scheduled for installation at the ISS in 2005. MD Robotics had designed Dextre 
for attachment to the ISS, either at the end of the robotic arm currently in place―Canadarm 
2―or on the mobile base station. Dextre would perform external maintenance tasks at the ISS.452 
 
Edward J. Weiler, NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified before the U.S. 
Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space about Project Prometheus, 
a proposed nuclear technology program. The proposal called for NASA to spend US$3 billion 
between 2003 and 2008, developing more powerful radioisotope thermoelectric generators 
(RTGs) to convert energy from the decay of radioactive material into electricity and to explore 
the use of fission to power spacecraft and their instruments. A strong supporter of the program, 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe, a former Secretary of the Navy, hoped to apply lessons 
learned from the nuclear submarine program to spacecraft. Weiler stated that nuclear fission was 
necessary for sending spacecraft to scrutinize the outer planets of the solar system, such as 
Jupiter, and could open the door to human spaceflight to Mars. NASA hoped to use the powerful 
RTGs developed in Project Prometheus for a robotic mission to Mars in 2009. NASA proposed 
to make a mission to Jupiter’s moons as its first use of fission technology in space exploration.453 
 
6 June 
NASA announced that it had awarded the contract to manage the James Webb Space Telescope 
(JWST) Science and Operations Control Center to a nonprofit consortium, the Association of 
Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). The contract, valued at US$162.2 million, 
stipulated that AURA manage the Science and Operations Control Center at the Space Telescope 
Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. AURA would provide products and services required 
to prepare the science program, develop ground systems, provide science and engineering 
support, provide integration and test support, perform educational and public outreach, and 
perform flight and science operations during the launch and commissioning of JWST, scheduled 
for launch in 2011.454 
 
The CAIB conducted an outdoor test re-creating the conditions at Columbia’s launch, to 
determine whether foam could break reinforced-carbon wing pieces. During the test, a pair of 
orbiter wing parts cracked and shifted out of alignment after investigators shot a 1.5-pound 
(0.68-kilogram) piece of foam at the panel at a speed of 525 miles per hour (845 kilometers per 
hour). The impact created a gap of less than 0.1 inch (0.25 centimeter) wide and at least 3 inches 
(7.6 centimeters) long. G. Scott Hubbard, the CAIB member in charge of the test, stated that the 
Board required further analysis to determine whether the damage would have allowed hot 
atmospheric gases to penetrate the wing during reentry.455

to place Koreasat 5 in orbit by early 2006. KT Corporation spokesperson Cho Chul-Je told the 
media that South Korea’s military would use military transponders on the satellite for 
communication and operation, but he declined to confirm reports that the craft would assist the 
military in collecting security information in Northeast Asia. The craft would also be equipped 
with commercial transponders. Koreasat 5 would replace Koreasat 2, which had launched in 
1996, allowing telecommunications companies to expand mobile networks to Japan, the People’s 
Republic of China, Taiwan, and the Philippines.456 
 
8 June 
Progress M1-10 launched successfully from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying 
2,400 kilograms (5,300 pounds) of fuel, canned food, water, oxygen, and equipment for 
scientific experiments to the ISS. Yuri P. Semyonov of RSC Energia (S.P. Korolev Rocket and 
Space Corporation), the company leading Russia’s participation in the ISS, remarked that 
Progress M1-10 carried a supply of extra water because NASA had canceled all Shuttle flights in 
the wake of the Columbia disaster. The ISS Expedition 7 would have a staff of two, rather than 
three crew members―Russian Flight Commander Yuri I. Malenchenko and U.S. Flight Engineer 
Edward T. Lu―to save fuel and water until Shuttle flights resumed.457 
 
9 June 
NASA announced the successful first test flight of Altair, its UAV. The purpose of the test flight 
was to evaluate Altair’s airworthiness and flight controls. NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise had 
established performance specifications for the craft, which was an extended-wing version of the 
MQ-9 Predator B military UAV―one of several UAVs designed for civil applications.458  
 
10 June 
From its floating platform Odyssey, Sea Launch launched a telecommunications satellite 
Thuraya-2 aboard a Zenit 3-SL rocket. The satellite belonged to Thuraya Satellite 
Telecommunications Company based in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, a company 
providing mobile telephone services to more than 100 countries in the Middle East, Europe, 
Africa, and Asia. Sea Launch had launched Thuraya-1 in October 2000.459 
 
NASA launched the first of two Mars Exploration Rovers from Cape Canaveral Air Force 
Station in Florida aboard a Delta 2 rocket. The destination of the 384-pound (174-kilogram) 
rover Spirit was the Gustev Crater, a site that scientists believed had been a crater lake. NASA 
intended the second of the identical rovers, called Opportunity, to launch later in June and to land 
on the opposite side of Mars from the Gustev Crater at a site called Meridiani Planum, which had 
a large deposit of a type of mineral (gray hematite) that usually forms in wet environments. 
NASA had designed the rolling rovers to capture sharper images, explore wider regions, and

11 June 
ESA launched aboard an Ariane 5G rocket Optus-1, a Japanese-built, hybrid 
communications/military satellite jointly owned by Australia and Singapore, and B-Sat 2C, a 
Japanese geostationary communications satellite from Kourou, French Guiana. The Australian 
Defence Force and Optus, the Australian telecommunications firm and subsidiary of Singapore 
Telecommunications, had jointly funded the Optus-1 craft. To avoid mixing up data between 
defense and commercial applications, the two portions of the Optus-1 payload operated 
independently, one devoted to military use and the other to television broadcasts, high-speed 
Internet services, and voice and data communications across Australia and parts of Asia. B-Sat 
2C would provide direct digital broadcasts to Japan and neighboring countries using Ku-band 
transponders.461 
 
12 June 
U.S. Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN), senior Democrat on the House Science Subcommittee 
on Space and Aeronautics, introduced H. R. 2450, the Human Space Flight Independent 
Investigation Commission Act, in an effort to ensure that future investigations of human 
spaceflight accidents would remain independent and “free from any perception that [NASA] is 
hiding something.” Gordon had wanted President George W. Bush to appoint an independent 
commission, free of any NASA personnel, to investigate the Columbia disastersimilar to the 
commission that had investigated the Challenger accident in 1986. Instead, NASA Administrator 
Sean O’Keefe had to revise the charter of the CAIB three times before the Board had attained a 
measure of independence. Moreover, the Board still included one NASA official and relied on 
NASA staff, an arrangement that Gordon feared would undermine the credibility of the CAIB’s 
final report. H.R. 2450 proposed that, in the event of another disaster, the investigative panel 
would follow the Challenger model, requiring a 15-member commission, with the chairperson of 
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) serving as a member and the President of the 
United States appointing the other 14. Under the terms of the Act, commission members would 
have diverse backgrounds, although some would also have spaceflight and accident investigation 
experience. The resolution also stipulated that NASA personnel could not serve, either on the 
investigative panel or on its staff. The commission would have subpoena powers and would 
report its findings simultaneously to the President, Congress, and the public.462 
 
The CAIB held its final public hearing, moving its focus beyond the cause of the disaster to a 
probe of the overall state of NASA’s management. Witnesses identified several key weaknesses 
in NASA’s management of its personnel, which could have affected safety issues in the Space 
Shuttle Program. Allen Li of GAO, which had issued a report in 2001 about NASA workforce 
issues, noted that NASA had faced substantial challenges in attracting and retaining a highly

skilled workforce. Therefore, key areas of NASA’s programs had an insufficient number of 
qualified workers, and the remainder of the staff showed signs of overwork and fatigue. In 
response to the 2001 report, NASA had developed new systems for monitoring such issues, and 
Li said that NASA had made noteworthy progress. However, NASA was still requesting 
congressional approval of personnel reforms that would help ameliorate the situation, reforms 
that would give NASA the authority to streamline the hiring process and the ability to offer 
larger recruitment and retention bonuses. Marcia S. Smith of the Congressional Research Service 
provided the CAIB with a history of NASA’s budget situation but remarked that the CAIB 
would have difficulty tying budgetary changes directly to safety issues and Shuttle operations. 
Russell D. Turner, the former CEO of the prime contractor for Shuttle operations, United Space 
Alliance, defended the work of the firms involved in the Space Shuttle Program.463 
 
13 June 
NASA named Roy D. Bridges Jr., Director of NASA’s KSC, to head NASA’s LaRC in 
Hampton, Virginia, effective 10 August. Bridges, a retired U.S. Air Force Major General and 
former astronaut who had piloted STS-51F in 1985, was a “natural selection to lead the Agency’s 
premiere center for aviation and space research,” according to William F. Readdy, Associate 
Administrator for Space Flight at NASA Headquarters. Bridges had been Director of KSC since 
1997 and, before that, had held various key aerospace positions, serving as Commander of the 
Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California, as well as Commander of 
the Eastern Space and Missile Center at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and Commander of the 
412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base. With his appointment as Director of LaRC, Bridges 
replaced Delma C. Freeman Jr., who had planned to retire but had been serving as Acting 
Director until NASA found a permanent director. Freeman planned to retire. In transferring 
Bridges to LaRC from KSC, NASA hoped to strengthen its engineering department in 
preparation for resuming Shuttle flights.464 
 
NASA appointed two veteran astronauts―Apollo Commander Thomas P. Stafford and Space 
Shuttle Commander Richard O. Covey―to lead the task force assisting NASA’s return-to-flight 
team. The Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG), composed of distinguished 
experts and industry professionals representing a wide range of disciplines, would help the 
NASA team implement the CAIB’s findings following the release of its final report. Stafford, a 
retired Lieutenant General in the U.S. Air Force who had flown four missions during the Gemini 
and Apollo programs, had also chaired the NASA Advisory Council Task Force on ISS 
Operational Readiness. Covey, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, had piloted the 1988 Shuttle 
Mission STS-26, the first flight following the Challenger accident. He had also piloted Mission 
STS-51I in 1985 and had commanded STS-38 in 1990 and STS-61 in 1993.465

15 June 
The CAIB and members of the U.S. Congress reached an agreement giving selected members 
and staff of the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology access to confidential 
interviews that CAIB had conducted with 225 witnesses, including NASA managers and others 
involved with Columbia’s mission. Because the most sensitive testimony about management 
decision making and engineering practices was contained in privileged statements, CAIB 
Chairperson Harold W. Gehman Jr. had resisted unfettered congressional access, fearing the 
potential effect on witnesses in future investigations of accidents if the CAIB were to release 
privileged testimony. Gehman had argued that privacy was critical to the Board’s ability to elicit 
full, frank, and timely information, citing U.S. Supreme Court decisions supporting privileged 
interviewing, which was a common practice in military aircraft accident investigations. The 
agreement had granted committee members and a select list of staff access to the statements at 
the CAIB’s office andin limited circumstances and under the supervision of a CAIB 
representativeto those at congressional offices. The CAIB retained the right to refuse to make 
information from statements to the Board available to the public. In addition, the CAIB would 
keep a record of those who viewed the information.466

Russia’s Space Forces launched a Molniya 3-53 military communications satellite aboard a four-
stage Molniya-M rocket from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region of Russia. 
Molniya 3-53 was the second Molniya communications satellite launched in 2003.467 
 
NASA released topographic data collected during its Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 
(SRTM), which had lasted from 11 to 22 February 2000, producing three-dimensional 
measurements of more than 80 percent of Earth’s landmass between 60° north and 56° south of 
the equator. Because of South America’s proximity to the equator and its frequent tropical cloud 
cover, traditional satellites had encountered difficulty acquiring imagery of its topography, but 
the cloud-penetrating radar on board the SRTM had produced information with scientific and 
commercial value that would help improve life on the continent. SRTM Project Scientist Michael 
Kobrick of NASA’s JPL remarked that the data would assist governments to prepare for natural 
hazards like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and floods. In addition, the information 
would help improve aviation safety in mountainous areas, and would help land-use planners 
make better-informed decisions about the development of critical infrastructure. The mission was 
a cooperative project of NASA, the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) of the U.S. 
DOD, and the German and Italian space agencies.468

Indiana University in Bloomington; Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, 
Massachusetts; SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View, 
California; and NASA’s ARC and GSFC would join the four lead teams that NASA had selected 
in 2001. The five-year awards, with annual funding levels of US$1 million, would commence in 
the autumn of 2003 when the agreements with the NAI’s 11 founding teams had concluded. Six 
of the new teams were among the founding member teams. 
 
NASA released to the public recovered photographs and video that Columbia’s crew had taken 
during its mission in January. The CAIB had determined that the material was not relevant to 
their investigation into the Shuttle’s demise. The imagery included nearly 10 hours of recovered 
video and 92 photographs. The Shuttle had carried 337 videotapes, of which 28 had recoverable 
footage, and 137 rolls of film, of which only 21 contained recoverable photographs. Search-and-
recovery crews had located more than 84,000 pieces of debris.469 
 
26 June 
NASA announced the appointment of James W. Kennedy as the new Director of NASA’s KSC, 
effective 10 August, succeeding Roy D. Bridges Jr. On 13 June, NASA had appointed Bridges to 
lead NASA’s LaRC. Kennedy had served as KSC’s Deputy Director since November 2002 and, 
before that, he had served as Deputy Director of NASA’s MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama. 
Kennedy had also served as Project Manager for the X-34 and DC-XA initiatives and had led 
KSC’s OneNASA effort to coordinate teamwork across all field centers. He had managed 
MSFC’s Space Shuttle Projects Resident Office at KSC in 1996, returning to MSFC later that 
year to manage the Solid Rocket Booster Project. In 1998 he had become Deputy Director of 
Science and Engineering and, one year later, Director of Engineering. In those positions, he had 
established and maintained a nationally recognized research and development capability in space 
research and technology.470 
 
The remotely operated Helios Prototype aircraft crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a test 
flight within the confines of the U.S. Navy Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) test range. 
Ground-based mission controllers had been flying the solar-electric, propeller-driven, proof-of-
concept flying wing remotely. The craft had been aloft west of Kauai, Hawaii, for about 29 
minutes at approximately 8,000 feet (2,438 meters), when the accident occurred, destroying it. 
High-efficiency solar cells, spread across the upper surface of its 247-foot-long (75-meter-long) 
wing, supplied power to its electric motors and other systems during daylight; at night, an 
experimental fuel cell–based electrical system generated power. The prototype, designed to fly at 
altitudes up to 100,000 feet (30,480 meters) had set a world record for altitude of winged 
aircraft―96,863 feet (29,524 meters)―during a flight in August 2001. NASA had intended the 
craft to fly single-day atmospheric-science and imaging missions at high altitudes, as well as to 
perform multiday telecommunications-relay missions at lower altitudes of 50,000 to 65,000 feet

NASA announced the creation of a five-member board, led by Thomas E. Noll of LaRC, to 
investigate the Helios Prototype accident. The board would work with the U.S. Navy and the 
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration to determine the cause of the 
accident.472 
 
30 June 
The German-Russian Eurockot Launch Services’ Rockot launch vehicle, a modified Russian 
ballistic missile, lifted off from Russia’s Plesetsk Cosmodrome carrying nine satellites and 
nanosatellites. The Rockot booster fired its Breeze upper stage twice, the first time releasing the 
145-pound (66-kilogram) Czech Micromeasurements of Satellite Acceleration (MIMOSA) 
satellite into orbit and, the second time, leaving the Canadian Microvariability and Oscillation of 
Stars (MOST) scientific satellite and six Japanese, Danish, and U.S. nanosatellites in a Sun-
synchronous orbit. A mock-up of a Russian Earth observation satellite that remained attached to 
the upper stage would gather mission data before de-orbiting. The Czech Astronomical Institute 
had launched MIMOSA to gather data on the density of Earth’s upper atmosphere, using a 
sensitive accelerometer designed to detect slight drag forces. President of the Canadian Space 
Agency Marc Garneau described the 113-pound (51.3-kilogram) MOST as “the world’s smallest 
space telescope,” with an aperture of just 15 centimeters (6 inches), about the size of Galileo’s 
telescope. Using an ultra-high-precision attitude-control system, the craft would very finely point 
toward targets, such as neighboring stars, studying how stars eject gas into the interstellar 
medium and seeking data to answer fundamental questions about the universe. Students had 
designed the two Japanese nanosatellites―CubeSat XI-IV and CUTE-1―to test various space 
technologies in flight. Three more student-built nanosatellites deployed via a launch tube―the 
Canadian CANX-1and the Danish AAU CubeSat and DTUSAT―would image stars. Quakesat, 
an American photo-imaging nanosatellite, would conduct an earthquake detection experiment.473

Armadillo Aerospace successfully carried out a milestone test of the company’s candidate for the 
X Prize, dropping the reusable suborbital spacecraft from a helicopter to demonstrate that they 
could recover the complete vehicle after flight. To conduct the test, the team placed 660 pounds 
(273 kilograms) of sandbags in the craft’s cabin area, to simulate passengers, and mounted a set 
of five Olympic barbell plates, to simulate the weight of the engines, plumbing, and backup

recovery system that the competitor’s full-size vehicle would have. A helicopter towed and 
released the craft, the drogue immediately inflated, pulling out the main parachute. Nine seconds 
elapsed between release and full canopy inflation, causing a negligible shock of only two Gs. 
The team was expecting greater opening shock after high-altitude flights. Overall, the vehicle 
fared wellthe craft sustained minor damage to the vehicle’s crushable nose cone, and none of 
the sandbags in the cabin ruptured.474 
 
7 July 
NASA engineers and investigators, together with members of the CAIB, watched as engineers 
fired foam insulation at a mockup of the leading edge of an orbiter wing, creating a 16-inch-wide 
(40.6-centimeter-wide) hole in the reinforced-carbon-carbon panel. Engineers used a compressed 
nitrogen gas cannon to fire a 1.7-pound (0.77-kilogram) piece of foam at the wing mockup at a 
speed of 530 miles per hour (853 kilometers per hour), duplicating the force exerted on 
Columbia’s wing when a piece of foam of the same size hit the orbiter during launch. The test 
results showed that it was possible that a foam block falling from the external tank could have 
breached the orbiter’s leading edge, allowing hot gases to penetrate the wing structure during 
reentry and resulting in the breakup of Columbia.475 
 
8 July 
After numerous delays, NASA launched Mars Explorer Rover-B (MER-B) aboard a Delta 2 
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in time to meet the 15 July deadline. If NASA had not met 
that deadline, it would have had to wait an additional four years to launch the craft. MER-B, 
nicknamed Opportunity, was an exact duplicate of MER-A, known as Spirit, which had launched 
on 10 June. Bad weather, a failed battery cell, and a problem with the cork insulation, which had 
failed to adhere to the aluminum rocket, had caused the launch’s delay. 
 
NASA released documents showing that the Columbia accident was not the first time that 
superheated gas had invaded an orbiter’s wing when it reentered Earth’s atmosphere. The 
documents showed that in 2000 Atlantis had entered orbit with a 0.25-inch (0.64-centimeter) 
breach in its wing’s leading edge, allowing plasma to enter the wing during the orbiter’s reentry. 
The incident had caused only minor damage. Improper insulation installation during Atlantis’s 
overhaul in 1997 had caused the gap to form. Instead of filling up the gap, the insulation had 
been “folded up and pushed away,” leaving an exposed cavity.476

The Boeing Company announced that, because commercial launches were costly and in 
relatively low demand, it would not seek commercial satellite launch contracts for five years, 
focusing instead on providing service for the U.S. military and NASA. However, Boeing was a 
member of the consortium International Launch Services (ILS), which would continue to offer 
commercial launch services. ILS used Russian-made Zenit 3-SL rockets to launch commercial

accommodate customers that preferred to use Delta rockets instead of the Russian-made rockets. 
The company stated that the change in business strategy would not affect any employees who 
worked on the launch programs.477 
 
Undersecretary of the U.S. Air Force Peter B. Teets testified before the House Science 
Subcommittee on Environment, Technology, and Standards that the National Polar Orbiting 
Environmental Satellite (POES) System spacecraft would not be available until late 2009 or 
2010, at the earliest. The U.S. Air Force and NOAA had jointly funded the system, the first of its 
kind, originally planning to deliver it in early 2008. The Bush administration had decided to 
request less money for the project in the near term than it had previously planned, and that 
decision had reportedly caused the delay. Because of the postponement of the delivery date, the 
Air Force and NOAA would need to restructure the contract to account for anticipated cost 
growth. The new system would replace the polar-orbiting systems that the agencies had 
previously operated separately. Greg Withee, NOAA’s Assistant Administrator for Satellite and 
Information Services, stated that the delay could result in a 21-month gap in coverage if NOAA 
encountered problems with its existing fleet.478 
 
In response to the anticipated recommendations of the CAIB, NASA announced its plans to 
create an independent NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) at NASA’s LaRC, 
providing a central location to coordinate engineering and safety assessment for all of NASA. 
The NESC, expected to draw on the talents of 250 staff throughout NASA to conduct analysis 
and share technical information, would report to Director of LaRC Roy D. Bridges Jr. Bryan D. 
O’Connor, Associate Administrator for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance at NASA 
Headquarters, would have responsibility for policy. NASA intended for the NESC to provide 
independent assessment and testing of engineering, in support of critical NASA projects and 
programs; to conduct reviews and evaluations of engineering and safety; to provide a central 
location for trend analysis; to provide a structure to support engineering collaboration for 
problem resolution; to provide central coordination of engineering and programmatic lessons 
learned, technical standardization, and development of technical discipline expertise; and to 
provide independent inspection and validation of activities to ensure the constant maintenance of 
NASA safety standards.479

An Atlas 5 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11:45 p.m. (UT), carrying the 
Rainbow 1 satellite into orbit. The 4.3-tonne (4.7-ton or 4,300-kilogram) Cablevision Systems 
Corporation satellite would provide direct-to-home television services in the contiguous United 
States. The Atlas 5, on its third flight since its inaugural flight in August 2002, carried for the 
first time two 64-foot (19.5-meter), Aerojet-built solid rocket boosters, which enabled the rocket 
to clear the launchpad in just 7 secondsonly half of the time required in the two previous

launches. The launch marked the completion of flight-testing of all major new systems in the 
Atlas line. The U.S. military had designed Atlas 5 under its Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle 
(EELV) Program.480 
 
NASA issued new safety standards for future space vehicles, such as the proposed Orbital Space 
Plane (OSP) and next-generation launch systems, requiring crew-escape systems and methods of 
aborting launches. Earlier, NASA had rejected recommendations for the proposed systems as too 
impractical or expensive for the existing Space Shuttle fleet. The new standards represented 
NASA’s effort to provide “maximum reasonable assurance” that, in the future, mission failures 
would not automatically endanger the crew. The standards, known as the Human-Rating 
Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems, stipulated that NASA would design 
future spacecraft to allow the crew to escape quickly during prelaunch procedures and to abort 
the mission or to effect an emergency escape during ascent.481 
 
18 July 
NASA’s JSC extended its contract with Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International Inc. 
(HSSSI) for work related to the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the U.S. spacesuit used for 
extravehicular activity (EVA). The extended option, valued at US$26 million, was the last of the 
available annual-renewal options of a contract worth US$333 million over six years. Under the 
contract, HSSSI was responsible for the successful performance of the EMU, including the 
design, development, certification, production, and enhancement of the EMU and of other 
hardware used in spacewalking.482 
 
21 July 
NASA announced the release of the first scientific product of the Gravity Recovery and Climate 
Experiment (GRACE) mission, a joint effort of NASA and the German Aerospace Center. The 
GRACE mission had produced the most accurate map to date of Earth’s gravity field, using 
preliminary data collected over 111 days. Project scientists had created the map from selected 
data, which they had used to calibrate and validate the instruments of the pair of American and 
German satellites comprising GRACE. The satellites had measured Earth’s gravitational force 
from orbits 500 kilometers (310.7 miles) high, with 220 kilometers (136.7 miles) separating 
them, making a pass of the entire planet once each month, and producing measurements of 
unprecedented accuracy. The measurements provided precise views of ocean currents and tidal 
changes, enabling scientists to better understand how the oceans affect climate. Although the 
data was preliminary, NASA had released it to oceanographers immediately, months in advance 
of the scheduled start of routine GRACE scientific operations, underscoring the mission’s 
importance and the data’s value.483

NASA announced the successful implementation of new software in three computers controlling 
the precision pointing of NASA’s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscope Explorer (FUSE) satellite. In 
mid-April 2003, NASA had installed the software for the spacecraft’s Attitude Control 
Instrument Data System and the processor for the Fine Error Sensor guide camera, and testing of 
the new configuration had been ongoing since that time. George Sonneborn, FUSE Project 
Scientist at NASA’s GSFC, explained that the uploaded software would allow FUSE to operate 
with any number of gyroscopes, or none, in the event of gyroscope failure. Tests showed that 
FUSE could operate with no gyroscopes without experiencing any degradation in quality of 
scientific data and with only a slight loss of efficiency in scheduling observations. Before the 
new software installation, FUSE had required at least one operating gyroscope on each of its 
three axes to conduct normal scientific operations.484 
 
22 July 
Starchaser Industries Ltd., a British entry for the X Prize competition, successfully tested its 
Nova 2 rocket capsule, dropping it from a Fairfield C123K aircraft near Kingman, Arizona. 
Parachute expert Ted Strong piloted the capsule, which the aircraft had released at an altitude of 
10,000 feet (3,048 meters). Traveling at 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour), the craft 
deployed a 10-foot (3-meter) drogue parachute to stabilize its descent, and 5 seconds later, the 
pilot “oriented the capsule into a horizontal position” before deploying the main steerable 
canopy. The pilot flew the capsule like a glider to a precision landing.485 
 
23 July 
NASA announced the selection of the Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services’ Atlas 5 
expendable launch vehicle for the Pluto New Horizons mission scheduled to launch in January 
2006. The agreement with Lockheed Martin stipulated a firm fixed-price, launch-service task 
order under the terms of NASA’s launch services contract with Lockheed Martin. NASA 
planned for its Pluto New Horizons mission to conduct the first reconnaissance of the binary 
planet system of Pluto-Charon, gathering information about the surfaces, atmospheres, interiors, 
and space environments of Pluto and Charon.486 
 
NASA announced the results of its own mishap investigation board’s review of the loss of the X-
43A Hyper-X research vehicle during its launch on 2 June 2001. The experimental plane was the 
first of three that NASA had developed and produced in a US$185 million program. The board 
concluded that the flight had failed because “the vehicle’s control system design was deficient in 
several analytical modeling areas, which overestimated the system’s margins.” For the test flight, 
the X-43A had launched aboard the nose of a modified Pegasus launch vehicle carried by 
NASA’s modified B-52 bomber. The bomber had released the Pegasus at an altitude of 24,000 
feet (7,315.2 meters), igniting its solid rocket motor (SRM) and sending the research-vehicle 
payload on its test flight. After beginning its planned pitch-up maneuver, the X-43A had 
experienced a control anomaly leading to a structural overload of the starboard elevon. The

vehicle had then deviated significantly from its planned trajectory, and NASA had destroyed it 
48.6 seconds after its release. The mishap investigation board, which had found a number of 
modeling inaccuracies, had been able to reproduce the flight mishap only after incorporating all 
of the inaccuracies into its analysis, leading the board to conclude that no single factor or 
potential contributing factor had caused the mishap. The board also found that preflight analyses, 
including wind tunnel tests, had failed to predict how the rocket would perform in flight.487  
 
25 July 
NASA announced appointments to the Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG), 
formed to conduct an independent assessment of NASA’s implementation of the CAIB’s 
recommendations. On 13 June, NASA had initially announced the formation of the SCTG to 
oversee an independent assessment of NASA’s efforts to implement the CAIB’s 
recommendations. Cochaired by veteran astronauts Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. Covey, 
NASA had selected the SCTG’s members from experts in industry, academia, and government, 
active in fields relevant to spaceflight safety. NASA had organized the SCTG pursuant to the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act, selecting only non-NASA employees as members, as well as 
one nonvoting, ex officio NASA representativethe Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety 
and Mission Assurance.488 
 
29 July 
NASA confirmed that its satellites’ observations had provided the first evidence that the rate of 
ozone depletion in Earth’s upper atmosphere was decreasing, a possible indication of the first 
stage of ozone-layer recovery. Scientists had analyzed data that NASA’s first and second 
Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and Halogen Occultation Experiment 
(HALOE) satellite instruments had collected, discovering a decrease in ozone depletion after 
1997. The scientists had found that the rate of depletion was consistent with the decline in 
abundance of the human-made chemicals that contribute to ozone destruction. However, 
according to Michael J. Newchurch of the University of Alabama, the lead scientist for the study, 
ozone depletion was still occurring, although its rate had decreased. Joseph M. Zawodny, a 
scientist on the SAGE II satellite-instrument science team at NASA’s LaRC, remarked that the 
finding would not have been possible if the two satellites had not lasted so long past their normal 
mission lifetimes. SAGE II was approaching its 19th launch anniversary, and HALOE had 
returned data for 11 years. Scientists had also used international ground networks to corroborate 
the satellites’ data. The findings indicated the effectiveness of international treaties in 
encouraging countries to curb pollutionspecifically the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances 
that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its amendments.489 
 
The ISS marked its 1,000th consecutive day of human residency aboard the station. The first crew

During that time, the living and working area had increased by 6,000 cubic feet (170 cubic 
meters) to the current area of 15,000 cubic feet (424.8 cubic meters), and ISS partners expected 
the station would eventually more than double its size. The seven ISS crews, consisting of 10 
American and 10 Russian crew members, had conducted 12 spacewalks and had welcomed 11 
visiting Space Shuttles, 4 Soyuz taxi crews, and 10 Progress cargo vehicles. Crews had added to 
the ISS the largest solar arrays ever produced for use in space, the first track-mounted railcar in 
space, and a science facility described as the most sophisticated space laboratory to date.490  
 
31 July 
For the first time, NASA quantified the costs related to the loss of the Shuttle, stating that, in the 
six months since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, it had spent US$152.4 million to conduct 
the investigation and recover debris. The figure included US$111.9 million for NASA to support 
the CAIB’s inquiry with research and analysis, including the expensive high-speed, foam-impact 
tests at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, which had provided evidence 
that foam striking Columbia after lift off had caused the hole in the left wing. NASA had spent 
US$18.7 million to fund the 13-member investigative board, paying the salaries of the five 
civilian members, office rent, travel expenses, and the expense of holding public hearings and 
maintaining the CAIB’s Web site. NASA had also spent US$21.8 million recovering debris from 
the Columbia accident, compared to the US$30 million it had spent salvaging pieces of 
Challenger. Shortly after the tragedy, the U.S. Congress had approved US$50 million to cover 
expenses, and it was considering a supplemental appropriation of US$50 million. John Scofield, 
spokesperson for the House Committee on Appropriations, remarked that nobody had criticized 
NASA’s spending, because nobody wanted to do the necessary work “on the cheap.” Scofield 
added that the committee was conducting its own analysis to confirm that NASA had correctly 
estimated its expenditures, but that Congress would likely reimburse NASA for much of the cost. 
NASA had spent a total of US$62 million (adjusted for inflation) to investigate the 1986 
explosion of Challenger. 491

4 August 
NASA selected the University of Arizona’s Phoenix lander concept for a US$325 million 
mission to Mars in 2007, beating out finalists from Arizona State University, NASA’s JPL, and 
NASA’s LaRC. The Phoenix concept, aptly named for the mythical bird that rose from ashes, 
drew on the technology of past expeditions, such as the canceled 2001 Mars Surveyor Program. 
Phoenix’s purpose was to search for evidence of water and carbon dioxide gasa robotic arm 
would scoop soil samples, small on-board ovens would heat the samples, and on-board 
instruments would analyze them, checking the soil for organic compounds. NASA called the 
Phoenix mission the first of a type of mission it had designated as Scout missions. If funding 
remained available, NASA planned to hold competitions every four years to select relatively 
small missions like Phoenix as Scout missions.492

NASA announced the selection of Donald J. Campbell, Director of GRC at Lewis Field, as 
Special Assistant to the Deputy Administrator for Nuclear and Alternative Power Generation 
Systems, effective 1 October 2003. In his new position, Campbell would lead the development 
and integration of high-power generation systems for propulsion, considered fundamental 
building blocks for sustained robotic and human exploration in outer space and deep space. 
Campbell had directed GRC since January 1994. Local political and community leaders had 
criticized Campbell for his leadership style, which had not galvanized the GRC workforce or 
fully leveraged the Center’s economic potential. NASA named Deputy Director of GRC Julian 
M. Earls to succeed Campbell as GRC’s Director.495

The Canadian Space Agency successfully launched its scientific satellite SciSat 1 aboard a 
Pegasus XL rocket dropped from an L-1011 jet flying out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California. The 330-pound (150-kilogram) atmospheric-research satellite carried two 
instrumentsthe Fourier Transform Spectrometer and the Measurements of Aerosol Extinction 
in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO)intended to 
monitor atmospheric ozone and dust composition in an altitude range of 4 to 100 kilometers (2.5

focusing on the chemical processes that control the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere.496 
 
14 August 
NASA released the final report of the Hubble Space TelescopeJames Webb Space Telescope 
(HST-JWST) Transition Plan Review Panel, an advisory panel assembled to review NASA’s 
plans for removing the HST from service as early as 2011, when NASA was preparing to launch 
the JWST. John N. Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, had 
chaired the independent panel of astronomers. The panel recommended three options to NASA: 
1) to launch two additional Shuttle-servicing missions to the HST in 2005 and 2010, to maximize 
the scientific productivity of the telescope; 2) to launch one Shuttle-servicing mission before the 
end of 2006, to replace gyroscopes and, possibly, to install a propulsion device to de-orbit the 
craft once scientific operations had become impossible, or, alternatively, to de-orbit the craft 
using an autonomous robotic system; and 3) if no Shuttle missions were possible, to launch a 
robotic mission to install a propulsion module to bring down the HST in a controlled descent 
once scientific operations had become impossible. The panel also described various ways to 
extract maximum scientific return from the HST if NASA opted for any of the recommended 
three scenarios.497 
 
21 August 
NASA announced that the Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous Technology (DART) 
spacecraft had completed the lengthy design-certification review for the Orbital Space Plane 
(OSP) program, verifying the craft’s safety, performance, and functional requirements. The 
DART team, based at NASA’s MSFC, planned to demonstrate the vehicle without a human pilot 
in 2004, launching it on a Pegasus rocket dropped from an L-1011 jet. At 40,000 feet (12,192 
meters) over the Pacific Ocean, the Pegasus rocket and the DART craft would separate, and 
DART would travel from a parking orbit to maneuver close to a target satellite or to rendezvous 
with it. The demonstration would require 24 hours. DART was the first of three flight-testing 
demonstrators: Boeing Expendable Launch Systems was developing the X-37 flight 
demonstrator, and Lockheed Martin Corporation was developing the launchpad-abort 
demonstrator. DART was NASA’s first completely computer-controlled, rendezvous-capable 
spacecraft.498 
 
22 August 
A 66-foot-high (20-meter-high) VLS-1 O3 rocket exploded on its launchpad during tests at 
Alcântara Launch Center in Brazil, delivering “a serious blow to Brazil’s nascent space 
program.” Brazil had hoped to be the first Latin American nation to place a satellite in orbit.

According to the Brazilian Ministry of Defence, the accident, which occurred three days before a 
scheduled launch, killed 21 people, mostly civilian technicians, injured 20 others, and destroyed 
two research satellites. The rocket had successfully completed two days of tests before the 
explosion. Brazil’s Minister of Defence José Veigas Filho stated that, for unknown reasons, one 
of the four main motors of the US$2.2 million rocket had ignited, leading to the explosion that 
destroyed the launchpad. The accident was Brazil’s third failed attempt to launch a rocket with a 
research satellite.499 
 
Scientists studying data produced by the thermal emission spectrometer (TES) on board NASA’s 
Mars Global Surveyor published findings in the journal Science disputing the theory that Mars 
once had a warm climate. Using the TES, which measured infrared light from rocks, scientists 
had searched for patterns of color to identify different minerals, particularly carbonates. 
Carbonates form only in the presence of liquid water. TES data confirmed small concentrations 
of carbonates in Martian dust, but no large deposits, such as those that would have formed at the 
bottom of a lake or ocean. Lead author of the article, Philip R. Christensen of Arizona State 
University, remarked that, according to the data, it was “extremely unlikely” that large bodies of 
water exposed to the atmosphere for an extended period had ever existed on Mars. Matthew P. 
Golombek of NASA’s JPL commented that the new findings directly contradicted the idea that, 
at one time, Mars may have been warmer and wetter with a denser carbon-dioxide atmosphere. 
Previously, scientists had proposed this theory to explain Mars’s apparent geological formations 
resembling the intricate patterns of riverbeds, carved canyons, and delta fans.500 
 
25 August 
NASA successfully launched its Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) aboard a Delta 2 
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Lockheed Martin–built SIRTF was the fourth and final 
of NASA’s Great Observatories, following the HST, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and 
the Chandra X-ray Observatory. NASA had designed the 110-pound (50-kilogram), 33.5-inch 
(85-centimeter) telescope to measure heat from celestial objects. SIRTF would study some of the 
same deep space objects as the other Great Observatories, as well as studying other parts of the 
cosmos. Michael Jura, SIRTF interdisciplinary scientist for planetary science at the University of 
California at Los Angeles, remarked that one of SIRTF’s main scientific goals was to develop a 
better understanding of star and planet formation. The project, originally proposed in the mid-
1970s, had faced repeated budgetary cutbacks and delays. NASA planned for SIRTF’s mission 
to last a minimum of 30 months, at an anticipated cost of US$1.19 billion.501 
 
26 August 
NASA announced that it had awarded a follow-on contract to the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to continue providing scientific and operational 
support for the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory had 
provided scientific and operational support since Chandra’s launch in July 1999. The follow-on

contract, valued at US$373 million, funded support through 31 July 2010. NASA had planned 
Chandra’s mission to last five years from the time of its launch, but had extended the mission to 
10 years because of Chandra’s success.502 
 
Harold W. Gehman Jr. delivered the CAIB’s final report to NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe, 
presenting its findings and recommendations. The CAIB found that a 1.7-pound (0.77-kilogram) 
piece of foam insulation, traveling at more than 500 miles (804.6 kilometers) per hour, had 
damaged Columbia’s wing during launch, ultimately leading to its disintegration during reentry. 
The report stated that management decisions during Columbia’s flight reflected missed 
opportunities, ineffective communication channels, flawed analysis, and ineffective leadership. 
When cameras tracking Columbia provided two grainy images showing the foam striking the 
wing, engineers had immediately begun to discuss obtaining further images of the Shuttle or 
initiating a spacewalk to check for damages. However, mission managers had “adjourned for a 
holiday weekend and did not discuss the foam strike.” Upon returning to work on 21 January, the 
managers had assessed the strike as a postlanding maintenance problem, because smaller foam 
strikes had left harmless dents in Shuttles during all previous missions. The CAIB’s Executive 
Director John L. Barry remarked that, among NASA’s competing goals of maintaining costs and 
meeting schedules, safety had lost out. The Board directly criticized Administrator Sean O’Keefe 
for increasing pressure to meet a February 2004 launch deadline, thereby creating a pattern 
similar to that which had led to the Challenger disaster in 1986. The CAIB recommended that 
NASA implement 15 actions before the next Shuttle flight, including creating an independent 
safety-and-engineering organization to help establish satisfactory safety margins. Upon receiving 
the Board’s final report, O’Keefe reiterated NASA’s intention to comply fully with the 
recommendations.503

Progress M-48 12P launched on a Soyuz FG rocket, carrying 2.6 tonnes (2.87 tons or 2,600

carried were an Iridium satellite phone and GPS equipment for the use of the Expedition 7 
crewRussian Commander Yuri Malenchenko and NASA Science Officer Edward T. 
Luwhen they returned to Earth in the Soyuz TMA-2 spacecraft in October. The Russian Space 
Agency had added the satellite phone and GPS equipment to the supplies because Soyuz TMA-1 
had experienced an internal glitch while returning the Expedition 6 crew to Earth, resulting in a 
long, tense search for the craft and crew.504

SEPTEMBER 2003 
 
3 September 
NASA announced the appointment of John M. Grunsfeld to succeed Shannon W. Lucid as 
NASA’s Chief Scientist, effective immediately. NASA tasked Grunsfeld with ensuring the 
scientific merit of NASA’s programs. Grunsfeld, an astronomer, astrophysicist, and veteran 
astronaut, had been an integral member of two Space Shuttle–servicing missions to the HST. 
Lucid had served as Chief Scientist since February 2002. NASA’s Administrator Sean O’Keefe 
had asked her to return to NASA’s JSC in Houston, Texas, to help with return-to-flight efforts. 
During her tenure as Chief Scientist, Lucid had updated NASA science policy, a project that 
NASA had not undertaken since 1996. One of her most important tasks had been working with 
the Offices of Biological and Physical Research, Earth Science, Space Science, and Space Flight 
to develop a comprehensive plan for prioritizing research projects on board the ISS.505 
 
CAIB Chairperson Harold W. Gehman Jr. and NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe appeared 
before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to discuss NASA’s 
return-to-flight goals in light of the CAIB’s findings. Committee members criticized the CAIB 
for its reluctance to assign individual blame within NASA for the Columbia disaster, but 
Gehman replied that the Board did not need to make judgments about individual accountability. 
O’Keefe added that NASA would have held individuals accountable only if someone had acted 
maliciously in the sequence of events that led to the loss of Columbia. O’Keefe also pointed out 
that all former members of the Shuttle team had either left their positions, or NASA had 
reassigned them. Gehman testified that the decisions and conditions that had led to the loss of the 
orbiter had begun years before, stating that Congress and the White House shared responsibility 
with NASA for creating the conditions responsible for the accident. Congress and the White 
House had reduced NASA’s budget by 40 percent over the previous decade, affecting the 
operation of NASA’s management system. When committee members asked whether NASA 
required additional funding for 2004, O’Keefe responded that the current budget did not cover 
some of the CAIB’s recommended activities, such as establishing an independent authority to 
oversee Space Shuttle technical requirements, recertifying the orbiters, and accelerating the 
Orbital Space Plane (OSP) program. Committee members asked for O’Keefe’s assurance that 
NASA would change its culture, implementing processes that would prevent future Shuttle 
accidents.506 
 
4 September 
NASA announced the completion of tests, which had taken place on 27 August at Edwards Air 
Force Base in California, demonstrating the possibility of reducing the impact of sonic booms. 
The research team showed that modifying an aircraft’s shape alters the shape of its sonic boom, 
thus reducing the sound level. Northrop Grumman Corporation had modified the fuselage and 
nose of an F-5E fighter jet for the demonstration. The modified jet and a regular F-5E had each 
flown at Mach 1.36 from the same supersonic corridor. The two aircraft had demonstrated no

difference in performance except that the modified jet’s sonic boom was 33 percent less intense 
than that of the unmodified F-5E. Analysis and wind tunnel tests had predicted the outcome, but 
NASA had never before flight-tested the theory. Richard Weizman of NASA’s Office of 
Aerospace Technology remarked that the demonstration was the culmination of 40 years of work 
by visionary engineers. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had managed the 
Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration (SSBD) program under its Quiet Supersonic Platform 
Initiative. NASA’s LaRC and Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC), as well as Northrop 
Grumman Corporation, had been partners in the SSBD program under a US$7 million 
cooperative agreement.507 
 
CAIB Chair Harold W. Gehman Jr. and three other Board members appeared before the U.S. 
House Committee on Science and Technology to discuss the CAIB’s findings. Gehman testified 
that budgetary pressures that the U.S. Congress and the White House ultimately controlled had 
been partly responsible for NASA’s management failures. House Committee Chair Sherwood L. 
Boehlert (R-NY) concurred that Congress shared some of the blame in the 1 February loss of 
Columbia but reiterated that NASA needed to make changes. Many of the committee’s questions 
focused on prospective remedies for NASA’s poor risk management. While agreeing that NASA 
had a tendency to be overly optimistic in risk assessment, Gehman and other investigators 
explained to the committee that, because of the age of the Shuttle fleet, risk calculations were 
little more than estimates. Boehlert expressed concern that NASA was rushing to meet 
unrealistic return-to-flight dates―NASA had proposed a March 2004 launch date―rather than 
studying the CAIB report carefully and taking deliberate steps toward returning the Shuttles to 
flight.508 
 
6 September 
While moving NOAA’s 14-foot (4.3-meter) NOAA-N Prime weather satellite from a vertical to 
a horizontal position, workers at a Lockheed Martin plant dropped the nearly completed US$239 
million craft, causing serious damage. Lockheed Martin spokesperson Buddy Nelson stated that 
the cart holding the spacecraft “was not in the proper configuration for the planned activity.” 
NASA’s GSFC was responsible for overseeing the construction and launch of the satellite, and 
NOAA would assume control of the craft once it was in orbit. Lockheed Martin Space Systems 
Company had been building weather satellites since the NOAA satellites’ initial launch in the 
early 1960s.509 
 
8 September 
NASA released its first preliminary return-to-flight plan, briefing reporters at JSC in Houston, 
Texas. The 158-page report, which Associate Administrator William F. Readdy called “an 
evolving document,” indicated that 11 March 2004 was the earliest possible date for a Space 
Shuttle to return to flight. However, Readdy emphasized that NASA would be safety-driven, not

schedule-driven, in its efforts to launch the first Shuttle to fly since the Columbia disaster. NASA 
had tentatively scheduled Atlantis for a launch between 11 March and 6 April 2004. In the 
preliminary plan, NASA indicated that it had changed Atlantis’s original mission of ferrying 
supplies and a new crew to the ISS. Instead, the mission would be a developmental flight during 
which the crew would test the new procedures and safety equipment that the CAIB had 
recommended. Although the ISS would still be Atlantis’s destination, the mission would not 
carry ISS replacement crew. NASA’s Space Shuttle Program Manager William W. Parsons Jr. 
said that the greatest challenges for future Shuttle missions would be developing methods to 
minimize the shedding of foam from the orbiter’s external tank and to repair tile and protective 
heat panels while in space. In addition, NASA would have to install cameras and sensors on the 
Shuttles and on the ISS robotic arms, to detect vehicle damage.510 
 
9 September 
NASA selected Team Encounter LLC as the first private company contracted to manage a 
commercial mission carrying one of NASA’s space science technology experiments into space. 
Valued at approximately US$6.5 million, the contract required the commercial company to 
mount NASA’s hardware on Team Encounter’s spacecraft and to integrate and test the system 
before the launch, scheduled to take place in 2004 or 2005. As the demonstration experiment for 
the mission, NASA selected a solar-sail technology known as the Inertial Stellar Compass (ISC) 
Technology Experiment. After the launch, Team Encounter would provide to NASA about 30 
days of data from the ISC experiment. Charles Gay, NASA Program Executive for the New 
Millennium Program, remarked that the award was an opportunity for NASA to work with 
commercial industry in a mutually beneficial venture providing NASA with an effective way of 
validating its technology experiments in space at a reasonable cost.511 
 
The U.S. Air Force launched a Titan 4B rocket with a Centaur upper stage carrying USA 171, an 
Orion classified satellite serving the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). The Air Force 
provided no comment on the payload’s destination or its whereabouts following the separation of 
the second stage of the Centaur. The Air Force had delayed the launch of USA 171 since April 
2002 because of a series of technical problems and issues with the payload. The launch was 
likely the last of the Titan-Centaur launches, with only three Lockheed Martin–built Titan 4 
rockets and one Titan 2 remaining to launch. The Air Force had contracted with Boeing and 
Lockheed Martin to replace the Titan 4 family with the Boeing Delta 2 and the Lockheed Martin 
Atlas 5, to provide the Air Force with cheaper, more reliable access to space for military 
payloads.512 
 
NASA announced that NOAA, Lockheed Martin, and NASA had formed teams to investigate

from a vertical to a horizontal position, Lockheed Martin workers had dropped it, significantly 
damaging the craft. NASA and Lockheed Martin had placed the satellite under guard, securing 
all records. NASA and NOAA were waiting for an assessment of the damage to determine how 
the accident would affect satellite programs.513 
 
11 September 
The Boeing Company named John Elbon to replace Joe Mills as Vice President and Program 
Manager of Boeing’s ISS NASA Systems. In his new position, Elbon would lead Boeing’s 
efforts as prime contractor of the ISS, holding the central role in the space station’s design, 
testing, and building, as well as working with the 16 participating countries. Boeing had 
appointed Mills to lead its newest space initiative, the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter Program, part of 
NASA’s development of nuclear-power and electronic-propulsion technologies intended to 
revolutionize space exploration.514 
 
12 September 
NASA announced the appointments of three additional voting members to the Stafford-Covey 
Task Group mandated to perform an independent assessment of NASA’s implementation of the 
CAIB’s recommendations. The new members were Kathryn C. Thornton, a physicist, former 
astronaut, and veteran of three Space Shuttle missions; Susan J. Helms, Chief of the Space 
Control Division’s Requirements Directorate at U.S. Air Force Space Command, who had been a 
member of five Space Shuttle crews and had lived aboard the ISS as a member of Expedition 2; 
and career systems analyst Christine H. Fox, Vice President and Director of the Operations 
Evaluation Group at the Center for Naval Analyses. The new appointments brought the total 
number of task group members to 30, including one member selected from NASA staff who 
would not vote. Members representing industry, academia, and government, divided among three 
panels, would examine the management, technical, and operational aspects of NASA’s return-to-
flight effort.515 
 
16 September 
NASA and the U.S. Army transferred an XV-15 tilt-rotor aircraft to the National Air and Space 
Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington Dulles International Airport in 
Virginia. J. Victor Lebacqz, Acting Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of Aerospace 
Technology, described the XV-15―a unique type of aircraft possessing the takeoff, hover, and 
landing capabilities of a helicopter, with the range and speed of a turboprop aircraft―as one of 
NASA’s most successful research aircraft and a prime example of cutting-edge aerospace 
research. Tilt-rotor flight research had begun in the 1950s with the Bell XV-3 convertiplane. In 
1977 the first of two XV-15s built by Bell Helicopter–Textron had made its maiden flight. The 
XV-15 had achieved speed and altitude records for its class, receiving multiple awards from 
national organizations. Its success had led to the development of the V-22 Osprey and to the

and scheduled for delivery in 2007.516 
 
17 September 
NASA awarded its Kennedy Space Center Integrated Communications Services (KICS) contract, 
valued at approximately US$190.7 million, to InDyne Inc. of McLean, Virginia. Under the cost-
plus-award fee/firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract, InDyne would 
provide communications services at NASA’s KSC in support of the Space Shuttle Program, ISS 
Program, Payload Carriers Program, and Launch Services Program Office payloads. The KICS 
contract was the first of five work packages in NASA’s space mission communications and data 
services solicitation, which succeeded the NASA consolidated space operations contract (CSOC) 
and incorporated the requirements of the visual information technical contract as well as the 
telephone service requirements of the outsourcing desktop initiative.517 
 
NASA announced the successful completion at KSC of the Multi-Element Integrated Test 
(MEIT) between Kibo, the Japanese Experiment Module-Pressurized Module (JEM-PM), and 
NASA’s Node 2. Only the third such integrated test carried out at KSC, its successful completion 
was a major milestone in demonstrating on-orbit performance of key ISS elements―on-orbit 
activation sequence, command-and-track systems that support audio and video systems, and 
caution-and-warning systems that monitor life systems in ISS modules. A team of international 
participants representing many organizations had carried out the MEIT. Members included ESA, 
Japan’s NASDA, the Canadian Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency; NASA and Boeing 
employees at NASA’s KSC, JSC, DFRC, and GRC; as well as flight-crew members from the 
United States, Japan, and Brazil.518 
 
20 September 
A team of engineers from academia and industry conducted the first known flight test of a 
powered, liquid-propellant, aerospike engine, which they had developed under the California 
Launch Vehicle Education Initiative (CALVEIN). The X-33/Venturestar single stage–to–orbit 
rocket plane, which NASA and Lockheed Martin had shelved, had been a prototype for 
aerospike-motor technology. Students at California State University at Long Beach had designed 
and developed the research vehicle Prospector 2 to use a mixture of liquid oxygen and ethanol. 
The rocket pitched after several seconds of stable flight, crashing to the floor of the Mojave 
Desert in California and destroying student payloads on impact. However, the aft section of the 
vehicle, which contained the aerospike, remained mostly intact. The mission achieved its single 
objective: to lift the vehicle into the air using the liquid-propellant aerospike engine. The test 
revealed several areas of the aerospike-engine design that needed improvement.519

21 September 
NASA’s Galileo mission ended when the Galileo spacecraft disintegrated in Jupiter’s 
atmosphere. NASA had managed the course of the craft’s demise to prevent its becoming 
uncontrollable once it had depleted its propellant. Galileo had launched from Space Shuttle 
Atlantis in 1989, following multiyear delays―originally, NASA had planned for the craft to 
launch in 1982 aboard a Centaur rocket. The probe had made significant contributions to 
scientists’ knowledge of Jupiter and its moons, including collecting evidence of the possibility of 
life on Europa. Galileo had outlasted its prime mission by six years, despite enduring numerous 
technical problems and more than four times the amount of radiation that engineers had designed 
the spacecraft to withstand.520 
 
23 September 
The National Academies’ National Research Council and Transportation Research Board 
released a report addressing the need to overhaul the air transportation system to meet an ever-
increasing demand for air travel. NASA and the FAA had sponsored the report, Securing the 
Future of U.S. Air Transportation: a System in Peril, which representatives of industry, 
academia, and government had written. The Board had found that aircraft and air traffic–
management systems were not improving to meet growing demand; noise and air pollution were 
increasing as air traffic increased; passengers were dissatisfied with travel costs and with 
uncomfortable conditions in airplanes; and security continued to be a major concern to travelers 
and to the industry. In comparing the U.S. air transportation system to that of Europe, the report 
stated that Europe considered the satisfaction of consumer needs a priority, whereas the United 
States did not address the issue. Among its goals, Europe hoped to achieve the primacy of the 
European aeronautics industry, to develop a supersonic aircraft carrying 1,200 passengers, and to 
build an air traffic system that would set the global standard for efficiency, whereas the United 
States had no similar strategy. Therefore, the report recommended that the federal government 
make air transportation a national priority with strong, focused leadership.521 
 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe accepted the resignation of all members and staff of the 
Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), which the U.S. Congress had first chartered in 1967 
following the Apollo 1 fire. ASAP’s function was to provide an independent body to advise 
NASA’s Administrator about the safety of NASA’s operations, facilities, and personnel. In her 
resignation letter, ASAP Chairperson Shirley C. McCarty stated that the panel had decided to 
resign so that the NASA’s Administrator and Congress would have an opportunity to revitalize 
ASAP and to reshape its charter and mission. The panel also noted its frustration that, over the 
years, legislation had weakened its authority and that the CAIB final report had described the 
ASAP as “often not very influential.” Experts had noted that NASA had often ignored warnings 
that the safety panel issued and that ASAP had possessed no authority to enforce its 
recommendations. In accepting the ASAP members’ resignations, O’Keefe pledged to strengthen

meet the needs of NASA.522 
 
NASA announced the successful completion of the systems-requirement review for the OSP 
program, evaluating the contractor teams’ concept designs for providing crew rescue and transfer 
for the ISS according to Level 1 requirements. The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin, and a 
team composed of members from Orbital Sciences Corporation and Northrop Grumman had 
conducted systems analysis, trade studies, and concept feasibility in preparation for the review. 
The review had also set Level 2 requirements, addressing guidelines for safety, launch, 
emergency-return and crew-transfer missions, mission frequency, on-orbit mission duration, 
contingency cargo requirements, and docking and interfacing with the ISS.523 
 
26 September 
NASA notified Resource21 LLC, a remote-sensing firm based in Englewood, Colorado, that 
NASA had rejected the company’s US$500 million bid to provide Landsat-type data for five 
years. NASA had managed the bidding process for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission on 
behalf of the USGS, which was responsible for archiving and distributing Landsat data. 
Resource21 was the only company to submit a final bid in the competition to commercialize the 
U.S. government’s satellite-based Landsat information program.524 
 
27 September 
A Russian Cosmos-3M rocket launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia carrying three 
100-kilogram (0.1-tonne or 0.11-ton) satellites into orbit for Nigeria (NigeriaSat-1), Turkey 
(BILSAT-1), and the United Kingdom (UK-DMC). The satellites joined a similar satellite from 
Algeria, launched in November 2002, to form the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC). The 
DMC’s purpose was to provide environmental information regarding floods, earthquakes, and 
fires. Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. of Guildford, United Kingdom, which specialized in small 
satellites, had initiated the DMC project. The four craft had ground resolution of 32 meters (105 
feet), and each image produced by the satellites showed 600 square kilometers (231.7 square 
miles). The Cosmos-3M also carried two military satellites for Russia. One of the satellites, 
Rubin-4 DSI, was a Russian communications experiment in transmitting telemetry data via 
standard e-mail, using Orbcomm communications satellites. Another, Mozheyets-4, built by 
students at the Mozhaisk Military Space Academy, tested hardware for future use on Russia’s 
GLONASS (Global Satellite Navigation System). The third was South Korea’s KAITSAT-4 
scientific-research microsatellite, a demonstration platform to test new satellite systems, hosting 
five science experiments from an international team of researchers.525 
 
In its first mission to the Moon, ESA launched its Small Mission for Advanced Research in 
Technology (SMART-1) spacecraft aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana.

SMART-1 was the first spacecraft since NASA’s 1998 Lunar Prospector to attempt the journey 
to the Moon. ESA planned for the 770-pound (349.2-kilogram) craft, powered by an ion-
propulsion engine, to reach the Moon in early 2005. SMART-1 carried 33 pounds (15 kilograms) 
of miniature instruments, which researchers from Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, 
and the United Kingdom had provided, including a color camera the size of a human eye, a 4.4-
pound (2-kilogram) infrared spectrometer, and an 11-pound (5-kilogram) x-ray spectrometer. 
The purpose of the SMART-1 mission was to solve certain mysteries about the Moon’s 
formation, its mineralogical composition, and the amount of water it has, if any. The Ariane 5 
also carried into orbit two telecommunications satellites―the INSAT 3-E for India and the 
European e-BIRD. ESA had delayed the launch of e-BIRD since 28 August to allow the Indian 
Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to make further checks on its satellite.526 
 
OCTOBER 2003 
 
1 October 
A telecommunications satellite jointly owned by the United States and Japan―known as 
Horizons 1 or Galaxy 13―launched aboard a Sea Launch Zenit 3-SL rocket from a platform in 
the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Connecticut-based PanAmSat and Tokyo-based JSAT corporations 
launched the craft to provide digital video, Internet, and data transmission services to Hawaii and 
to Central America and North America. PanAmSat owned the satellite’s C-band payload Galaxy 
13 and planned to use it as part of the company’s Galaxy cable constellation. President and CEO 
of PanAmSat Joseph R. Wright Jr. remarked that the addition of Galaxy 13 to the company’s 
fleet would create the first high-definition neighborhood and would help to meet the growing 
demand for high-resolution television. The two companies would jointly operate the satellite’s 
Ku-band payload Horizons 1, which would offer a variety of digital video, Internet, and data 
services, as well as creating new IP-based content-distribution networks.527 
 
Japan merged its three space agencies with the goal of saving US$89.8 million a year. According 
to the new configuration, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) would manage the 
unified entities of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, NASDA, and the National 
Aerospace Laboratory. Modeled on NASA but about one 10th of the size of its American 
counterpart, JAXA had 1,800 employees and an initial annual budget of US$1.66 billion.528 
 
8 October 
NASA announced its selection of Allied Aerospace Industries of Tullahoma, Tennessee, to 
manufacture three flight-ready experimental demonstrator vehicles for the X-43C project, a 
NASA-led initiative. NASA’s LaRC had led the team, comprising members from the U.S. Air 
Force and from the aerospace industry, to design and develop the X-43C demonstrator vehicle 
and propulsion system. Following the example of the Hyper-X (X43-A), a vehicle designed to 
demonstrate short-duration, scramjet-powered flight at Mach 7 and Mach 10, the creators of the

X-43C intended it to demonstrate free flight of a scramjet-powered vehicle, with acceleration 
capability between Mach 5 and Mach 7. Allied Aerospace Industries had also developed the 
X43-A vehicle. The Air Force had provided a dual-mode scramjet capable of operating as a 
ramjet or scramjet for the X-43C vehicles. The cost-plus-fixed-fee completion-type contract that 
NASA awarded to Allied Aerospace Industries was valued at US$150 million over 66 months, 
covering all work through completion of the Preliminary Design Review; options covered the 
final design, hardware fabrication, and all support activities. X-43C Project Manager Paul L. 
Moses remarked that the demonstrator vehicle would validate advanced technologies, design 
tools, and test techniques for designing reusable space-access vehicles in the future.529 
 
10 October 
NASA announced the appointment of Steven J. Dick as NASA’s Chief Historian, to succeed 
Roger D. Launius, who had departed in July 2002 to become Historian of the National Air and 
Space Museum. An astronomer and historian of science, Dick had served as the first Historian of 
the U.S. Naval Observatory and, just before his NASA appointment, had been Acting Chief of 
the Naval Observatory’s Nautical Almanac Office. As an expert in the field of astrobiology and 
its cultural implications, Dick had served on a panel examining the potential societal implications 
of the discovery of life in the Mars rock. He had received the NASA Group Achievement Award 
in recognition of his contributions to the establishment of the NASA Astrobiology Institute 
(NAI), including the definition of the field of astrobiology. Dick had authored more than 100 
works, including a history of the Naval Observatory, Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval 
Observatory, 1830–2000, which had won the John Lyman Award of the North American Society 
for Oceanic History for best book in 2002 in Science and Technology and the U.S. Naval 
Observatory’s Captain James Melville Gilliss Award for extraordinary dedication and exemplary 
service. At the time of his appointment, Dick served on the editorial boards of several journals 
and was an associate editor of the International Journal of Astrobiology. From 1993 to 1994, 
Dick had served as Chairperson of the Historical Astronomy Division of the American 
Astronomical Society, and between 1997 and 2000, he had been President of the History of 
Astronomy Commission of the International Astronomical Union.530  
 
14 October 
NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) commissioned the US$34 million NASA 
Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, 
New York, where NASA biologists and physicists would perform thousands of experiments to 
measure the hazards of space radiation and to develop countermeasures to protect astronauts. 
Construction of the facility had begun in 1998. NASA and the DOE had cooperated in building 
the NSRL, which housed an accelerator producing beams of protons or heavy ions, like those 
that the Sun and other cosmic sources typically produce. The beams moved through a 328-foot 
(100-meter) transport tunnel to a 400-square-foot (37-square-meter) target hall, to hit a target 
composed either of a biological sample or of shielding material. Scientists planned to measure

the interaction of specific particles with targets to determine the effectiveness of various 
materials in shielding against radiation and to develop and to test new materials. An NSRL 
health team would perform tests with biological samples to learn how radiation damages cells, 
how to predict risks, and to develop countermeasures to mitigate radiation effects.531 
 
15 October 
The People’s Republic of China launched Shenzhou 5 on a Long March 2F rocket, becoming the 
third nation after Russia and the United States to send a human into orbit. Veteran fighter pilot 
Yang Liwei expected to orbit Earth 14 times before landing. The launch was the culmination of 
the decade-long effort of China’s secretive, military-linked space program, undertaken with the 
hope of improving the communist nation’s image abroad, as well as among its own citizens. 
Chinese officials described the Shenzhou program as homegrown, but western analysts stated 
that Russia had provided China with important technology and training for its taikonaut 
(astronaut) corps. Western analysts described the Shenzhou craft as an improvement over the 
Russian Soyuz design, with new solar arrays enabling the front-end orbital module to remain in 
space after the taikonaut compartment had returned to Earth. In addition, the craft’s improved 
collision-avoidance systems provided Shenzhou with enhanced capacity to avoid dangerous 
space debris.532 
 
NASA released its Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) Mishap Investigation Board (MIB) report, 
which identified four possible causes for the failure of the comet-rendezvous mission. The 
CONTOUR Missionintended to encounter at least two comets and to perform investigations 
and analyses of comet materialhad launched on 3 July 2002. NASA had lost contact with the 
craft on 15 August 2002, following a propulsive maneuver involving the solid rocket motor 
(SRM), and had been unable to reestablish contact as of 20 December 2002. On that date, NASA 
and Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory had concluded that the spacecraft 
was lost. NASA had established the MIB on 22 August 2002. The CONTOUR MIB’s task was 
to examine the processes, data, and actions surrounding the events of 15 August; to search for 
proximate and root causes of the loss of the craft; and to develop recommendations for future 
missions. In its report, the CONTOUR MIB concluded that the probable cause of the mission’s 
failure was the structural failure of the spacecraft resulting from plume heating during the 
embedded SRM burn on 15 August. However, the lack of telemetry and observational data, 
immediately before and during the burn, as well as the lack of recoverable debris, left open the 
possibility that one of several other problems might have contributed to the loss of the spacecraft. 
The MIB report identified as other possible causes the catastrophic failure of the SRM; collision 
with space debris or meteoroids; and the loss of dynamic control of the spacecraft.533

awards, presented in the categories of Space Explorer, Communications, Space Scientists, 
Technology for Humanity, and Aerospace, honored scientists whose work had benefited the U.S. 
space program and all of humanity. A veteran of seven spaceflights, a record he shared with only 
one other astronaut, Chang-Dìaz was Director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at 
NASA’s JSC in Houston, Texas, where he was leading a team to develop the Variable Specific 
Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) Engine. The team was working on a conceptual 
engine that would eventually enable humans to explore distant regions of Earth’s solar system 
and, perhaps, regions beyond the solar system. A native of Costa Rica, Chang-Dìaz had earned 
undergraduate and advanced degrees in mechanical engineering and applied plasma physics from 
the University of Connecticut and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before becoming an 
astronaut in 1981. He had first traveled to space in 1986 and, most recently, had participated in 
the ISS assembly and crew-exchange mission in June 2002, during which he undertook three 
spacewalks.534 
 
16 October 
Chinese taikonaut Yang Liwei successfully completed his 21-hour mission of 14 orbits around 
Earth aboard the Shenzhou 5, landing safely in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. From aboard the 
ISS, American astronaut Edward T. Lu, speaking in Chinese, had welcomed Yang to space and 
wished him a safe journey and success. Russian cosmonaut Yuri I. Malenchenko had told 
Mission Control in Houston that he was glad to have someone else in space besides himself and 
Lu, congratulating the great accomplishment of thousands of people in the People’s Republic of 
China who had worked together to send Yang into space. After emerging from his capsule, Yang 
stated that Shenzhou 5 had operated very well, that he felt well, and that he was “proud of the 
motherland.”535 
 
18 October 
Soyuz TMA-3/ISS-9S launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan transporting to 
the ISS the Expedition 8 crew―American Mission Commander C. Michael Foale, Russian 
Flight Engineer Alexander Y. Kaleri, and Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque. Foale and Kaleri were 
traveling to the ISS for a 200-day mission, replacing American Edward T. Lu and Russian Yuri 
I. Malenchenko who were completing a six-month stay aboard the orbiting station. Duque would 
conduct 10 days of scientific experiments on the ISS and would return to Earth with Lu and 
Malenchenko.536 
 
The U.S. Air Force launched its Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F16 craft 
aboard a Titan 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, marking the final launch 
of the Lockheed Martin launch vehicles. In keeping with its 1986 agreement with the U.S. Air 
Force, Martin Marietta had converted 14 Titan 2 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) into 
space launch vehicles. The Air Force had used the converted missiles to launch weather and spy 
satellites into low Earth orbit; the first such converted missile launched in September 1988. The

Titan 2 that launched the DMSP F16 satellite was the 13th of the 14 converted ICBMs to launch; 
the Air Force had no plans for the 14th converted ICBM except to hold it as a spare. The 
successful launch of the satellite marked the end of the 33 months of postponements of the 
US$450 million mission that had resulted from technical problems. The Air Force intended for 
the craft to track clouds, storm systems, and hurricanes, planning to use the data that the satellite 
collected to forecast weather and to monitor ice and snow coverage, pollution, and fires. The 
constellation of two primary DSMP satellites and older backups provided meteorologists with 
information for generating forecasts, which commanders and troops relied upon for strategic and 
tactical planning. DSMP F16 replaced DSMP F15, which had launched in December 1999, as 
the lead craft in the constellation’s mid-morning orbit.537

province. The 1.6-tonne (1.76-ton or 1,600-kilogram) CBERS 2 remote-sensing satellite, 
designed to collect data related to the environment, agriculture, urban planning, and water 
pollution, would be under Chinese control for 18 months before transferring to Brazilian control 
for a minimum of six months.538 
 
NASA awarded a US$9.7 million grant to Colorado State University to study radiation and 
cancer. The grant was one of three that NASA awarded to institutions as part of a new initiative 
to establish national centers studying risks associated with deep space travel. The grant 
established the NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) at Colorado State University, 
which would investigate the risk of the development of cancer associated with radiation 
exposureparticularly with the development of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which has 
a direct correlation with radiation exposure. The research, which would study threats to 
astronauts from radiation in space, would directly benefit cancer patients who develop AML as a 
secondary cancer after radiation therapy treatments of the initial cancer.539 
 
25 October 
JAXA officials announced that mission controllers had lost contact with the Advanced Earth 
Observing Satellite 2 (ADEOS 2), nicknamed Midori 2. The environmental research satellite was 
conducting a joint mission of the United States and Japan designed to study ocean winds, sea 
surface temperatures, sea ice, and water vapor distribution in the atmosphere; to monitor plant 
life and vegetation in marine areas; and to monitor Earth’s ozone layer. The craft had launched 
14 December 2002 to replace Midori 1, which had been lost in 1997 when a solar-array 
malfunction had left it with no power supply.540

At 8:47 p.m. (EST), Soyuz TMA-2 landed safely in the steppes of Kazakhstan, returning to Earth 
the ISS Expedition 7 crew, American astronaut Edward T. Lu and Russian cosmonaut Yuri I. 
Malenchenko. Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque of ESA was also aboard the flight, returning from 
a 10-day mission performing scientific experiments in the ISS lab. The Soyuz TMA-2 flight was 
equipped with a GPS and satellite phones, which NASA had donated to prevent a disruption in 
communications between the crew and Mission Control Center in Moscow. Such a disruption 
had occurred in May 2003, when a Soyuz craft returning from the ISS had landed 250 miles 
(402.3 kilometers) off course because of a computer malfunction.541 
 
28 October 
NASA released to the public five additional volumes of the CAIB’s report. The new 
volumes―including reports that NASA and other organizations had written; working documents 
the CAIB had produced; and findings or suggestions that the CAIB had, ultimately, not 
adopted―provided the full context of the technical reports and background information that the 
Board had used as the basis for its official 29 findings. The CAIB stated that conclusions and 
recommendations found in the new volumes did not necessarily reflect the Board’s official 
views; therefore, the Board emphasized that the first volume, containing its official findings and 
recommendations, should always take precedence over the other volumes in the event of a 
conflict in findings.542 
 
29 October  
The GAO presented testimony to the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation 
Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space regarding the impact of the Shuttle fleet’s 
grounding on ISS construction and maintenance. Based on a GAO report published in 
September, a report that the full Senate committee had requested, GAO testified that the 
grounding of the Shuttle fleet would increase the cost of completing the ISS and could expose 
the station’s two-person crew to additional risk. NASA had originally estimated the cost of the 
ISS at US$10 billion, but since 1985, the U.S. Congress had appropriated US$32 billion to the 
project. The Bush administration had cancelled several planned ISS modules in 2001, to offset 
US$4 billion in cost overruns. Since the grounding of the Shuttle fleet following the Columbia 
disaster in February 2003, several components of the station―completed and ready to 
launch―had reached their storage limit, necessitating their replacement or refurbishment. The 
inability to ferry heavy items to the ISS had hampered NASA’s ability to correct known safety 
concerns, such as the delivery of additional shielding to protect the ISS crew dormitory from 
orbital debris. Furthermore, NASA had estimated that the probability of space debris penetrating 
ISS living quarters increased by 1.6 percent for each year that the ISS partners postponed 
installing new shielding. The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
had requested the report from GAO. Members of Congress had repeatedly asked NASA to 
provide financial details about the effect of the Columbia accident on the ISS program. However, 
GAO’s September report stated that neither NASA nor GAO could accurately estimate the costs 
associated with the grounded Shuttle fleet. GAO testified that it would be able to make such an

30 October 
The FAA certified the ASDE-X (Airport Surface Detection Equipment) technology, a new 
airport surface–detection system for preventing runway and taxiway collisions, which would 
replace the expensive ASDE-3 system. General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, deployed the first ASDE-X system, and 25 other airports planned to install ASDE-X 
systems during the following four years. The ASDE-X system, which integrated several air 
traffic–control systems, used strategically placed sensors to report the location of aircraft and 
vehicles to controllers, giving them a real-time view of all aircraft and vehicles on airport 
grounds or flying in the area. A collaborative effort between a team of FAA employees, Sensis 
Corporation of Syracuse, New York, and Raytheon Corporation, the FAA had initially intended 
ASDE-X as a lower-cost alternative to the ASDE-3.544 
 
31 October 
JAXA officials announced that the chances of restoring the operations of ADEOS 2, known as 
Midori 2 in Japan, were extremely slight. JAXA had lost contact with ADEOS 2 on 25 October 
and had been unable to restore communications with the US$654 million craft. Analyses of the 
malfunction had provided little hope for recovery. ADEOS 2 had replaced the ADEOS 1 mission 
of 1996, which Japan had abandoned after 10 months when its solar panel had broken down as a 
result of a design fault. Japanese officials stated that they believed ADEOS 2 had not suffered 
exactly the same fate as its predecessor but, rather, had experienced a problem with its power 
circuitry. A JAXA spokesperson suggested that recent solar flares might have affected the 
craftone of the solar flares had been the largest in three decades.545 
 
NOVEMBER 2003 
 
3 November 
NASA filed a request for proposal with Federal Business Opportunities, inviting companies to 
define their schedules for Orbital Space Plane (OSP) design completion, development, testing, 
and delivery. NASA requested the completion of a crew-rescue vehicle by 2008 and a crew-
transfer vehicle by 2012, despite congressional requests that NASA slow down its work on the 
OSP project. The Boeing Company and a Lockheed Martin–Northrop Grumman team had both 
been developing concepts for the OSP, a vehicle anticipated as the next space vehicle to ferry 
astronaut crews to and from the ISS. NASA had hoped to award the prime contract in August 
2004 at the earliest. On 29 October, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science 
and Technology, responsible for authorizing NASA programs, had restated its position that

NASA should halt work on the OSP Program until the White House, Congress, and NASA had 
agreed on the direction the U.S. human spaceflight program would take after completion of the 
ISS. Congressional leaders had also questioned NASA’s funding profile for the program.546 
 
6 November 
ESA’s Science Programme Committee (SPC) dropped the Eddington mission and scaled back 
the BepiColombo mission because of budgetary concerns―the SPC had determined that ESA 
would only have sufficient resources to fund one new mission in the next decade. For that 
mission, the Committee had selected the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Pathfinder 
mission, which would launch in 2006 or 2007 and would test technologies and strategies for the 
planned 2012 LISA mission to detect gravitational waves. ESA had planned for the Eddington 
mission, scheduled for launch in 2008, to monitor the brightness of stars, study their interiors, 
and search for planetsof the size of Earth or smallerpassing in front of the stars. Japan and 
Europe had scheduled BepiColombo, their joint mission to Mercury, for launch in 2011 and had 
originally planned to send a lander to Mercury as part of that mission. Although the SPC had 
cancelled the lander portion of the mission, it still planned for ESA to launch two satellites to 
orbit the planet.547 
 
NASA released an 84-page report, “Implementation Plan for the International Space Station 
Continuing Flight,” detailing NASA’s plans to improve exterior inspections of the ISS and to 
shield the station from debris strikes, while continuing to maintain a crew aboard the ISS during 
the disruption of Space Shuttle flights. Before the Columbia accident, Space Shuttle crews 
visiting the ISS had routinely photographed the exterior of the station; NASA expressed concern 
that in the absence of Shuttle flights, external damage would go undetected. The report outlined 
plans to conduct thorough inspections of external surfaces of the ISS using external cameras and 
classified satellite images, as well as to inspect more closely the wiring and equipment inside the 
station.548 
 
The U.S. Air Force 45th Space Wing transferred operation of Launch Complex 47 at Cape 
Canaveral Air Station to the Florida Space Authority (FSA) by means of a licensing agreement 
under the Commercial Space Transportation Act. J. Gregory Pavlovich, Commander of the 45th 
Space Wing, stated that the transfer of operations was a positive development, remarking that, 
although the Air Force had previously scheduled the launchpad for deactivation, licensing it to 
the FSA would enable Launch Complex 47 to remain available for educational use for years into 
the future. Under the agreement, Brevard Community College could offer as many as 200 
educational launch opportunities over the following five years, allowing for hands-on technical 
education that would help motivate students to join the aerospace workforce.549

NASA announced the successful test of a launchpad-abort test vehicle designed to support its 
OSP Program. Wind tunnel tests had demonstrated the Lockheed Martin–designed Pad Abort 
Demonstration (PAD) vehicle’s stability and maneuverability under simulated conditions 
approximating escape from a catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle. The tests, which followed 
the completion of September’s PAD Preliminary Design Review, marked a significant success in 
the development of a safe and effective crew-escape system, clearing the way for the initial 
testing of the vehicle’s engine in November 2003 and the first set of parachute drop tests in 
December 2003. NASA had not pursued the PAD Project to integrate crew-escape capability into 
spacecraft design since the Apollo program ended.550 
 
7 November 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris Alyoshin and French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin 
signed an agreement allowing Russian access to the ESA launch complex in French Guiana, 
beginning in 2006. The agreement provided for the construction of a new launchpad at Kourou 
for the launching of Russian Soyuz rockets. France agreed to contribute half of the cost of EUR 
314 million (US$361 million), with other ESA member states providing the remainder. The 
agreement also allowed Arianespace to collaborate with the Russian company Starsem to use 
Soviet-era Soyuz rockets for launching medium-sized payloads, thereby closing a gap in 
Arianespace’s marketing range.551 
 
The U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment of Gwendolyn S. Brown as NASA’s Chief Financial 
Officer. Before her nomination in July 2003, Brown had served as NASA’s Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer for Financial Management, and before joining NASA, she had served on the 
U.S. Senate staff and had held various positions within the DOD. Brown had come to NASA 
from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Directorate for Program and 
Financial Control, where she had been a senior program analyst.552 
 
NASA announced the names of three additional members of the crew of the Space Shuttle 
Program’s Return to Flight Mission STS-114. In 2001 NASA had named four astronauts to STS-
114―Mission Commander Eileen M. Collins, Pilot James M. Kelly, Mission Specialist Stephen 
K. Robinson, and Mission Specialist Soichi Noguchi of JAXA. The four were already training 
for the flight, scheduled to launch no earlier than September 2004. Astronauts Andrew S. W. 
Thomas, Wendy B. Lawrence, and Charles J. Camarda rounded out the mission’s crew of seven. 
NASA had originally planned for STS-114 to have a seven-member crew, but in the wake of the 
Columbia accident, NASA had changed the mission objective to focus on testing and evaluating 
new procedures for flight safety, rather than on ISS logistics and crew rotation. Thomas and 
Lawrence were veteran astronauts―Thomas was the second-highest-ranking member of 
NASA’s Astronaut Office, and Lawrence had flown on the Shuttle three times. Camarda was a

12 November 
NASA announced the appointment of U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Thomas Q. Donaldson V as 
Director of its SSC in Mississippi, effective 5 January 2004. Since February 2000, Donaldson 
had served as Commander of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command, one of 30 
agencies at SSC. NASA appointed Deputy Director of SSC Michael Rudolphi, who had been 
acting as interim Director since May 2003, to manage the Space Shuttle Propulsion Office at 
NASA’s MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama, effective 1 December 2003.554 
 
The Partnership for Public Service announced the results of the first survey measuring employee 
satisfaction in the federal government, conducted several months before the Space Shuttle 
Columbia accident. The survey results ranked NASA first, overall, among 28 major government 
agencies; NASA’s MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama, ranked first, and its JSC in Houston, Texas, 
ranked second, among 200 smaller divisions. NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe attended a 
news conference to publicize the results of the survey, describing the findings as a “proud day” 
for NASA. O’Keefe remarked that, although NASA was in the midst of working through the 
tragedy of the Columbia accident, the survey results established that NASA had a “very good 
foundation upon which to work.”555  
 
14 November 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced the appointment of the team that would lead the 
new NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC), chartered in the wake of the Space Shuttle 
Columbia accident. NASA’s Office of Safety and Mission Assurance would assume oversight of 
the NESC. Based at NASA’s LaRC, the NESC would coordinate and conduct testing and safety 
assessments in support of critical NASA projects and programs. O’Keefe had charged Director 
of LaRC Roy D. Bridges Jr. with assembling a team to get the Center up and running. O’Keefe 
remarked that Bridges had “assembled a dynamic group of recognized experts in the fields of 
engineering analysis and risk mitigation.” The group comprised new Director of the NESC Ralph 
R. Roe Jr., formerly Manager of the Space Shuttle Vehicle Engineering Office at NASA’s JSC; 
new Deputy Director Paul M. Munafo, formerly Manager of Materials, Processes and 
Manufacturing at NASA’s MSFC; and new Deputy Director of Safety J. Larry Crawford,

the NESC drew criticism from the U.S. Congress because of his involvement in decisions 
regarding Columbia’s fatal mission. As Director of Shuttle Vehicle Engineering at the time of 
the Columbia accident, Roe had been one of several managers who dismissed concerns about 
possible damage to the Shuttle’s external tank when foam insulation struck the orbiter’s left wing 
after launch. Moreover, he and other mission managers had decided that it was unnecessary to 
obtain satellite images of the orbiting Columbia to check for damage.556 
 
18 November 
NASA announced the new charter and new members of its Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel 
(ASAP). All members of the previous ASAP, which the U.S. Congress had initially chartered in 
1967 following the Apollo 1 fire, had resigned in late September 2003 in the wake of the 
Columbia accident investigation. The original charter had intended the panel to act as an 
independent body to advise NASA’s Administrator on safety issues, but over the years, 
additional administrative procedures had governed the panel’s work. In the new charter, NASA 
revoked those procedures to enable the panel to develop its agenda in accordance with CAIB 
findings. The ASAP’s original 1967 charter formed the foundation of the new charter, with the 
following revisions: 1) the ASAP would make quarterly reports, instead of annual; 2) new 
members would have two-year terms, extendable to a maximum of six years; 3) members would 
have staggered terms to ensure fresh perspectives at regular intervals; and 4) the ASAP would 
focus on industrial and systems safety, risk management, trend analysis, and management of 
NASA’s safety and quality systems. NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe named, as new 
members of the ASAP, Rear Admiral Walter H. Cantrell, Vice Admiral Joseph W. Dyer, 
Augustine O. Esogbue, Major General Francis C. Gideon Jr., Deborah L. Grubbe, Rosemary 
O’Leary, John C. Marshall, Steven B. Wallace, Rick E. Williams, and ex officio member, 
Brigadier General Joseph A. Smith. The new members represented academic, military, and 
industrial sectors; no member was a current or former NASA employee or contractor.557 
 
Federal investigators concluded that a series of avoidable mistakes had caused the fatal crash of 
the chartered King Air A100 carrying Senator Paul D. Wellstone (D-MN) on 25 October 2002. 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the two charter pilots had 
possessed inferior flying skills, they had twice failed to align the twin-engine turboprop on the 
proper course for an instrument landing, and they had subsequently permitted the airspeed to 
drop to dangerously low levels. The craft had stalled and plummeted into the woods, killing all 
eight on board. The NTSB recommended that the FAA improve inspections of on-demand 
charter companies in an effort to improve pilot training and in-flight procedures. The NTSB 
report also recommended that the FAA and NASA create a special technical panel to study the 
feasibility of “low airspeed alert systems,” which would automatically warn pilots, especially 
those of small aircraft, of conditions that could lead to a disastrous stall.558

NASA announced the successful test of a High Power Electric Propulsion (HiPEP) ion engine 
using commercial-utility electrical power, marking the first successful test of an engine that 
could “lead to revolutionary propulsion capabilities for space exploration missions throughout 
the solar system and beyond.” The test used the largest microwave ion thruster ever built. The 
test was also the first in a series, demonstrating the high-velocity and high-power thrust 
necessary for the new nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) applications. NASA’s Project 
Prometheus had been studying the HiPEP―one of several candidate propulsion 
technologies―for possible use on the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO). The JIMO Mission’s 
design included a small nuclear reactor as its power source and electric thrusters to provide 
propulsion. NASA planned for JIMO to study Jupiter’s three icy moons―Ganymede, Callisto, 
and Europa. Director of Project Prometheus Alan R. Newhouse remarked that the test 
represented a “huge leap in demonstrating the potential for advanced ion technologies.”559 
 
The ISS marked its five-year anniversary in space. Since the Russian Zarya control module had 
launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 20 November 1998, the ISS had grown 
from an uninhabited module to a permanently staffed research facility the size of a three-
bedroom house. After five years, the ISS was not completely constructed―NASA was preparing 
more than 80 tons (72,575 kilograms or 72.58 tonnes) of equipment and hardware, including 
solar arrays and support structures, for launch at the Space Station Processing Facility at its KSC. 
Also in launch preparation at KSC was the Node 2 module, which would connect the U.S., 
European, and Japanese research laboratories; and the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module. The 
eventual launch of the European Columbus laboratory under construction in Bremen, Germany, 
would expand the station’s volume to that of a five-bedroom house. The first crew to live aboard 
the orbiting facility had arrived on 2 November 2000, and since that date, eight successive 
crews―22 people―had staffed the ISS, conducting research in bioastronautics, physical 
sciences, fundamental space biology, space product development, and spaceflight disciplines.560 
 
29 November 
JAXA launched an H2-A rocket carrying two classified satellites intended to monitor North 
Korea, but aborted the launch when one of the vehicle’s two boosters failed to separate. Because 
the malfunction meant that the rocket would be unable to attain sufficient height and speed to 
achieve orbit, JAXA destroyed the rocket 10 minutes after launch. In March 2003, Japan had 
launched its first two spy satellites to monitor North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs.561

technical analyses. The memorandum of agreement was the second that the two organizations 
had signed―the latest agreement between NASA and another organization managing high-risk 
operations. The previous agreement between NASA and NAVSEA had enabled the two to share 
information regarding critical supplier quality and performance.562  
 
The U.S. Air Force launched an Atlas 2-AS rocket carrying a classified satellite for the National 
Reconnaissance Office (NRO), marking the final launch of the II-AS model from Vandenberg 
Air Force Base in California. The launch cleared the way for officials from the military and from 
Lockheed Martin to begin renovating Launch Complex 3 to accommodate the Atlas 5 rocket. 
Renovation plans included raising the mobile service tower 30 feet (9.14 meters) to 
accommodate the taller launch vehicles, building a fixed launch platform, modifying the 
umbilical tower, and enlarging the flame trench. The Lockheed Martin Atlas team planned to 
launch the first Atlas 5 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2005.563 
 
4 December 
Scientists studying data from NASA’s Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration 
(IMAGE) satellite and ESA’s four-satellite Cluster constellation published a study in the journal 
Nature reporting that solar wind creates large cracks in Earth’s magnetic field, allowing the wind 
to penetrate the magnetic field and causing geomagnetic storms. The leader of the study, Harald 
U. Frey of the University of California at Berkeley, stated that the data showed that the cracks do 
not open and close sporadically, as scientists had previously thought, but rather, that the cracks 
can remain open for several hours. Using this information, scientists would be able to create a 
better model of the affect of space weather on Earth, helping them to predict geomagnetic 
storms, which disrupt power, interfere with satellites, and endanger astronauts. IMAGE had 
monitored a spot in Earth’s upper atmosphere, revealing an area of heavy particles (ions) striking 
the ionosphere above the Arctic region, thereby creating an aurora with enough energy to power 
75,000 homes. Unlike the auroras known as the northern and southern lights, this aurora was not 
visible to the human eye. Far above the IMAGE satellite, the Cluster constellation had flown 
through the opening created by the solar wind’s interaction with Earth’s protective magnetic 
field. The scientists estimated that the size of the crack was twice that of Earth. The crack 
occurred at the edge of the magnetic field, 38,000 miles (61,155 kilometers) above the planet.564

Russia successfully conducted its first test of a modified Soviet RS-18 Stiletto missile, launching 
the missile from an underground silo at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Stiletto, 
renamed Strela, or Arrow, carried a dummy satellite into low Earth orbit. Originally designed to 
carry six individually guided nuclear warheads, Russia planned for the modified Stiletto to 
become the world’s cheapest booster rocket for commercial satellite launches. Spokesperson for

NASA announced the creation of the first detailed map of the water contained in Earth’s 
atmosphere, a map that would help scientists better understand the nature of atmospheric water 
vapor and its implications for climate change and ozone depletion. In July 2002, NASA had 
taken detailed measurements of water isotopes in the atmosphere using Alias, an aircraft laser 
infrared absorption spectrometer flying aboard NASA’s WB-57F high-altitude jet aircraft. The 
new laser technique had enabled scientists to map the water isotopes with sufficient resolution 
for researchers to use the map to study water transport, as well as to examine the detailed 
microphysics of clouds―key parameters necessary for understanding atmospheric composition, 
storm development, and weather prediction. The resulting map showed heavy hydrogen and 
heavy oxygen atoms, from Earth’s surface to 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) above the planet. 
NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise had funded the mission, which had used six aircraft provided 
by NASA and other federal agencies, to record observations above, in, and below the clouds.566 
 
8 December 
NASA astronaut C. Michael Foale, living aboard the ISS, set a new U.S. space record―Foale 
had spent more time in orbit than any other American had achieved. During four Shuttle 
missions, an expedition aboard Russia’s former space station Mir, and his current residence at 
the ISS, Foale had spent more than 231 days in space, surpassing Carl E. Walz’s previous record 
for an American in space―230 days, 13 hours, 3 minutes, and 37 seconds. Walz had participated 
in four Shuttle missions and one ISS expedition in 2002. Along with astronaut Daniel W. Bursch, 
Walz continued to hold the U.S. record for the longest, single spaceflight―196 days.567 
 
9 December 
JAXA spokesperson, Junichi Moriuma, announced that JAXA had failed in its final effort to 
return the Nozomi craft to the correct trajectory for orbiting Mars. Insufficient fuel supplies had 
prevented the craft’s engines from firing. Nozomi―Hope―had been traveling toward Mars for 
five years and was schedule to arrive in one week. JAXA had planned for Nozomi to examine 
the Martian atmosphere’s interaction with the solar wind, to determine whether the planet has a 
magnetic field. During its journey from Earth to Mars, Nozomi had experienced several 
malfunctions that had altered its trajectory, placing it on a course that was too low and causing 
concern that the spacecraft would crash into Mars, possibly contaminating the surface. JAXA 
officials stated that, although they had failed to place the craft on the correct trajectory, they had 
greatly reduced the probability of the craft’s colliding with Mars. Instead, the craft would escape 
Mars’s gravitational field and enter a long-term orbit of the solar system. Moriuma remarked that

10 December 
NASA’s GRC and the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory (PNNL) signed a Space Act Agreement to collaborate in developing sealing 
technologies for the stacks of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), groups of thin ceramic cells 
separated by gas seals. A combustion-free electrochemical process generates electricity between 
these thin cells. NASA had been investigating SOFC technology to meet the need for high-
efficiency, low-emission power capabilities for aviation and space applications. Prabhakar Singh, 
Director of PNNL Fuel Cell Development, commented that the agreement combined the two 
agencies’ complementary research―PNNL’s work in glass seals and NASA’s expertise in glass 
and glass-ceramic composites.569 
 
17 December 
SpaceShipOne broke the sound barrier during its first powered flight, but a partial landing gear 
collapse caused the privately built supersonic aircraft to veer off its desert runway. Test pilot 
Brian Binnie was not injured during the landing. Scaled Composites LLC, which built the craft, 
stated that engineers could easily repair the damage the craft had sustained. The test flight 
represented a milestone―the first piloted supersonic flight of an aircraft developed by a small 
private company. SpaceShipOne’s specially designed jet aircraft, the White Knight, carried 
SpaceShipOne to an altitude of 48,000 feet (14.63 kilometers) before releasing it. Traveling near 
Mach 1.2, the rocket shut down after firing for 15 seconds. Binnie then placed the craft into a 
vertical climb to reach 68,000 feet (20.72 kilometers). Nine seconds into the climb, the craft 
broke the sound barrier. Binnie then reconfigured the craft to its conventional shape, and glided 
to touchdown, at which time the landing gear collapsed.570 
 
18 December 
NASA released the first pictures from its Space Infrared Telescope Facility and officially 
renamed the craft Spitzer Space Telescope. NASA had named the telescope for one of the 20th 
century’s most influential scientists, Princeton University astronomer Lyman Spitzer Jr., who in 
1946 had first proposed placing telescopes in space. Spitzer had been a major force behind the 
1990 launch of the HST, the first of NASA’s Great Observatories. With the release of the Spitzer 
Space Telescope’s first observations―a glowing stellar nursery; a swirling, dusty galaxy; a disc 
of planet-forming debris; and organic material in the distant universe―Project Scientist Michael 
Werner of NASA’s JPL remarked that the telescope was working extremely well. The fourth of 
its Great Observatories, NASA had designed the craft with powerful infrared detectors to capture 
never-before-seen cosmic features. Unlike its predecessor Great Observatories, which circle

Earth, NASA had deployed the Spitzer Space Telescope in a novel trajectory that placed it in an 
orbit closely trailing that of Earth.571  
 
NASA announced the successful completion of a series of engine and parachute tests, clearing 
the way for NASA to carry out integrated Pad Abort Demonstration (PAD) test flights to support 
its Orbital Space Plane (OSP) program. In November and December 2003, engineers had 
conducted a series of 14 hot-fire tests of a 50,000-pound-thrust (22,680-kilogram-thrust) RS-88 
rocket engine, resulting in a total of 55 seconds of successful engine operation. The Rocketdyne 
Propulsion Power unit of the Boeing Company had designed and built the engine. On 9 
December 2003, engineers had tested the parachutes at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Grounds 
in Yuma, Arizona, verifying the function, performance, and stability of an 80-foot (24.38-meter) 
drogue parachute and of four 156-foot (47.55-meter) main parachutes. Testers had dropped a 
12.5-ton (11.34-tonne or 11,340-kilogram) pallet from 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) to simulate the 
size and weight of a vehicle and crew. The pallet had descended to a soft landing under nearly 
two acres of parachutes.572 
 
19 December 
ESA announced that the Beagle 2, ESA’s Mars Lander, had separated from the Mars Express 
orbiting spacecraft. ESA had scheduled the Beagle 2 to land on Mars early on 24 December 
(EST), while, at approximately the same time, Mars Express would enter Martian orbit.573 
 
23 December 
NASA announced that a team of JPL engineers had successfully tested a new ion-propulsion 
engine design, marking the first performance test of the Nuclear Electric Xenon Ion System 
(NEXIS) engine at the high-efficiency, high-power, and high-thrust operating conditions needed 
for use in large-scale, nuclear-electric-propulsion applications. The NEXIS engine was one of 
several candidate propulsion technologies under review by NASA’s Project Prometheus, an 
initiative to make strategic investments in nuclear-fission power and electric-propulsion 
technologies for use in space travel. NASA intended for Project Prometheus to enable 
development and implementation of a new class of missions to the outer solar system. Lead 
Investigator for the JPL test, James E. Polk, remarked that the NEXIS thruster had demonstrated 
one of the highest efficiencies of any xenon-ion thruster ever tested, and that the research team 
expected the NEXIS design to meet the requirements for the proposed Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter 
Mission.574

in China as Tan Ce 1, Double Star 1 carried eight instruments for investigating Earth’s 
magnetosphere―five from ESA and three from the Chinese National Space Administration. 
ESA and China had designed the mission to study how magnetized and charged particles 
streaming off the Sun affect Earth. The space agencies had scheduled the second of the two craft 
to launch six months after the first.575

2 January 
NASA’s Stardust spacecraft performed a flyby of comet Wild 2, obtaining particle samples, as 
well as the most detailed, high-resolution images ever taken of a comet. Stardust was the first 
robotic mission created to collect material from outside the Moon’s orbit. Scientists planned to 
analyze the particle samples of the comet in January 2006, once the spacecraft had returned to 
Earth. During the flyby, Stardust flew within 240 kilometers (149 miles) of Wild 2, capturing 
images of the comet’s nucleus at resolutions ranging from 6.5 to 32 kilometers (4 to 20 miles) 
per pixel. NASA scientists hoped that the images would help them better understand conditions 
on comets and that the particle samplescomposed of materials identical to those that had 
formed planetswould reveal information about how comets and Earth’s solar system 
formed.576 
 
3 January 
NASA succeeded in landing the first of two robotic laboratories on the planet Mars. The robotic 
rover Spirit was one of two mobile laboratoriesMars Exploration Roversthat NASA had 
designed to collect and analyze geological samples on Mars. Analysis of the samples would help 
scientists determine whether the planet had previously possessed water and the ability to support 
life. The twin rovers, part of NASA’s Mars Exploration Program, would land at sites on opposite 
sides of the planet, where scientists believed that liquid water might have existed in the past. To 
conduct geological research on the planet, NASA scientists had equipped each rover with a 
microscopic imager, a panoramic camera, and a variety of spectrometers. NASA had scheduled 
Opportunity, the second rover, to land on Mars later in January.577

Astronomers published their analysis of the first observations ever made of a supernova 
occurring in a binary star, thereby providing crucial support for a theory concerning the most 
violent type of event in the universe. Supernovas occur when stars exhaust their nuclear fuel 
reserves and collapse, ejecting their outer layers in a massive explosion. Previously, scientists 
had regarded the study of supernovas as important for understanding the evolution of galaxies 
and of the universe, but they had remained uncertain about the origins of supernovas, including 
whether they occur in solitary or binary star systems. However, the team of astronomers from 
ESA and the University of Hawaii had used the HST and the W. M. Keck Telescope in Hawaii to 
observe the remnants of supernova SN 1993J. They had discovered a massive star in close 
proximity to the star that had caused SN 1993J, demonstrating that supernovas emerge from 
binary star systems. According to the astronomers, supernovas occur in binary systems when one 
star collapses, shedding its mass, and a nearby star of comparable size accretes the lost mass.579 
 
12 January 
NASA announced that astronaut Leroy Chiao would replace William S. McArthur Jr. as 
Commander of Expedition 9, the next mission to the ISS. NASA had disqualified McArthur from 
Expedition 9 because of an unspecified medical issue. Chiao, who had trained as McArthur’s 
substitute, would join Russian cosmonaut Valery I. Tokarev for the mission, scheduled to launch 
in April 2004.580 
 
ISS crew members repaired an air leak in the space station. Astronaut C. Michael Foale and 
cosmonaut Alexander Y. Kaleri fixed a leak in a flex hose located in the ISS’s Destiny laboratory 
module. The orbiting space station had begun to lose air on 22 December 2003. After examining 
the station’s air pressure readings, NASA’s Mission Control had informed ISS crew members of 
the leak on 5 January 2004. The air leak had not endangered either the ISS crew or operations. 
By systematically isolating the ISS’s compartments and using an ultrasound device to determine 
the location of a hissing sound emitted by the faulty hose, Foale and Kaleri had discovered the 
source of the air loss.581 
 
14 January 
In a speech at NASA Headquarters, President George W. Bush announced the new space policy 
for the United States, which he called the Vision for Space Exploration. President Bush’s new 
policy called for the completion of the ISS by 2010, the subsequent retirement of the Space 
Shuttle fleet, and the development of a replacement Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) capable of 
conducting human spaceflight missions by 2014. President Bush stated that he would seek US$1 
billion in funding over the next five years to begin research on the new vehicle program. In 
addition, he called for robotic exploration of the Moon by 2008, followed by crewed missions to 
the Moon in 2020 and, eventually, astronaut missions to Mars, directing NASA to divert US$11

billion from existing space programs over the next years to fund the development of the 
technology to travel to the Moon and Mars. President Bush also extended an invitation to other 
countries to cooperate in attaining the objectives of the Vision. Major newspapers described the 
Vision for Space Exploration as a response to the Columbia disaster and a means of regaining 
public support for continued space exploration.582 
 
15 January 
NASA announced it would undergo an internal reorganization to meet its new objectives under 
the Vision for Space Exploration, the blueprint for American space policy that President George 
W. Bush had released one day before. The reorganization included the creation of a new office to 
develop a new CEV and other technologies for future missions to the Moon and Mars. NASA 
named Craig E. Steidle to oversee the new Office of Exploration Systems. Furthermore, NASA 
renamed its Office of Aerospace Technology, which had previously been responsible for 
spacecraft development. Under its new nameOffice of Aeronauticsit would have 
responsibility for developing aviation technologies. J. Victor Lebacqz, former Acting Associate 
Administrator of the Office of Aerospace Technology, became Associate Administrator of the 
new Office of Aeronautics.583 
 
The GAO released its assessment of NASA’s efforts to upgrade the Space Shuttle fleet in the 
wake of the Columbia tragedy. NASA planned to implement the recommendations of the 
Columbia Accident Investigation Board, as well as those of its own Space Shuttle Service Life 
Extension Program (SLEP). The GAO report stated that before NASA determined the upgrade 
requirements and priorities for the Shuttles, it should first determine the Shuttles’ operational life 
and the requirements for meeting the objectives of the Integrated Space Transportation Plan 
(ISTP). Before the announcement of the new Vision for Space Exploration, the ISTP had 
encompassed the space policy of the United States. However, GAO noted that the establishment 
of President Bush’s new Vision for Space Exploration, which formally changed the duration of 
operations for both the Space Shuttles and the ISS, had largely invalidated the recommendations 
offered in GAO’s assessment.584

ESA reported that Mars Express had discovered the first direct evidence of water on Mars. 
Whereas some previous research had suggested that water might be present on Mars, Mars 
Express had detected the presence of actual water ice covered by a layer of frozen carbon dioxide 
at the planet’s south pole. The spacecraft had also found that the amount of carbon dioxide in 
Mars’s atmosphere was inadequate to have warmed the planet sufficiently for the formation of

crucial in determining whether Mars could have supported life in the past.585 
 
19 January 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe officially informed HST Program staff that he had decided 
to eliminate all future servicing missions to the space telescope. NASA had conducted previous 
HST servicing missions to replace aging or inoperable components and to install new 
technologically improved equipment. According to NASA, O’Keefe had made the decision to 
halt the missions in the wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, based on assessments of 
the risk to astronauts performing HST servicing missions.586 
 
23 January 
NASA announced that the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit was malfunctioning because of 
problems related to its flash memory that could take several weeks to repair. Flash memory, a 
type of memory commonly installed in electronic devices, such as digital cameras, retains data 
when the device’s power is off. The mobile robotic geological laboratory Spirit had landed on 
Mars on 3 January 2004 and had performed satisfactorily until it had abruptly terminated 
communications with NASA on 21 January 2004. On 23 January 2004, Spirit had reestablished 
contact with NASA, but, according to major newspapers, NASA scientists doubted that the 
robotic spacecraft would regain full functionality.587 
 
The U.S. Air Force awarded the Boeing Company a US$472 million contract to develop a 
military satellite system capable of secure, high-capacity global communications for NASA, the 
U.S. intelligence community, and the DOD. Under the terms of the contract, Boeing would lead 
a team of companies that would conduct risk-reduction and system-definition studies for the 
Transformational Communications MILSATCOM (Military Satellite Communications) Space 
Segment, which uses laser communications, advanced processors, and other advanced 
technologies to provide communications for airborne intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance. The companies selected to conduct research on the project included Ball 
Aerospace, Cisco Systems, and Raytheon.588

NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed on Mars nearly three weeks after its twin 
rover Spirit had landed on the planet. NASA had created the two mobile robotic rovers to 
explore rocks and soils on Mars to determine whether the planet had previously possessed water

Mars simultaneously, on nearly opposite sides of the planet.589 
 
27 January 
President George W. Bush formally established the President’s Commission on Implementation 
of United States Space Exploration Policy, to provide recommendations on implementing 
elements of his recently announced Vision for Space Exploration. The Commission would make 
recommendations regarding the type of scientific research U.S. scientists would conduct on the 
Moon, the development of technologies to enable human and robotic exploration of the Moon 
and the planets, and the criteria for selecting future destinations for human space explorers. The 
appointed members of the Commission were Edward C. Aldridge Jr., Carleton S. Fiorina, 
Michael P. Jackson, Laurie A. Leshin, Lester L. Lyles, Paul D. Spudis, Neil deGrasse Tyson, 
Robert S. Walker, and Maria T. Zuber.590

The Russian Space Agency successfully launched the Progress M1-11 resupply vehicle to the 
ISS from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 6:58 a.m. (EST). The Progress vehicle, the 
13th resupply flight to the ISS, carried 2.5 tons (2,300 kilograms or 2.3 tonnes) of food, fuel, and 
equipment. The vehicle’s mission designation was ISS 13P.591

NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe and families of the Space Shuttle Columbia crew unveiled a 
commemorative monument for the Columbia crew at Arlington National Cemetery. The crew 
had died when Columbia broke apart during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere on 1 February 2003. 
The marble monument was 66 inches (1.7 meters) tall, 48 inches (1.2 meters) wide, and bore two 
bronze plaques portraying the crew and the shoulder patch they had worn on the mission.592

NASA’s MSFC and KSC provided law enforcement agencies with analysis of video and imagery 
relevant to their investigation of the abduction of an 11-year-old girl in Sarasota, Florida. When 
law enforcement officials asked the two centers to examine security camera footage showing the 
girl’s abduction by an unknown individual, MSFC provided assistance using its Video Image 
Stabilization and Registration System (VISAR), an image-stabilization software program 
developed for space program research. KSC examined the security camera footage using its 
Image Analysis Facility, which NASA had developed for visual analysis of Space Shuttle

in this manner, the case garnered major press coverage throughout the United States.593 
 
6 February 
ESA’s Mars Express orbiter relayed information between ground-based NASA engineers and 
NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, the first in-orbit communication between ESA and 
NASA spacecraft and the first successful international communications network outside of Earth. 
As part of their general efforts to cooperate in space exploration, the two space agencies had 
planned the information relay to enable future cooperative use of their communications 
technologies during Mars missions. In this particular communication sequence, Spirit’s operation 
personnel at NASA’s JPL transferred commands for the rover to ESA’s Space Operations Centre 
in Germany, which then transmitted the instructions to the Mars Express. The Express 
successfully commanded Spirit and, subsequently, relayed telemetry information from the rover 
to JPL via the Space Operations Centre.594 
 
NASA and the ISS partners announced crew assignments for the next two expeditions to the 
space station. NASA astronaut E. Michael Fincke and Russian cosmonaut Gennady I. Padalka 
would serve on Expedition 9, and NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao and Russian cosmonaut Salizhan 
S. Sharipov would provide the crew for Expedition 10. In addition, Chiao and Sharipov would 
serve as the backup crew for Expedition 9, while NASA astronaut William S. McArthur Jr. and 
Russian cosmonaut Valery I. Tokarev would serve as the backup crew for Expedition 10. 
Although NASA and its partners had previously scheduled Tokarev to pair with Chaio on 
Expedition 10, the ISS partners had decided to replace Tokarev with Sharipov, because Sharipov 
had previously trained with Chiao.595 
 
Jerome F. Lederer, NASA’s first Director of Manned Space Flight Safety, died at the age of 101. 
Lederer, an aviation-safety expert, had introduced notable aviation-safety technologies, such as 
blinking anticollision lights and flight-data recorders. Lederer had started his career in aviation 
safety in 1926 as an aeronautical engineer for the U.S. Air Mail Service, where he had 
redesigned the service’s airplanes to prevent them from igniting after crashes, a frequent cause of 
death of the pilots. In the 1950s, he had helped establish the agency that later became the FAA. 
In 1967, after a fire on Apollo 1 had killed three astronauts during a launchpad test, NASA had 
asked Lederer to establish an Office of Manned Space Flight Safety. In 1970 NASA had 
appointed Lederer as the safety director for all NASA activities. Lederer had retired two years 
later. Later, Lederer had taught at the University of Southern California and had served two 
three-year terms on the Advisory Council for the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.596

Inspector-General René Bonnefoy would oversee the inquiry, which would investigate the 
reasons for the mission’s failure and establish lessons that ESA could apply in future missions. 
Beagle 2, a component of ESA’s Mars Express mission, had failed to communicate with ESA 
after the time of its scheduled landing on Mars on 25 December 2003. The Beagle 2 
Management Board had declared the spacecraft lost on 6 February 2004.597 
 
12 February 
ESA’s Science Programme Committee approved a proposal to extend the operation of the 
Ulysses spacecraft―a joint project of ESA and NASA―until March 2008. NASA had already 
approved continuing the spacecraft’s operations. The two space agencies had designed the 
spacecraft to study the heliosphere, a region of space influenced by the Sun and its magnetic 
field. Scientists of the agencies hoped that the continued operations of Ulysses would help them 
better understand the Sun. Since the 1990 launch of Ulysses, ESA and NASA both had launched 
additional fleet of solar and heliospheric spacecraft: NASA’s Cassini, ESA’s four Cluster 
satellites, and another collaborative project between ESA and NASA, the Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory (SOHO).598 
 
16 February 
An international team of astronomers discovered a galaxy cluster that could be the most distant 
known galaxy in the universe. The team, led by Jean-Paul Kneib of California Institute of 
Technology, had used the W. M. Keck Telescopes in Hawaii and the HST to observe a galaxy 
known as Abell 2218. The astronomers believed that the Abell 2218 galaxy, which they 
estimated at 13 billion light-years from Earth, could be the most distant known galaxy, but 
precise measurements of its distance were particularly difficult, because the galaxy is so far from 
Earth that its visible light stretches into infrared wavelengths. Moreover, the scientists suggested 
that the galaxy might be a young stellar system formed at the initial stages of the universe’s 
inception. Further observation of Abell 2218 and other distant galaxies could yield important 
clues about the universe’s formation.599 
 
18 February 
NASA and ESA jointly announced that scientists had obtained evidence of a black hole 
consuming a star, an event known as stellar tidal disruption. Previously, scientists had only 
theorized the existence of such an event. Using observations from NASA’s Chandra X-ray 
Observatory and ESA’s XMM-Newton orbiting observatory, an international team of scientists 
had discovered a star that had been thrown from its orbit after a close encounter with another star 
and, subsequently, had moved into the gravitational field of a black hole. The black hole, with a 
mass estimated at 100 million times greater than the Sun, had exerted a gravitational pull on the

19 February 
NASA’s Space Flight Leadership Council (SFLC), which was overseeing NASA’s efforts to 
resume Shuttle flights, announced that NASA would not launch another Space Shuttle before 
March 2005. NASA had delayed a Shuttle launch because of a new requirement that launches 
occur during daylight hours, to enable photographing the liftoff from multiple angles. Because of 
the limited number of days available in which a launch could take place in daylight, the next 
Shuttle launch could occur no earlier than March 2005. In addition, NASA announced that, when 
Shuttle launches recommenced, one Shuttle would function as a standby rescue vehicle in case 
the Shuttle carrying the crew sustained damage during flight. NASA announced that, although 
rescue vehicles would not necessarily be positioned on the launchpad, they would be ready for 
launch within 45 to 90 days, the maximum length of time that seven astronauts could survive on 
the ISS before their supplies ran out.601 
 
20 February 
NASA announced its findings concerning how and why a piece of insulation had separated from 
a fuel tank on Space Shuttle Columbia, an event that had later contributed to Columbia’s 
destruction upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. According to NASA official William F. 
Readdy, NASA had determined that extremely cold fuel had liquefied air or nitrogen, which 
subsequently had seeped into a portion of the foam or had collected on nuts and bolts below the 
foam, eventually expanding and explosively jettisoning a piece of the foam. The foam had shot 
from the fuel tank, hitting the orbiter and creating a large―and ultimately fatal―gash in its left 
wing. Before the Columbia tragedy, engineers had believed that when the fuel tanks shed foam, 
it fell away from the body of the orbiter. Readdy stated that NASA had redesigned the fuel tanks 
and improved techniques for applying the foam to remedy the problem that had caused the 
accident to Columbia.602 
 
26 February 
ISS crew members Alexander Y. Kaleri and C. Michael Foale conducted a spacewalk, leaving 
the station vacant. The spacewalk marked the first time that the ISS crew had left the station 
without another crew member remaining on board to assist in case of emergency. The purpose of 
the spacewalk was to service experiments located on the station’s exterior and to prepare the 
orbiting structure for future assembly work. The astronauts were unable to complete all of the 
planned tasks, however, because a problem with Kaleri’s spacesuit prompted Russian flight 
controllers to end the spacewalk early.603

In an internal review, NASA concluded that the ISS program suffered from many of the same 
problems as the Space Shuttle program and that the ISS partners needed to make improvements 
in the station’s management. NASA had drafted the 172-page report to apply lessons learned 
from the Columbia disaster to NASA’s other programs. The report identified seven areas of 
concern, such as inconsistencies in monitoring the ISS’s hardware, lack of training for personnel 
administering equipment problems, and an incomplete set of blueprints for hardware. In their 
response to the report, NASA managers stated that the ISS program had no major problems and 
that NASA was already pursuing measures to improve the station’s operations. For example, 
NASA had worked to minimize the sources of debris that could hit the ISS. In addition, NASA 
had expanded an existing agreement with U.S. intelligence agencies to use intelligence satellites 
to examine the ISS for damages. Managers also noted that they planned to install additional 
cameras to the station’s exterior and that, during future spacewalks, astronauts would photograph 
the ISS more extensively.604 
 
29 February 
A team of researchers led by scientist Marc L. Imhoff of NASA’s GSFC published research 
indicating that increasing urbanization in the United States had reduced the amount of fertile land 
available for agriculture. Using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) 
and NOAA’s polar-orbiting satellites, the scientists had discovered that cities covered 3 percent 
of the land area in the continental United States. Moreover, the team found that the urbanized 
areas were capable of producing an amount of food and fiber rivaling that produced on 
agricultural lands, which covered 29 percent of the land area in the continental United States. 
Furthermore, they found that the urbanized land areas had the potential to produce enough food 
to meet the caloric requirements of 16.5 million people, nearly 6 percent of the U.S. population. 
The authors explained that, throughout history, human settlement has tended to occur on lands 
best suited for growing food. The research results, which were consistent with this trend, 
strongly suggested that urbanization should occur in conjunction with agricultural and 
environmental considerations.605

Researchers announced that they had found a new type of celestial object, which they suspected 
was a new class of black holes. A group of scientists led by Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics had examined data collected by NASA’s Chandra X-ray 
Observatory. The team had studied x-rays emitted by enigmatic objects located in nearby 
galaxies, finding that the volume of x-rays emanating from these objects was comparable to or 
greater than the volume emitted by relatively warmer, larger hard x-ray sources, such as neutron

stars and supermassive black holes. The findings indicated that the newly discovered objects 
could be a type of black hole that the researchers termed “quasi-soft” x-ray sources.606 
 
2 March 
ESA launched the Rosetta comet probe on an Ariane 5 rocket at 7:17 a.m. (UT) from the Guiana 
Space Centre in French Guiana. ESA had created Rosettathe first spacecraft designed to enter 
a comet’s nucleus and to place a probe on a comet’s surfaceto study the comet 
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta, equipped with solar arrays spanning 105 feet (32 
meters) and relying on solar cells for its power supply, was also the first probe designed to travel 
past Mars. Scientists hoped that, in studying comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenkoa remnant of 
a primitive nebula from which Earth’s solar system emergedRosetta would help them 
understand more about the role of comets in forming the solar system and contributing to the 
development of life on Earth.607 
 
3 March 
Former astronaut Robert D. Cabana became Deputy Director of NASA’s JSC, replacing Brock 
R. Stone, who had retired after a 36-year career with NASA. Cabana had previously served on 
four Space Shuttle missions and in many management positions supporting the Astronaut Office 
and the ISS Program. Before becoming Deputy Director of JSC, Cabana had served as Director 
of Flight Crew Operations. NASA had appointed former astronaut Kenneth D. Bowersox to fill 
that position.608 
 
5 March 
NASA reported that its Mars Exploration Rovers had discovered geological evidence indicating 
that Mars had once had water. The rover Spirit had found a volcanic rock containing fissures 
filled with material that could have crystallized from water. A few days earlier, on 2 March 
2004, the rover Opportunity, operating nearly 6,600 miles (10,622 kilometers) from Spirit, had 
found minerals and geological features that appeared to have been leached by groundwater or to 
have been formed by sediment in what was previously a body of water. However, scientists were 
unable to conclude from the two rovers’ findings when Mars had actually had water in the past 
or whether the water had been located above or below the planet’s surface.609 
 
The airline company Virgin Atlantic conducted the first successful test flight of its Globalflyer 
airplane. The company had designed the Globalflyer to conduct a flight around the world in 3.3 
days without refueling, which, if achieved, would create a world’s record for the length of an 
unrefueled flight. During a test flight lasting 1½ hours, the Globalflyer aircraftalso known as 
the Model 311 Capricornexhibited no significant mechanical problems. However, the 
experimental aircraft had required several modifications, such as the development of a cabin-

A group of astronomers announced the most detailed telescopic view ever taken of the visible 
universe. NASA’s HST had captured a 1 million-second-long exposure of a small portion of dark 
sky, with a resulting image containing an estimated 10,000 galaxies, some so far away that 
astronomers had never before seen them. Astronomers called the image the Hubble Ultra Deep 
Field. They believed that the Hubble Ultra Deep Field might have revealed light from galaxies 
created near the time of the Big Bang and hoped that the image would provide information about 
the creation of the universe.611 
 
13 March 
Japan’s Mobile Broadcast Corporation and South Korea’s Sun Kyung Telecom launched the 
Loral Mobile Broadcasting Satellite (MBSAT), which the two companies had designed to 
provide the world’s first digital multimedia broadband broadcasting system. The MBSAT, 
launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas 3 rocket, carried a 40-foot-diameter (12.2-meter-diameter) 
antenna designed to provide audio, video, and data services to users of portable audio and visual 
devices in Japan and South Korea. International Launch Services (ILS), a U.S.-Russian private 
company, provided the launch services for the Japanese-South Korean joint venture.612

William H. Pickering, a former Director of NASA’s JPL, died at the age of 93. Pickering had 
begun his career at JPL in 1944 and had served as Director from 1954 to 1976. Soon after 
becoming Director of JPL, Pickering had led a project that had successfully launched the first 
U.S. satellite Explorer 1 into Earth orbit on 31 January 1958. During the remainder of 
Pickering’s tenure, JPL had launched the Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon and the 
Mariner missions to Mars and Venus. Pickering had received numerous awards during his 
lifetime: NASA had presented him with its Distinguished Service Medal, President Gerald R. 
Ford had awarded him the National Medal of Science, and the Queen of England had given him 
an honorary knighthood.613 
 
NASA-funded researchers announced that they had found the most distant object orbiting the 
Sun yet discovered. Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology had led a team 
of scientists to discover a small body of rock and ice located 8 billion miles (13 billion 
kilometers) from Earth. They had named the object Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the ocean. 
Sedna was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto’s discovery in 1930. However, 
astronomers reported that they could not designate Sedna as a planet because, like Pluto, Sedna

is too smallwith an estimated diameter of 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers)and possesses an 
irregular orbit. The scientists stated that the discovery might also have been the first observation 
of a region called the Oort Cloud, which is located outside of Pluto’s orbit. Astronomers had 
long hypothesized the existence of this region of small frozen objects, the source of comets that 
enter Earth’s solar system. The team had discovered Sedna using the Samuel Oschin Telescope 
at the California Institute of Technology’s Palomar Observatory.614 
 
A NASA-funded study found that some climate-forecasting models might have incorrectly 
estimated future increases in Earth’s temperatures. Scientists Kenneth R. Minschwaner of the 
New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and Andrew E. Dessler of the University of 
Maryland had determined that some climate models might have incorrectly estimated the amount 
of water vapor that enters Earth’s atmosphere as the planet warms. For years, scientists had 
debated the extent to which water vaporthe most important heat-trapping greenhouse gas in 
Earth’s atmosphereinfluences Earth’s surface temperatures. Using data from NASA’s Upper 
Atmosphere Research Satellite, the scientists had found that, although the amount of water vapor 
in the atmosphere had increased with surface warming, the increase had not been as high as 
previous researchers had assumed. The findings also cast doubt on research suggesting that 
Earth’s temperatures would decrease because of a lack of water vapor in the atmosphere.615

At a hearing held by the U.S. House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Space and 
Aeronautics, officials from NASA and the Pentagon stated that they expect to work together on 
President Bush’s exploration strategy for Mars and the Moon, without altering the traditional 
divisions between the two organizations. According to officials, NASA and the Pentagon would 
cooperate on technical issues of concern to both agencies, including the development of 
lightweight fabrication systems and systems for unpiloted docking of spacecraft. The two 
agencies would also explore sharing launch systems, including NASA’s possible use of the Atlas 
5 and Delta 4 rockets, which the Pentagon had developed to launch its own satellites. According 
to major media, House subcommittee members were interested in the possibility of saving 
money through the collaboration between NASA and the Pentagon, but they were also concerned 
about the possibility of the two agencies repeating their previous collaborative failures. As an 
example of such a failed collaboration, they cited the Advanced Launch System project, a 
collaborative project between the two agencies during the 1980s and 1990s.616 
 
A team of European scientists released research that solved a long-standing puzzle concerning 
the sources of gamma rays in the center of the Milky Way. Scientists already knew that the 
Milky Way produces a substantial quantity of gamma rays, which illuminate the galaxy. 
However, they were uncertain about whether the galaxy’s gamma rays originate predominantly 
from so-called point sources, such as black holes and neutron stars, or from diffuse sources, such 
as gas atoms, which are abundant in the Milky Way. Using data from ESA’s 
INTEGRALInternational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratoryresearchers led by François

Russian President Vladimir V. Putin appointed Anatoly N. Perminov as Director of the Russian 
Space Agency. Perminov, a professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute, had previously served as 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Space Force. He replaced previous Russian Space Agency 
Director Yuri N. Koptev, who Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin had appointed in 1992.618

NASA’s X-43A Hyper X plane set a new record for flight speed, traveling at Mach 7, which is 
nearly 5,000 miles (8,050 kilometers) per hour and seven times the speed of sound. The flight 
was also the first free flight of an aircraft powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet enginea 
scramjeta type of engine that provides thrust by funneling air and fuel into a hollow chamber 
at extremely high speed. The 12-foot-long (3.7-meter-long) unpiloted, experimental aircraft flew 
for approximately 11 seconds over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude of 95,000 feet 
(approximately 29,000 meters), before NASA deliberately landed the aircraft in the ocean. 
NASA used a modified B-52 aircraft to carry the X-43A into the sky, launching the X-43A into 
flight using a Pegasus rocket mounted to the B-52. The test flight, which took place near San 
Nicolas Island off the California coast, originated from NASA’s DFRC at Edwards Air Force 
Base in California.619

The FAA released an analysis of the economic impact of the commercial space-transportation 
industry on the United States’ economy. The report examined how industriessuch as launch-
vehicle manufacturing, satellite services, and remote sensingaffect economic activity, 
employee earnings, and the amount of employment in all major industry sectors. Based on data 
from 2002, the FAA had found that the commercial space-transportation industry had 
contributed US$95 billion to economic activity in the United States, including US$23.5 billion in 
employee earnings. The report also stated that demands for commercial space transportation and 
its products and services had resulted in the employment of nearly 600,000 people. In addition, 
the FAA had found that much of this economic impact was the result of increased demands for 
satellite services and ground-equipment manufacturing, which includes satellite-related hardware 
and consumer electronics used with satellite services.620

1 April 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee 
on Science, Technology and Space concerning NASA’s budget request for FY 2005. NASA had 
requested US$16.2 billion for FY 2005, an increase of 5.6 percent over its budget for FY 2004. 
Much of O’Keefe’s testimony and the Senate subcommittee members’ questions were concerned 
with the likelihood of NASA’s achieving the objectives that President George W. Bush had 
established for NASA in his Vision for Space Exploration, announced in January 2004. Those 
objectives included human flights to the Moon and replacing the Space Shuttles with a new 
space-exploration vehicle.621 
 
2 April 
The GAO released an analysis of NASA’s budgetary outlays for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. 
Under Pub. L. No. 106-391, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization 
Act of 2000, GAO was required to verify NASA’s accounting of its funds obligated against 
established budgetary limits for the ISS and for Space Shuttle support for the ISS. Under the Act, 
NASA’s obligations were limited to US$25 billion for the ISS and US$17.7 billion for Shuttle 
support. GAO’s report noted that NASA had not provided sufficient documentation for the 
amounts it had reported as obligated against budgetary limits. Thus, GAO could not verify the 
amounts that NASA had reported to Congress in its budget requests for fiscal years 2002 through 
2004. Similarly, NASA had not reported any documentation of its FY 2004 budget obligations in 
its FY 2005 budget request to Congress. NASA officials acknowledged that NASA’s accounting 
system presented some difficulties for GAO’s auditors, but explained that those difficulties were 
the result of NASA’s having reported budgetary figures based on the amount it was authorized to 
spend rather than on the amount it was obligated to spend.622 
 
5 April 
A commission composed of officials from ESA and the British National Space Centre released 
the results of their investigation into the loss of the Beagle 2 spacecraft, the first European 
spacecraft designed to explore the surface of Mars. On 19 December 2003, the Beagle 2 had 
successfully separated from ESA’s Mars Express, the spacecraft that had carried the Beagle 2 to 
its orbit of Mars. However, subsequently, Beagle 2 had failed to send any signals to mission 
engineers, and its eventual fate remained unknown. Although its report did not identify any 
single technical issue that had caused the mission loss, the investigating panel did provide 19 
recommendations for future missions. These recommendations, implicitly critical of the Beagle 2 
mission, suggested that future missions should have adequate funding and adequate testing, and 
that an agency with appropriate capabilities and resources should manage the missions.623

NASA approved a five-month extension of the Mars Exploration Rovers’ mission nearly two 
weeks before its originally scheduled end on 26 April 2004. NASA had originally planned for 
the mission to last three months but had decided to extend it because the robotic 
rovers―Opportunity and Spirit―had satisfied all of their primary mission criteria, achieving 
several successes, such as discovering evidence that Mars had once had water. According to 
officials, NASA planned to provide US$15 million to continue the rovers’ operations, doubling 
the mission’s duration at less than 2 percent of the overall mission’s cost.624 
 
15 April 
In a newly released survey, U.S. federal government employees ranked NASA as the best place 
to work in the federal government. The Office of Personnel Management had collected the data 
during a 2002 survey of federal employees, and the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service 
and American University’s Institute for the Study of Public Policy Implementation had produced 
the rankings. According to the survey, in eight out of 10 categories related to employment 
satisfaction, federal employees had ranked NASA first―federal employees had ranked NASA as 
the best place to work for women, for racial minorities, and for individuals under 40 years of 
age.625 
 
Astronomers announced the first successful use of a new technique to discover a planet outside 
of the solar system. Astronomer Ian Bond of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and his 
team of researchers had used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify a star located 
17,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. The gravitational lensing technique 
entailed the observation of increases in the brightness of the light of distant stars, caused by the 
gravitational fields of stars closer to Earth. The astronomers made these observations when a star 
nearer Earth passed before the lens of a telescope on Earth, between the telescope and a more 
distant star. When this occurred, the nearer star’s gravity caused the light of the more distant 
star’s light to become brighter, so that the distant star became more visible to astronomers on 
Earth.626 
 
Sirpa Häkkinen of NASA’s GSFC announced that a research team had discovered changes in the 
North Atlantic Ocean indicating significant changes in the ocean’s climate. Using data from 
several NASA and European satellites, the researchers had found a dramatic weakening in a 
particular current in the ocean, which circulates water between Ireland and Canada. The change 
in the current indicated substantial climate variability in high-latitude areas, but the research 
remained uncertain of whether or not the change related to global warming. However, the 
scientists emphasized that the North Atlantic Ocean region is key for analyzing climate and that 
changes in the ocean’s current could influence the circulation of the entire Atlantic Ocean 
system.627

The Expedition 9 crew of the ISS launched at 11:19 p.m. (EDT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in 
Kazakhstan on the Russian Soyuz TMA-4/ISS-8S. The crew members consisted of Russian 
cosmonaut, Expedition 9 Commander Gennady I. Padalka; NASA astronaut E. Michael Fincke; 
and ESA astronaut André Kuipers of the Netherlands. Padalka and Fincke would remain at the 
ISS for nearly six months, while Kuipers would spend nine days on the ISS, returning to Earth 
with the crew members of Expedition 8―NASA astronaut C. Michael Foale and Russian

20 April 
NASA launched its Gravity Probe B (GP-B) on a Boeing Delta 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air 
Force Base in California at 12:57 p.m. (EDT). NASA had designed the satellite to test two 
fundamental aspects of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. According to Einstein’s theory, 
time and space create a veritable fabric in space. When massive objects, such as Earth and other 
planets, distort the fabric of space, causing relatively smaller objects to move towards them, they 
create gravity. Einstein’s theory of relativity also states that large objects twist the fabric of space 
around them as those objects spin on their axes. Gravity Probe A, which NASA had launched in 
1975, had tested the former part of the theory, and GP-B would test both aspects. GP-B 
contained some of the most accurate scientific instruments ever constructed, including the most 
precise gyroscopes ever built.629 
 
Scientist Menglin Jin of NASA’s GSFC published research based on the first use of satellites to 
create a multiyear record of Earth’s land-surface temperatures. Jin had used remote-sensing data, 
which satellites had collected from 1981 to 1998, to develop an 18-year record of global land-
surface temperatures more comprehensive and detailed than data derived from ground-station 
measurements. According to the satellite data, average global land-surface temperatures had 
increased by 0.43˚C (0.77˚F) per decade, whereas ground-station data had indicated an increase 
of 0.34˚C (0.61˚F). The different findings produced different measurements because satellites 
measure actual land-surface temperatures―also known as skin temperatures―and ground 
stations measure air temperatures 6.6 feet (2 meters) above land surfaces. However, Jin also 
noted regional variations in temperature changes, with the central regions of North America and 
Asia experiencing some declines in temperatures.630

22 April 
NASA researchers discovered a previously unknown property of Arctic sea ice, challenging 
conventional models of climate change that had incorporated data on Arctic sea ice. A group of 
scientists led by Ronald Kwok of NASA’s JPL had used satellite data from Canada’s 
RADARSAT and NASA’s ICESat to examine changes in Arctic sea ice. In the past, scientists 
had tended to examine data from ocean buoys to determine changes in Arctic sea ice, rather than 
using satellite data. The NASA researchers had discovered that, during 12-hour intervals, Arctic 
sea ice makes subtle, back-and-forth motions, which result in approximately 20 percent of ice 
growth during the Arctic winter. Although conventional models of the dynamics of Arctic sea ice 
had incorporated data regarding the ice’s motion, those models had not incorporated ice motion 
occurring during such brief periods and, thus, may have inaccurately simulated large-scale 
changes in the ice and underestimated the production of Arctic sea ice.632

Researchers announced that they had found the remains of a large object that crashed into Earth 
250 million years ago, possibly causing the largest mass extinction in history. Previously, many 
scientists had agreed that a large-scale eventthe Permian-Triassic extinctionhad occurred 
approximately 250 million years ago. However, they had debated about whether volcanic activity 
or the impact of an extraterrestrial object such as a meteor had caused the event. A team of 
scientists led by Luann Becker of University of California at Santa Barbara reported the 
discovery of strong evidence for the impact theorypart of a meteorite or comet, nearly 6 miles 
(10 kilometers) in diameter, buried in sediment off the coast of Australia. Based on analysis of 
the object’s age and mineral composition, the team believed that the object might have caused 
the Permian-Triassic extinctionthe extinction of 90 percent of marine species and 70 percent 
of land species. NASA and the National Science Foundation had funded the scientists, who 
cautioned that their findings did not prove definitively that extraterrestrial impact had caused the 
extinction event.639

A group of astronomers reported new findings concerning two prominent enigmas of 
physicsdark energy and the expansion of the universe. Steve Allen of Cambridge University

clusters of galaxies, located 1 to 8 billion light-years from Eartha span of time covering the 
universe’s initial explosion and subsequent expansion. Previously, many scientists had theorized 
that a force called dark energy might have counteracted gravity, causing the expansion. 
Chandra’s observations of the distances between the galaxy clusters indicated that the universe’s 
expansion had accelerated, and Chandra’s data on the ratio of hot gas to dark matter within the 
galaxy clusters indicated that the density of dark energy had not changed. Both findings were 
contrary to many previous hypotheses. The astronomers stated that, although their findings were 
inconclusive, the data suggested that the constant density of dark energy causes the universe to

NASA’s Chief Financial Officer Gwendolyn Sykes Brown and officials from the GAO provided 
testimony on NASA’s accounting system to the U.S. House Government Reform Subcommittee 
on Government Efficiency and Financial Management. According to GAO, NASA had not 
acknowledged the nature and extent of its financial management problems, such as its inadequate 
documentation of financial statements. Brown responded, detailing NASA’s efforts to improve 
its financial management system. For example, NASA had acquired new accounting software 
and had adopted a single financial system for all of its centers. Subcommittee members stated 
that they planned to monitor NASA and that they expected NASA to provide periodic reports on 
its progress in correcting its accounting system.642 
 
20 May 
NASA released pieces of the debris from Space Shuttle Columbia to a nongovernmental agency 
for study and testing. The release of the materials was the first implementation of NASA’s new 
policy for the use of materials from a destroyed Space Shuttle. Henceforth, instead of burying 
Space Shuttle materials, as it had done after the Challenger accident, NASA would use materials 
from destroyed Space Shuttles for research. The company that received the partsthe Aerospace 
Corporation of El Segundo, Californiawas one of several organizations that had requested 
NASA’s permission to study Columbia’s debris. Under the terms of the release, the company 
would keep the Shuttle parts for one year, using them to analyze the effect of atmospheric 
reentry on materials.643 
 
27 May 
NASA announced that the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), launched on 25 August 2003, had 
made several new discoveries. The SSTformerly called the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, 
or SIRTFwas the largest infrared telescope ever launched. Among the SST’s specific findings 
was the discovery of nearly 300 new stars in RCW 49, a region in the constellation Centaurus, 
13,700 light-years from Earth. In addition, the SST had revealed high quantities of icy organic 
materials in planets forming around young stars in the constellation Taurus, located 420 light-
years from Earth. The presence of organic materials in the newly forming planets could explain 
the origins of similarly icy bodies, such as comets. Scientists theorized that comets might have 
provided the water and other organic materials that enabled life to form on Earth.644

A group of scientists led by Enric Pallé of the New Jersey Institute of Technology published 
research indicating that, since 1999, the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface had 
declined. Analyzing NASA’s data on cloud cover, along with data from Earth-based telescopes, 
the team had calculated how much sunlight Earth reflected to the Moon, using the results to 
determine the amount of sunlight that reached Earth. They reported that the amount of sunlight 
reaching Earth’s surface had begun to increase in the mid-1980s, but had started to decline in the 
early 1990s, a trend that the team attributed to the increasing pollution of Earth’s air. The air 
pollution had reduced the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface and had increased the 
amount of water droplets condensing in the atmosphere, thereby increasing the amount of cloud 
cover blocking sunlight.645

The Director of NASA’s LaRC Roy D. Bridges Jr. appointed Lesa B. Roe as LaRC’s Deputy 
Director. At the time of the appointment, Roe was LaRC’s Associate Director for Business 
Management, a position she had held since August 2003. Roe had begun her career with NASA 
in 1987 as a radio-frequency communications engineer at KSC, later working in KSC’s Payload 
Processing Directorate and in the ISS Hardware Integration Office.646

Kevin L. Petersen, Director of NASA’s DFRC, appointed Steven G. Schmidt as DFRC’s Deputy 
Director. Schmidt had served as Special Assistant to NASA’s Administrator since January 2002. 
In addition, Schmidt had previously worked in numerous programs at DFRC, such as the X-33, 
X-43A, and the F-15 programs. Schmidt, who had begun working for NASA in 1994, had also 
served as Executive Director of the President’s Space Commission and as Executive Secretary 
for Management on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.647

Passing by Saturn’s furthest moon Phoebe, the Cassini spacecraft returned analyses of the moon 
indicating that Phoebe’s chemical composition is similar to the composition of comets, a finding 
that supported previous scientific theories about the enigmatic Phoebe. Because Phoebe has an 
unusually dark appearance and orbits Saturn in a direction opposite that of the planet’s other 
moons, scientists had theorized that the moon is a captive object of Saturn. Cassini’s analyses of 
Phoebe indicated that the diminutive moon’s surface is composed of carbon dioxide, water ice, 
water-bearing minerals, and various organic chemicals. The results indicated possible chemical 
similarities between Phoebe’s composite materials and materials observed in comets. The 
Cassini spacecraft was one of two in the Cassini-Huygens mission, a joint project of ESA, the 
Italian Space Agency, and NASA. Besides Cassini―an orbiter designed to orbit Saturn, studying

A commission created by President George W. Bush released its report outlining how NASA and 
other organizations might implement President Bush’s new policy: the U.S. Vision for Space 
Exploration. The President’s Commission, led by Edward C. Aldridge Jr., endorsed the Vision 
for Space Exploration’s goals―to explore Mars and the Moon. In addition, the commission 
recommended that, to meet those goals, NASA needed to make numerous changes; the federal 
government needed to establish a permanent council to develop and coordinate space exploration 
policies; and the private sector needed to become more involved in space operations. Specific 
changes that the commission recommended were that NASA should focus on the research and 
development of space technology, and that private industry should conduct operational activities, 
such as launching payloads to low Earth orbit. The report also recommended that NASA pursue 
partnerships with the scientific community and with foreign space agencies.649 
 
17 June 
The U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Science, Technology, 
and Space concluded a hearing on the final report of the President’s Commission on 
Implementation of the U.S. Space Exploration Policy. The report, which the commission had 
released the previous day, addressed ways in which the federal government and private 
companies could implement the Vision for Space Exploration. Individuals testifying before the 
committee included Edward C. Aldridge Jr., who had led the President’s Commission; Paul D. 
Spudis of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; Maria T. Zuber of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Earth Atmospherics and Planetary 
Sciences; Laurie A. Leshin of Arizona State University; and retired U.S. Air Force General

Scientists published research on comet Wild 2, revealing unexpected discoveries about comets. 
The researchers had based their findings on data that NASA’s Stardust spacecraft had acquired 
during a flyby of Wild 2 on 2 January 2004―data that included the highest-resolution images 
ever taken of a comet. The scientists had discovered that the comet’s surface is not simply icy 
and dirty; rather the comet has a diverse landscape, including peaks, cliffs, and craters, and 
isolated, volatile jets, violently spewing particles. Although scientists did not yet know whether

The company Scaled Composites launched the first privately developed piloted vehicle to travel 
beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The vehicle, called SpaceShipOne, departed from Mojave Airport in 
California at 6:45 a.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST), attached to another aircraft. Upon reaching 
an altitude of 46,000 feet (8.7 miles or 14 kilometers), the aircraft released SpaceShipOne. 
Propelled by a fuel containing rubber and nitrous oxide―laughing gas―SpaceShipOne 
eventually attained an altitude of 328,491 feet (62 miles or 100 kilometers), achieving suborbital 
spaceflight. After SpaceShipOne had remained in suborbital flight for nearly 3½ minutes, the 
vehicle’s pilot Michael W. Melvill―who became the first civilian astronaut with this 
flight―safely landed the craft at Mojave Airport. Burt Rutan, the founder of Scaled Composites, 
had designed SpaceShipOne, and Microsoft cofounder Paul G. Allen had financed the project.652 
 
24 June 
NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced that, effective 1 August 2004, NASA would 
restructure its organization to render it better able to implement President George W. Bush’s 
Vision for Space Exploration. Among many other announced changes, NASA planned to 
restructure its Earth Science, Space Science, and other Strategic Enterprises into four Mission 
Directorates―Aeronautics Research, Exploration Systems, Science, and Space 
Operations―with clearer organizational roles and responsibilities. In addition, to improve 
communication and clarify responsibilities, functional offices of NASA Headquarters and its 
field offices―including the office of the Chief Financial Officer―would become mission 
support offices.653 
 
26 June 
The European Union (EU) and the United States signed a cooperative agreement on their satellite 
navigation services―the EU’s planned Galileo system and the United States’ GPS. According to 
the agreement, the Galileo and GPS satellites would broadcast a common civil signal. They also 
agreed not to discriminate in commercial trade of satellite-navigation goods and services. In 
addition, the agreement stipulated that Galileo signals would not interfere with the efforts of the 
United States to prevent its adversaries’ accessing satellite-based positioning signals. European 
Commission Vice President Loyola de Palacio, Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen, and U.S. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell signed the agreement in Dublin, Ireland.654

Cassini-Huygens became the first spacecraft to successfully navigate Saturn’s rings and to orbit 
the planet. A joint project of ESA, the Italian Space Agency, and NASA, the mission comprised 
two spacecraft: the orbiter Cassini and the probe Huygens. The space agencies had planned for 
Cassini to conduct 76 orbits of Saturn during a four-year survey of the planet and its moons. 
They had designed the Huygens probe to analyze the atmosphere of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. 
If the probe survived its descent to Titan, it would analyze the moon’s surface, as well.655 
 
American astronaut E. Michael Fincke and Russian cosmonaut Gennady I. Padalka successfully 
completed repairs to the ISS during a much-delayed spacewalk lasting 6 hours. Among the 
numerous repairs that Fincke and Padalka completed were the replacement of a faulty circuit 
breaker and the restoration of power to a gyroscope that helped stabilize the ISS. The ISS 
partners had rescheduled the spacewalk from 24 June 2004 because of problems with the crew 
members’ spacesuits.656

2 July 
Scientists reported that they had produced the first three-dimensional views of the large solar 
eruptions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs, the most powerful eruptions in the 
solar system, can disrupt power systems, radio communications, and satellite links with Earth. 
Although uncertain of the origin of these eruptions, scientists know that CMEs occur when 
billions of tons of electrified gas explode from the Sun’s atmosphere into space at speeds of 
millions of miles per hour. The team had used data from ESA and from NASA’s Solar and 
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to construct the images, which they hoped would help 
scientists learn more about the structure of CMEs and the manner in which they affect Earth.657 
 
9 July 
Major media reported details of a NASA internal document, which stated that a proposed plan to 
use the ISS as a safe haven for Space Shuttle astronauts would likely have a high risk of failure. 
The NASA document was a response to a proposal that the ISS should temporarily house the 
Shuttle crew if a problem arose that prevented an orbiting Shuttle from returning its crew to 
Earth safely. In the internal document, NASA objected that the ISS had neither sufficient 
supplies nor support systems to keep both ISS and Shuttle crew members alive longer than a few 
months. NASA officials responded to the publication of the document, stating that the 
provisional contingency plan had been one of many ideas considered for improving Space 
Shuttle safety.658

The FAA announced that, on 17 June 2004, it had issued a license for the United States’ first 
inland launch site. The five-year license authorized California’s East Kern Airport District, 
which included the Mojave Airport, to operate as a launch site for suborbital reusable launch 
vehicle (RLV) missions. On 21 June 2004, SpaceShipOne had staged the first commercial launch 
to outer space from Mojave Airport. The license made the Mojave Airport the fifth commercial 
spaceport licensed by the FAA. The other four licensed spaceports were the California Spaceport 
at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Spaceport Florida at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the 
Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska, and the Virginia Spaceport at Wallops Flight Facility 
(WFF).659 
 
13 July 
The National Research Council (NRC) issued a report calling for NASA to send a Space Shuttle 
mission to service the HST. The report challenged Administrator Sean O’Keefe’s earlier decision 
that NASA would not conduct a Shuttle servicing mission for the HST because of potential 
safety risks. According to the NRC report, if NASA did not service the orbiting telescope, it 
would eventually become dysfunctional and fall out of orbit. Although the report acknowledged 
that a Shuttle mission would pose some risks for astronauts, the NRC stated that the scientific 
value of continuing HST operations merited a mission, both to maintain the orbiting telescope 
and to upgrade its components. The report recommended that NASA should consider sending a 
robotic servicing mission for the HST instead of a Shuttle mission, but should not rule out 
sending a Shuttle servicing mission, if NASA determined that the robotic option was too costly 
or complex.660 
 
15 July 
NASA launched an Earth-observation satellite called Aura from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
California at 3:01 a.m. (PDT). The spacecraft was one of three satellites in NASA’s Earth 
Observing System (EOS)―the two others were Terra, which monitored land, and Aqua, which 
monitored the planet’s water cycle. NASA had created Aura to collect scientific data on global 
air quality, ozone recovery, and climate change, equipping the satellite with four instruments: the 
High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder, the Microwave Limb Sounder, the Ozone Monitoring 
Instrument, and the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer. Project engineers hoped that the 
instruments would enable the spacecraft to collect the most detailed measurements to date of 
atmospheric pollution, climate change, and the ozone layer.661

An independent panel of experts released an interim assessment of NASA’s progress 
implementing recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). The 
U.S. Congress had chartered the group―formally called the Stafford-Covey Return to Flight 
Task Group (SCTG)―to provide independent evaluations of NASA’s progress in meeting the 
CAIB’s recommendations. The CAIB had enumerated safety and operational practices that 
NASA must implement before resuming Space Shuttle flights. In its interim assessment, the 
Task Group stated that NASA had successfully implemented two of the CAIB’s 
recommendations: to define foreign-object debris and to create computer-accessible digital 
images of Shuttle hardware, taken at various stages of development and launch preparation. The 
Task Group would assess NASA’s progress toward satisfying the other CAIB recommendations 
in future reports.663

Representatives of the space agencies of Canada, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United 
States―the nations participating in the ISS project―met to discuss their cooperative activities 
for the station. At the meeting at ESA’s Technical Centre in the Netherlands, ESA officials 
reviewed ISS operations and plans, unanimously endorsing a new technical configuration for the 
space station that would incorporate components from each of the ISS partner space agencies. 
Upon completion, the ISS would have improved research capabilities and would accommodate 
more crew members than the current maximum of three.664

fitting―connects a Shuttle’s external fuel tanks to the orbiter during launch. The newly designed 
bipod fitting eliminated the use of foam covering in favor of four rod-shaped heaters, reducing 
the risk of falling debris during launch. Investigators believed that the Columbia disaster might 
have resulted from the impact of insulating foam, which had fallen from the bipod fitting, 
damaging the orbiter’s left wing. According to NASA, the approval of the redesigned bipod 
fitting was a significant step in its efforts to resume safe Shuttle flights. Engineers would begin 
using the new fitting on the external tanks for the next Space Shuttle mission.666

A NASA-funded study found that artificial surfaces in urban areas often cause temperatures to 
increase, enabling longer growing seasons in cities than in surrounding rural areas. Using data 
from NASA’s Terra satellite, a team of Boston University scientists led by Xiaoyang Zhang 
compared the growing seasons of 70 North American cities with those of adjacent rural areas. 
The scientists discovered that the growing season in urban areas lasted nearly 15 days longer 
than the growing season in rural areas. In addition, the data revealed that urban climates affect 
vegetation located up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) from urban land cover. According to the 
scientists, high concentrations of artificial surfaces in urban areas cause surface temperatures to 
be relatively higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas. In addition, the scientists 
suggested that their findings demonstrated how land use and other human activities affect Earth’s 
environment.667

Mercury―NASA’s Mariner 10 had photographed the planet during flybys in 1974 and 
1975―MESSENGER was the first spacecraft designed to examine Mercury while orbiting the 
planet.669 
 
ISS crew members E. Michael Fincke and Gennady I. Padalka performed a spacewalk to prepare 
the ISS for the arrival of new unpiloted cargo ships, scheduled to launch in late 2005. ESA had 
created the new cargo vessels, formally called Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATVs). Fincke and 
Padalka installed new communications antennas and laser reflectors to facilitate the docking of 
the ATVs at the ISS. During the 4½-hour excursion, the two men also replaced a circuit breaker 
and rotated scientific experiments.670 
 
5 August 
Data from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft revealed a new radiation belt around Saturn. Researchers 
already knew that Saturn had radiation belts―ring-shaped concentrations of ionized 
particles―outside the orbit of the planet’s rings. However, the newly discovered rings were 
inside Saturn’s rings. Previously, scientists had thought that a radiation belt could not exist inside 
the planet’s rings, because they believed that the rings would absorb any ionized particles that 
approached Saturn. The presence of radiation within the orbit of the rings indicated that the 
radiation belt’s particles are able to move through Saturn’s rings.671 
 
7 August 
NASA and NOAA announced that the two agencies would extend the Tropical Rainfall 
Measuring Mission (TRMM) by five months, effectively reversing an earlier decision to 
terminate the weather satellite’s mission. NASA and NOAA also announced that they had 
requested the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the utility of extending the satellite’s 
mission for an additional 18 months. Launched in 1997, the TRMM―designed to measure 
rainfall―was a joint project of NASA and JAXA. NASA and JAXA had originally planned for 
the satellite’s mission to last three years, but meteorologists and climate researchers, who 
continued to find the satellite’s data highly valuable, particularly for analyzing tropical storms, 
had advocated to prolong the mission.672 
 
10 August 
NASA announced that it would commence work on a robotic mission to service the HST, 
reversing its earlier decision to remove the orbiting telescope from service. According to NASA, 
the robotic servicing mission, planned for launch in 2007, would perform maintenance and 
upgrades of the HST, including changing batteries and gyroscopes, repairing malfunctioning 
equipment, and adding new instruments. If successful, the mission would extend the operational 
life of the 15-year-old HST by at least five years.673

The GAO published an assessment of the efforts of the DOD and the military services to develop 
personnel for space-related national security matters and to integrate those personnel into their 
forces. In the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2004 (Pub.L.No. 108-136), the U.S. 
Congress had required the DOD to create a strategy to develop and integrate personnel who were 
capable of operating space-based systems and of developing space-related concepts, doctrine, 
and technology. In addition, Congress had required GAO to assess those efforts. In its report, 
GAO stated that the DOD did not have a plan to implement its strategy for developing and 
integrating space personnel. GAO also found that the military services varied in the extent to 
which they had implemented plans to develop and manage their space personnel. The report 
included recommendations to address these issues.674 
 
16 August 
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft provided data revealing two previously unknown moons orbiting 
Saturn―a new total of 33 identified moons orbiting the planet. The two moons―designated 
S/2004-S1 and S/2004-S2, until receiving their formal names―measured 2 miles (3.2 
kilometers) and 2½ miles (4 kilometers) in diameter. Because of the moons’ diminutive size, 
scientists suspected that they might be fragments from a larger moon.675 
 
26 August 
A consulting firm, which NASA had hired, reported that NASA had made significant 
organizational reforms in its safety procedures and management culture. NASA had hired the 
consulting firm Behavioral Science Technology to assist in its three-year effort to implement the 
CAIB’s recommendations. Reporting on the first anniversary of the CAIB’s report, the 
consulting firm’s chairperson Thomas R. Krause stated that NASA administrators and managers 
had made significant efforts to seek input from lower-ranking employees regarding safety 
enhancements. NASA had made the improvements in response to the CAIB’s specific 
recommendation.676 
 
30 August 
Astronomers announced the discovery of three planets, comparable in size to Earth, orbiting stars 
outside the solar system, a finding they considered an important step in the search for life 
elsewhere in the universe. Although the planets have orbits too close to their stars to enable the 
planets to support life, all have relatively small mass, indicating that planets vary significantly in 
size. This discovery led the astronomers to hope that researchers might eventually discover 
planets as small as Earth. The three planets’ masses ranged from 14 to 20 times greater than that 
of Earth, far smaller than planets that scientists had previously observed orbiting living stars, 
which have been around 50 times the mass of Earth. Three groups of astronomers had made the 
discoveries separately: the teams of R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution, Michael Endl of

Astronomer Fred Lawrence Whipple, a pioneering comet researcher, died at the age of 97. 
Whipple, born on 5 November 1906 in Red Oak, Iowa, had begun his research at Harvard 
University in 1931, studying meteors and Earth’s atmosphere. During his career, Whipple had 
contributed to many significant scientific achievements, including a meteor bumper known as the 
Whipple shield―a device that protects spacecraft from meteor collisions. However, Whipple 
was best known for research defying conventional scientific theories about comets: whereas 
many scientists had suspected that comets were composed of sand and rock bound by gravity, 
Whipple had theorized that comets are discrete bodies with a frozen nucleus that heats up and 
emits propulsive jets of gas and dust. Later spacecraft missions to comets had proven his theory 
correct.678

As part of its first efforts to meet the objectives of President George W. Bush’s Vision for Space 
Exploration, NASA awarded contracts to 11 companies to provide research on human lunar 
exploration and the development of a vehicle to replace the Space Shuttle. The Vision for Space 
Exploration called for NASA to engage in human and robotic exploration of the solar system and 
regions beyond. NASA awarded three contracts of approximately US$1 million each to 
Raytheon, Science Applications International Corporation, and the SPACEHAB Corporation for 
preliminary studies of human lunar exploration. An additional eight companies―Andrews 
Space, The Boeing Company, Draper Labs, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Orbital 
Sciences Corporation, Schafer, and Transformational Space Corporation―received contracts of 
approximately US$3 million to conduct preliminary research on human lunar exploration and on 
the development of a new crewed exploration vehicle.679

ISS crew members E. Michael Fincke and Gennady I. Padalka performed a spacewalk to conduct 
maintenance tasks and to prepare the ISS for the future arrival of a new cargo spacecraft. During 
the nearly 5½-hour spacewalk, Fincke and Padalka replaced a component of the ISS’s cooling 
system, installed safety equipment for future spacewalks, and set up three antennas to aid the 
docking of ESA’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), a new ISS cargo ship scheduled for 
launch in 2005.680

NASA’s Genesis space capsule returned to Earth but experienced a problematic landing, which 
NASA officials feared might have damaged the capsule’s scientific cargo. NASA had launched 
Genesis in August 2001 to collect particle samples from solar winds, samples that scientists 
hoped would provide information about the solar system’s chemical composition during its 
formation stages. To return Genesis to Earth, NASA had designed the capsule to release a 
rectangular parachute, which helicopters would grab, gently lowering the spacecraft to Earth. 
However, the parachute failed to deploy, and Genesis crashed into a desert area of Utah at nearly 
200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour). Although NASA officials were uncertain about the 
extent of damage to the spacecraft’s cargo, their initial prognosis was that researchers could still 
use some of the samples in scientific analyses.681 
 
9 September 
The ISS’s main oxygen generator stopped working, but the equipment failure posed no 
immediate danger to the station’s crew members. ISS Commander Gennady I. Padalka stated 
that the crew could repair the generator, which had failed on previous occasions. The 
malfunction did not pose an immediate threat to Padalka or his fellow crew member E. Michael 
Fincke, because they could access several alternative sources of oxygen stored in the orbiting 
space station.682 
 
Scientists published research demonstrating that changes in Earth’s gravitational field can affect 
the planet’s climate and weather. Experts described the findings as an important advance in 
climate research. Bryon D. Tapley of the University of Texas at Austin led the team of scientists, 
who had discovered that changes in Earth’s gravitational field are associated with changes in the 
distribution of water and ice masses. Their findings demonstrated that scientists could use 
satellite measurements of Earth’s gravitational field to measure changes in the distribution of 
Earth’s mass and to determine the causes of those changes―changes that included variations in 
climate and weather. In their analyses, the scientists had examined data from the Gravity 
Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), consisting of two spacecraft that measure 
variations in Earth’s gravitational field―a project of NASA and the German Aerospace 
Center.683 
 
A NASA-funded study revised a fundamental idea in biological research: a concept known as the 
tree of life. Previously, biologists had theorized that all life had originated from three types of 
cells―archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes―and had evolved in the pattern of a tree, with bacteria 
at the base and multicellular life forms branching out from those roots. However, the tree-of-life 
model did not explain the evolution of different cell types from a single cell or the merger of 
separate genomes, which form the branches of the tree of life. According to the new research of 
biologists Maria C. Rivera and James A. Lake, of the University of California at Los Angeles, 
two of the tree types of cells―bacteria and archaea―had merged to form the third type of cell,

NASA announced that it had made its Morning Report flight-safety software available for 
licensing. Scientists at NASA’s ARC had created the Morning Report as part of NASA’s 
Aviation System Monitoring and Modeling Project. The Morning Report, a flight-data-analysis 
software tool, could help flight-operations analysts automatically identify potentially problematic 
aircraft flights―flights with a high statistical probability of experiencing problems that could 
lead to an accident or another major problem.685 
 
NASA awarded a US$814 million contract to Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International 
(HSSSI) to provide equipment and services supporting spacewalks performed by Space Shuttle 
and ISS crew members. Under the contract―formally called the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 
Systems Contract―Hamilton Sundstrand would provide EVA hardware, training support, real-
time mission support, and other products and services related to spacewalks. The contract had a 
five-year base period and five additional one-year options.686

NASA re-extended the missions of its Mars rovers by an additional six months. The two mobile 
robotic geological laboratories, Spirit and Opportunity, had landed on Mars in January 2004. The 
robotic rovers had successfully completed their primary three-month mission in April 2004, and 
NASA had extended their mission by five months. Because the rovers remained operable and 
continued to provide important scientific data on Mars, NASA officials had decided to provide 
funding to cover an additional six months of rover operations.687

Scientists revealed the first observations of the merger of two galaxy clusters, providing crucial 
support for a theory of the universe’s formation. The scientists, led by J. Patrick Henry of the 
University of Hawaii, used ESA’s XMM-Newton orbiting observatory to obtain data showing 
that the galaxy cluster Abell 754 formed from the collision of two distinct clusters. Galaxy 
clusters such as Abell 754 contain hundreds of galaxies and are the universe’s largest 
gravitationally bound structures. Measurements of Abell 754’s density, pressure, and 
temperature indicated that it is still in formation. Moreover, the evidence showed that Abell 754 
had emerged from the collision of galaxy clusters, supporting the theory that the universe’s 
hierarchical structure had resulted from small galaxies and galaxy clusters merging into 
relatively larger ones.688

A privately funded rocket called SpaceShipOne became the first vehicle to complete a flight for 
the commercial spaceflight competition known as the Ansari X Prize. The X Prize competition 
would award US$10 million to the first private organization to create a spacecraft transporting a 
pilot and payload, with the equivalent weight of two passengers, to an altitude of 100 kilometers 
(62.1 miles) above Earth’s surface, twice in two weeks. California-based Scaled Composites had 
built SpaceShipOne, and the company’s founder Burt Rutan had designed the vehicle. The 
spacecraft left California’s Mojave Airport at 7:11 a.m. (PST), affixed to another aircraft. The 
aircraft released SpaceShipOne after attaining an altitude of 48,000 feet (9.1 miles or 14.6 
kilometers). Although SpaceShipOne had some difficulty during its ascent, the vehicle’s pilot 
Michael W. Melvill was able to guide the vehicle to a peak altitude of 337,500 feet (63.9 miles 
or 102.9 kilometers). However, Scaled Composites would have to repeat the feat within the 
subsequent two weeks to win the Ansari X Prize.689

4 October 
SpaceShipOne became the first privately developed, piloted spacecraft to exceed an altitude of 
100 kilometers (62.1 miles) twice within 14 days, thus winning the Ansari X Prize competition. 
The spacecraft launched at 7:00 a.m. (PST) from Mojave Airport in California. During the flight, 
the spacecraft’s pilot Brian Binnie set an unofficial world record for altitude for a private 
spacecraft, reaching 367,442 feet (69.6 miles or 112 kilometers) above Earth’s surface. The 
founder of the X Prize competition, California entrepreneur Peter H. Diamandis, had modeled 
the Ansari X Prize on the Orteig Prize, which Charles A. Lindbergh had won in 1927 for 
completing the first nonstop flight from New York to Paris. To win the competition and its 
US$10 million award, a private team had to launch a spacecraft with a pilot and an equivalent 
weight of two passengers to an altitude of 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) twice within two weeks. 
California-based Scaled Composites had built SpaceShipOne, company founder Burt Rutan had 
designed the spacecraft, and Microsoft cofounder Paul G. Allen had financed the project.690 
 
NASA scientists reported that many of the samples from the Genesis space capsule had survived 
the spacecraft’s crash on 8 September 2004. NASA had launched Genesis in 2001 to obtain 
particle samples from solar winds, planning to use the particles in a study of the chemical 
composition of the solar system during its creation billions of years ago. However, Genesis’s 
sample-return capsule had failed to land on Earth as planned. Instead, it had crashed into the 
Utah desert, risking the destruction of the particle samples. However, although the crash had 
complicated the extraction and processing of the capsule’s fragile, wafer-like, sample-collection 
plates, NASA scientists had found many of the samples intact and usable for subsequent 
analyses.691

Former astronaut Leroy Gordon Cooper died at age 77 in Ventura, California. One of the original 
seven astronauts for the Mercury program, the United States’ first human spaceflight program, 
Cooper was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, on 6 March 1927. He had joined the U.S. Air Force in 
1949, and NASA had selected him as a Mercury astronaut in April 1959. In May 1963, Cooper 
had piloted the program’s last mission, which lasted 34 hours and 20 minutes―longer than all 
the combined duration of all previous Mercury missions. Cooper had made his second and final 
trip to space on Gemini 5 in August 1965, in a two-person mission that had set a record for space 
endurance of 191 hours. The mission had demonstrated that humans could survive in a 
weightless environment and, therefore, that a trip to the Moon was feasible. In addition, Cooper 
had been the first American astronaut to make two spaceflights, to sleep in space, and to appear 
in a televised broadcast from space. After retiring from the Air Force in 1970, he had run several 
companies, including a consulting firm specializing in projects ranging from aerospace to hotel 
development.692

Maxime A. Faget, who had contributed to the designs of every U.S. spacecraft built to transport 
humans from Mercury to the Space Shuttle, passed away at age 83 in Houston, Texas. Born on 
26 August 1921 in British Honduras, Faget had graduated with a degree in mechanical 
engineering from Louisiana State University in 1943. He had begun his career with NASA in 
1946 as a research scientist at the NASA’s LaRC in Hampton, Virginia. In 1958 he had joined 
the Space Task Group―later, NASA’s JSC―where he had helped to design the spacecraft for 
the Mercury project and had led a team studying the feasibility of a lunar mission. Faget had also 
worked on the original feasibility study for the Space Shuttle, later contributing to the 
development of the Shuttles. After retiring from NASA in 1981, Faget had helped found Space 
Industries Incorporated, a private space company that had developed a Shuttle project for 
processing material in a near-perfect vacuum.693

surrounding 266 stars of similar size. The prevailing theory of planetary formation held that 
small rocky planets collide to form larger planets, and the collisions produce a substantial

quantity of dust, which steadily fades away over time. However, the team’s SST observations 
had significantly challenged that theory, revealing that some relatively younger stars have no 
surrounding dust clouds and that older stars tend to have large, bright discs of orbiting dust. The 
presence of dust clouds around the older stars indicated that planetary collisions continue far 
after initial planetary formation. The team concluded that planetary formation is a longer and 
more chaotic process than scientists had previously assumed.695

NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe announced the immediate appointment of James B. Garvin 
as NASA’s new Chief Scientist. Garvin had previously served as Chief Scientist for NASA’s 
lunar and Mars exploration programs. As Chief Scientist for all of NASA, Garvin would be 
responsible for ensuring the scientific merits of NASA’s programs, including formulating the 
programs’ scientific requirements. Garvin replaced former astronaut John M. Grunsfeld, who had 
served in the post since September 2003. NASA had selected Grunsfeld to train as an astronaut 
for a future long-duration mission.696 
 
Scientists published the first direct evidence of one of the fundamental elements of Einstein’s 
theory of general relativity: an effect known as frame dragging. Frame draggingthe distortion 
of space and time around rotating celestial bodies, such as Earthoccurs because the gravity of 
those objects pulls space and time along with them. Ignazio Ciufolini of the University of Lecce 
in Italy and NASA scientist Erricos C. Pavlis of GSFC had measured distortions in the orbits of 
the Laser Geodynamics Satellites, LAGEOS and LAGEOS2, to obtain the evidence of frame 
dragging. They had discovered that, although irregularities in Earth’s surface account for some 
of the variation in the satellites’ orbits, the remainder of the variation is the effect of space-time 
distortions.697

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft completed the closest approach ever made to Titan, Saturn’s 
largest moon, as well as the only moon in the solar system known to have an atmosphere. Soon 
after Cassini pierced Titan’s viscous atmosphere, the spacecraft beamed images of the moon’s 
surface to mission scientists at NASA’s JPL. ESA, the Italian Space Agency, and NASA had 
launched the mission in 1997 to study Saturn and its moons. Even though it is too cold to support 
life, scientists remain greatly interested in Titan, because they suspect that conditions on the 
planet are similar to those on Earth before the development of life.700

1 November 
Rex D. Geveden became Chief Engineer and Director of NASA’s Independent Technical 
Authority. Administrator Sean O’Keefe had appointed Geveden as Chief Engineer on 14 October 
2004. The Office of Chief Engineer was responsible for ensuring that NASA planned and 
conducted its development efforts and missions operations on a sound engineering basis. The 
Chief Engineer reported the overall review and technical readiness of all NASA programs 
directly to the Administrator. Geveden, who had been Deputy Director of NASA’s MSFC since 
July 2003, succeeded the retiring Theron Bradley Jr., who had served in the post since June 
2002.701 
 
8 November 
NASA scientists published research showing that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is 
the single most important factor in interannual rainfall variability throughout the world. The 
scientists had used data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite to 
identify geographic areas with the greatest variations in rainfall between 1998 and 2002. After 
comparing the TRMM data with rainfall patterns over the previous 50 years, they had found that 
changes in the ENSO directly correlated with local changes in rainfall patterns around the world. 
The TRMM satellite, a joint project of NASA and JAXA, used microwaves to measure 
precipitation over the tropics.702

Scientists from NASA’s ARC and Yale University announced that they had designed a complete 
map of gene activities in human tissue. The researchers had affixed pieces of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) sequences from the human genetic blueprint―known as the genome―to specially 
patterned glass slides. Using these slides, they had measured levels of ribonucleic 
acid―biochemical copies of DNA, which activating genes produce to make proteins. Among

their findings, the scientists had discovered that certain DNA sequences, which they had 
previously believed are nonfunctioning, are actually functioning―they are encoding active 
genes. The NASA scientists hoped their results would enable other researchers to analyze genes 
for human diseases and to develop new treatments for them. In addition, their research had a 
specific benefit for NASA: the NASA scientists hoped it would help them understand how 
human genes respond to spaceflight, so that they would be better able to protect the health of 
astronauts.703 
 
16 November 
NASA’s X-43A research vehicle established an unofficial world speed record for aircraft of 
nearly 7,000 miles per hour (11,265 kilometers per hour) or Mach 10―10 times the speed of 
sound. The X-43A contained an experimental engine―called a supersonic combustion ramjet or 
scramjet. The scramjet engine had no moving parts and did not use fuel from an on-board tank, 
as is the case with rockets. Instead, the engine used oxygen from the atmosphere, passing 
through the vehicle, to ignite fuel. NASA had explored the use of scramjets as an alternative to 
rocket power for space-access vehicles, with the hope that scramjet vehicles would operate more 
like an airplane than a rocket. The mission lifted off from NASA’s DFRC at Edwards Air Force 
Base in California at 2:30 p.m. (PST). A NASA B-52 carried the unpiloted X-43A to an altitude 
of 40,000 feet (7.6 miles or 12.2 kilometers). Before the X-43A had attained at an altitude of 
111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers), a Pegasus rocket booster launched from the B-52, 
providing an initial acceleration that enabled the X-43A to attain an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 
miles or 33.8 kilometers). The experimental aircraft flew for nearly 10 seconds at that altitude 
before descending into the Pacific Ocean as planned, nearly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) off the 
coast of California.704 
 
The SMART-1 spacecraft, the first of ESA’s Small Missions for Advanced Research in 
Technology (SMART), successfully completed its first orbit of the Moon. ESA had launched 
SMART-1 in September 2003 to study the Moon’s surface. SMART-1 was noteworthy for its 
use of a host of techniques and technologies to reach lunar orbit―including a solar-electric 
propulsion system or ion engine, which made the journey of 52.2 million miles (84 million 
kilometers) from Earth to the Moon using only 130 pounds (59 kilograms) of the 181 pounds (82 
kilograms) of xenon fuel that it had carried. That fuel consumption rate was equivalent to more 
than 5 million miles per gallon. The 809-pound (367-kilogram) spacecraft was able to achieve 
this rate of fuel efficiency using solar panels. During 13 months of expanding orbits around 
Earth, the solar panels had charged the xenon gas atoms, providing the spacecraft with 
occasional thrusts. ESA hoped to replace conventional propulsion systems―which were either 
too expensive or incapable of fulfilling the same objective―with the new solar-panel 
technology, to propel future spacecraft further into space.705

19 November 
NASA hosted representatives from 30 countries―including China―in talks about how to 
accomplish President George W. Bush’s Vision for Space Exploration. Experts and participants 
described Chinese participation in the talks as a small but significant advance toward the goals of 
global security and space exploration―China’s presence at the talks indicated its interest in 
collaborating with other countries, particularly the United States. According to analysts, Chinese 
contributions to space exploration could include expendable rockets, piloted spacecraft, and 
space robotics.706 
 
20 November 
NASA launched the Swift satellite from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. NASA 
and an international team of participants had designed the spacecraft to detect and analyze 
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)―ephemeral explosions that occur throughout the universe, usually far 
from Earth. GRBs may indicate a number of significant cosmological events, such as the 
collision of extremely dense celestial bodies or the formation of black holes. Swift was equipped 
with three telescopes to study GRBs, including the Burst Alert Telescope, which could detect 
and locate GRBs, and the X-ray Telescope (XRT) and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT), 
two telescopes that could study the bursts’ afterglows. Among the many participants in the Swift 
mission were the Italian Space Agency and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research 
Council of the United Kingdom.707 
 
Donald R. Puddy, longtime NASA Flight Director who had supervised numerous human 
spaceflight missions, died at the age of 67 in Houston, Texas. Born in Oklahoma, Puddy had 
joined NASA’s JSC in 1964 and had spent 22 years at JSC’s Mission Control Center. Puddy was 
only the 10th person to become a NASA flight director. He had later served in many other 
positions at NASA’s JSC, ARC, and Headquarters. As JSC Flight Director, Puddy had led flight-
control teams during the Apollo Program, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and the Skylab 
missions, as well as serving as Flight Director for the first Space Shuttle mission. He had also 
created and managed projects related to aircraft-safety procedures and had played a significant 
role in early cooperative efforts between the space programs of the United States and the 
U.S.S.R. Among the numerous awards Puddy had received for his achievements were the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal.708

NASA announced the crew for ISS Expedition 11, a six-month mission set to launch in April 
2005. Russian cosmonaut Sergei K. Krikalev would serve as Station Commander, and American 
astronaut John L. Phillips would serve as Flight Engineer and ISS Science Officer. In 2000 
Krikalev, who had experienced the most spaceflights of any Russian cosmonaut, had served as a 
member of the first ISS crew for Expedition 1. Phillips also had ISS experience as a member of

1 December 
A NASA-funded study revealed evidence of newly discovered relationships between climate 
change, ice sheets, and sea-level rise. Researchers led by Ian R. Joughin of NASA’s JPL found 
that, between 1992 and 2003, the speed of the ice movements of Greenland’s Jakobshavn Isbræ 
glacier―which has the fastest flow of ice from land to ocean of any glacier―had doubled. The 
increased ice flow from this single glacier had led to nearly a 4 percent increase in the rate of 
global sea-level rise during the 20th century. Furthermore, remote-sensing data from Canadian, 
European, and NASA satellites indicated that the glacier’s accelerated ice flow was largely the 
result of the warming of Earth’s climate.710 
 
8 December 
The National Research Council (NRC) issued a report outlining recommendations for servicing 
the HST. The issue of servicing the HST had initiated a public discussion in January 2004, when 
NASA had decided to cancel a Shuttle mission to service the HST because of concern for 
astronaut safety. The debate had erupted again after April 2004, when NASA had announced that 
it would conduct an unpiloted servicing mission for the HST. In response to criticism for those 
decisions, NASA had requested that the NRC evaluate servicing options for the HST. The NRC 
recommended that NASA service the HST using a piloted Shuttle mission, because a robotic 
mission would be too complex for NASA to complete before 2007, when NASA anticipated that 
the HST’s machinery would wear out. According to the guidelines recommended by the CAIB, 
astronauts would be able to service the HST by 2007. The NRC also reported that, if NASA 
carefully planned and conducted the piloted Shuttle mission, the mission would be far more 
likely to extend the telescope’s operational life at a relatively lower cost.711 
 
9 December 
NASA officials announced that the crew members of the ISS were experiencing a food shortage 
and would have to eat less until a Russian supply capsule could bring additional food supplies. 
Russia had scheduled the resupply capsule to arrive at the ISS on 25 December 2004, but if it 
missed the delivery, crew members Leroy Chiao and Salizhan S. Sharipov would have to return 
to Earth aboard the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the ISS. NASA also noted that, if the crew 
members had to evacuate the space station, Russia and the United States could continue to 
operate the ISS from Earth. Officials cited a number of reasons for the supply shortage on the 
ISS, including the postponement of regular supply missions after the Columbia accident and the

NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe submitted his resignation in a handwritten letter to President 
George W. Bush. In his resignation, O’Keefe stated that he would continue serving as 
Administrator until Bush had named a successor, but that he would prefer to leave by February 
2005. O’Keefe cited family commitments and his interest in pursuing better economic 
opportunities as the reasons for his resignation. Major media speculated about candidates to 
replace O’Keefe, but the White House provided no details about its choice for a successor. 
Before becoming NASA’s Administrator in December 2001, O’Keefe had worked for the 
OMB.713 
 
15 December 
U.S. federal government agencies released details of a long-term business strategy for the 
development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System―NextGen. The air traffic 
system NextGen encompassed a collection of infrastructural, policy, and technological efforts to 
address air traffic control, security, and other air-transportation concerns, which the U.S. 
government expected would increase with the continued growth in U.S. air traffic. In 2003 the 
U.S. Congress had created the Joint Planning and Development Office to coordinate public and 
private efforts to create and implement NextGen. The federal agencies participating in the effort 
included NASA and the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, and 
Transportation. The newly released NextGen strategy did not provide specific recommendations 
on NextGen; rather, it outlined objectives and requirements according to eight subject areas, 
including airport infrastructure development, security, and weather forecasting.714 
 
16 December 
An independent panel of experts provided its interim assessment of NASA’s efforts to meet the 
CAIB’s requirements for resuming Space Shuttle flights. NASA had chartered the Stafford-
Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG) to assess independently its implementation of the 
CAIB’s preflight recommendations―mandatory for NASA’s resuming Space Shuttle flights. 
The 26-member Task Group, headed by former astronauts Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. 
Covey, stated that it had approved NASA’s compliance plans for eight of the CAIB’s 15 
requirements. The task force did not see any major obstacles to NASA’s resuming Shuttle flights 
by May or June of 2005. The Task Group also noted, however, that NASA continued to have 
difficulty developing methods to repair the exterior heat tiles and thermal-resistant carbon-fiber 
material damaged during Shuttle flights.715

A NASA-funded study provided the first direct evidence that aerosols affect the absorption and 
release of carbon by ecosystems. Because carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere, acts as a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, the research team sought to identify the 
factors that influence carbon transfer between the atmosphere and soils. Led by Dev S. Niyogi of 
North Carolina State University, the scientists had used NASA satellite data to examine 
atmospheric aerosol content and carbon absorption in different ecosystems. They had discovered 
that high aerosol levels increase carbon absorption in croplands and forests but decrease carbon 
absorption in grasslands. The researchers suggested that this variation occurs because of the way 
that aerosols interact with different types of vegetation canopies to affect the dispersion of 
radiation from sunlight. In the dense vegetation canopies of croplands and forests, aerosols 
scatter sunlight in a manner that enables more radiation to reach a greater quantity of plant leaves 
and increases carbon absorption through plant photosynthesis. However, in the less dense 
vegetation canopy of grasslands, aerosols scatter sunlight in a manner that raises ground 
temperatures, causing the soil to release more carbon dioxide.717 
 
21 December 
Researchers using images from NASA’s Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) found evidence 
of dozens of newly forming galaxies, a discovery that challenged prevailing scientific 
understanding of the creation of galaxies. Many astronomers believe that the universe began 13.7 
billion years ago after a massive explosion of dense matter―an event often referred to as the Big 
Bang―and that galaxy and star formation peaked around 8 to 10 billion years ago. However, the 
researchers using the GALEX data had found evidence of 36 massive galaxies, ranging in age 
from 100 million to 1 billion years old and producing stars at a prodigious rate. The findings 
suggested that the new formation of galaxies had not ended as early as scientists had believed, 
and that the peak of galaxy formation had occurred later than previously thought.718

The Russian Space Agency launched Progress-M 51/ISS-16P, an automatic cargo vehicle, on a 
Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 10:19 p.m. (GMT). Progress-M 
51, bound for the ISS, carried 2.75 tons (2,500 kilograms or 2.5 tonnes) of equipment, fuel, food, 
and water.720 
 
A NASA study revealed that clouds that form from small haze particles do not reduce Earth’s 
temperatures as much as previous research had suggested. Scientists had thought that low-lying 
clouds cool Earth by reflecting sunlight away from the planet’s surface, and that the reflectivity 
of clouds increases as their volume of water increases. However, NASA scientist Andrew S. 
Ackerman led a group of researchers who found that polluted, low-lying clouds neither hold 
more water nor reflect more solar energy than do cleaner clouds. Using measurements from 
polar-orbiting satellites and from NASA aircraft flying through clouds, the scientists discovered 
that water tends to decrease in polluted clouds, rather than to increase. Because most predictions 
of climate change had incorrectly assumed that polluted clouds counteract greenhouse warming, 
this finding could significantly influence how scientists predict changes in climate.721

NASA’s Cassini orbiter successfully released ESA’s Huygens probe on a controlled course to 
Saturn’s largest moon Titan. ESA, NASA, and the Italian Space Agency had created the Cassini-

designed to analyze Titan’s atmosphere and surface―to enter the moon’s atmosphere in January

NASA’s Cassini spacecraft made a close pass of Saturn’s moon Iapetus, flying within 123,400 
kilometers (76,677 miles) on its closest approach, and coming about 10 times closer to the moon 
than Voyager 2 had come in 1981. Cassini’s closest approach had occurred over the moon’s 
mysterious dark terrain, which scientists had never before seen at close range. Scientists 
described the dark coating, the origin of which was unknown, as rich in carbon-based molecules. 
The dark terrain blankets the side of Iapetus that leads in the direction of the orbital motion

NASA announced that the Chandra X-ray Observatory had detected the most powerful eruption 
measured in the universe to date, generating a supermassive black hole that is growing at a 
remarkable rate. The eruption in the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 had been in process for 
more than 100 million years, generating energy equal to that of hundreds of millions of gamma-
ray bursts (GRBs). In the past, scientists had usually detected the rapid growth of supermassive 
black holes by observing very bright radiation from galaxies. However, MS 0735.6+7421 had no 
detectable bright, central radiation, and the galaxy cluster’s radio jets were faint. Chandra’s x-ray 
observations of the hot cluster gas had revealed the true nature of the black hole. Michael R. 
Wise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology remarked that, until Chandra had captured 
this information, scientists had no idea that the black hole was “gorging itself.” Chandra’s 
discovery demonstrated that, to observe and understand some of the most violent events in the 
universe, astronomers need x-ray telescopes.724 
 
6 January 
The ISS Expedition 10 crew, comprising Leroy Chiao and Salizhan S. Sharipov, successfully 
reactivated the station’s Elektron oxygen generator, which had shut down on 1 January because 
of air bubbles in the system’s lines. Flight Engineer Sharipov made three unsuccessful attempts 
to repair the Russian-built unit. While the ISS crew continued to work on the problem, flight 
controllers in Russia used oxygen stores aboard the Progress 16 supply ship to repressurize the 
station. Russian engineers then instructed the crew to hook up a backup liquid unit to infuse fresh 
electrolytes into the oxygen generator’s system. The crew reactivated the Elektron generator 
without incident. Engineers planned to monitor the system’s performance to ensure that it 
continued to function properly.725 
 
The White House Office of Science and Technology released the Vision for Space Exploration, 
the new policy for transportation in space and the first wholesale revision of space policy since 
1994. The new policy detailed broad principles and national security goals for providing access 
to space for military satellites, spy spacecraft, and other government missions, emphasizing the 
creation of a robust program for space exploration. The policy called for astronauts to return to 
the Moon by 2020, planned for future human missions to Mars, and supported the 
commercialization of large parts of the space industry. Under the new policy, the government 
would fund Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation rockets to launch government 
satellites through the end of the decade. At that time, the White House expected that the private 
sector would have developed launchers that were less costly and more flexible. The policy also 
reiterated President George W. Bush’s plan for the retirement of the Space Shuttle at the 
completion of ISS constructionestimated to occur at the end of the decade. The projected

retirement of the fleet required that the DOD and NASA recommend the best option for 
replacing the Space Shuttle. According to the new policy, the two agencies would work closely 
to determine long-term funding plans. In addition, the agencies would use heavy-lift rockets, 
which the military was developing, for satellites and other robotic missions.726 
 
NASA announced the completion of the most extensive global topographic map ever created, 
using data collected during Endeavour’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 
February 2000. NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had processed 
the collected data for more than four years, creating digital elevation maps that encompassed 80 
percent of Earth’s landmass and revealed, for the first time, large, detailed swaths of topography 
previously obscured by persistent cloud cover. The data covered Australia and New Zealand in 
unprecedented, uniform detail, as well as the more than 1,000 islands comprising much of 
Polynesia and Melanesia in the South Pacific and the islands in the South Indian and Atlantic 
oceans, including many that geographers had never topographically mapped. The low 
topography typical of the islands makes them vulnerable to tidal effects, storm surges, and long-
term rise in sea level. Mission Project Scientist at NASA’s JPL, Michael Kobrick, remarked that 
the maps would help mitigate the effects of future disasters of the magnitude of the Indian Ocean 
tsunami, because scientists would now be able to see where rising waters would go. Kobrick also 
commented that the SRTM was among the most significant missions the Shuttle had performed 
and, probably, the most significant mapping mission of any single type.727 
 
11 January 
James D. Wetherbee, the only U.S. astronaut to command five Space Shuttle flights, announced 
his plans to retire from NASA. Wetherbee had participated in six Space Shuttle missions since 
becoming an astronaut in 1984, serving as pilot aboard Mission STS-32 in 1990 and 
commanding STS-52 in 1992, STS-63 in 1995, STS-86 in 1997, STS-102 in 2001, and STS-113 
in 2002. His missions had included flights both to the Russian Mir space station, including the 
first Shuttle–Mir rendezvous, and to the ISS. Just before retiring, Wetherbee had worked as 
Space Shuttle Lead in the Independent Technical Authority at NASA’s JSC, a group responsible 
for identifying and analyzing possible hazards and determining launch readiness. Wetherbee had 
also served for two years as Director of Flight Crew Operations at JSC and for five years as 
Deputy Director of JSC.728

The NASA probe known as Deep Impact launched aboard a Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral 
in Florida, on its mission to Comet Tempel One. The craft carried an impactor, intended to 
collide with the comet to create a crater about 100 meters (328 feet) wide and 28 meters (92 feet) 
deep, as well as two instruments designed to observe the impact and its aftermath in visible and

14 January 
ESA announced that its Huygens probe, which had undertaken a seven-year journey through the 
solar system, aboard NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, had successfully landed on the surface of 
Saturn’s moon Titan. ESA intended Huygens to provide the first direct and detailed sampling of 
Titan’s atmospheric chemistry, the first photographs of its surface, and a detailed weather report 
of the moon. ESA had selected Titan as the probe’s destination because Titan’s nitrogen 
atmosphere is rich in methane, and scientists believe its surface may contain chemicals similar to 
those that existed on the young Earth, before life evolved. Before the landing of Huygens, 
scientists had been unable to see Titan’s surface, because the methane in the atmosphere reacts 
with sunlight, creating a permanent blanket of smog. ESA had designed the Huygens probe 
specifically to breach that shroud.730 
 
18 January 
Russian Space Agency Chief Anatoly N. Perminov and ESA Director General Jean-Jacques 
Dordain signed an agreement allowing Russia to use ESA sites for space launches and enabling 
Russia and Europe freely to exchange research and development information. Specifically, ESA 
would permit Russia to conduct Soyuz launches from Kourou, French Guiana. In addition, the 
two would share information on the design of new launchers and fuelsinformation once 
closely guarded by both sideswith the intention of developing new launchers jointly. For 
example, Russia and Europe had studied the option of developing new reusable launchers and 
new propulsion systems.731 
 
In the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers studying data from the Mediterranean 
Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) reported their determination that a strange flash over the 
Indian Ocean, which had occurred on 20 January 2003, was not related to lightning. The 
researchers named the mysterious reddish glow Transient Ionospheric Glow Emission in Red, or 
TIGER. Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, a crew member of the ill-fated STS-107, had recorded the 
glow while aboard Space Shuttle Columbia, using an infrared video camera. During the Shuttle 
flight, Ramon had collected data about dust particles in the atmosphere for the MEIDEX Sprite 
campaign at the Open University in Ra’anana, Israel. Researchers for MEIDEX had analyzed 
Ramon’s video, including a single frame that showed a mysterious reddish glow 150 kilometers 
(93.2 miles) above the ocean near Madagascar. Like blue jets and elves, sprites are 
emissions―transient luminous events (TLEs)―that occur above thunderstorms. Airline pilots

21 January 
NASA announced that the NASA-led Swift mission had detected and captured its first image of 
a GRB. On 17 January, the craft had turned, autonomously, to focus on the burstquickly 
enough to capture an image with its X-ray Telescope (XRT), while its Burst Alert Telescope 
(BAT) continued to detect gamma rays. The event marked the first time that an x-ray telescope 
had imaged an in-process GRB. Previous images had captured the burst’s afterglow, but never 
the burst itself. The event had also marked the first time that BAT had detected a burst, and an 
XRT detection had autonomously followed it. Swift had carried a third instrument, the 
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT), which was still in its testing phase. UVOT had not been 
collecting data when the other two telescopes detected the burst. John A. Nousek, Swift’s 
Mission Operations Director at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania, 
remarked that Swift had successfully achieved, early in its mission, its primary purposeto 
detect the fleeting bursts and to focus telescopes on them autonomously within a minute.733 
 
24 January 
Northrop Grumman Corporation announced that it had finalized an agreement with the Boeing 
Company to compete as a team to develop NASA’s new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and 
related human lunar-exploration systems, in anticipation of NASA’s formal request for proposals 
(RFPs). NASA intended the CEV to serve as the central human space-transportation system 
within the Project Constellation, which would incorporate human and robotic space systems, 
ferrying astronauts to the Moon and beyond. According to the agreement, Northrop Grumman’s 
Integrated Systems sector would serve as team leader and prime contractor during the initial 
development phase, Spiral 1. During the Spiral 1 phase, the team hoped to demonstrate the 
CEV’s ability to operate safely in low Earth orbit with astronauts aboard. Boeing NASA 
Systems, an operating unit of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, would serve as principal 
subcontractor. The two companies’ roles would reverse to implement the second phase, Spiral 2. 
During the Spiral 2 phase, NASA intended to begin to expand human space exploration to the 
Moon and beyond.734 
 
26 January 
NASA announced its selection of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) as part of NASA’s 
Small Explorer Program (SMEX). Scheduled for launch in 2008, IBEX was the first mission 
designed to detect the edge of the solar system. IBEX planned to use two neutral atom imagers to 
detect the particles created from the termination shock that occurs at the boundary between the 
solar system and interstellar space. IBEX would also study galactic cosmic rays, which pose a

successfully launched six SMEX missions.735  
 
ISS Expedition 10 Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan S. Sharipov 
successfully carried out a spacewalk to install a universal work platform at the station’s Zvezda 
module. The excursion was Chiao’s fifth spacewalk and Sharipov’s first. Over a period of 5 
hours and 28 minutes, the crew attached a German-built test robot, ROKVISS (Robotic 
Components Verification on the ISS), to the newly installed work platform. The two-jointed 
robot, with an on-board camera and manipulator arm, would test the application of the 
lightweight robotic systems that may help support the ISS and other spacecraft in the future. 
Chiao and Sharipov encountered some difficulty fastening the power cables of the robot’s 
antenna, but they succeeded in their second attempt. ISS crews would be able to operate the 
robot using a computer, but flight controllers in Germany would operate the robot remotely, 
relying on the antenna. Sharipov also inspected and photographed three vents, which the 
station’s Elektron oxygen generator and other systems used to expel waste matter. He reported 
white residue resembling honeycomb, on the Elektron generator’s vent, and brownish residue on 
the other two vents. Engineers on the ground planned to analyze the photographs to determine 
whether the residue had caused the repeated shutdowns of the main oxygen generator of the 
ISS.736  
 
28 January 
NASA announced that one of its scientific balloons had broken the balloon flight record for 
duration and distance, soaring for nearly 42 days and making three orbits around the South Pole, 
thereby exceeding the previous record of nearly 32 days and two orbits. The flight of the balloon, 
which carried the Cosmic Ray Energetics and Mass (CREAM) experiment, demonstrated the 
capabilities of NASA’s Ultra-Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) support system. NASA had 
designed the CREAM experiment to study the supernova acceleration limit of cosmic rays―the 
relativistic gas of protons, electrons, and heavy nuclei arriving at Earth from outside the solar 
system. The ULDB system, which NASA was developing, would extend flights up to 100 
days.737

invasive species. As a member of the council, NASA would provide data acquired using Earth-
observation spacecraft and predictive models to assist 12 other federal agencies’ efforts to 
combat invasive species nationwide. The council had extended the invitation because of NASA’s

previous work monitoring invasive species: NASA had provided data, predictive models, and 
systems engineering to the USGS, information that had helped the USGS build predictive maps 
of invasive species in Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. With NASA’s 
assistance, USGS had converted data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer 
aboard NASA’s Terra satellite, as well as other data, to create predictive maps of plant species 
distribution. USGS had used the National Invasive Species Forecasting System to help improve 
the nation’s response to invasive species.738 
 
The U.S. House Committee on Science held a hearing to examine options for the HST. 
Astronauts had serviced the HST four times since its entry into orbit in 1990. NASA had 
scheduled a fifth servicing mission for 2004, planning to make repairs and upgrades. However, 
because it had grounded the Shuttle fleet following the Columbia disaster in February 2003, 
NASA had not performed the scheduled servicing mission. The decision about whether to 
service or to decommission the telescope hinged upon the expense of the mission and on 
NASA’s budgetary allocation of funds for the mission. Joseph H. Taylor of Princeton University, 
head of the National Academy of Sciences committee that set priorities for planning astronomy 
missions for the first decade of the 21st century, testified that his committee had identified the 
servicing mission to the HST as a priority for NASA’s space program, but only if the cost of the 
mission did not exceed US$400 million. Taylor stated that he would not support the mission if it 
would delay other programs or if NASA would have to rearrange its priorities to fund the 
mission. Newly revised NASA estimates placed the total cost of a fifth servicing mission at 
US$1 to US$2 billion, a cost that NASA’s Space Science Division could not sustain on its own. 
Experts testifying before the committee agreed that, if the Office for Human Space Flight and the 
Space Sciences Division could share the expense, the mission would be well worth it.739 
 
3 February 
ESA and the government of the United Kingdom (UK) officially published the report of the 
investigation into the circumstances and possible reasons for the failure of the Beagle 2 mission. 
Beagle 2, the Mars lander that had “piggybacked” aboard ESA’s Mars Express Orbiter, had 
failed to communicate after its landing date of 25 December 2005. The UK government and ESA 
had commissioned the report in February 2004, and the commission had completed the report in 
April 2004. Initially, ESA and the UK government had refused to publish the report, citing 
details of confidential intergovernmental agreements, as well as commercially sensitive 
information. Instead, they had issued a set of recommendations for future missions. However, the 
New Scientist had requested the report’s publication under the UK’s new Freedom of 
Information Act, in force since the beginning of 2005. Colin Pillinger, the planetary scientist 
who had first proposed the Beagle 2 project, and Mark Sims, the mission’s project 
managerboth at the Open University in the UKagreed that the report contained little, if any, 
commercially sensitive information. However, the report concluded that ESA and the UK 
government should never have approved the project. ESA committee investigating the loss of the

probe had found several fundamental errors, such as classifying the lander as an instrument 
aboard Mars Express, instead of as a separate spacecraft, and making inaccurate estimates about 
the characteristics of the Martian atmosphere. The committee also determined that ESA and the 
UK had underfunded the mission from the start. Moreover, the committee found that the 
mission’s logistics were too complex for Pillinger’s team.740 
 
The U.S. Air Force successfully launched two military satellites aboard an Atlas 3B, the last of 
Lockheed Martin’s Atlas 3 rockets. The launch marked the 145th and final launch from Complex 
36 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, after 43 years of operation. NASA had built the complex in the 
early 1960s, specifically for its Atlas-Centaur program, which included the launches of NASA’s 
historic Surveyor, Mariner, and Pioneer missions. Launches from the site had proved highly 
successful; the launch of the last Atlas 3B marked the 75th consecutive successful Atlas rocket 
launch, including all six Atlas 3 flights. Launch Complex 36 was one of the United States’ oldest 
continuously operating launch sites and the last of the U.S. launch sites to use a traditional 
blockhouse to control the launch. The final Atlas 3B carried a pair of formation-flying, classified 
satellites, which analysts believed were part of the Naval Ocean Surveillance System (NOSS) of 
the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Satellites in the NOSS, a network for monitoring 
ships around the globe, were reportedly capable of detecting radio transmissions from ships to 
pinpoint their locations precisely.741 
 
4 February 
NASA announced the inauguration of SERVIR, an innovative regional monitoring system 
designed to provide early warnings to Central American decision makers about various 
ecological and climatic changes. SERVIR, Spanish for “to serve,” is the acronym for the Spanish 
phrase, Sistema Regional de Visualización y Monitoreo (Regional Visualization and Monitoring 
System). The purpose of the system was to aid the governments and industries of the seven 
countries of Central America and the southern Mexican states. NASA scientists had developed 
the system to track weather, climatological, and ecological eventsfor example, to monitor 
wildfires, red tides, and toxic algae bloomsusing NASA’s research in Earth sciences and 
space-based observations. Daniel E. Irwin, SERVIR Project Manager at NASA’s MSFC, 
remarked that the system was an excellent tool for gauging slow or periodic shifts in climate that 
could lead to drought or other long-term problems, in addition to identifying quick-forming 
weather phenomena that threaten human lives.742

Officials of the Personal Spaceflight Federation announced the newly formed organization’s

December 2004Pub. L. No. 108-492, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 
2004the industry group planned to work with federal regulators to draft rules and standards for 
suborbital space tourism. The new federation brought together visionary space entrepreneurs, 
including SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan, whose team had won the US$10 million X Prize 
in October 2004 for conducting the first private suborbital spaceflight, and video-game developer 
John D. Carmack II, whose Armadillo Aerospace team had been among the leading contenders 
for the X Prize. Executive Director of the X Prize Foundation Gregg E. Maryniak, serving as the 
Federation’s spokesperson, remarked on the law’s new mandate that government and industry 
work together to develop safety standards. Maryniak stated that the Federation believed strongly 
that private industry must devise a suborbital product considerably safer than that of the current 
civil space program.743 
 
9 February 
The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation held a hearing to 
explore the regulation of the nascent commercial spaceflight industry. Members of the newly 
formed Personal Spaceflight Federation and its Industry Consensus Standards Organization 
voiced their concern that the government would attempt to implement additional regulations, 
thereby overregulating the new industry and stifling innovation. The Commercial Space Launch 
Amendments Act of 2004 required the FAA to issue licenses for the launches of privately built 
spacecraft and had given the FAA three years to issue rules for licensing. However, the Act also 
prohibited the FAA from issuing safety regulations for passengers and crew for eight years, 
unless specific design features or operating practices had resulted in serious or fatal injuries. U.S. 
Representative James L. Oberstar (D-MN), ranking member of the Transportation Committee, 
objected to that approach and had introduced his own bill (H.R. 656), requiring the FAA to 
include in its licensing rules minimum safety and health standards for spacecraft passengers and 
crew. FAA Administrator Marion C. Blakey agreed with regulation of private spaceflight in 
principle but suggested that such oversight needed to develop alongside the industry, 
emphasizing the difficulty in stipulating regulations for vehicles that did not yet exist.744

EUR geostationary satellite would provide military communications for the United States and 
Spain. For 10 days, the Netherlands’ microsatellite SLOSHSAT-FLEVO, weighing just 127 
kilograms (0.127 tonnes or 0.139 tons), would test the dynamics of de-ionized water in orbit. 
FLEVO was the acronym for Facility for Liquid Experimentation and Verification in Orbit, as 
well as the name of the latest Dutch province that the Netherlands had reclaimed from the sea. 
ESA also sent aloft a monitor, MAQSAT, which remained attached to the rocket to gather data 
about the rocket’s dynamic behavior, from launch through the release of the two satellites. In its 
inaugural launch, the rocket had veered off course, prompting Mission Control to destroy it. An 
inquiry board had determined that the cooling system of the rocket’s Vulcain engine had 
malfunctioned.745 
 
15 February 
NASA awarded a US$9.8 million, five-year research grant to the University of Texas’s 
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to study the cancer risks of radiation exposure during 
space travel, adding another NASA Specialized Center of Research (NSCOR) to NASA’s space 
radiation program. The name of the newest NSCOR was NASA Specialized Center of Research 
for the Estimation of Solid Tumor Cancer Risks from Space Radiation. The grant enabled 
researchers to study the relationship of lung cancer pathogenesis and exposure to HZE-particles 
(high-energy charged particles) at the cellular and molecular level, using data collected from 
animal models and tissues.746 
 
17 February 
The U.S. House Committee on Science held a hearing to discuss NASA’s FY 2006 budgetary 
request and priorities. Committee Chair Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-NY) expressed doubt that 
NASA would receive the full US$16.45 billion it had requested. Committee members questioned 
Deputy Administrator Frederick D. Gregory on several topics: NASA’s long-term plan to return 
to the Moon and to send a human mission to Mars; its projected cuts to science and astronautics 
programs; its decision not to fund a servicing mission to the HST; and its plans for its workforce. 
The committee also questioned the US$858 million NASA had designated for Mars and lunar 
exploration, while reducing spending in other space science programs, including that of the HST. 
The committee questioned budgetary proposals based on plans for 28 Shuttle flights to the ISS 
and no flights to repair the HST. Representative Vernon J. Ehlers (R-MI) remarked that that the 
HST was capable of conducting more and better scientific research in one week than the ISS 
could produce in its entire lifetime. Boehlert reminded NASA officials that the U.S. Congress 
had never endorsed or even discussed the President’s January 2004 declaration urging NASA to 
return humans to the Moon within 15 years and, ultimately, to launch human missions to Mars 
and beyond. Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN) remarked that Congress had no consensus 
regarding the proposed changes in NASA’s priorities, changes that he described as “almost 
staggering in terms of magnitude.”747

NASA officially refuted news reports that had circulated on 16 February claiming that NASA 
scientists affiliated with ARC had found strong evidence that life might exist on Mars. 
According to the news reports, during a private meeting in Washington, DC, two astrobiologists 
from Ames had told a group of space officials that they had found strong evidence, in the form of 
methane signatures, that life currently exists on Mars, hidden in caves and sustained by pockets 
of water. NASA stated that it did not have any observational data from any current Mars 
missions to support the claim. NASA further stated that the work the scientists had conducted did 
not directly support any conclusion regarding the existence of life on Mars but, rather, that the 
scientists’ research could help formulate a strategy for searching for such life. The scientists had 
not submitted any research papers asserting the existence of Martian life to any scientific 
journal.748 
 
22 February 
The Boeing Company announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its Rocketdyne 
Propulsion and Power business to Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies Corporation unit, for 
about US$700 million in cash. Rocketdyne, primarily a rocket engine developer and builder that 
provided booster engines for the Space Shuttle and the Delta series of expendable launch 
vehicles, had helped pioneer space exploration in the 1950s and1960s. The sale reflected 
Boeing’s struggle to make a profit in the space-launch business and marked the company’s latest 
move toward focusing on large-scale weapons and aerospace systems. United Technologies 
intended the acquisition to broaden the product line at Pratt & Whitney, which, in recent years, 
had lost market share in its core business of providing jet engines.749 
 
24 February 
NASA announced the completion of its pioneering Advanced Air Transportation Technologies 
(AATT) project, which, since 1996, had focused on developing technologies to improve the 
capacity of transportation aircraft operations at and between the major airports of the National 
Airspace System. The AATT project had collaborated with the FAA and the airline industry to 
develop decision-support tools for air-traffic controllers, airline pilots, and air-operations 
managers. Tools developed and implemented through the AATT project included: the Traffic 
Management Advisor, operational at eight Air Route Traffic Control Centers, which helped 
controllers manage air traffic by sequencing aircraft as the craft approached their destinations; 
the Surface Management System, scheduled for transfer to the FAA, which helped airport 
controllers and company traffic managers coordinate aircraft departures from the gate, 
preventing delays at the runway; other technologies, which helped aircraft fly the most direct

industry personnel better understand air-traffic patterns and future trends. Michael R. Landis, 
Manager of the AATT project, remarked that NASA would incorporate many of the technologies 
and concepts developed by the AATT project into the Next Generation Air Transportation 
System, the initiative of the government and industry to modernize the National Airspace 
System.750 
 
26 February 
Japan successfully launched a geostationary weather satellite MTSAT-1R aboard an H-2A rocket 
from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima prefecture, after a glitch in communications 
between the rocket and ground systems had caused a 76-minute delay. The launch was Japan’s 
first launch of a heavy-lift vehicle since November 2003, when one of the H-2A’s solid boosters 
had failed to jettison as expected after completing its burn, causing the launch to fail. In the 
failed launch, Japan had lost the second pair of the four spy satellites that it had built after North 
Korea had fired a missile into Japanese territory in 1998. The other pair of the four 
satellitesone optical and one radar-sounding satellitewere all Japan had left to monitor its 
threatening neighbor. Furthermore, the launch failure had dashed Japan’s plans to enter the 
commercial satellite-launch business and had caused Japan to lose its international credibility. 
The successful launch of the MTSAT-1R restored morale to Japan’s rocketry program. A second 
mission of the MTSAT-1R was to replace a satellite lost in November 1999 when the final H-2 
rocket, the predecessor of H-2A, had failed to reach orbit. Japan had designed the MTSAT-1R to 
service the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau and the Japan Meteorological Agency, fulfilling the two 
missions of facilitating air-traffic management and obtaining satellite imagery for 
meteorologists.751

1 March 
NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate issued a request for proposals (RFP) for the 
Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) that NASA intended to use to transport astronauts beyond low 
Earth orbit and to the Moon by 2020. NASA had set the deadline for submissions for 2 May 
2005 and planned to select two contractors in September 2005. The two contractors would 
develop competing prototypes with a December 2008 completion date, at which time NASA 
would select the prime contractor. NASA stipulated that the minimum specifications for the CEV 
were that the craft weigh 20 tonnes (18.14 tons) or less; house as many as four astronauts, for as 
long as 16 days; have the ability to rendezvous and dock with future lunar landers and 
interplanetary modules; and allow a safe abort throughout all phases of its flight. NASA 
stipulated that it would permit contractors to design spacecraft that exceeded these specifications. 
For instance, the RFP permitted the design of craft that could maintain a crew in space for longer

than 16 days or accommodate a crew of six. The RFP also gave contractors the flexibility to 
decide whether the CEV would be able to dock with the ISS.752 
 
NASA signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the United Nations Education, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in an effort to improve global conservation 
through increased use of NASA’s Earth science research and remote-sensing data. Under the 
agreement, UNESCO would use NASA-generated data to share scientific information about how 
Earth functions. In addition, the MOA would further an existing partnership between the NASA-
supported Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) education 
program and UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre. NASA and UNESCO would train teachers in 
UNESCO-member states to work with UNESCO’s Natural World Heritage Site managers on 
collaborative conservation program activities.753 
 
3 March 
J. Stephen Fossett landed the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer experimental aircraft in Salinas, 
Kansas, after flying the first solo, nonstop, non-refueled, around-the-world airplane trip. The 
flight had lasted three days, during which Fossett had not slept and had only consumed 12 
milkshakes. The craft, designed by X Prize–winning SpaceShipOne creator Burt Rutan, carried 
NASA’s advanced experimental Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) transceiver, 
the Low Power Transceiver (LPT) that NASA researchers believed would provide a flexible and 
inexpensive option for relaying information between spacecraft. NASA had placed the new 
transceiver on board GlobalFlyer to test the device’s function during a real flight, especially its 
performance in delivering a constant video feed. NASA had loaned GlobalFlyer a modified 
version of its Personal Cabin Pressure Monitor to alert the pilot of potentially dangerous or 
deteriorating cabin pressure. Because the background noise in GlobalFlyer’s cockpit was too 
loud for the pilot to hear an alarm, the modified monitor vibrated to signal a problem. The 
mission had successfully overcome periodic failures of GlobalFlyer’s navigation system. 
Furthermore, while passing through Japanese airspace, the aircraft had appeared to be running 
out of fuel too quickly, but a solid tailwind had helped Fossett avoid making a landing in 
Hawaii.754 
 
7 March 
Aera Corporation, which had competed as American Astronautics in the X Prize private 
spaceflight competition, signed a five-year launch support agreement with the U.S. Air Force, 
securing access to Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida. Although Aera had yet to launch a 
single test vehicle, the company planned to launch paying customers by the end of 2006. Aera’s 
President and Chief Operating Officer Lewis Reynolds explained that the company had used 
computer-based modeling for most of its testing and had done very little testing of actual 
physical components for the spacecraft. The company intended to apply for a FAA launch

NASA-funded researchers reported that they had discovered that lightning in clouds a few miles 
above the ground clears a safe zone in the Van Allen Beltthe radiation belt located thousands 
of miles above Earth. Without this zone, satellites would have no safe area in which to orbit. The 
discovery, which NASA described as unexpected, resolved a 40-year debate about how the safe 
zone forms and how the region clears after magnetic storms fill it with radiation. Previously, the 
prominent theory held that turbulence in the zone generates radio waves in space, which clear the 
radiation. However, lightning also generates radio waves. The research team had confirmed the 
lightning theory using a global map of lightning activity created from data that the Micro Lab 1 
spacecraft had collected. The team had also collected radio-wave data from the Radio Plasma 
Imager aboard the Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft, 
combining that data with archival data from the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft. These two data 
sets showed that radio-wave activity in the safe zone closely follows terrestrial lightning 
patterns; if the radio waves had originated in space rather than Earth, no such correlation would 
exist. Therefore, the team had concluded that lightning clears radiation within a few days 
following magnetic storms. According to NASA, engineers could eventually design spacecraft 
that generate radio waves at the correct frequency and location to clear radiation belts around 
other planets, enabling humans to explore planets and moons such as Jupiter’s Europa.756 
 
9 March 
The GAO published a report warning that the lack of a detailed, long-term strategy regarding 
NASA’s workforce could threaten the safety of Space Shuttle operations and delay 
implementation of the Bush administration’s 2004 directive to return astronauts to the Moon. 
The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation had tasked GAO with 
tracking NASA’s efforts to develop a strategy for sustaining the Space Shuttle workforce until 
the Shuttle’s retirement and identifying factors that impeded those efforts. GAO reported that 
NASA had made limited progress toward this goal. GAO found that NASA had taken 
preliminary steps: identifying lessons learned from the retirement of programs comparable to the 
Space Shuttle, such as the Air Force Titan 4 Rocket Program; enlisting the assistance of human 
capital experts; and revising its acquisition strategy for updating specific prime contracts. 
However, GAO concluded that NASA’s failure to make decisions regarding contractor 
requirements during the remainder of the Shuttle program would hinder its progress. Moreover, 
GAO stated that NASA must develop a detailed strategy for retiring the Shuttle program, to 
enable it to protect agency-wide goals from the potential impact of workforce problems. GAO 
cited several factors hampering NASA’s ability to accomplish this, such as NASA’s near-term 
focus on returning the Shuttle to flight, a focus that had caused a delay in assessing hardware and

aspects of the President’s Vision for Space Exploration.757 
 
11 March 
International Launch Services (ILS) successfully launched the European satellite Inmarsat 4-F1 
from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a stretched version of the Atlas 5 rocket. Weighing 13,138 
pounds (5,959 kilograms or 5.96 tonnes), the EADS Astrium-built Inmarsat 4 was the largest 
commercial satellite ever to launch. As part of a three-satellite constellation comprising the new 
Broadband Global Area Network, the spacecraft would provide wireless, broadband connections 
to ships, planes, and remote areas that had not previously had reliable access to ground-based, 
high-speed networks.758 
 
15 March 
NASA and the FAA brought a demonstration of the Small Aircraft Transportation System 
(SATS) to Foley Square in downtown New York City. SATS represented one aspect of a public-
private partnership focused on developing technology that would enable more people to fly 
directly to their destinations at their own convenience. The ultimate goal of the SATS project 
was for people to be able to access air travel in much the same way that they hail a cab. NASA’s 
SATS Project Manager Jerry N. Hefner described a scenario in which a person would board a 
plane in his or her neighborhood to fly to a destination 500 miles away, without changing planes 
and without going through a hub. Instead, SATS would fly into and out of underused rural and 
suburban airports, reducing congestion at larger airports and easing traffic on interstate highways 
across the country. SATS Project Manager for the FAA Peter C. McHugh commented that those 
involved in the project believed that, as the travel population using SATS aircraft grew, minimal 
interference or intersection with the larger airline system would occur.759 
 
NASA selected Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation of Broomfield, Colorado, to 
develop, manufacture, and provide prelaunch and postlaunch support for the Global Precipitation 
Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument. The total contract value was 
approximately US$100.2 million over a period of seven years and nine months. The GMI, a 
conical-scan microwave radiometer, would fly on the GPM Core spacecraft as part of a 
multinational collaborative effort to measure global precipitation. The spacecraft, which NASA 
had not yet built, would be the first in a constellation of spacecraft deployed under NASA’s 
GPM mission. The GMI instrument would make calibrated, radiometric measurements from 
space at multiple microwave frequencies and polarizations. NASA’s Deputy Associate 
Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate Ghassem R. Asrar remarked that scientists 
need to know the amount and distribution of precipitation worldwide so that they can assess the 
quantity and quality of fresh water resources for food and fiber production, human consumption, 
and other societal needs. Experts in water resource management, agriculture, transportation,

16 March 
The U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing to examine 
NASA’s proposal to reduce spending on aviation research by 20 percent over five years, which 
would necessitate the closure of some wind tunnels and other centers. Overall, the Bush 
administration had proposed a 2.4 percent increase in NASA’s budget, with most of that increase 
directed toward funding travel to the Moon and Mars, initiatives requiring NASA to eliminate or 
reduce its other programs, such as aviation research. NASA’s Associate Administrator for 
Aeronautics Research J. Victor Lebacqz defended the program, remarking that the United States 
remained a global power in aviation and had developed technologies to improve safety, reduce 
environmental impact, and increase efficiency of aviation operations. However, Lebacqz stated 
that NASA needed a clearer vision for the goals of the program. John M. Klineberg, a retired 
NASA official and industry executive, who had headed a National Research Council (NRC) 
study group in 2004, testified before the committee. The NRC study group had published a 
review of NASA’s aeronautics programs. Klineberg warned against using the group’s 
recommendations out of context to justify major cuts in programs. He testified that NASA’s 
proposed aviation-research budget was a disaster, putting the program at risk of becoming 
irrelevant to the future of aeronautics in the United States and throughout the world. In an 
interview following the hearing, Klineberg emphasized that the study group had suggested 
consolidating and focusing programs but did not support budgetary cuts eliminating entire areas 
of research.761 
 
The U.S. Air Force announced the findings of its investigation into the December 2004 inaugural 
launch of Boeing’s Delta 4 Heavy Rocket, which had failed when engines shut down 
prematurely. The Air Force and Boeing had intended the launch of the rocket, which was 
transporting a dummy payload, as a full dress rehearsal. The plan had been to test the newest and 
largest member of Boeing’s next-generation rocket series before critical national security 
satellites began using it. Boeing had designed the rocket with three Common Booster Cores, each 
with a cryogenic main engine. The three cores, secured together, formed a craft capable of 
launching large cargo into space. The investigation had determined that each booster’s engines 
had undergone premature shutdown during the launch, after internal sensors incorrectly 
determined that the engines had exhausted their liquid-oxygen fuel supply. Investigators had 
concluded that cavitationbubbles in the liquid oxygen plumbinghad caused the glitch. Major 
Rodney Houser, the lead investigator for the Air Force, stated that the investigating team would 
focus on determining the cause of the cavitation within the liquid-oxygen feed system and on 
implementing corrective measures to prevent the problem’s repetition.762

17 March 
NASA announced the successful completion of flight tests above a virtual forest fire to evaluate 
new flight-control software on board two small UAVs. The software experiment had sought to 
guide the UAVs simultaneously around obstacles, using principles derived from studies of the 
movements of fish and birds. Engineers and technicians from NASA’s ARC and DFRC had 
conducted the flight tests over a remote area of Edwards Air Force Base in California, to 
investigate cooperative flight strategies for atmospheric sampling and for airborne monitoring 
and surveillance of natural disasters. John E. Melton of ARC, Principal Investigator for the 
Networked UAV Teaming Experiment, explained that his team had used two autopilot-equipped 
APV-3 UAVs, each with a 12-foot wingspan, to flight-test several novel approaches for assisting 
wildfire-suppression crews. The two craft had flown along computer-generated paths to 
demonstrate their ability to avoid obstacles in a cooperative and synchronized manner, without 
the assistance of flight personnel. Melton commented that the technology could eventually 
enable swarms of aircraft to move safely from one area to another as a group, collecting air 
samples on scientific missions or helping ground personnel monitor natural disasters.763 
 
22 March 
NASA announced that the Spitzer Space Telescope had captured the light from two known 
planets that are orbiting stars other than the Sun, enabling scientists to measure and compare 
extrasolar planets directly. This event marked the beginning of a new era in planetary science. 
Previously, scientists had confirmed the existence of extrasolar planets using one of two 
techniques of indirect discoverythe “wobble” technique or the “transit” technique. The wobble 
technique detected the gravitational tug that a planet exerts on its parent star, and the transit 
technique inferred the presence of a planet when the planet passed in front of its star, causing the 
star to dim. Both techniques depended on visible-light telescopes. By contrast, Spitzer observed 
infrared light, enabling astronomers to contrast a planet against the glow of its parent star. If 
detected using the transit technique, the glow of the parent star would have overwhelmed the 
glimmer of light reflected by the planet.764 
 
23 March 
NASA announced findings from research exploring the impact of black carbon or soot on Earth’s 
climate, findings that provided new and additional evidence that pollution generated through the 
process of incomplete combustion contributes to the accelerated melting of sea ice and snow, as 
well as to the changing atmospheric temperatures in the Arctic region. Dorothy M. Koch, of 
Columbia University and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), and James E. 
Hansen, also of GISS, coauthored the study, using satellite data and computer models to recreate 
the climate and to track pollution. In addition to confirming past findings regarding the 
relationship between pollution and climate change in the Arctic region, the study had found that 
most of the pollution in the environment and the atmosphere of the Arctic did not originate in the 
developed world, but rather in southern Asia, which had the highest level of industrial soot 
emissions in the world. Using the GISS General Circulation Model (GCM) to locate the origins 
of Arctic soot, Koch and Hansen had found that one-third of the pollution originated in southern

NASA and its partner the Spaceward Foundation, a publicly funded, nonprofit organization 
dedicated to advancing the cause of space access, announced prizes totaling US$$400,000 for 
four competitions. The competitions would be the first under NASA’s Centennial Challenges 
program, designed to promote technical innovation in support of the Vision for Space 
Exploration and NASA’s goals. The first two competitions, the Tether Challenge and the Beam 
Power Challenge, would challenge innovators to focus on developing lightweight, yet strong, 
tether materials and wireless power transmission technologies. Winners of each of the initial 
2005 challenges would receive a prize of US$50,000. The Tether Challenge would require teams 
to make the strongest tether of a specified diameter. Competing in a tournament-style bracket 
system, the tethers would be stretched until they broke, with the overall winner competing 
against NASA’s “house tether” to win the cash. The Beam Power Challenge would require teams 
to use wireless technology to lift a weight off the ground. NASA planned a second set of Tether 
and Beam Power challenges, with a greater degree of difficulty, for 2006.766 
 
28 March 
ISS Expedition 10 Commander Leroy Chiao and Flight Engineer Salizhan S. Sharipov 
completed the second and final spacewalk of their mission 1 hour ahead of schedule, returning 
into the ISS after 4.5 hours. To help in navigation, Chiao and Sharipov installed a set of space-to-
space antennas around a section of Zvezda, the Russian service module that would aid in the 
docking operations of Europe’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) during a future cargo 
mission. The crew also attached a GPS unit to the Zvezda module to help the ATV. The ATV, 
scheduled to arrive during the next year, had the capability to deliver up to 8.5 tons (7,711 
kilograms or 7.71 tonnes) of cargo, including 10,000 pounds (4,536 kilograms or 4.54 tonnes) of 
propellant. After the crew finished connecting the antennas, Sharipov returned to the Pirs 
docking compartment to retrieve a small satellite called NanoSputnik. The satellite, which 
weighed just 11 pounds (5 kilograms) and measured only 1 foot (0.31 meter) long, carried a 
transmitter designed to test control and orientation systems for small spacecraft during its 100-
day mission. Sharipov released the satellite into a retrograde orbit by hand, while Chiao 
photographed the launch.767

APRIL 2005 
 
5 April 
NASA announced that scientists analyzing images from the its Polar Orbiting Environmental 
Satellite (POES) and from the Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) 
spacecraft had discovered that Earth’s northern and southern auroras are not mirror images of 
each other, as previously thought. Images from the two spacecraft showed that auroras move and 
change, depending on the tilt of Earth’s magnetic field toward the Sun and on solar wind 
conditions. Knowing more about how auroras react to the solar wind could help scientists predict 
space weather. Timothy J. Stubbs of the Laboratory for Extraterrestrial Physics at NASA’s 
GSFC remarked that the analysis was the first to track the locations of the auroras using 
simultaneous observations, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, of the auroras in 
their entirety.768 
 
6 April 
NASA announced that it had approved the extension of operations for the twin Mars Rovers, 
Spirit and Opportunity, for up to 18 months. The robotic craft had already surprised engineers 
and scientists, having completed 11 months of extended activity beyond their successful three-
month primary missions. Opportunity had driven more than three miles since arriving at Mars, 
eight times the distance originally planned, and, in March 2005, had set a new record of 722 feet 
(220 meters) in a single day’s drive. Spirit had driven a shorter distance but was working in a 
much rougher terrain than Opportunity. Both rovers were exhibiting signs of wear and exposure, 
and scientists recognized that either mission could end suddenly because of a random part 
failure. James K. Erickson, Project Manager for the rovers at NASA’s JPL, remarked that, 
despite the wear and the effects of exposure, both rovers remained in exceptional shape. Erickson 
said that NASA would work to get as much benefit as possible for as long as the craft were 
capable of producing worthwhile scientific results. Director of NASA’s Mars Exploration 
Program J. Douglas McCuistion added that the rovers’ successes had strengthened NASA’s 
commitment to achieving the ambitious goals of returning samples from Mars and eventually 
sending a human expedition to the planet.769 
 
7 April 
NASA announced that Space Shuttle Discovery had reached a major milestone, arriving at 
Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s KSC in preparation for its Return to Flight Mission, scheduled for 
15 May. Over more than two years, Discovery had undergone 41 major modifications in 
response to the Columbia accident, including the addition of the new sensor system at the far end 
of the orbiter boom; cameras and laser systems to inspect its thermal protection system while in 
space; sensors in the leading edge of its wings to monitor for debris impacts; and a new digital 
camera for viewing the external tank during launch.770

11 April 
Russian space officials and officials from the French rocket company Arianespace signed an 
agreement in Moscow allowing Russia to launch medium-weight satellite payloads from ESA’s 
spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Under the agreement, Europe would provide 344 million 
euros to build a launchpad for Russian Soyuz rockets, and Russia would erect a tower for the 
launchpad, ship the rockets from Russia, and make any changes to the rockets necessary for them 
to operate in the equatorial climate. Locating launches at the equator would allow Russia to 
increase the weight of its payloads from 1.6 tonnes (1,600 kilograms or 1.7 tons) to about 3 
tonnes (3,000 kilograms or 3.3 tons). The arrangement also filled a niche that Arianespace’s two 
rocket fleets did not. Arianespace Vega rockets launched small scientific satellites weighing no 
more than 1.5 tonnes (1,500 kilograms or 1.65 tons) into a low orbit. The two models of Ariane 5 
rockets could launch payloads weighing 6.6 tonnes (6,600 kilograms or 7.3 tons) or 10 tonnes 
(10,000 kilograms or 11 tons), respectively, into geostationary transfer orbit. Expecting to launch 
three or four Soyuz rockets per year, beginning in 2008, Arianespace had already booked three 
launches from Kourou using the Russian Soyuz rocket―launches of one Australian 
telecommunications satellite and two French scientific satellites.771 
 
12 April 
The Apstar 6 satellite launched aboard a Chinese Long March 3B rocket from Xichang Satellite 
Launch Center in China’s Sichuan Province. The 4.8-tonne (4,800-kilogram or 5.3-ton) satellite 
carried 38 C-band and 12 Ku-band transponders. Replacing the ageing Apstar 1A, the craft 
would provide digital, multimedia transmissions to Australia, India, and countries in eastern 
Asia. The satellite was the first Western-built, commercial telecommunications spacecraft to 
carry almost no U.S.-made components, as well as the first commercial Chinese satellite with an 
antijamming payload. Hong Kong–based APT Satellite Company had requested that Alcatel 
Space include the antijamming technology in response to the threat of satellite-signal piracy, 
which had occurred several times over the previous two years. The new Alcatel Spacebus 4000 
C1 satellite platform selected for Apstar 6 included no U.S. parts subject to the export controls of 
the U.S. Department of State. Because the U.S. government had refused to grant export licenses 
for U.S. satellite parts destined for launch in China, Alcatel Space had substituted European, 
Russian, and other non-U.S. components.772 
 
13 April 
NASA announced that the U.S. Senate had confirmed the nomination of Michael D. Griffin as 
NASA’s 11th Administrator. Griffin replaced Sean O’Keefe, who had resigned in February to 
become Chancellor of Louisiana State University. Since 2004, Griffin had served as the Space 
Department Head at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Baltimore, 
Maryland. Before holding that position, he had served as President and Chief Operating Officer 
of In-Q-Tel and had held several positions within Orbital Sciences Corporation. Earlier in his 
career, he had served as Chief Engineer at NASA and as Deputy for Technology at the Strategic 
Defense Initiative Organization. Griffin held a doctorate in aeronautical engineering and five 
master’s degrees, credentials that had led Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, ranking 
Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees NASA, to introduce Griffin as

the ideal person to lead NASA. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, 
Science and Transportation Committee, Griffin had stated that, as Administrator, he would 
reevaluate NASA’s decision not to send astronauts to repair and service the HST. He had named 
his priorities for NASA, including the Space Shuttles’ safe return to flight. Furthermore, he had 
stated that he planned to speed up NASA’s development of a replacement craft for the Shuttle, so 
that the United States could continue to send humans into space. Griffin had stated that the 
United States’ dependence on other nations to ferry astronauts to space was unacceptable in 
terms of national security. Griffin had also testified that he supported President George W. 
Bush’s Vision for Space Exploration, which included returning humans to the Moon and, 
ultimately, sending human explorers to Mars and beyond.773 
 
14 April 
NASA’s Space Shuttle Program reached another milestone: filling a 154-foot-high (47-meter-
high) external tank with fuel and oxygen. The test, intended to assure engineers that all changes 
to the tank operated as expected, marked the first time since Columbia’s accident that NASA had 
prepared an external tank for flight. The foam was necessary to keep the liquid fuel cool and to 
reduce ice build-up on the tank, but NASA and Lockheed Martin had redesigned the tank to 
reduce the amount of foam debris during launch. Changes to the tank design included removing 
the foam from the bipod ramp and replacing the foam with heaters. The designers had also added 
a “drip-lip” to reduce ice accumulation on the joints that permit the adjustment of the tank’s fuel 
line. In a dress rehearsal for Discovery’s upcoming launch, engineers pumped more than 500,000 
gallons of fuel into the tank, monitoring the tank and the Shuttle’s systems down to the T-minus 
31-second mark in a mock countdown. N. Wayne Hale Jr., Deputy Manager of the Space Shuttle 
Program and Chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team, remarked on the outstanding 
performances of the newly modified external tank, the Shuttle, and the launchpad.774 
 
15 April 
Soyuz TMA-6 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying the Expedition 11 
crew of three to the ISS. Russian Commander Sergei K. Krikalev and American Flight Engineer 
John L. Phillips would replace Leroy Chiao and Salizhan S. Sharipov. Italy’s Roberto Vittori, 
also aboard, would conduct scientific experiments at the ISS before returning to Earth with 
Chiao and Sharipov.775

Pegasus-XL HAPS rocket released from an L-1011 cargo aircraft. NASA intended the launch to 
test the 360-kilogram (793.76-pound or 0.4-ton or 0.36-tonne) satellite’s video-guidance-system 
technology, which would enable DART to rendezvous with an experimental military 
communications satellite and maneuver around it. The technology would allow future spacecraft 
to approach and dock with another craft automatically.776  
 
17 April 
The Soyuz TMA-6 crew arrived at the ISS. After greeting the new arrivals, the Expedition 10 
crew held a safety briefing to familiarize the Expedition 11 crew and Roberto Vittori, the Italian 
astronaut visiting the ISS, with emergency escape procedures. The mission was Commander 
Sergei K. Krikalev’s third long-term space assignment and his second aboard the ISS. Krikalev 
was the first person to serve more than one tour at the station.777 
 
22 April 
NASA announced that it had awarded Rice University’s Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory 
(CNL) an US$11 million contract to produce a prototype power cable constructed of carbon 
nanotubes. The engineers expected the so-called quantum wires to conduct electricity up to 10 
times better than copper, at 1/6th the weight. NASA anticipated that the technology would help 
return humans to the Moon and enable travel to Mars and beyond. Richard E. Smalley, the 
project’s Lead Investigator, explained that the Space Shuttle’s primary power-distribution system 
accounted for almost 7 percent of its weight. However, NASA’s next generation of human and 
robotic spacecraft would need far more power to support additional instrumentation and 
broadband communications, requiring a copper power-distribution system that would account for 
up to 25 percent of the craft’s weight. Under the contract, CNL would provide NASA with a 1-
meter (3.2-foot) prototype of quantum wire by 2010, a task requiring major breakthroughs in the 
production of nanotubes. To date, scientists had succeeded in producing wires no longer than 
several centimeters. At the time NASA awarded the contract, only armchair nanotubesa type 
comprising 2 percent of all nanotubes were suitable for use as quantum wires. Researchers at 
CNL planned to grow these nanotubes like crystals, placing “seeds” in a laboratory reactor and 
pumping in a source of carbon, such as carbon monoxide, with the hope of creating perfect, long 
armchair nanotubes each time. The researchers would then twist the tubes together to produce a 
quantum wire according to NASA’s specifications.778 
 
NASA announced the establishment of the DART Mishap Investigation Board to determine why 
the DART spacecraft had failed to complete its mission on 15 April. Initially, NASA had 
believed that DART had come within 300 feet (91.4 meters) of the target satellite before low fuel 
readings prompted it to abort its mission. However, NASA spokesperson Kimberly D. Newton 
later explained that new data had indicated that DART had bumped the satellite, boosting its 
orbit by as much as 5.75 miles (9.3 kilometers). However, DART had abandoned its target

approximately halfway through its 24-hour mission. The Board consisted of seven voting 
members from NASA’s MSFC, NASA’s GSFC and ARC; the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency; and the U.S. Air Force Space Command. NASA assigned eight federal 
employees to serve as advisors to the Board―six from MSFC, and one each from NASA’s JSC 
and NASA Headquarters. NASA selected Scott D. Croomes of MSFC to chair the Board and 
Kerry L. Remp of GRC to serve ex officio, to assure that board activity conformed to NASA’s 
procedural requirements.779  
 
24 April 
The Expedition 10 crew, American astronaut Leroy Chiao and Russian cosmonaut Salizhan S. 
Sharipov, returned to Earth from the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-5 after almost 193 days in space. 
Together with Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori, who had conducted scientific experiments at the 
ISS after his arrival on 17 April with Expedition 11, the crew landed on target in north-central 
Kazakhstan. Although the crew and recovery team encountered no major problems, weeks of 
heavy snow and rain had caused flooding in the steppes, complicating the recovery. Only three 
of the 10 recovery helicopters were able to land in the wet conditions. During their mission, 
Chiao and Sharipov had maintained ISS systems and conducted scientific research. They had 
replaced critical hardware in the Joint Quest Airlock, repaired U.S. spacesuits, completed two 
spacewalks to prepare the ISS for the arrival of a new European cargo spacecraft during the next 
year, and submitted a scientific research paper on the use of ultrasound in space. Chiao had voted 
in the U.S. presidential election the previous November, the first astronaut to do so in space. 
Vittori had spent 10 days in space, eight of them aboard the ISS, and had performed 22 
experiments, including tests of astronaut fatigue, research on the durability of components of 
microsatellites, research into the electromagnetic waves that emanate from Earth and may be 
related to earthquakes, and experiments growing shoots as a potential food source for people in 
orbit.780 
 
25 April 
NASA celebrated the HST’s 15th anniversary with the release of new images of the Eagle 
Nebula and the Whirlpool galaxy (spiral galaxy M51), two of the most well-known objects that 
the Hubble had observed to date. The new images, made with the HST’s newest camera, the 
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), were among the largest and sharpest the Hubble had yet 
captured, so sharp that, even if enlarged to billboard size, the image would preserve the stunning 
details. The new image of the Eagle Nebula revealed ultraviolet light originating from a group of 
massive hot stars and sculpting a tall, dense tower of gas. The new image of the Whirlpool 
galaxy, in addition to displaying its classic features, revealed a companion galaxy located at the

end of one of the Whirlpool galaxy’s arms. The launch of the HST in 1990 had ushered in a new 
era in astronomy. Before the existence of the HST, no telescope had viewed the universe in 
visible light from above Earth’s atmosphere, which blurs light and causes images to appear 
fuzzy. Among its many achievements, the HST had helped astronomers calculate the precise age 
of the universe; helped confirm the existence of dark energy; detected small protogalaxies; 
proved the existence of supermassive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting 
Jupiter; and demonstrated that the process of planetary system formation is common throughout 
the galaxy.781 
 
NASA announced the establishment of the Exploration Systems Advisory Committee (ESAC), 
composed of leading experts from government, academia, and industry. NASA named Lester L. 
Lyles, a former commander of the U.S. Air Force Materiel Command to chair ESAC. Lyles had 
extensive experience managing large, high-technology organizations involving aeronautical and 
astronautical research, development, acquisition, and logistics. The committee would provide 
advice and recommendations to NASA’s Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems, 
including input regarding plans, policies, programs, and other matters pertinent to the 
directorate’s responsibilities.782  
 
26 April 
Spaceway 1, a DirecTV satellite, launched from Sea Launch’s Odyssey floating platform at the 
equator aboard a Zenit-3SL rocket. Sea Launch used a self-propelled launch platform and a 
command ship that had sailed from Long Beach, California, to the equator. At the equator, the 
physics of Earth’s rotation make it possible to launch heavier payloads than elsewhere. Sea 
Launch announced that the 13,376-pound (6,067.3-kilogram or 6.1-tonne) satellite was the 
heaviest commercial satellite ever launched.783 
 
27 April 
NASA announced that on 25 April its Deep Impact spacecraft had successfully photographed 
comet Tempel 1, Deep Impact’s target destination. The craft’s Medium Resolution Instrument 
had captured the image on its first attempt. The image was the first of thousands that NASA 
planned for the craft to capture over the following 10 weeks. The images would aid Deep 
Impact’s navigators, engineers, and scientists, as they plotted the craft’s final trajectory toward 
its encounter with Tempel 1, scheduled for 4 July.784 
 
30 April 
USA 182, a National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) classified military satellite, launched atop a 
Titan 4B rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida. The rocket was the last Titan to 
launch from the Florida coast, signaling the end of the historic program after five decades and 
168 launches. Only one Titan remained, scheduled for a July launch from Edwards Air Force

Base in California. The United States was retiring the Titan, which had begun as a two-stage 
intercontinental ballistic missile in the 1950s and had made its first launch from Cape Canaveral 
in 1959, in favor of the less-expensive and more modular Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rocket series, 
which could fulfill the need for heavy-lifting to space. Titan 2 missiles had served as the boosters 
for NASA’s Gemini missions, and various Titan 3 and Titan 34D rockets had launched satellites, 
as had Titan 4, the largest and most powerful version in the program. Titan rockets had also 
launched space probes―Viking to Mars, Voyager to the outer planets, and Cassini to Saturn.785

2 May 
Lockheed Martin and the Boeing Company announced the formation of a joint venture called 
United Launch Alliance, combining the production, engineering, testing, and launch operations 
associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Martin Atlas rockets. 
The merger ended a two-year legal battle between the two largest government contractors, in 
which Lockheed Martin had accused Boeing of cheating to win rocket-launch work. The venture 
eliminated market competition for launching weather satellites for NOAA, scientific satellites for 
NASA, spy satellites for the National Security Agency, and communications satellites for the 
U.S. Air Force. According to the agreement, the joint venture would produce both Boeing’s 
Delta and Lockheed’s Atlas rockets, consolidating production at Boeing’s Decatur, Alabama, 
facility. Lockheed’s Denver, Colorado, office would serve as headquarters, housing the 
engineering and administrative functions. Lockheed Martin’s Vice President of Financial 
Strategies Jeffrey D. MacLauchlan remarked that the preservation of the two separate rocket 
families was the crux of the venture’s appeal to the federal government.786  
 
3 May 
The National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) in Hampton, Virginia, released a report commissioned 
by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, which had 
concluded that, to keep pace with Europe, the U.S. government would need to spend more on 
aeronautics, not less. The report, “Responding to the Call: Aviation Plan for American 
Leadership,” recommended that, over the next five years, the U.S. government should restore 
NASA’s aeronautics funding to 1998 levels, a goal that implied a spending level approximately 
twice that of President George W. Bush’s proposal for FY 2006. The study team comprised more 
than 250 of the nation’s top aviation experts representing industry and academia. NIA President 
and Executive Director Robert Lindberg remarked that the United State’s aviation capabilities 
had eroded, despite the position of aviation as a critical component in the U.S. balance of trade. 
The report of more than 1,000 pages provided detailed investment plans, budgets, and needs 
assessments for seven aeronautics sectors: airspace systems, aviation safety and security,

After a delay of more than one year, ESA’s Mars Express deployed the first of three booms that 
form the craft’s Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS). The 
MARSIS booms would search for evidence of water under the surface of Mars. The deployment 
marked the beginning of a 10-day sequence, originally scheduled for April 2004. NASA’s JPL 
had conducted an investigation that had warned of the possibility that one or more of the antenna 
components could swing back and hit the spacecraft, a risk that had caused ESA to delay the 
deployment. Although an ESA review board had concluded that, even if such an event were to 
occur, the risk of damaging Mars Express remained low, scientists had voiced concerns that a 
strike from any of the booms could damage delicate instruments on board the orbiter. According 
to Mars Express Mission Manager Fred Jansen, engineers had analyzed the problem over the 
past year to assure themselves that any existing risks would not affect the spacecraft. As 
deployment commenced, telemetry data indicated that the first boom, which formed half of 
MARSIS’s primary antenna, had deployed successfully. ESA had scheduled the second half of 
the antenna to deploy four days later.788 
 
5 May 
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched its Cartosat-1 Earth-
mapping and remote-sensing satellite aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle-C6 (PSLV-C6) 
from the newly built launchpad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, 
India. The 1.56-tonne (1,560-kilogram or 1.72-ton) Cartosat-1, the heaviest payload that the 
PSLV had ever ferried to space, carried two f/4.5 Panchromatic cameras, which together would 
enable the production of a stereoscopic image at a resolution of 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). ISRO 
planned to use the images to generate digital terrain-elevation maps, which would aid in 
assessing and monitoring land use, forest cover, and river flow. The launch vehicle also carried 
into orbit HAMSat, a 43-kilogram (0.043-tonne or 0.047-ton) microsatellite designed to relay 
amateur VHF radio communications.789 
 
6 May 
Alliant Techsystems announced the successful completion of the first in a series of ground tests 
for solar-sail technology, developed to enable solar-powered interplanetary probes and solar 
observatories. At NASA’s GRC’s Plum Brook Station in Ohio, NASA engineers fully deployed 
a 20 x 20 meter (65.6 x 65.6 feet) version of the solar-sail system, in a 100-foot-diameter (30.5-
meter-diameter) vacuum chamber, to test the system’s functional deployment and attitude 
control. The test marked a critical milestone in the development of in-space propulsion 
technology using the Sun’s energy, instead of fuel propellant, to provide thrust. The In-Space

9 May 
NASA launched a 40 million-cubic-foot (12.2 million-cubic-meter) balloon, the Deep Space Test 
Bed facility, from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, carrying an automobile-sized aluminum gondola 
containing scientific experiments prepared by university and elementary school students. NASA 
had collaborated with the students to carry out research to analyze characteristics of Earth’s 
atmosphere from the unique laboratory traveling 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) above Earth. The 
primary payload was the High Energy Replicated Optics (HERO), a hard x-ray–focusing 
telescope. Engineers from NASA’s MSFC had designed HERO to create images from high-
energy x-ray light. Undergraduate students from Pennsylvania State University, Montana State 
University, the University of Alabama, and Auburn University in Alabama had prepared 
experiments for the new laboratory. The experiments would identify pollution-related aerosols in 
the atmosphere, measure radiation and its impact on the integrity and behavior of the balloon, 
measure the external temperature of the balloon material, and gather magnetic-field data. 
Students from eight grade schools had prepared experiments to observe the effect of the flight 
environment on microscopic organisms and seeds, placing their experiments in brick-size plastic 
containers inside two large containers on board the balloon.791 
 
12 May 
NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin, who had been in his new position for only one month, 
appeared as the sole witness before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Justice, and Science, to testify regarding NASA’s FY 2006 budget request. Key issues that the 
panel discussed with Griffin included several related to the Space Shuttle Program: the four-year 
gap between the planned decommissioning of the Space Shuttle in 2010 and the first scheduled 
flight of the new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) in 2014; the United States’ obligation to 
complete the ISS before the retirement of the Space Shuttle; and servicing the HST. In his 
responses, Griffin stated that, in mid-July, he would release a plan for the first flight of the new 
CEV. He suggested that, if the ISS partners postponed some scheduled on-board scientific 
research, they could complete the ISS before the Shuttle’s retirement, without cancelling any 
research programs. Regarding the HST, Griffin stated his opposition to a robotic servicing 
mission and said that he wished to assess the first two Shuttle flights before making a decision. 
The panel also discussed recommended cuts in Earth Science research. Griffin responded that 
NASA had listened to the concerns of the scientific community and was reexamining that area. 
Griffin clarified that NASA would not cut science programs to fund the spaceflight program.792

to make spaceflight available to the public within two years. Canadian Arrow was creating a 
rocket based on the German World War II V-2 rocket. Although the company had not completed 
its rocket in time to compete for the US$10 million X Prize in 2004, it had successfully 
completed a drop test of the vehicle in August 2005 and expected to complete the rocket within 
one year. PlanetSpace planned to charge US$250,000 per person for a suborbital flight that 
would include 14 days of training and 15 minutes of flight time. The rocket would launch from a 
Canadian site with a pilot and two passengers and would reach a maximum velocity of four times 
the speed of sound. The rocket would coast to a maximum height of 70 miles (112 kilometers), 
providing a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of the curving Earth with a black sky 
above. Finally, a crew capsule would separate from the rocket during its descent and would 
parachute down to a water landing.793 
 
19 May 
NASA’s JPL released a series of images that Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had captured on 20 
and 21 April, which showed, for the first time, NASA’s Mars Odyssey and ESA’s Mars Express 
spacecraft orbiting Mars. MGS had orbited the planet since 1997, Mars Odyssey had arrived in 
2001, and Mars Express had arrived in late 2003. MGS and Mars Odyssey followed similar near-
polar orbits, sometimes passing within 9 miles (15 kilometers) of each other, but Odyssey orbited 
higher than MGS to prevent collision. MGS had captured two images of Odyssey 7.5 seconds 
apartthe first from a distance of 56 miles (90 kilometers) and the second from 84 miles (135 
kilometers). The following day, MGS had captured an image of Mars Express from a distance of 
155 miles (249 kilometers).794 
 
NASA and the Florida Space Research Institute (FSRI) announced the third Centennial 
Challenges competition: the Moon Regolith Oxygen (MoonROx) challenge. The MoonROx 
challenge would require teams to develop hardware, within mass and power limits, able to 
extract a minimum of 5 kilograms (0.005 tonnes or 0.006 tons) of breathable oxygen from 
simulated lunar soila volcanic ash called JSC-1within a period of 8 hours. The first team to 
accomplish the oxygen-production goal before June 2008 would win US$250,000. Existing 
state-of-the-art technologies were incapable of extracting oxygen from simulated lunar soil. FSRI 
Executive Director Samuel T. Durrance remarked that oxygen-extraction technologies would be 
critical for robotic and human missions to the Moon.795

NASA launched a new environmental satellite for NOAA, aboard a Boeing Delta 2 7320-10 
expendable launch vehicle, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The NOAA-18 (N), 
the fourth in the series of five Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) carrying improved

also carried instruments used in COSPAS-SARSAT, the international Search-and-Rescue 
Satellite-Aided Tracking System (COSPAS is the Russian acronym for “Cosmicheskaya Sistema 
Poiska Avariynyh Sudo,” which means “Space System for the Search of Vessels in Distress”).

21 May 
A California Launch Vehicle Education Initiative (CALVEIN) research team successfully 
launched and recovered the Prospector 6 (P6) test vehicle at the Mojave Test Area owned and 
operated by the Reaction Research Society. The test was part of a joint industry/academic effort 
to develop a low-cost Nanosat Launch Vehicle, a booster capable of delivering 22-pound (10-
kilogram) payloads to low Earth orbit. Researchers at Garvey Spacecraft Corporation of Long 
Beach, California, and California State University at Long Beach had designed and built the 
partially reusable 27-foot (8-meter) P6 test vehicle, which had flown to just under 3,000 feet 
(914 meters), a milestone toward the team’s goal. P6 had also carried student payloads from 
across the country: a mini-DV camera to capture on-board video of the entire flight sequence; a 
real-time telemetry system that adapted off-the-shelf Wi-Fi technology to relay key propulsion-
system parameters; and a measurement-logging package to record acceleration, pressure, and 
temperature data that the research team would use to assess the vehicle’s performance.797 
 
23 May 
NASA announced results of the Cassini probe’s first radio occultation observations of Saturn’s 
rings, atmosphere, and ionosphere, which had taken place on 3 May. Scientists had labeled the 
seven main rings in the order of discovery; however, from the planet outward, the rings are 
labeled D, C, B, A, F, G, and E. During the experiment, Cassini had been 
occulted―hidden―behind the planet’s rings. The craft had simultaneously transmitted Ka, X, 
and S, three radio signals of different frequencies―the first occultation experiment to do so. 
NASA’s ground-based Deep Space Network had received the signals, but their passage through 
Saturn’s ring material had affected their strength―the denser the ring, the weaker the signal. 
Cassini’s radio signals had revealed Saturn’s ring structure with clarity never before seen, in 
particular the structure of ring B, which had eluded previous robotic explorers. Cassini had 
revealed ring B’s composition as a thick, 5,000-kilometer-wide (3,100-mile-wide) core, 
containing several bands of material nearly 4 times as dense as that found in ring A, and nearly 
20 times as dense as ring C. Cassini had also shown that the structure of ring B varies 
dramatically, contrasting sharply with the relatively flat structure of ring A and the wavy 
structure of ring C.798

24 May 
NASA announced that scientists had finally agreed that Voyager 1, launched in 1977, had 
reached the solar system’s final frontier, passed through the termination shock region―the point 
at the edge of the solar system where the solar wind slows abruptly, and entered the 
heliosheath―a frontier of unknown thickness defining the border with interstellar space. In 
November 2003, the Voyager team had announced unusual events in the mission’s history, 
signaling that Voyager 1 had reached the edge of the solar system. However, scientists disagreed 
as to whether the craft had actually encountered termination shock or was merely approaching 
the region at the edge of interstellar space. NASA explained that scientists had based the 
evidence that Voyager 1 had encountered termination shock on the craft’s measurement of a 
sudden increase in the strength of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind, combined with an 
inferred decrease in speed, which happens when the solar wind slows down. Additionally, 
Voyager had observed an increase in the number of high-speed, electrically charged electrons 
and ions, as well as a burst of plasma-wave noise, which scientists had expected to occur when 
Voyager 1 passed the termination shock. Eric Christian, Discipline Scientist for the Sun-Solar 
System Connection Research Program at NASA Headquarters, remarked that Voyager’s 
observations over the past few years had shown that termination shock is far more complicated 
than previously thought. When Voyager 1 entered the heliosheath, the craft was 8.7 billion miles 
(14 kilometers) away from Earth, the farthest any human-made object had traveled.799 
 
25 May 
Khrunichev Center announced that it had signed a contract with Russia’s defense ministry, valid 
through 2010, to research, develop, and flight-test the Angara launch vehicle. The Angara project 
included a series of liquid oxygen/kerosene expendable launch vehicles. The Khrunichev Center 
intended for Angara 5 to have greater capabilities than the company’s existing Proton rocket and 
to be far more environmentally friendly. In addition, the Angara 5 would launch exclusively 
from Plesetsk, rather than from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. According to the 
contract, near the end of 2006, the Khrunichev Center would launch the first vehicle carrying a 
Russian government payload.800  
 
26 May 
NASA returned Discovery to the Vehicle Assembly Building from its launchpad, to attach a 
newer fuel tank and booster set to the Space Shuttle. While Discovery was sitting on the 
launchpad, NASA had determined that ice could break off the outside of its external fuel tank 
and could prove as lethal as the falling foam insulation that had led to the demise of Columbia. 
To minimize the risk of such debris striking the orbiter’s fragile heat shield, NASA had decided 
to install an additional heater on the fuel tank. Ice forms on the external tank when the fuel is 
extremely cold, and a heater would reduce the amount of ice build-up on the tank.801

France and the United States agreed to establish a Space Shuttle landing site in southern France. 
NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin and French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte signed the 
agreement, which covered NASA’s Space Shuttle support for the ISS. Under the agreement, 
France would permit Shuttles encountering problems during launch to land at Istres Air Base 
125, near Marseilles, and allow the U.S. government to conduct additional support activities for 
Space Shuttles on French soil, such as weather monitoring and search-and-rescue operations.802

The Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG) provided an update on NASA’s efforts 
to comply with the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s (the CAIB’s) recommended safety 
and operational practices for Shuttle launches. The Task Group stated that it had approved 
NASA’s efforts regarding five of the CAIB’s critical recommendations, bringing the total 
number of CAIB recommendations with which NASA had complied to 12. Among the five 
recommendations that NASA had implemented were the installation of cameras on the Shuttle to 
observe critical events and steps to ensure that budgetary issues and other outside pressures 
would not influence flight schedules in the future. The Task Group stated further that, although 
NASA had not yet complied with three of the CAIB recommendations, it saw no circumstances 
that might prevent NASA’s planned launch of Space Shuttle Discovery in July 2005. The three 
CAIB recommendations that NASA had not yet implemented were establishing in-orbit repair 
techniques for the orbiter, preventing catastrophic debris from falling off the orbiter’s fuel tank 
during launch, and fortifying the orbiter against debris impacts.803 
 
13 June 
Scientists announced that they had found the most Earth-like planet ever before observed. 
Experts described the discovery as a milestone in efforts to find extraterrestrial life. Scientists led 
by Eugenio J. Rivera of the University of California, Santa Cruz, had discovered the planet, 
called GJ 876 d, orbiting the star GJ 876, which is 15 light-years from Earth. The planet, with a 
mass seven times that of Earth, is mostly composed of silicates, iron, and nickel―compositional 
matter more similar to that of Earth than the material of any other planet yet discovered. 
However, the planet is unlikely to support life, because estimated temperatures on the side of the 
planet facing the star are around 400° to 700°F―temperatures too hot for liquid water. Experts 
described the scientists’ method of discovering the planet as a significant demonstration of the 
state-of-the art technologies for finding exoplanets―planets outside the solar system―that are as 
small as Earth. The scientists had used a spectrometer to discover GJ 876d, which is the smallest 
exoplanet yet found. Using the spectrometer had enabled them to observe changes in the 
exoplanet’s reflected light. They had used the data to measure the planet’s gravitational effects 
on the movements of its accompanying star.804

The spacecraft’s sponsors, the Planetary Society and Cosmos Studios, are U.S. nonprofit 
organizations that seek to increase the public’s knowledge of and involvement in space 
exploration. The late American scientist Carl Sagan had helped found the Planetary Society, and 
Ann Druyan―Sagan’s widow―had founded Cosmos Studios. The two organizations had 
designed the craft and launched the mission to demonstrate the feasibility of solar power 
technology as an effective means of space travel. The pressure of solar light 
particles―photons―on the spacecraft’s large, triangular, mirror-like “solar sails” were to propel 
the engineless, fuel-free Cosmos 1.806 
 
22 June 
The Russian Space Agency announced that the launch of Cosmos 1 had failed. According to the 
agency, the rocket that had launched the spacecraft had experienced failure 83 seconds after 
ignition. Consequently, the experimental solar-powered spacecraft had crashed soon after its 
launch.807 
 
During its 179th meeting, held at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, 
the ESA Council elected Sigmar Wittig as its Chair, effective 1 July 2005. Wittig, head of the 
German delegation to ESA and the Chair of the Executive Board of the German Aerospace 
Center (Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt), replaced Per Tegnér of Sweden, whose 
term of office was ending on 30 June 2005. The ESA Council is ESA’s governing body and 
provides policy guidelines for ESA’s space programs.808

The American Academy of Arts and Sciences released “United States Space Policy: Challenges 
and Opportunities,” a research paper highly critical of the Vision for Space Exploration. In the 
paper, former Director of NASA’s JSC George W. S. Abbey and former White House science 
advisor Neal F. Lane stated that the Vision for Space Exploration does not address major 
obstacles to the United States’ progress in space exploration and science. Those problems 
include predicted shortfalls in the U.S. engineering and science workforce and declining 
international cooperation on existing and planned space missions. Abbey and Lane also stated 
that the United States would be unlikely to realize the Vision’s objectives because of the 
diminishing U.S. commitment to the country’s commercial space industry and the declining role 
of basic science in the U.S. space program and in the national economy. NASA officials did not 
comment on the paper, stating that they had not yet seen it.809 
 
NASA-funded physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had 
created the first superfluid, a form of matter that flows without internal mechanical resistance or 
viscosity. The scientists had created the superfluid by cooling a gas of lithium atoms to nearly 
absolute zero (approximately -459°F), applying a magnetic field, to get the atoms of the gas to 
form pairs without creating molecules, and then using a laser to stir the gas. The last step 
produced vortexes―or microscopic whirlpools―throughout the resulting fluid. The vortexes 
provided conclusive evidence of superfluidity because, whereas rotating a container of normal 
fluid causes the fluid to spin, rotating a container of superfluid does not cause the frictionless 
superfluid to spin but, instead, produces vortexes in the superfluid that continue to spin as long as 
the fluid remains a superfluid. Experts described the research as a major breakthrough in physics. 
The findings could lead to the development of products such as room-temperature 
superconductors, which could help in other applications, such as transporting energy and 
assisting in medical diagnostics.810 
 
27 June 
The Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG) announced that it considered the Space 
Shuttle Discovery safe enough to fly again, even though NASA had not undertaken some steps 
recommended by the CAIB to ensure the Shuttle’s safe launch. NASA had planned to launch 
Discovery as the first Shuttle flight since the Columbia accident in 2003 and had established the 
Task Group to review NASA’s compliance with the CAIB’s critical recommendations. Task 
Group members stated that, although NASA had not complied with all of the CAIB’s 15 critical 
recommendations, the Space Shuttle was ready to resume flight, and NASA was responsible for 
making the final decision to launch the Shuttle. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin was 
unclear about how the Task Group’s findings would influence Shuttle launch plans.811

The House Committee on Science held a hearing entitled The Future of NASA in preparation for 
a subcommittee to consider, on the following day, legislation reauthorizing NASA’s aeronautics, 
human spaceflight, and science programs through FY 2006 (H.R. 3070). President George W. 
Bush had requested US$16.5 billion in funding for NASA for FY 2006. NASA Administrator 
Michael D. Griffin provided testimony to the committee about NASA’s intentions regarding 
issues contained in the President’s budget request, including NASA’s plans for human and 
robotic space exploration, the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), and Space Shuttle safety. 
Griffin told the committee that, despite the fact that NASA had not yet complied with all 15 of 
the CAIB’s critical recommendations, NASA was preparing to launch Shuttle Discovery on 13 
July 2005, pending the results of NASA’s own inspection. Furthermore, Griffin discussed 
President Bush’s intention to amend the Iran Nonproliferation Act, which had effectively 
prevented NASA from purchasing or bartering for space on Russian spacecraft. The amendment 
of the act would permit NASA to send astronauts to the ISS after April 2006.812 
 
30 June 
An international group of astronomers led by Debra A. Fischer of San Francisco State University 
announced that they had discovered the largest solid core yet found in an exoplanet. The planet, 
called HD 149026b, has a solid core that is approximately 70 times larger than Earth’s mass. The 
discovery was the first observational evidence of the core accretion theory of planetary 
formation, which posits that planets begin as small rock-ice cores and acquire additional mass 
through gravitational attraction of gas and other matter. The competing gravitational instability 
theory holds that planetary formation occurs after the rapid gravitational collapse of large gas 
clouds. Fischer and the other astronomers reported that they had determined that the mechanism 
of gravitational instability was unlikely to have produced the large, rocky core of HD 
149026b.813

NASA’s Deep Impact spacecraft, created to analyze the comet Tempel 1, successfully completed 
a planned crash into Tempel 1, becoming the first mission to probe beneath the surface of a 
comet. Astronomers believe that analyzing comets can help them better understand the solar 
system’s formation and evolution, because comets are composed of materials from distant 
regions of the solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago. The Deep Impact 
spacecraft―one of a series of low-cost space science ventures developed under the NASA 
Discovery Mission―consisted of two vehicles: an impactor and a flyby vehicle. NASA had 
designed the impactor to crash into Tempel 1, thereby exposing the comet’s internal material, 
and to capture images of the comet until just seconds before impact. NASA intended the flyby 
vehicle to capture images of Tempel 1’s substrata, the internal material of the comet that the

NASA scientists announced the first measurements ever taken of changes in sea level that were 
unrelated to changes in land height. Although researchers believed that rising sea levels were 
related to global warming, they were unsure of how much sea levels had changed, the degree to 
which sea-level changes were attributable to upward and downward land movements, and the 
causes of those changes. However, using data from numerous satellites, NASA scientists had 
discovered that global sea levels had increased during the previous 50 years, at an estimated rate 
of 1.8 millimeters (0.07 inches) annually, and that the rate of increase had accelerated to 3 
millimeters (0.12 inches) annually in the previous 12 years. The scientists attributed half of the 
rise in sea levels to the expansion of water from warmer ocean temperatures and the remainder to 
various other sources, such as the melting of ice covers in Antarctica, Greenland, and 
elsewhere.815

JAXA launched its Suzaku astronomy satellite at 3:30 a.m. (GMT) from Uchinoura Space Center 
(formerly called the Kagoshima Space Center) on an M-5 rocket. Suzaku, known as Astro-E2 
before the launch, was JAXA’s replacement for its first Astro-E satellite, which had been lost 
during launch in 2000. JAXA and the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science had 
built the satellite to monitor space in conjunction with NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and 
ESA’s XMM-Newton. The Suzaku satellite was equipped with three telescopes: a Hard X-ray 
Detector, an X-ray Spectrometer, and an X-ray Imaging Spectrometer.816 
 
14 July 
Maciej Konacki of the California Institute of Technology reported the first discovery of a planet 
occupying an orbit among three stars. The planet, dubbed HD 188753, has a mass that is slightly 
larger than Jupiter. HD 188753 closely orbits a primary star, along with a pair of similarly sized 
stars. According to scientists, Konacki’s findings challenged conventional scientific 
understanding of the architecture of planetary systems. Scientists had believed that other 
planetary systems have a structure like Earth’s solar system, in which only planets―and not 
stars―orbit a star. Konacki’s research cast doubt on conventional theories of planetary system 
development, because his findings provided the first evidence that a planet could develop and 
survive in a gravitationally complex stellar system. According to conventional scientific theory, 
HD 188753’s two companion stars would have burned away the primary star’s surrounding gas 
and dust, which would have provided the materials to form the new planet. In addition, although 
other existing theories had suggested that a planet of HD 188753’s size could have migrated to 
the massive star from elsewhere, those theories had posited incorrectly that the secondary pair of

Researchers at NASA’s GRC successfully tested a new type of fire detector, which could 
significantly reduce false alarms in the baggage and cargo compartments of commercial aircraft. 
Whereas most fire detectors only detect smoke particles, the GRC-developed sensor 
system―called the MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS)―could compare gas 
concentrations and smoke-particle dimensions in the environment to those commonly found in 
fires. The MEMS was equipped with carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide sensors, a smoke-
particle detector, and integrated software, elements that, collectively, rendered it less vulnerable 
to false alarms than smoke-sensing detectors, which can give false alarms when sensing dust and 
other airborne particles. According to the FAA, the ratio of false alarms to actual fires on aircraft 
was around 100 to 1.818 
 
26 July 
NASA’s Space Shuttle Discovery lifted off from NASA’s KSC in Florida at 10:39 a.m. (EDT) in 
NASA’s first Space Shuttle launch since the February 2003 Columbia tragedy. Although 
officially designated STS-114, NASA had frequently referred to the Discovery mission as the 
Return to Flight Mission. In addition, STS-114 was the first step toward implementation of the 
Vision for Space Exploration, the U.S. space policy calling for human and robotic missions to 
the Moon, Mars, and other planets in the solar system. The primary objectives of STS-114 were 
to test and evaluate new safety procedures at the ISS and to conduct construction and 
maintenance tasks at the ISS. Mission crew members were Commander Eileen M. Collins, Pilot 
James M. Kelly, Mission Specialists Charles J. Camarda, Wendy B. Lawrence, Stephen K. 
Robinson, and Andrew S. W. Thomas, and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi, also a Mission 
Specialist.819

NASA announced that it would once again ground the Space Shuttle fleet, because mission 
personnel had discovered that Shuttle Discovery had experienced a problem similar to the one 
that had fatally damaged Columbia. Specifically, analysts had discovered that, during launch, 
Discovery’s external fuel tank had shed portions of foam insulation. At least one of the pieces of 
insulation had come from the same area of the tank as the foam that had ended the Columbia 
mission. Although the problem did not affect Discovery’s launch, the Shuttle’s crew had spent 
much of their first full day in orbit closely examining the orbiter’s exterior to determine the 
extent of the problem.820

A group of astronomers led by Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology 
announced the discovery of a new planet in the solar system. The scientists had temporarily 
called the planet 2003 UB313 until the International Astronomic Union could formally approve 
the name that the scientists had proposed, but had not yet disclosed to the public. Although the 
scientists did not yet know the planet’s exact size, they believed it was larger than Pluto, which 
astronomers estimate is 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) in diameter. In addition, the newly 
discovered planet, which the scientists believed to be composed of rock and ice, was the furthest 
known object in the solar system, with a 560-year elliptical orbit around the Sun at distances 
ranging from 3.3 to 9 billion miles (5.3 to 14 billion kilometers) from the Sun. By comparison, 
Pluto’s orbit ranges from 2.7 to 4.6 billion miles (4.3 to 7.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun. The 
astronomers had also discovered that the orbit of 2003 UB313 is quite different from that of most 
planets in the solar system―it possesses an orbit skewed at an angle 44º from Earth’s orbit, 
whereas most planets orbit in planes that are close to that of Earth.821

Space Shuttle Discovery astronauts, Stephen K. Robinson of NASA and Soichi Noguchi of 
JAXA, completed a spacewalk during which they tested new prototype methods to repair heat-
resistant tiles on the orbiter’s exterior. Robinson applied an experimental compound inside 
cracks in damaged panels, and Noguchi applied a thick, dark-colored paint to thermal protection 
tiles, to replace cracked or missing black surface coatings. NASA had developed the repair 
techniques in response to recommendations from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. 
During the spacewalk, the two astronauts also performed several tasks to upgrade the ISS, such 
as replacing a broken GPS antenna and installing a bracket designed to hold a toolbox and parts 
kit for use during future spacewalks.822

1 August 
Space Shuttle Discovery astronauts Soichi Noguchi of JAXA and Stephen K. Robinson of NASA 
performed the second of three scheduled spacewalks for STS-114. The two astronauts conducted 
tests on materials designed to service the orbiter’s heat-shielding tiles and replaced a 600-pound 
(272.2-kilogram) gyroscope on the exterior of the ISS. The device was one of four gyroscopes 
that help maintain the station’s orientation in space.823

was to remove two pieces of protruding heat shielding―called gap fillers―from the bottom of 
the orbiter. NASA was concerned that the fillers might add extra heat to the orbiter’s heat-
shielding tiles upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, thereby threatening the mission. Astronauts 
James M. Kelly and Wendy B. Lawrence used the robotic arms of the Shuttle and those of the 
ISS to lower Robinson to the underside of Discovery, while Noguchi monitored the operation. 
Despite concerns that Robinson might lose communication with the other astronauts, the 
operation was a success. The maneuver was the first time that an astronaut had worked on the 
underside of an orbiter while in space. During the spacewalk, Noguchi and Robinson also 
installed an external stowage platform and a new iteration of an experiment to test materials in 
the environment of space.824 
 
Astronomers using NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) detected, for the first time, a large 
population of black holes known as type-2 quasars. Quasars―supermassive black holes―are the 
universe’s brightest objects. Although scientists had observed the light from type-1 quasars, they 
had never before been able to detect type-2 quasars because, despite the brightness of type-2 
quasars, the gas and dust rings that surround them obscure the quasars’ visible light and block 
their emission of x-rays. Space telescopes and other scientific instruments rely on x-ray 
emissions to detect and to analyze these celestial phenomena. However, Alejo Martínez-Sansigre 
of the University of Oxford led a team of astronomers who used the SST to detect infrared light 
emitted by type-2 quasars, thereby capturing evidence of 21 quasars. The research also indicated 
that the growth of black holes has been concentrated in obscure regions of the universe and has 
tended to occur in the cores of forming galaxies during brief, highly productive periods. The new 
data suggested that thousands more such quasars might exist in the universe.825 
 
9 August 
The Space Shuttle Discovery returned to Earth, landing at California’s Edwards Air Force Base 
at 5:11 a.m. (PDT). The mission―officially designated STS-114―was NASA’s first Shuttle 
mission since the February 2003 loss of Columbia. The Shuttle’s successful reentry was 
particularly important, because the Columbia accident had occurred during the reentry phase of 
its mission. The mission’s primary objectives were to test and evaluate new safety procedures for 
Shuttle missions and to continue construction and maintenance of the ISS. Soichi Noguchi and 
Stephen K. Robinson had performed some of the ISS and Shuttle maintenance tasks during three 
spacewalks on 30 July, 1 August, and 3 August. The total duration of STS-114 was 13 days, 21 
hours, and 32 minutes.826

NASA launched its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) at 7:43 a.m. (EDT) from Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on an Atlas 5 launch vehicle. The occasion marked the 
first time that NASA had used an Atlas 5 to launch an interplanetary mission. NASA had 
designed the MRO to conduct highly detailed analyses of Mars’s atmosphere, surface, and

subsurface. From low orbit, the MRO would evaluate landing sites for future Mars missions and 
search for sites where water might have previously existed. NASA planned to examine the MRO 
data to seek evidence of previous life on the planet and to study planetary climate change. After 
two years of gathering data, the MRO would relay the information to Earth, using two robotic 
probes scheduled to arrive on Mars in 2008 and 2010.827

Russian cosmonaut and ISS crew member Sergei K. Krikalev set a world record of 748 days for 
total time spent in space. Krikalev had begun his cosmonaut training in 1985 and had first served 
as a crew member of Russia’s Mir space station in 1988. Krikalev had served on the Mir crew 
again in 1991 and had later become a member of the first ISS crew comprising both Russian 
cosmonauts and U.S. astronauts. In addition, he had been the first Russian to travel on a NASA 
Space Shuttle, achieving that distinction on Shuttle Discovery in 1994. The ISS partners had 
scheduled Krikalev’s return to Earth for October 2005―by then he would have spent 814 days in 
space.828 
 
NASA scientists led by Karel J. Schrijver announced the results of their research on the 
development of better methods of forecasting solar storms. Radiation from solar 
storms―extremely powerful explosions in the Sun’s atmosphere―can affect unprotected 
astronauts and airplane passengers, as well as satellites. In the past, scientists had usually 
analyzed changes in solar magnetic fields to forecast solar storms (also called solar flares), but 
this method had demonstrated limited reliability. However, a team of NASA scientists using 
NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) had found that strong electrical currents in 
the solar atmosphere―currents associated with changes in solar magnetic fields―are the 
primary drivers of solar flares. Therefore, observing the electrical currents is a more reliable 
method of forecasting solar flares than the method previously used. The researchers had also 
discovered that solar flares are strongest and most likely to occur in regions of the Sun where 
electrical currents accumulate until they have reached an explosive threshold. According to 
Schrijver and the other researchers, these findings would enable scientists better to forecast 
periods of potentially hazardous space weather.829

The Stafford-Covey Return to Flight Task Group (SCTG) released its final report on NASA’s 
efforts to meet the CAIB’s recommendations for resuming piloted Shuttle flights. Former NASA 
Administrator Sean O’Keefe had established the task group to provide an independent 
assessment of NASA’s implementation of the CAIB’s 15 critical recommendations. In the final 
report, the CAIB concluded that NASA had met or exceeded 12 of the 15 recommendations and 
had made substantive progress on the remaining three. The task group explained that the final 
three recommendations were of a type that would be nearly impossible to complete. However,

major media highlighted an appendix of the document in which seven of the 28-member task 
group provided a highly critical assessment of NASA’s management. These seven task force 
members claimed that some of the same organizational behaviors of NASA managers that had 
contributed to the destruction of Space Shuttle Columbia had also jeopardized the July 2005 
Space Shuttle Discovery mission. They stated further that NASA had failed to address the 
problem of Discovery’s loss of foam insulation from its fuel tank and had failed to take steps to 
protect the Space Shuttles from the damage caused by such debris.830 
 
18 August 
A group of scientists led by David N. Burrows of Pennsylvania State University announced that 
they had found evidence of black holes behaving in a manner previously unknown. Using 
observations from NASA’s Swift satellite, the scientists had discovered newly formed black 
holes that were simultaneously consuming matter while propelling away other material. They 
also observed that, after the black holes had emerged from large star explosions, the energy from 
the black holes’ initial formative activities had caused several subsequent explosions during the 
following minutes, with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) from the first explosion followed by x-ray 
flares from later explosions. Previously, scientists had believed that black holes and GRBs were 
only associated with single explosions of collapsing stars, rather than with a rapid succession of 
explosions. The scientists had been able to conduct their analyses because NASA’s Swift 
satellite could observe GRBs within minutes after their occurrence, whereas other satellites had 
only been able to observe GRBs hours after they had occurred.831 
 
24 August 
NASA and NOAA announced their joint development of procedures to improve the accuracy of 
medium-range weather forecasts in the Northern Hemisphere. NASA and NOAA scientists had 
incorporated into weather prediction models the data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder 
(AIRS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite, improving the accuracy range of experimental six-day 
weather forecasts of the Northern Hemisphere by 6 hours. Observers called this improvement of 
4 percent a significant development in weather forecasting. NASA had launched Aqua on 4 May 
2002, enabling the AIRS to produce three-dimensional maps of air and surface temperature, 
cloud properties, and water vapor. Moreover, the instrument had a spectral resolution more than 
100 times greater than that of other infrared sounders.832

Scientists published the first research findings from NASA’s Deep Impact mission, which had 
revealed important and unexpected findings about comets. On 4 July 2005, a probe from the 
Deep Impact spacecraft had performed a planned crash into the comet Tempel 1, while various 
observatories and the spacecraft’s observational vehicle analyzed the impact. One of the most

important findings was the presence of organic material in the comet, a discovery that supported 
theories that comets may have seeded Earth with the chemical precursors to life. However, 
scientists were surprised to find that the frozen comet contained minerals that require liquid 
water, not frozen water, to form. Scientists also puzzled over the presence of minerals that form 
in warmer temperatures than those present in the outer margins of the solar system, where they 
believed that comets had originated. Just as surprising to researchers was the discovery that the 
comet was not composed of solid ice, but that, instead, it had a fragile shell of ice covering a 
highly porous interior composed largely of dust.833 
 
9 September 
NASA Deputy Administrator and former astronaut Frederick D. Gregory announced his 
resignation from NASA. Gregory, who had become Deputy Administrator in 2002, stated that he 
was leaving the post so that a younger and more motivated individual could have the experience 
of serving. During his 31-year career with NASA, Gregory had served as Associate 
Administrator for Space Flight and Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of Safety and 
Mission Assurance. Gregory also had logged 455 hours in space as an astronaut, and in 1989 he 
had become the first African American to command a Space Shuttle mission. In his resignation 
letter to President George W. Bush, Gregory stated that he would remain Deputy Administrator 
until NASA had a confirmed successor.834 
 
The GAO issued a report detailing numerous problems with NASA’s financial management 
operationsproblems that could threaten NASA’s major programs. The report addressed 
NASA’s implementation of its Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP)NASA had 
begun implementing the IFMP in 2000 as a single accounting system to replace 11 separate 
accounting systems. At the request of the U.S. Congress, in 2003 GAO had examined NASA’s 
progress on IFMP implementation and had recommended that NASA make 45 changes to the 
program. In its assessment of NASA’s efforts to implement those recommended changes, GAO 
stated that NASA had made slow progress and still needed to implement most of the 
recommendations. The report also stated that NASA’s financial management problems were in 
danger of threatening its capacity to manage its programs and to allocate its budget to projects 
and programs. NASA responded that it had made significant improvements under the IFMP and 
had made progress on more of GAO’s recommendations than GAO had indicated in its report.835 
 
12 September 
Astronomers announced the detection of the most distant explosion ever observed, at 
approximately 12.6 billion light-years from Eartha gamma-ray burst (GRB) occurring after a 
massive star’s collapse and transformation to a black hole. The explosion, which astronomers 
had named GRB 050904, had occurred nearly 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang, which itself 
had happened 13.7 billion years ago. The astronomers used ground-based telescopes and

NASA’s Swift satellite to detect GRB 050904’s emitted infrared light. Because the event had 
occurred so far away, the infrared light had just begun to reach Earth. However, the explosion 
was not the most distant object or event that astronomers had ever observed. Scientists had 
detected a quasar and a galaxy located 12.7 billion light-years from Earth.836 
 
18 September 
Scientists announced that NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had detected water vapor on Enceladus, 
one of Saturn’s moons. Scientists described this as one of the most important findings in 
planetary science, because the discovery suggested that liquid water might exist on Enceladus. 
Liquid water is a prerequisite for the formation of life. Scientists had already known that 
Enceladus has a crystalline ice covering, the most reflective type of surface in the solar system, 
making Enceladus the brightest object in the solar system with the exception of the Sun. In 
addition, scientists had already known that diminutive Enceladus, which is only 310 miles (500 
kilometers) in diameter, is the smallest object in the solar system to have volcanic activity. 
However, scientists were surprised to discover water vapor over Enceladus’s south pole, and 
they were unable to explain the finding. NASA and ESA had launched Cassini in 1997 to survey 
Saturn and its moons.837 
 
19 September 
NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin released to the public NASA’s detailed master plan for 
meeting goals established under the Vision for Space Exploration, including transporting humans 
to the Moon, Mars, and elsewhere in the solar system. The US$104 billion plan, called the 
Exploration System Architecture Study, addressed the technologies and strategies that NASA 
planned to use to transport crews to the ISS, the Moon, and Mars. NASA proposed to replace the 
Space Shuttles with a Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) similar in design to the Apollo and Soyuz 
spacecraft, but incorporating new fuels and technologies.838 
 
William W. Parsons replaced Thomas Q. Donaldson as Director of NASA’s SSC. Parsons had 
served as Director of SSC from August 2002 to May 2003 before leaving SSC to serve as Space 
Shuttle Program Manager from May 2003 to September 2005. Donaldson had left SSC to serve 
on a Federal Emergency Management Agency special assignment concerning recovery efforts 
for areas affected by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.839

The U.S. Air Force launched the most technologically advanced GPS satellite ever developed, 
the GPS IIR-14, on a Delta-2 rocket at 11:37 p.m. (EDT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 
in Florida. The GPS IIR-14 was the first of eight satellites planned for the new GPS, which the 
Air Force had created to provide improved encryption and GPS antijamming capabilities for the

The FAA issued the first airworthiness certificate for a civil UAVthe General Atomics Altair. 
The UAV had a wingspan of 86 feet (26.2 meters), could fly to an altitude of 52,000 feet (9.8 
miles or 15.8 kilometers), and could remain airborne for more than 30 hours. General Atomics 
and NASA had jointly built the Altair to perform scientific and commercial research.841 
 
30 September 
The Russian Space Agency launched the crew of ISS Expedition 12 in a Soyuz spacecraft at 
11:55 p.m. (EDT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The members of Expedition 12 
were American astronaut Commander William S. McArthur Jr. and Russian cosmonaut Valery I. 
Tokarev. The two men would replace the crew of Expedition 11, comprising Russian cosmonaut 
Commander Sergei K. Krikalev and American astronaut John L. Phillips. The ISS partners 
planned for the new crew to remain at the station for nearly six months. The launch also included 
American executive Gregory Olsen, who would conduct scientific experiments under a 
commercial contract with the Russian Space Agency. Olsen planned to return to Earth with the 
Expedition 11 crew on 10 October 2005.842

Lesa B. Roe replaced the retiring Roy D. Bridges Jr. as Director of NASA’s LaRC. Roe, who 
had begun working with NASA in 1987, had served as LaRC’s Deputy Director since June 2004. 
Before that, she had been LaRC’s Associate Director for Business Management since August 
2003. Bridges had served as Director of LaRC from June 2003 until his retirement from 
NASA.843 
 
Astronomers announced that they had discovered the source of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 
which had been an enigma for decades. Gamma rays are the most energetic and deadly form of 
electromagnetic radiation. Although scientists had already discovered that supernovas cause long 
GRBs, which last for approximately 2 seconds, they had remained uncertain of the causes of 
short GRBs, which last less than 1 second. Using data from numerous NASA satellites, 130 
astronomers from around the world found that short GRBs originate from neutron stars and 
not―as some theories had suggested―from supernovas. More specifically, satellite data showed 
that short GRBs originate from collisions involving a neutron star and either another neutron star

or a black hole. However, the data was not conclusive regarding the exact type of collision that 
causes short GRBs, because the brevity of these events makes them difficult to observe 
directly.844 
 
8 October 
ESA’s CryoSat spacecraft was destroyed during a failed launch from Russia’s Plesetsk 
Cosmodrome. ESA had intended CryoSat as one of a series of Earth-observation spacecraft 
called Earth Explorers. ESA had built CryoSat to monitor the thickness of land and sea ice, to 
determine whether climate change is reducing Earth’s ice masses. Initial assessments of the 
launch failure indicated that the rocket launching the satellite had experienced a problem with its 
on-board flight-control system, a problem that had prevented the rocket’s upper stage from 
separating from its second stage.845 
 
10 October 
JAXA successfully tested an experimental aircraft capable of flying at Mach 2, which is twice 
the speed of sound. JAXA launched the aircraft, formally known as the Scaled Experimental 
Supersonic Transport (SST), on a rocket from Australia’s Woomera Test Range at 7:06 a.m. 
(local time). After its release from the rocket, the SST flew for nearly 15 minutes at speeds of 
Mach 1.9 to 2 (1,446 to 1,522 miles per hour or 2,327 to 2,449 kilometers per hour) and at 
altitudes ranging from 12 to 19 kilometers (7.5 to 11.8 miles). Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had 
developed the SST as part of a US$10 million program to create an aircraft capable of 
transporting 300 passengers between Los Angeles and Tokyo in approximately 4 hours.846 
 
The crew of Expedition 11 returned to Earth aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, landing at 9:09 
p.m. (EDT) in Kazakhstan. The members of Expedition 11 were Russian cosmonaut Commander 
Sergei K. Krikalev and American astronaut John L. Phillips. The two men had spent 179 days in 
space, during which time they had performed a variety of scientific experiments and maintenance 
tasks at the ISS. Accompanying Krikalev and Phillips on their return was American contractor 
Gregory Olsen, who had spent eight days on the ISS performing research under a commercial 
agreement with the Russian Space Agency.847

The China National Space Administration (CNSA) launched its second piloted spacecraft, the 
Shenzhou 6, on a Long March 2F rocket from Jiuquan, China, at 1:00 a.m. (GMT). The Shenzhou 
6 carried taikonauts Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng. The CNSA planned for them to remain in 
low Earth orbit for five days. The CNSA provided few details about the mission and declined to 
publicize information, such as the taikonauts’ names and the spacecraft’s scheduled return date,

conduct scientific experiments while in orbit.848 
 
13 October 
Scientists published research based on data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, which 
provided the first observational evidence that black holes not only destroy stars, but also create 
them. Sergei Nayakshin of the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom and Rashid A. 
Sunyaev of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, compared x-ray 
emissions from stars in the Orion nebula with x-ray emissions from stars orbiting within one 
light-year of the central Milky Way’s black hole Sagittarius A*. According to current scientific 
theories, a black hole’s immense gravity is able to pull millions of stars close to the black hole 
and to destroy stars. However, Nayakshin and Sunyaev had discovered that Sagittarius A* is not 
consuming its surrounding stars. Furthermore, the number of stars near the black hole is around 
10,000, far less than scientists would expect if the black hole’s gravity had drawn the stars 
toward it. Therefore, the scientists had concluded that the Chandra data supports an alternative 
theory of why stars are near black holes. This theory holds that dust around a black hole creates 
dense gas clouds. The gravity of the clouds counteracts the gravity of the black hole, thereby 
creating an environment in which stars form.849 
 
14 October 
NASA announced findings from its investigation into the causes of the foam loss on Discovery’s 
external tank during the Space Shuttle’s launch in July 2005, a problem similar to the one that 
had caused the destruction of Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. A team of NASA 
investigators stated that they had uncovered several possible factors that may have caused a 3-
foot (0.9-meter) portion of insulating foam to separate from Discovery during launch. They 
reported that the most likely cause was inadequate methods of applying and repairing the foam 
on Discovery’s external tank. The investigators stated that workers might have sprayed the foam 
in a manner that introduced fissures into it and might have crushed the foam while standing on it 
in the course of conducting the repairs on Discovery. Although the foam debris had not damaged 
Discovery, the incident had prompted NASA to suspend Shuttle launches until May 2006, so that 
engineers could identify the problem and correct it.850

The crew members of China’s Shenzhou 6 returned to Earth safely, landing at 8:33 p.m. (GMT) 
at Siziwang Banner in China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. During the five-day 
mission, which was China’s second piloted space mission, the Shenzhou 6 had flown 3.25 
million kilometers (2 million miles) in low Earth orbit. Although the CNSA provided few details 
about the mission, Chinese news outlets reported that crew members Fei Junlong and Nie 
Haisheng had practiced several procedures that astronauts must perform when living in the

19 October 
NASA researchers announced the possible discovery of oxygen sources on the Moon, which 
astronauts might be able to use in future human explorations. Using NASA’s HST, the 
researchers had examined the first high-resolution ultraviolet images of the Moon ever captured. 
The images had revealed high concentrations of a mineral called ilmenite in an area called the 
Aristarchus Plateau. Human visitors to the Moon could conceivably use ilmenite―composed of 
iron, oxygen, and titanium―as a source of oxygen, by extracting the oxygen from the mineral 
through chemical or heating processes. However, the NASA scientists stated that they would 
continue evaluating the findings, as well as their potential usefulness for future lunar missions.852 
 
31 October 
Scientists using the HST announced that they had discovered two additional moons orbiting 
Pluto, increasing the number of Pluto’s known moons to three. Planetary scientists with the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory had found two moons, of approximately 30 to 100 
miles (48 to 161 kilometers) in diameter, orbiting Pluto at distances of 30,000 miles (48,000 
kilometers) and 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers), respectively. Because of Pluto’s diminutive 
size, elliptical orbit, and compositional material, scientists continued to debate whether or not 
Pluto is a planet. Some experts believed that the discovery of the two additional moons, 
provisionally named P1 and P2, supported the classification of Pluto as a planet.853

The FAA announced that it would install a new runway safety system at the nation’s airports to 
reduce the likelihood of runway collisions between aircraft. The system―Airport Surface 
Detection Equipment, Model X (ASDE-X)―combined data from radar and airplane 
transponders to provide air traffic controllers with a continuously updated map of airport-surface 
operations, even during conditions of poor visibility, such as night and bad weather. Previously, 
most airports had relied on radar-based systems, which were susceptible to providing poor or 
false information during darkness and inclement weather and were unable to detect near 
collisions on intersecting runways. The FAA stated that it would begin installing the ASDE-X at 
14 of the nation’s busiest airports in January 2006.854

Both crew members of the ISS, NASA astronaut William S. McArthur Jr. and Russian 
cosmonaut Valery I. Tokarev, performed a spacewalk to prepare the ISS for the first assembly 
work since the 2003 accident of Space Shuttle Columbia, which had led to the suspension of 
construction on the station. The two removed broken and disused equipment and installed a new 
television camera, designed to aid in the assembly of additional truss segments for the ISS. 
McArthur and Tokarev were performing these tasks to prepare the ISS for the future installation 
of a new solar power module, planned for 2006.855 
 
9 November 
ESA successfully launched the Venus Express on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 4:33 a.m. (CET). ESA had created the spacecraft to analyze 
Venus’s atmosphere, chemistry, and structure, while the craft was orbiting the planet. ESA 
planned to use the analysis of Venus’s surface and its hot, stormy atmosphere to study climate 
change on Earth, as well as to help determine why Venus had evolved so differently from Earth, 
despite numerous structural similarities between the two planets. The spacecraft was ESA’s 
second probe designed to orbit a specific planet, the first being Mars Express, which ESA had 
launched in 2003.856

spacecraft had remained docked at the ISS to serve as a return vehicle to Earth and an emergency 
escape vehicle. McArthur and Tokarev were relocating the Soyuz so that Pirs could serve as an

President George W. Bush signed into law Pub. L. No. 109-108, legislation that provided 
US$16.5 billion in appropriations to NASA for FY 2006. In the bill’s conference report, 
Congress noted some specific programs that it wanted NASA to pursue. For example, Congress 
specified that NASA use the funds to develop the Crew Exploration Vehicle and Crew Launch 
Vehicle, as described in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study, NASA’s master plan for 
meeting the goals of the Vision for Space Exploration. Moreover, Congress also directed NASA 
to make more effective use of NASA Television―NASA’s own television station, which it had 
primarily used for internal communications―to promote public knowledge about and interest in 
space exploration.858

President George W. Bush signed into law Pub. L. No. 109-112, the Iran Nonproliferation Act, 
which effectively allowed U.S. astronauts to continue flying on Russian spacecraft, thereby 
maintaining the United States’ access to the ISS. The terms of the original act, passed in 2000, 
did not permit U.S. government agencies to make “extraordinary payments” to Russia, including 
purchasing space on Soyuz spacecraft, unless the President of the United States had certified that 
Russia was not exporting missile and nuclear technologies to Iran. However, at the time that 
Congress had passed the original act, Russia had an agreement with the United States to provide 
11 free voyages on Soyuz spacecraft to U.S. astronauts, so that NASA did not have to purchase 
space on Soyuz. In September 2005, American astronaut William S. McArthur Jr. had become 
the 11th U.S. passenger on a Soyuz, and, subsequently, Russia had required payment for any 
carriage of U.S. astronauts. Therefore, NASA had asked Congress to amend the act so that it 
could buy space on Russian spacecraft.859 
 
23 November 
Former NASA astronaut Michael L. Coats became Director of NASA’s JSC, replacing Jefferson 
D. Howell Jr., who had left to become a visiting professor at the University of Texas in Austin. 
Coats had begun working at NASA in 1978 and had flown three Space Shuttle missions before 
retiring from NASA in 1991. Before becoming JSC Director, Coats had worked for Lockheed 
Martin in Denver, Colorado.860 
 
26 November 
JAXA’s Hayabusa spacecraft successfully landed on the asteroid Itokawa, marking the first 
landing of a Japanese spacecraft on an extraterrestrial body. JAXA had created the spacecraft to 
collect samples from the asteroid―named after Japanese space scientist Hideo Itokawa. 
Scientists had theorized that asteroids are composed of material that has remained unchanged 
since the solar system’s formation, and they hoped that analyzing the composition of that 
material could provide information about the origins of celestial bodies. JAXA planned for a 
capsule with samples from Itokawa to launch from the asteroid within a few days and to land in 
the Australian outback in June 2007.861 
 
29 November 
Shana L. Dale became Deputy Administrator of NASA, replacing Frederick D. Gregory, who 
had announced his resignation from NASA in September 2005. Before joining NASA, Dale had 
worked at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, serving as Chief of Staff, General 
Counsel, and, finally, as Deputy Director for Homeland and National Security. In addition, Dale 
had served as Staff Director for the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics from 1995 
to 2000.862

The NASA Advisory Council (NAC), responsible for providing counsel and policy advice to the 
NASA Administrator on important programs and issues, held its first meeting after its 
organizational restructuring. NASA had restructured the NAC to provide it with better support as 
NASA implemented the Vision for Space Exploration. Under the reorganization, the NAC had 
incorporated standing committees that it had previously chartered. The six committees 
composing the restructured Council were Aeronautics, Audit and Finance, Exploration, Human 
Capital, Science, and Space Operations. Each committee was responsible for examining 
particular subject areas and providing findings to the full Council, which would consider the 
findings and supply specific recommendations to the Administrator. Former U.S. Senator and 
Apollo program astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt chaired the 24-member NAC, which also 
included former Apollo program astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, the first person to walk on the 
Moon.863 
 
30 November 
ESA announced that its Mars Express spacecraft had discovered ancient geological structures 
and ice reservoirs―but not liquid water―below Mars’s surface. Mars Express, equipped with 
radar capable of conducting subsurface analyses of the planet, had detected a crater 
approximately 250 kilometers wide (155 miles wide) below the planet’s surface, as well as 1.8 
kilometers (1.1 miles) of subsurface water ice near its north pole. However, the spacecraft had 
not detected the liquid water necessary to support life. Even deep below the surface of Mars, the 
planet’s polar temperatures decline to -129ºC (-200ºF), preventing its ice from melting. Scientists 
regarded the discovery of subsurface ice as evidence that Mars’s environment was unable to 
harbor life.864 
 
DECEMBER 2005 
 
6 December 
NASA announced a major discovery: images from the Cassini spacecraft had revealed geological 
activity on Saturn’s moon Enceladus. ESA, the Italian Space Agency, and NASA had jointly 
created Cassini to study Saturn and its moons. Although scientists had previously believed that 
Enceladus is too small to be geologically active, data from Cassini had revealed that the moon is 
one of the solar system’s most geologically dynamic objects. The images showed surface 
features such as deep canyons and flowing material, a south polar hot spot, and jets of icy 
particles supplying matter to one of Saturn’s rings.865 
 
7 December 
The FAA announced that it would deploy a new communications system―called the En Route 
Communications Gateway (ECG)―in all 20 en route, air traffic–control centers (formally called

Air Route Traffic Control Centers) in the continental United States. En route centers manage 
high-altitude air traffic between airports and serve as the National Airspace System’s hubs. The 
FAA had designed ECG to communicate data from existing radar sites and other legacy sources 
to the en route centers, as well as to enable future air traffic–communications systems to receive 
radar and other data through the Internet. Lockheed Martin had designed the ECG as a 
replacement for the Peripheral Adaptor Module Replacement Item, which was susceptible to 
system-wide outages.866 
 
9 December 
ESA and JAXA performed the first bidirectional, optical, interorbital communication, a form of 
communication in which satellites use lasers to transmit and receive commands and data over 
long distances. Laser-based communications have numerous advantages over communications 
using radio waves, including freedom from interference and higher data-transmission speeds and 
volumes. ESA and JAXA performed the communication between ESA’s Advanced Relay and 
Technology Mission satellite and JAXA’s Optical Inter-Orbit Communications Engineering Test 
Satellite. Previously, ESA and JAXA had conducted unidirectional, optical communications 
between their satellites, but this event was the first bidirectional form of this type of 
communication.867 
 
14 December 
JAXA officials announced that the agency would delay the Hayabusa spacecraft’s return to Earth 
by two years. JAXA had created Hayabusa to collect samples from the asteroid Itokawa, and 
Hayabusa had successfully landed on the asteroid in November 2005. However, problems with 
the spacecraft’s thrusters had prevented a probe containing samples from launching during a 
period when the asteroid’s alignment with Earth and the Sun provided an opportunity for the 
probe to return to Earth successfully. In addition, JAXA officials reported that they were 
uncertain whether Hayabusa’s probe had actually collected samples from the asteroid.868 
 
15 December 
NASA announced that it would remove the potentially problematic foam insulation ramps from 
the Space Shuttles’ external fuel tanks before the next Shuttle launch, which NASA had 
scheduled for 2006. NASA had examined the foam ramps after a portion of foam had separated 
from Discovery during its July 2005 launch, nearly striking the Shuttle. The event was similar to 
the one that had contributed to the destruction of Columbia in 2003. Engineers had designed the 
foam ramps―formally called Protuberance Air Loads (PALs)―to protect Shuttle tanks’ fuel-
pressurization lines and electrical cables from potentially damaging winds during launch. NASA

technicians remained unsure of why the foam ramp had separated from Discovery, but 
inspections conducted in November 2005 had revealed small cracks in a PAL. The PAL with the 
cracks was on a tank that NASA had tested before Discovery’s launch but had not used for that 
mission.869 
 
22 December 
Scientists using NASA’s HST announced the discovery of two new rings and two new moons 
around the planet Uranus. The newly discovered rings―faint bands of dust that undergo 
continual change, with dust spiraling out of the rings―are replenished by debris from collisions 
between asteroids and the newly discovered Uranian moon called Mab. The discovery of the 
rings increased the number of known Uranian rings to 13. The discovery of the two moons, 
which the scientists named Cupid and Mab after mythological and Shakespearean characters, 
increased the number of known Uranian moons to 27, the most of any planet in the solar system. 
Scientists also remarked that the orbits of known Uranian moons had changed since Voyager 2 
had last observed them in 1986. Scientists described the dynamic nature of Uranus’s moons and 
rings as indicative of dynamism throughout the solar system. Scientists hoped that observing 
Uranus would help them better understand this dynamism.870 
 
25 December 
Woodrow Whitlow Jr. became Director of NASA’s GRC, replacing the retiring Julian M. Earls. 
Whitlow had served as Deputy Director of NASA’s KSC since September 2003. Before that, he 
had served as Director of Research and Technology at GRC. Whitlow, who held bachelor’s, 
master’s, and doctoral degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, had begun working for NASA in 1979 as a research scientist at LaRC.871 
 
28 December 
ESA launched the satellite Giove A on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket at 5:19 a.m. (UT) from Baikonur 
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The satellite was the first component of a satellite navigation 
system called Galileo. According to ESA’s plan, the Galileo system would consist of 30 satellites 
and would commence operations by 2008. ESA had created Galileo to reduce European 
dependence on the United States for satellite navigation services and to provide more accurate 
civilian services than the GPS, a system that the U.S. military had created. According to ESA, 
users who had mobile phones with integrated chips would be able to use Galileo to find 
directions to particular destinations, such as parks and restaurants. Galileo would be capable of 
providing civilian users with real-time positioning accuracy to within 1 meter (3.28 feet). 
Civilian services from the GPS were accurate to nearly 5 meters (16 feet).872

29 December 
The FAA published the first proposed regulations on commercial human spaceflight, a growing 
industry often referred to as space tourism. The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 
2004 (Pub. L. No. 108-492) required the U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees the 
FAA, to implement regulations on commercial human spaceflights. Congress had passed the bill 
for to establish a balanced and clear regulatory regime that promoted the development of the 
growing commercial human spaceflight industry. Most of the FAA’s proposed regulations 
addressed passengers’ informed consent and crew members’ qualifications, as well as the 
training of both passengers and crew. The proposed regulations would remain subject to public 
comment for 60 days (until 27 February 2006). The FAA was required to issue the final 
regulations by 23 June 2006.873 
 
30 December 
President George W. Bush signed into law Pub. L. No. 109-155, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005, which authorized NASA’s appropriations for 
fiscal years 2006 through 2010 and directed NASA to pursue particular programs during that 
period. More specifically, the new law directed NASA’s Administrator to ensure that NASA 
would pursue a balanced set of programs related to aeronautics research and development, 
human spaceflight, and scientific research―including robotic missions to the Moon. Among the 
specific programs the law directed NASA to pursue was the launch of the Crew Exploration 
Vehicle (CEV) at a date as close to 2010 as possible, and the landing of Americans on the Moon 
by 2020. Both objectives were components of the Vision for Space Exploration. Moreover, the 
law specifically authorized appropriations for only two years―US$17.9 billion for FY 2007 and 
US$18.7 billion for FY 2008.874
