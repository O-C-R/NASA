                               Foreword
   This volume in NASAâ€™s   continuing series of annual chronologies records the
events of 1973. The 15th year of the space agencyâ€™s existence is memorable
to the public as the Year of Skylab and the Year of Jupiter. The nationâ€™s
first earth-orbital laboratory was launched. Beginning with a dramatic 10-day
fix-it effort that restored Skylabâ€™s capability to generate electrical power,
three three-man crews rendezvoused and docked with the space laboratory.
Their total of 12 351 man-hours in space supported the feasibility of pro-
longed manned space flight. Even more impressive were the volume and
quality of experiment results. The sophisticated battery of telescopes in the
Apollo Telescope Mount produced 182 842 frames of film and 941 hours of
manned viewing of the sun. The earth was not neglected either. Orienting the
laboratory toward the earth, astronauts took a total of 40 286 frames of
earth-resources photographs. Electric furnace experiments with zero-gravity
manufacturing offered interesting possibilities of new industrial processes that
cannot be achieved in earth gravity. Assimilation of the knowledge contained
in the mass of data is still continuing.
    As the year closed, Pioneer 10 swept by the planet Jupiter after a 21-month
flight that traversed a billion kilometers. Passing through the intense radia-
tion surrounding the largest planet in our solar system, Pioneer 10 sent back
 300 closeup photographs of the planet and its inner moons, along with other
measurements of the swirling atmosphere and its massive Red Spot and of
 the magnetic, radiation, and electrical environments. Even as it returned the
data-much of which contradicted previous theories-Pioneer 10 was heading
 outward toward the orbits of Saturn and Pluto. In the late 1980s it will be-
 come the first man-made object to leave the solar system and voyage into
 interstellar space. The events of Skylab and Pioneer were only the most
 visible successes of 1973, however; many other important events accom-
 plished their objectives with less notice.
    On a smaller scale, but particularly important to a few, was the announce-
 ment of a new heart pacemaker developed from electronic components and
 batteries originally designed for use in space. The new model was recharge-
 able, thus eliminating the need for periodic surgery to replace the earlier
 instrument.
    Uses for the vast amount of data from the Earth Resources Technology
 Satellite Erts 1 multiplied as it completed its first year in space in July 1973:
 planning land use, managing water resources, estimating crop yields, inven-
 torying timber, exploring for minerals and petroleum. The practical benefits
 from this and similar programs seem at this writing almost limitless. Indeed,
 the principal problems are no longer the acquisition of such data, but rather
 its rapid and economical reduction int9 usable forms.
    In aeronautics, work went forward on a number of programs: digital fly-
 by-wire, which will significantly improve aircraft control; the supercritical
 wing, which provides significant fuel savings; reduction of noise and pollu-
 tion; and hydrogen injection to increase efficiency and reduce pollution from

gasoline engines. Collectively these efforts promise safer flight, fuel economies,
and less damage to our environment.
    Thus on most counts NASA activities seemed to bear out the Administratorâ€™s
statement in late 1973 that NASA was providing more emphasis on becoming
L<
   more like one of the service agencies of the government.â€
    Altogether 1973 was a productive year, punctuated at times with excite-
ment. And while real achievements were being realized, plans were being
laid for subsequent programs, and this volume offers specific information
about both.

   A brief, chronological account of key events of the year in space and in
the atmosphere, Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1973 records dates, actions,
hardware, persons, scientific discoveries; plans, decisions, achievements, pre-
liminary evaluations of results, and samples of public reaction and social
impact. The volume is offered for reference use within the Federal Govern-
ment and by the public. It should be of use to present and future scholars in
a variety of disciplines.
   The sources, identified by abbreviations that are explained in Appendix D,
were those immediately available in NASA and other Government agencies,
the Congress, and the professional societies, as well as the press. Contradictory
accounts have been resolved and doubtful ones verified whenever possible by
querying participants. Cross-references are given in the text, and the detailed
index will aid in tracing related events through the year. The index also
serves as a glossary of acronyms and abbreviations.
   General editor of the volume was the Publications Manager of the NASA
Historical Office, Frank W. Anderson, Jr., and the technical editor was Mrs.
Carrie E. Karegeannes. Archivist Lee Saegesser collected current documenta-
tion. The Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress, under
an exchange of funds agreement, drafted monthly segments in comment
edition form, which were circulated for corrections, additions, and use. At
the end of the year, the entire manuscript was reworked to include comments
received and additional information that was not available when the monthly
segments were prepared. At the Library, Patricia D. Davis, Nancy L. Brun,
Shirley M. Singleton, and May Faye Johnson carried principal responsibility.
Arthur G . Renstrom of the Library prepared preliminary indexes for the
first six months; Informatics TISCO, Inc., prepared the detailed index for the
annual volume.

                             January 1973

January 1: NASA had scheduled 15 spacecraft launches in 1973 from Ken-
    nedy Space Center, Eastern Test Range, and Western Test Range, KSC
    announced. Launches would include four Skylab missions, three of them
    manned; Intelsat-IV F-6, F-7, and F-8 for Communications Satellite
    Gorp.; Pioneer-G to fly by Jupiter; Canadaâ€™s Telesat-B comsat; RAE-B
    Radio Astronomy Explorer; United Kingdomâ€™s Skynet 11-A comsat;
    Mariner mission to fly by Venus and Mercury; ITOS-E Improved Tiros
    Operational Satellite; ERTS-B Earth Resources Technology Satellite ; and
    AE-c Atmosphere Explorer. ( ICSC Release 1-73)
∞NASA and Soviet space officials had agreed to permit representatives of the
    U.S. and U.S.S.R. to observe and advise in Apollo and Soyuz flight con-
    trol rooms during orbital phase of July 1975 joint mission, Aviation
    Week & Space Technology reported. No agreement had been reached to
    permit U.S. observers at the Soviet launch site during liftoff of Soyuz
    spacecraft. [See March 15-30.] (Av Wk,1/1/73, 13)
∞An Aviation Week 8 Space Technology editorial noted the aerospace indus-
    try forecast for 1973 was for continuing improvement â€œacross the entire
    technical spectrum.â€™â€™ The year 1971 had bottomed out the 1969-1970
    recession and provided the â€œfirst tangible evidence of upswing.â€ The
    year 1973 should continue the uptrend â€œon a modest but solid curve.â€
    Industry had been â€œunder increasing pressure from Congress, the Penta-
    gon and the taxpaying public for the last five years to improve its
    manageria1 efficiency and the reliability performance of its products. The
    pressure has now accumulated to the point where the industry must re-
    spond, both internally in cleaning its own house and mounting an
    aggressive campaign for government contracting reforms to match, or
    face the very real spectre of nationalization in the public mood that may
    well prevail four years hence.â€ (Hotz, Av Wk, 1/1/73, 11)
∞The â€œdeeper meaningâ€ of Apollo 17 (Dec. 7-19, 1972), the last manned
    lunar landing mission in the NASA program, was discussed by author
    William I. Thompson in a New York Times article: The mission had
    represented a â€œsunsetâ€ of rocket technology. â€œApollo 17 turned the night
    into day, but elsewhere smalIer lights were going on as men began to
    discover relationships between consciousness and the growth of plants
    . . . , between enzyme change and faith healing. . . , and between mind
    and matter in psychokinesis. . . . The space program was an important
    scaffolding, but now that the building of the new human culture is up,
    we no longer need the scaffolding.â€ To spend a fortune on rockets now
    â€œwould be the same as spending a fortune on dirigibles in 1916. There
    are other forms of space travel to be invented, and these forms are more
    likely to spring from the new paradigms emerging in science than from
    the hardware of the old technology. The era of the rocket has climaxed
    in Apollo 17; if we push on and ignore the sense of an ending, we shall
    find only the bitterness and disappointment of the anticlimax.â€ (NYT,
     1/1/73, 3 :13)

January 2

January 2: Dr. James C. Fletcher,       NASA Administrator, expressed gratifi-
    cation in his monthly letter to the staff â€œwith NASAâ€™s  excellent perform-
    ance in 1972, and with the successful transition . . . from the completed
    programs of the Sixties to the new programs and new challenges of the
    Seventies. In 1972, Phase I of the national space effort of the United
    States was completed and Phase I1 well begun.â€
       NASAâ€™s year with all launches and missions successful underlined
               first
    that it was NASAâ€™s   custom â€œto do the unprecedented and then quickly
    make it routine.â€ Zero failures could now be the goal year after year. Dr.
    Fletcher also noted that of 18 space launches in 1972 half had been for
    other organizations or countries, with 8 being reimbursed.
       On another â€œimportant front,â€ the NASA-wide payload cost-reduction
    campaign begun in 1972 had gone well, with valuable suggestions from
    Centers and contractors. The effort â€œwas not a routine cutback exercise
    and not a threat to anyoneâ€™s security. It is, instead, a creative effort to
    expand our usefulness even though funds are limited. And you can be
    sure it has a lot to do with NASAâ€™s  long-range survival as the instrument
    of the U S . Government to handle most kinds of space and aeronautical
    R&D and other related assignments.â€ ( N A S A Activities, 1/15/73, 2-3)
  ∞Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Presidential Science Adviser, resigned to return
    to private industry. The former communications systems scientist at Bell
    Telephone Laboratories, Inc., had served as Director of White House
    Office of Science and Technology for 28 mos and had instituted reorgani-
    zation of the Federal science complex. The New York Times quoted White
    House sources as saying the resignation was prompted by disappointment
    that his advice had not been heeded by the Nixon Administration. Fed-
    eral support for science and technology expressed as percentage of
    budget outlays for research and development had reached the lowest
    point since latter years of the Eisenhower Administration. The White
    House had declined comment on the resignation and had not released
    the text of Dr. Davidâ€™s letter to the President. (Lyons, N Y T , 1/3/73, 1 )
  ∞Grumman American Aviation Corp. was formed by the merger of Grum-
    man Corp.â€™s general-aviation interests and American Aviation Corp.
    Grummanâ€™s Gulfstream 1 and 2 and Ag-Cat program assets were trans-
    ferred to American Aviation Corp. in exchange for shares in American.
    Corporate headquarters of the new company would be in Cleveland, Ohio,
    with Grumman President E. C. Tow1 as company Chairman and Ameri-
    can President and Chief Executive Officer R. W. Meyer as President.
     (Znteravia, 4/73, 301; Grumman Corp pro)
January 3: President Nixon accepted the resignation of Dr. Edward E.
    David, Jr., as Science Adviser and Director of Office of Science and
    Technology [see Jan. 21. ( P D , 1/8/73, 10)
∞NASA planned to spend up to $100 million during the next five years on
    the post-Apollo lunar science program to extract information from 385
    kg (850 Ibs) of lunar samples, 30 000 photos, and â€œmilesâ€ of magnetic
    tape from six Apollo lunar landing missions, the New York Times re-
    ported. Director Anthony J. Calio of Manned Spacecraft Center Office
    of Science and Applications had said in an interview that recommenda-
    tions in an October 1972 report of the Lunar Science Institute were being
    followed in much of MSCâ€™S planning, but the MSC Lunar Receiving
    Laboratory would be closed on completion of Apollo 17 sample process-
    ing. The sample collection might be divided for storage at another
    Government facility as a â€œprecaution.â€ The LRL report had said preser-

                                                                       January 3
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1973

      vation of MSG curatorial facilities for lunar materials was â€œabsolutely
      essentialâ€ to lunar science objectives. Calio said sample inventory and
      preparation of rock slivers for the thin sections library should take two
      years. Repository for Apollo geophysical material, including magnetic
      tapes, probably would be Goddard Space Flight Center. (Wilford, NYT,
      1/3/73, 25)
    ∞The Aviation Advisory Commission sent to the President a report of its two-
      year study of long-range U.S. aviation needs. Acting under Public Law
      91-258, the Commission had concluded that the â€œU.S. is facing the
      greatest combination of threats to its position of world preeminence in
      aviation since it established that position in the late forties.â€ Recom-
      mendations included establishment of Under Secretary for Civil Avia-
      tion in Dept. of Transportation to prepare and keep current a 10-yr plan
      for air services, airports, airways, air vehicles, and ground access.
      Civil-aviation research and development functions of NASA, the Federal
      Aviation Administration, and other Federal agencies should be placed
      under the USCA. (CR, 1/12/73, S608)
    ∞Reaction of writers Norman Mailer and Katherine Anne Porter to space
0

      flight and to nighttime launch of Apollo 17 were reported in the Chris-
      tian Science Monitor. Authors had witnessed the Dec. 6, 1972, launch
      and participated in a space seminar during the â€œVoyage beyond Apolloâ€
      cruise of the S.S. Statendam, which left New York Dec. 4 for Cape
      Kennedy and the Caribbean.
          Mailer had said: â€œMoon colonies offer the possibility that weâ€™ll be
      able to discover definitively and for the first time what we are doing
      wrong. Whether we thrive on the moon or fail weâ€™re going to learn
      something that weâ€™re not going to learn by staying here on earth. . . .â€
      Part of â€œthe fundamental impasse of 20th-century man and woman is
      that they cannot find communities which express their philosophical
      ideas, their social ideas, and their private ideas. In other words, the one
      thing that we canâ€™t do any longer is verify what we think. We can have
      ideas. But we spend our lives just talking about them.
          â€œThere are very few people who have a profound sense of commit-
      ment. One of the reasons that the astronauts have been so revered . . .
      is that they have this huge sense of commitment. . . . they are absolutely
      devoted to a living a life that they believe in utterly and are willing to
       go through great hardship for it. I think that until our society reaches
      the point where many more people live lives of such commitment itâ€™s
       going to remain essentially unhealthy. . , .
          â€œThe decision to go to the moon is such a declaration of intent. If
       nothing else, one has to risk dying on it. One has to recognize that one
       is taking a major step, and the idea of taking a major step brings out in I
       people at least for a short period . . . the best in them. Then, if thereâ€™s
       something really alive in the venture, theyâ€™re likely to keep changing
       their habits and go on to make more of themselves.â€
          Miss Porter had said that, in almost anything men undertook together
       here on the earth, â€œin no time at all thereâ€™s a pull and haul for power.
       Theyâ€™re betraying and tricking each other, getting in one anotherâ€™s way.
       And yet when it comes to something they consider big â€˜enough and
       grand enough they do it in a grand way and they do it well, like the
       astronauts. . . . Weâ€™ve always built and saved a little more than weâ€™ve
       been able to destroy, donâ€™t you think?â€ (CSM, 1/3/73)

∞Rep. Alphonzo Bell (R-Calif.) introduced H.R. 32, National Science and
    Policy Priorities Act of 1973. The bill differed from S.32, passed by the
    Senate in 1972 but never reported out by the House Committee on Sci-
    ence and Astronautics [see Jan. 41. The new bill sought to protect the
    National Science Foundationâ€™s pure science functions by allocating at
    least 40% of the science budget to N S F . (CR, 1/3/73, H27; NASA LAR,

    one year and work on communications satellites would be phased out,
    with cancellation of ATS-G. Work on nuclear propulsion would be dis-
    continued and work on nuclear power curtailed. Plum Brook Station of
    Lewis Research Center would be closed. In aeronautics, quiet, propulsive-
    lift, experimental, short takeoff and landing ( QUESTOL) aircraft would

    case. One important phase of our space exploration program has
    ended, but a new phase-a more productive phase in terms of benefits
    to man on earth-has already begun.â€ Sen. Moss would â€œwork diligently
    with my colleagues on the Committee and with NASA to develop a clear
    understanding of the programâ€ and its relation to other national needs
    and priorities. Sen. Moss has been concerned with the â€œapparent high
     cost of the space program in relation to other important demands on
    the Nationâ€™s resources.â€ He would â€œapproach the question of current,
    present and future level of the nationâ€™s space program with an open

    uranium, and thorium-similar        to those at the Fra Mauro site-were
    relatively abundant in the Descartes region. (4) Potassium-uranium
    ratio of the lunar crust was similar to that of KREEP basalts. (5) The

January 8-23: The U.S.S.R. launched its Luna 21 unmanned lun
    from Baykonur Cosmodrome at 11:55 am local time (1:55 am EST).
    The â€œautomatic stationâ€ was separated from the â€œsatelliteâ€ in earth
    orbit and placed on a close to the planned trajectory for the moon.
    Tass said the purpose of the mission was to â€œfurther scientific studies
    of the moon and near-lunar space.â€ During the flight to the moon all
    systems were reported functioning normally. On Jan. 12 Luna 21
    entered lunar orbit with 110-km (68.4-mi) apolune, 90-km (55.9-mi)
    perilune, 1-hr 58-min period, and 60â€™ inclination. Orbital corrections
    were made Jan. 13 and 14 and on Jan. 14 the spacecraft was placed
    in an elliptical orbit with a low point of 16 km (10 mi) from the moonâ€™s
    surface.
       Luna 21 softlanded on the eastern fringe of the Sea of Serenity Jan.
    16 (Jan. 15 EST) and released the 840-kg (1850-lb) self-propelled
    Lunokhod 2 vehicle to make scientific investigations of the moonâ€™s
    surface. Lunokhod 2 resembled its predecessor, Lunokhod 1 (placed on
    the moon Nov. 17, 1970, by Luna 2 7 ) . It carried flags, pennants with
    Leninâ€™s bas relief, state coat of arms, and the inscription â€œ50th An-
    niversary of the U.S.S.R.â€ and was equipped with a control system,
    radio and TV devices, and scientific instruments including a French-
    made laser reflector. The reflector was designed to measure the distance
    between the earth and the moon to within 20-30 cm (10-12 i n).
       Between Jan. 16 and Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2, powered by solar batteries
    and controlled from the ground by a special crew, photographed the
    lunar soil, rocks, and panoramic moonscape ; determined chemical
    composition of the surface layer; measured the glow of zodiacal light
    near sun; and looked for cosmic dust. A highly skilled ground crew
    maneuvered vehicle over the shortest and safest routes, orienting it to
    a complex relief map of route. Lunokhod 2 was turned to bypass ob-
    stacles without decreasing speed. On Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2 was com-
    manded to terminate operations in preparation for lunar night.
       Luna 17 was the first unmanned spacecraft to land on the moon and
    deploy an automatic lunar explorer. The last mission in the series, the
    unmanned Luna 20 (launched Feb. 14, 1972), had landed on the moon
    and returned to earth with lunar samples. (GSFC SSR, 1/31/73; Tass

∞Scientists at an unidentified Soviet laboratory had reported successful con-

     version of hydrogen gas into metal, the New York Times said. In letter
     to the Soviet Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics, scientists
     had said a cylindrical charge of a high explosive had driven a projectile
     into a compression chamber filled with liquid hydrogen. At a pressure
     2.8 million times that of the atmosphere at sea level, the density of hy-
     drogen had jumped from 1.08 to 1.30 g per cu cm (from 0.04 to 0.05 lb
     per cu in), indicating conversion to a metallic state. Hydrogen as metal,
     hitherto unknown on earth, was thought by scientists to be the chief con-
     stituent of the planets Jupiter and Saturn and was expected to have su-
     perconducting characteristics. (Sullivan, N Y T , 1/10/73, 3 :23)

    space research.â€ X-ray astronomy to date had revealed about 125 dis-
    crete sources and a â€œdiffuse background which spans the energy range
    from 100 ev to tens of Mev.â€ X-ray sources revealed included supernova
    remnants, pulsars, and binary systems in the galaxy. Extragalactic

        A committee established by AIAA to evaluate NASAâ€™s  space shuttle pro-
    gram reported its conclusion that a shuttle system, including both
    manned and unmanned flight, ought to be built. The committee recom-
    mended a research and applications module system with interchangeable
    modules that could be removed in space to become part of an orbiting
    laboratory. Other nations should be encouraged to participate in shuttle
    development, the committee said. (Tech Rev, 5/73, 55)
        Advanced applications of the shuttle were discussed by J. E. Blahnik
    of Science Applications, Inc., and D. R. Davis of ITT Research Institute.
    An exploratory study had concluded that use of the shuttle orbiter for
    advanced, manned, high-energy missions from low earth orbit should be
    competitive with other proposed concepts, if orbital and refueling re-
    quirements were satisfied by using normal shuttle missions to deliver
    propellant in addition to their payload. (Program)
January 10-13: The American Astronomical Society met in Las Cruces,
    N. Mex. Cal Tech astronomer Dr. Robert Howard said six-year observa-
    tions through the 46-m (150-ft) solar telescope at Mt. Wilson Observa-
    tory had shown sections of the sunâ€™s outer atmosphere to be in motion
     with respect to time. Movements had extended to 259 000 sq km (100 000
    sq mi) of photosphere-the sunâ€™s gassy surface-and had appeared to
     be east-west or west-east. Some motions had been calculated at 6257 km
     per h r (3888 mph) ; others, at 7300 km per hr (4536 mph) . Cause and
    significance of the motion were unknown.
        At a press interview Dr. John C. Brandt, chief of the Goddard Space
     Flight Center Solar Physics Laboratory, said Indians in New Mexico,
     Arizona, and California nine centuries ago might have recorded a star
     explosion. Drawings on walls and ceilings of a cave at Chaco Canyon
     National Monument, N. Mex., closely resembled an explosion of July 4,
     1054, as recorded by the Chinese. Similar drawings had been found in

    but has decided to throw open the airwaves to various competitive
    groups.â€ There should be no corporate dominance of systems that de-
    pended on Federal funds. As FCC developed its open skies policy for
    satellites, â€œit should also consider the use of educational and public

    oceans of the world.â€ In the near future Americans might receive some
    programs originating in Canada ; later, from Europe. â€œOperating pro-

      three to measure ionospheric properties on three kinds of anomalous
      days: (1) â€œL,â€ a day with very low electron densities in the 70- to
      80-km (40- to 50-mi) region and a 10-day minimal storm activity pre-

      same altitude and magnetic storm prerequisites; and (3) ccH2,â€a day
      with very high electron densities in the same region with two or three
      days of major magnetic disturbance and magnetic storm aftereffects.
      The Nike-Apache was launched on an HI day and measured electron

January 17: NASA Hq. held its first press briefing on Mariner 9 (launched
    May 30, 1971) since spacecraft ceased transmission October 27, 1972,
    one year after it had gone into Martian orbit. Photos were released
    showing three kinds of channels on the Mars surface thought to be
    formed by flowing water sometime in Martian history. Harold Masursky
    of the U S . Geological Survey said one kind seemed to have been formed
    by melting permafrost; the other two looked â€œas though itâ€™s necessary
    to have precipitation and a collection of that runoff into flowing water
    channels.â€
       New Mexico Univ. geologist Dr. Bradford A. Smith said riverbeds
    on Mars probably had dried because of orbital changes. When the Mars
    orbit was more elliptical than at present, the perihelion would be much
    closer to the sun, perhaps producing long-term climate changes which
    might, â€œat certain times, permit liquid water to exist.â€
       Dr. Conway B. Leovy, Univ. of Washington, said dust storms en-
    countered by Mariner 9 were â€œphenomena which will recur on Mars
    depending on the particular astronomical relationship between the
    perihelion and the solstice.â€ Dust storms might have been responsible
    for â€œthe remarkable laminated terrain which has been observed in both
    polar zones.â€
       Scientists had determined from Mariner 9 photos that the planet was
    a more varied and dynamic body than expected. Dr. John E. Naugle,
    NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences, said: â€œMars is like
    three planets : the old cratered planet, the young volcanic active planet
    that you see, and then an entirely different situation in the polar re-
     gions in Mars.â€ Mars as â€œplanetary laboratoryâ€ of towering volcanoes,
     deep rift valleys, broad plateaus broken by fault lines, ancient planes
     with moonlike craters, sand dunes, clouds with water ice, and ever-
     changing polar caps would â€œsubstantially increase our basic knowledge
     of planets . . . and . . . when that history is written you will find that
     planetary exploration has contributed in a major way to the health and
     welfare of life on this planet.â€ (Transcript)

   achievements in a speech before the National Security Industrial Assn.
    in Los Angeles. The Apollo program had reasserted U.S. technological
    leadership, exploded theory that only a controlled economy and Com-
    munist society could succeed with large scientific and technological
    undertakings such as space exploration, demonstrated â€œthat we could
    respond effectively to a totalitarian challenge without resorting to
    totalitarian methods,â€ and produced the kind of Government-industry
    cooperation on large-scale research and development programs needed
    to make the American system work and keep it competitive with any
    other systems in the world. Apollo had reinforced â€œCan Do attitude that
    has made America great,â€ met national security requirements in 1960s
    for rapid progress in manned space flight technology and wide experi-
    ence in the field, obtained valuable scientific knowledge obtainable no
    other way, â€œdiscoveredâ€ planet Earth on the way to the moon, forced
    creation of new technology â€œas no peacetime enterprise in history has
    done-or could do up to now,â€ contributed spiritually to lives of all
    Americans, â€œand stayed within estimated cost bounds.â€ The program
    had cost $25 billion, or $11 per person per year from 1961 through

January 17-19:     A Skylab simulation at Manned Spacecraft Center picked
    u p the Skylab flight plan in the 10th day of the mission scheduled for
    April 30 launch. Flight controllers worked in shifts to tally the dayâ€™s
    activities, prepare a summary flight plan for the day following, and
    complete a detailed flight plan for use the next day. Activities included
    all elements of flight between 8 am and 5 pm each day but were oriented
    toward experiments rather than flight operations. Skylab astronauts
    manned crew simulators, principal investigators manned support sta-
    tions, and the Marshall Space Flight Center Operations Support Center
    for Skylab provided support for the Orbital Workshop. Prime contrac-
    tors North American Rockwell Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. sup-
    ported the simulation. MSC controllers inserted simulated malfunctions
    to exercise procedures and mission rules for the flight and to observe
    the reaction of control teams. (MSC Roundup, 1/19/73, 2 )

      expected to join later. After definition studies of the research and appli-
      cations module (RAM), the sortie lab final design would be agreed on by
      NASA and ESRO. ESRO would proceed to development phase, with delivery
      of the sortie lab to NASA scheduled for 1979. The laboratory would con-
      sist of a pressurized manned module to house equipment, experiments,
      data-processing equipment, electrical power and environmental control
      systems, and a six-scientist crew. An external, unpressurized instrument
      platform would house experiments and large instruments controlled re-

    Science Adviser, Dr. Edward A. David, Jr. [see Jan. 31: The resigna-
    tion and â€œlikelihood that the office of the Presidentâ€™s science adviser
    will be abolished come as a disappointing shock. David is a scientist-
    engineer of very broad competence who maintained intellectual integ-
    rity in the emotional heat of politics.â€ Abolition of office was â€œone of
    many consequences of President Nixonâ€™s determination to reorganize
    the Executive Office of the President.â€ It was probable that the Presi-
    dentâ€™s Science Advisory Committee and the Office of Science and Tech-
    nology â€œwould vanishâ€ in reorganization. Criticism of Presidential
     Science Advisers had been â€œthat they often became so involved in the
     day-to-day fighting of political brush fires that they lost sight of the
    forest.â€ The scientific establishment had fought against creation of a
     Dept. of Science. â€œIt has been argued that science and technology
     permeate the activities of virtually all executive agencies and that cen-
    tralization would not be wise. The argument had been driven home too
     well. In consequence, there is now danger that science, while being

January 22: Former President Lyndon B. Johnson died of heart attack in
     Austin, Tex., at the age of 64. During his senatorial career preceding
     his election to the Vice Presidency in 1961, Johnson had served in 1957
     as Chairman of the Prepardeness Investigating Subcommittee of the
     Senate Committee on Armed Services, where he had instituted an in-
     quiry into the status of US. satellite and missile programs. Hearings
     led to establishment Feb. 6, 1958, of the Senate Special Committee on
     Space and Astronautics with Johnson as Chairman. The Special Com-
     mittee prepared the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958
     establishing NASA (effective Oct. 1, 1958). Before passage of the Space
     Act July 29, 1958, the Senate created the permanent Committee on
     Aeronautical and Space Sciences July 24. Johnson became first chair-
     man-the position he held until 1961.
         Johnson was Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Coun-
     cil 1961-1963 and was instrumental in persuading President John F.
      Kennedy to select attainment of a manned lunar landing within the
      decade as a national goal. Johnson had become 36th US. President on
      assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963 and had seen
     the first successful manned circumlunar flight, made by ApolZo 8
      Dec. 21-27, 1968, before he left office in January 1969. ( W Post,

     lowing their Dec. 7-19, 1972, mission. They were welcomed by the
      House of Representatives, since the Senate was not in session. Cernan
      told the House that Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrongâ€™s place-
      ment of the first U S . flag on the moon in 1968 had been â€œa symbol of
      the courage and the dedication and the effort and self-sacrifice of 200
      million people in this country who made that effort possible.â€ The act
      had â€œprobably gained more pride and more respect throughout the
      entire world than any one thing that has happened . . . in the entire
      200-year history of our country.â€™â€™ With one step by Armstrong, â€œwe
      are able to gain something that we had never really been able to grab
      hold of in my lifetime.â€ Evans said his stay in the CM had made him
      realize that earth, like spacecraft, had limited consumable resources and

    conserve these resources and man must learn to adapt to his environ-
    ment.â€ Schmitt said that, in obtaining knowledge through the Apollo
    program, man had evolved into entering universe. â€œAlthough the na-
    ture of that evolution was technological, I believe it will be marked
    a thousand years from now as a single unique event in human historyâ€
    appearing â€œmore distinctly even than historyâ€™s record of our use of
    atomic energy. It is at times unseemly, at times shortsighted but always

       Former President Lyndon B. Johnson who had died during day, had
    sent a message commending space pioneers who had â€œmade the Apollo
    miracle a living reality. It has been more . . . than an amazing adven-
    ture into the unexplored and the unknown. The Apollo program has
    been and will endure as a monument to many things-to the personal
    courage of some of the finest men our nation has produced-to the
    technological and managerial capability, which is the genius of our
                   to a successful cooperation among nations which has

    A message from Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.), former Vice
    President and Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council,
    said the Apollo program had been an â€œoutstanding example of govern-
    ment, industry, and university cooperation and has really shown bril-
    liance of management and technological competence.â€ An Apollo film
    was narrated by Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, NASA Apollo Program Director.
       Dr. Petrone said the Apollo program had taken 12 yrs â€œand I donâ€™t
    look upon this as curtains at the end of a play. Itâ€™s like the curtain
    at the end of the first act. Itâ€™s just beginning.â€ Dr. Wernher von Braun,
    Vice President for Engineering and Development with Fairchild In-
    dustries, Inc., and former NASA Deputy Associate Administrator, said
    President Johnson had been instrumental in achieving congressional
    support for the space program. Apollo 8 Astronaut William A. Anders
    recalled President Johnson as â€œa very large man, very down to earthâ€
    who had the spirit of an astronaut, but was â€œa little too bigâ€ to be
    one. (Program; Texts; Smyth, W Post, 1/23/73, B2; RI PIO)

    of the rocket configuration that would be used for a series of calibra-
    tion rocket ( CALROC) launches during the manned Skylab mission
    scheduled for May. The rocket and instrumentation performed satis-
    factorily.
       The CALROC launches would provide a reference for the calibration
    of equipment on Skylabâ€™s Apollo Telescope Mount ( A T M ) . CALROC
    launches were also scheduled during the Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 mis-
    sions, to acquire solar flux data on specific regions of the sun in con-
    junction with Skylab astronaut observations of the same regions with
    ATM experiments. Instrumentation on CALROC would be similar to but
    smaller than that on the ATM. Black Brant VC would be used for all

January 25: The Global Atmospheric Research Program         (CARP) Atlantic
    Tropical Experiment (GATE), largest and most complex international
    scientific experiment, would observe one third of the earthâ€˜s tropical
    belt from June 15 to Sept. 30, 1974, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
    pheric Administration announced. A network of satellites, ships, air-
    craft including NASAâ€™s   instrumented Convair 990, instrumented buoys,
    and land stations would collect meteorological data from the tropical
    Atlantic and adjacent land areas to improve forecast techniques for the
    equatorial belt. Brazil, Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany,
    Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, and Ven-
    ezuela, in addition to the US., would process data for compatibility.
    Data would be integrated by the GATE data center and distributed in
    1976. US. participation would be coordinated by NOAA. (NOAA Release

    of 1973. The plan abolished the National Aeronautics and Space
    Council, including the position of Executive Secretary, and the Office of
    Science and Technology, including the posts of Director and Deputy
    Director. NASC had been created under the National Aeronautics and
     Space Act of 1958, enacted July 29, 1958. Provisions of the plan would
     take effect July 1 unless Congress acted against the plan.
        In his transmission message the President said NASC had â€œmet a
     major need during the evolution of our nationâ€™s space program. Vice
     President Agnew has served with distinction as its chairman for the
     past four years. At my request, beginning in 1969, the Vice President
     also chaired a special Space Task Group charged with developing
     strategy alternatives for a balanced U.S. space program in the coming
     years. As a result of this work, basic policy coordination can now
     be achieved through the resources of the executive departments and
     agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
     augmented by some of the former Council staff.â€™â€™ In streamlining the
     Federal science establishment, the Administration was â€œfirmly com-
     mitted to a sustained, broad-based national effort in science and

    technology.â€ The research and development capability of executive
    departments and agencies had been upgraded. The National Science
    Foundation had â€œbroadened from its earlier concentration on basic
    research support to take on a significant role in applied research as
    wellâ€ and had â€œmatured in its ability to play a coordinating and
    evaluative role within the Government and between the public and
    private sectors. I have therefore concluded that it is timely and
    appropriate to transfer to the Director of the National Science Foun-
    dation all functions presently vested in the Office of Science and
    Technology, and to abolish that office.â€
       The President also announced his intention to ask Dr. H. Guyford
    Stever, NSF Director, to take on the additional post of Science Adviser
    to advise and assist the Administration â€œon matters where scientific
    and technological expertise is called forâ€ and to act as the Presidentâ€™s
    representative in selective cooperative programs in international
    science, â€œincluding chairing such joint bodies as the US.-U5S.R Joint

     was to get away and not come back, escape the dialectical symmetries of
     up down, out back, growth and decay-and instead burst through into
      speeds and distances not just greater but other; yet also, yes, to come
      back changed, to save the earth, prove to Earthling ecologues it had
      been worth all that liquid oxygen and hydrogen in a few minutes of

January 29: President Nixon, in his message transmitting the FY 1974
      U S . budget to Congress, said the budget supported U.S. efforts to
      establish lasting peace by maintaining military strength while pro-
      posing a sound fiscal and monetary policy that â€œwill contribute to
      prosperity and economic stability here and abroad.â€ The U S . had
      progressed substantially toward ending its part in war in Southeast
      Asia, concluded in the past four years â€œmore significant agreements
      with the Soviet Union than in all previous years since World War 11,â€
      and ended isolation of the U S . from the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
      Taken â€œwith the success of the Nixon Doctrine, our substantial disen-
      gagement from Vietnam, and the increased effectiveness of newer
      weapons systems,â€ defense outlays had been kept in line. When adjusted
      for pay and price increases, 1974 defense spending would be â€œabout
      same as in 1973 and about one third below 1968.â€ (PD, 2/5/73,86-98)
∞President Nixon sent a $268.7-billion FY 1974 national budget request
      to Congress-an increase of $18.9 billion over FY 1973. The budget
      projection for the succeeding fiscal year was included for first time,
      with the FY 1975 budget estimated at $288 billion. The national total
      for FY 1974 included an R&D budget of $17.4 billion (an increase of
      $300 million), with $3.1 billion requested for civilian and military
      space programs. Emphasis was on practical, immediate results from
      R&D rather than expanding scientific knowledge, with reduced priority
      for space research.
         The total request for NASA new obligational authority of $3.016
      billion (1.276 of the total US. budget) was $391 million less than

   the FY 1973 NOA of $3.407 billion. FY 1973 funds of $91 million
   were to be carried over to FY 1974. NASA expenditures were budgeted
   to increase $74 million, from $3.062 billion in FY 1973 to $3.136
   billion. The FY 1973 increase of $11 million had been largely for
   space shuttle engine and airframe design and development. Of the FY
   1974 budget request, $2.288 billion would go for R&D, $112 million
   for construction of facilities, and $707 million for research and pro-
   gram management.
       In manned space flight, elimination of Apollo funding reflected suc-
   cessful completion of the Apollo program with the ApoZb 17 mission.
   Manned space flight operations-including $233.8 million for Skylab ;
   $90 million for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) ; $220.2 million
   for development, test, and mission operations; $21 million for space
   life sciences; and $15.5 million for mission systems and integration-
   would decrease from $879 million in FY 1973 to $580.5 million. The
   decrease reflected removal of space shuttle funding from the manned
   spacecraft operations category to separate program status. The FY
   1974 budget request allocated $475 million to the space shuttle pro-
   gram for the orbiter, main engine, solid-fueled rocket boosters, external
   tanks, technology and related development, and vehicle and engine
   definition. Advanced missions would receive $1.5 million, to bring
   the total for manned space flight (including the shuttle) to $1.057
   billion, down $100 million from FY 1973.
       Funding for space science programs would decrease $95.2 million,
   from $679.2 million in FY 1973 to $584 million in FY 1974. The
   decrease reflected suspension of the High Energy Astronomy Obser-
   vatory (HEAO)program, in which two flights had originally been
   scheduled during 1976-1978. The physics and astronomy program
   would receive $95 million, down from $126.2 million; lunar and plane-
   tary exploration would receive $312 million, down from $331.9 mil-
   lion; and launch vehicle procurement would receive $177 million,
    down from $221 million.
       NASAâ€™sspace applications programs would receive $153 million
    (a decrease of $35.7 million), including $51 million for weather and
   climate research with satellites, meteorological soundings, experimental
   instruments and techniques, and for the Global Atmospheric Research
   Program (GARP) ; $13.9 million for pollution monitoring, including $9
    million for Nimbus-G oceanographic and air pollution observation
   satellite; $42.6 million for earth resources survey; $10.7 million for
    earth and ocean physics; $3.1 million for space processing; $22.1
    million for communications, including a multi-use communications
    experiment satellite (ATS-F) and a Canadian Cooperative Satellite
    ( CAS-C); $3 million for a multidisciplinary Earth Observing Satellite
    (EOS) $4.5 million for shuttle experiment definition; and $2 million

       The total requested for NASAâ€™s
    grams increased from $232.5 million in FY 1973 to $240 million.
    Aeronautical research and technology funding would increase from
    $150.6 million in FY 1973 to $171 million, including $22 million for
    experimental engine programs, $9.3 million for flight experiment
    programs, and $30 million for system technology programs. Space re-
    search and technology would receive $65 million, and nuclear power
    and propulsion $4 million ( a drop from $17.1 million).

       The Dept. of Defense FY 1974 budget of $85 billion was at an
    all-time high, $4.1 billion above the FY 1973 budget authority, but
    was 28.4% of total Federal outlays for FY 1974 (a percentage decrease
    from 29.0% in FY 1973 and the lowest proportion since 1950) and
    6.0% of the gross national product (the lowest GNP percentage in
    24 yrs, down from 6.2% in FY 1973). The DOD total included $8.7
    billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) , a $600
    million increase over FY 1973. Of the requested RDT&E total, military
    astronautics-with    major programs including military comsats, the
    first spaceborne ballistic missile early warning system, a prototype
    satellite to demonstrate precise navigation capabilities, continued flight
    experiment programs, and technology programs in advanced naviga-
    tion, guidance, sensors, cooling, reentry, and propulsion-would receive
    $604.6 million (up $169.9 million). Military sciences would re-
    ceive $509.8 million ( u p $13.7 million). Aircraft RDT&E would receive
    $1.787 bilIion (down $86 million), and missiles RDT&E $2.245 billion
     (up $143 million).
       Major DOD increases were programmed for the Trident submarine-
    launched ballistic missile system ($1.712 billion, up $917 million), new
    Air Force F-4J jet fighter aircraft ($131 million), CVN-70 aircraft
    carrier ($657 million, up $358 million) and F-15 air superiority
    fighter ($1.148 billion, up $240 million). Decreases of $198 million
    in funding for the Safeguard antiballistic missile system, $208 million
    for the Poseidon missile, and $64 million for the short-range attack
    missile (SRAM) reflected a modernization program, as DOD continued the
    transition from combat support in Southeast Asia to strengthening base-
    line forces.
       The Dept. of Transportation budget request of $9.025 billion was a
    decrease of $2.302 billion from FY 1973. DOT funding would continue
    a 10-yr, $10-billion program to improve urban mass transportation
    and reduce highway congestion. Federal Aviation Administration fund-
    ing of $2.126 billion would continue efforts to reduce aircraft noise,
    ensure that advanced aircraft engines did not adversely affect the up-
    per atmosphere, and design a safer and more productive airport system.
       The Atomic Energy Commission FY 1974 budget request of $3.066
    billion, up $382 million over FY 1973, would cover production of
    nuclear materials to make electricity and for use in nuclear weapons
    and as nuclear reactor fuel, research into availability of source ma-
    terials, operation safety, and development of techniques for long-term
     storage of radioactive waste.
       The National Science Foundation FY 1974 budget request of $582.6
    million was down $63.1 million from FY 1973, but R&D funding would
    increase from $510.3 million in FY 1973 to $554.1 million. Programs
    would emphasize research into domestic problems, problems of long-
     range national interest, and effects of R&D on the economy. Priorities
    would include development of solar power as an energy source and
    of tunneling technology for urban use under the Research Applied to
     National Needs (RANN)program and development of a very-large-
     array radioastronomy facility.
        The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (in the Dept.
     of Commerce) budget request of $343.0 million, down from $366.7

    monitoring, prediction, and warning ; continuation of its polar orbiting
    satellite system and implementation of a two-geostationary satellite
    system in the weather satellite program ; major hurricane modification
    research; and expansion of research on marine ecosystems analysis to

∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the statement given
    out at the NASA FY 1974 budget briefing held Jan. 27: â€œThe budget
    the President has approved for NASA for FY 1974, like those of other
    agencies, has been reduced substantially below previous plans and
     expectations to hold total government spending to the targets set by
    the President. At the same time, the budget will permit NASA to carry
    forward a substantial and significant program in space and aero-
     nautics.â€
        The budget provided for continuing the major projects in the sched-
     ule announced Jan. 5 and for starting two new projects: Nimbus-G,
     â€œanother in NASAâ€™s   series of experimental earth oriented satellites, which
     will be directed at environmental pollution and oceanographic measure-
     ments, and LAGEOS, a new geodetic satellite for extremely accurate
     measurements of movements of the earthâ€˜s surface.â€
        In addition to reductions in programs announced Jan. 5, the budget
     required â€œthat we stretch out schedules in a number of ongoing projects.
     The second Earth Resources Technology Satellite ( ERTS-B) will be
     delayed two years, until 1976. This will allow it to carry an additional
     sensor. Tiros-N, the prototype of a new series of operational meteorolog-
     ical satellites for the National Weather Service, will be delayed by
     about one year io 1977.
        â€œWe will also undergo another belt-tightening in NASA. By the end
     of FY 1974 our civil service complement will be reduced 1880 positions
     below the FY 1973 end strength approved in the FY 1973 budget.
     This reduction includes the previously announced reductions related
     to the termination of our nuclear programs.â€
         Despite a â€œsharp decrease from the level budget anticipated last
     year,â€ Dr. Fletcher was â€œvery pleased with the program content we
      were able to retain. Clearly from what has been said today and on
     January 5, we will have to curtail several activities that are of major
      importance to the nation.â€ But â€œwe have been able to keep NASAâ€™S
      main line program essentially intact and each of the programs cur-
      tailed will still be done, either at a later date than anticipated or in
      an alternate way to that planned last year. Although I, personally,
      would like to see a higher NASA budget, I believe we can capitalize
      on the belt-tightening required to produce even greater yield for the
      tax dollar in future years.â€ NASA was â€œmaking substantial efforts to
      reduce future costs . . . while still giving the nation a strong pro-
      gram in space and aeronautics.â€ Additionally, a prime object of the
      space shuttle program was to reduce costs of operating in space. NASA
      intended to â€œdevelop and introduce new design concepts and manage-
      ment approaches which, together with the relaxed weight and size con-

                                       29

      straints of the Space Shuttle, will result in substantially lower develop-
      ment and operating costs.yy
         NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly discussed personnel cutbacks ne-
      cessitated by the new budgetary limitations. The total NASA Civil Service
      reduction of 1880 positions would include a Marshall Space Flight Cen-
      ter cut of 650; Goddard Space Flight Center, 158; Kennedy Space
      Center, 100; Manned Spacecraft Center, 75 ; Wallops Station, 17; Lewis
      Research Center, 660; NASA Hq., 150; and Ames, Langley, and Flight
      Research Centers, a total of 70. From a peak Civil Service complement
      of more than 34 000 in 1967, NASA would be reduced to under 25 000
      employees by June 1974-a drop of 30%. Total employees from all
      sources-contract and in-house-would drop from the 1966 peak of
      420 000 to about 100 000. (Text; Transcript)

       review series and first to use the metric system in all quantitative
       measurements to conform to NASA and Soviet practice. The U S . ex-
       pected to have spent $70 billion by June 30 on combined civilian and
       military space programs. Physical evidence of Soviet space activity
       indicated the U.S.S.R. had committed a similar amount. There had
       been no manned Soviet launches in 1972. Moscow had been â€œfilled
       with rumorsâ€ in late July of an impending â€œmore ambitious Salyut-
       Soyuz manned mission,â€ but press reports had indicated later that
       tracking ships which usually supported such missions were returning

    gas in deep space, developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration geophysicist Dr. Thomas E. Holzer, would aid future
    space flight planning and provide data on the origins and fate of
    universe, NOAA announced. The presence of thin hydrogen gas in in-
    terplanetary space had been observed by Ogo 5 (launched by NASA
    March 4, 1968). Interaction of the solar wind and interstellar hydro-
    gen could become important at astronomical units from the sun. Neu-
    tral hydrogen could become charged and associated with the solar wind.
    Some solar wind energy would be converted to random motion or
    heat. At the same time, the velocity of the solar wind would be di-
    minished. Neutral hydrogen could act as gentle, penetrable barrier
    to the solar wind. (NOAA Release 73-7)

    newtons per sq cm ( 5 lbs per sq in) of Apollo pressure during the
    July 1975 joint docking mission, to eliminate two-hour depressurization
    for each crew member before transfer to the other spacecraft. The
    change would permit time for all three astronauts and two cosmonauts
    to fly in the othersâ€™ spacecraft. Previously, only two astronauts had
    been scheduled to make the transfer.

February 2: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed NASAâ€™s

                                              budget at about the $3.4 billion
    have not been able to stabilize NASAâ€™s
    level . . . and that our reduced program workload necessitates a fur-
    ther reduction in . . . NASA employees. I am pleased, though, that we
    can proceed with most of our mainline programs and schedules for
    this decade with little change.â€ With the May launch of Skylab â€œwe
    should be able to give the world a very impressive demonstration of
    the tremendous new capabilities we now have for using manned and
    unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit. I believe that Skylab will awaken
    public interest throughout the world in the usefulness of scientific
    and practical observations to be made from Earth orbit, and in the
    â€˜space manufacturingâ€™ experiments. I am also confident that the reports
    from Pioneer 10 as it swings past Jupiter in December will stimulate
    strong public interest in expanded programs to explore the planets.
     Our joint flight with the Russians in 1975 will stress the potential of
    large-scale international cooperation in space. The Viking Lander on
    Mars may produce the first evidence of life in the universe beyond
    the confines of our home planet Earth; and it may suggest to Ameri-
    cans the real potential of space exploration as a continuing and expand-
    ing activity during our third century as an independent and demo-
     cratic nation.â€ Dr. Fletcher forecast a favorable NASA future: â€œWith
     another year of excellent performance in 1973 like we had in 1972, and
     continued strong bi-partisan support in Congress, this forecast is bound
     to become a reality.â€ ( N A S A Activities, 2/15/73, 26-8)

  ∞The National Science Foundation released A n Analysis of Federal R&D
    Funding by Function: FY 1963-73 (NSF 72-313). Federal expendi-
    tures for research and development were expected to grow faster than
    total Federal outlays in FY 1973 for the first time since FY 1965. Be-
    tween FY 1972 and 1973 R&D expenditures were expected to rise 3.6%,
    with total outlays up 2.6%. The Federal R&D percentage of the total
    was expected to be 7.3% in FY 1973. Of total outlays for space re-
    search and technology, 98% was expected to go toward R&D, but the
    R&D share of the total outlay for international affairs and finance,
    veterans benefits and services, general government, and income se-
    curity would be less than 1%. Functions other than national defense
    and space R&T had increased emphasis on R&D significantly 1963-1973,
    from 10% to an expected 23%. The trend toward more civilian-
    oriented programs within the Federal R&D total was continuing, with an
    expected rise of 2% between 1972 and 1973. (Text)

    environmental impact of the U S . SST by the Nixon Administration was
    realistic and should be approved by Congress â€œfor the nationâ€™s protec-

    seemed confident the space shuttle would be built. The President had
    supported the project â€œalthough his new budget message contained no
    mention of the space programâ€ and, â€œin Congress, it has survived
    handily all past attempts to kill it. The fact that the project helps
    sustain an aerospace industry that has suffered grievously from layoffs
    is a point lost on no one. And then too, NASA has going for it the fact
    that, both in Apollo and in the unmanned programs, it has generally
    met its goals and stayed within its budget.â€ Evidence existed â€œthat the
    President does indeed look to a possible revivalâ€ of the supersonic
    transport â€œbut not until later in the 1970â€™s. The new NASA budget con-
    tains $28 million-more than twice as much as last yearâ€™s budget-for

February 9-19: The U.S.S.R. ground control commanded the lunar ex-
    plorer Lunokhod 2 to unfold its solar battery panel and begin its
    second lunar day of exploration. The moon car explored its parking
    area-a     small deep crater with outcroppings of bedrock at its edge,
    formed 3 million yrs ago by a large meteorite that hit the surface of
    congealed lava. Lunokhod 2 made measurements of the magnetic field
    inside the crater by approaching it four times from different directions
    and making 120 precision maneuvers.
       The vehicle moved southeasterly to the Taurus Mountains. En route
    it measured physicomechanical properties of the soil and tension of the
    local magnetic fields, took panoramic photos of surrounding terrain, and
    tested riding characteristics of the lunar vehicle in various modes of
    operation. A monolith one meter (three feet) long of unusual lunar
    material was discovered Feb. 13. The plate had a strong, smooth surface
     unlike surrounding pockmarked stones and appeared to be much
    younger.
        During exploration of the giant crater Lunokhod 2 skidded and
    swerved over 2.3 km (1.4 mi) of difficult terrain with slopes up to 25"
     and sank in dust to the hub of its wheels as it ascended the rim of the
    crater. At the top of the rim, TV cameras showed a complex surface
     with ejecta piled on the rims of lunar holes formed when three
     meteorites hit the area within millions of years. Lunokhod 2 descended

February 11: Rising costs of the Skylab missions were discussed by
    Thomas Oâ€™Toole in a Washington Post article: Nearly $400 million had
    been added to cost estimates since the Skylab program had originated
    seven years ago. Postponement of the first Skylab launch from April to
    May had added $5 million in overtime costs and NASA had conceded
    another two-week delay and $5 million in additional costs was possible.
    Another reason for skyrocketing costs was the post-Apollo switch of
    emphasis from the moon and planets to the earth. Skylabâ€™s original
    purpose had been to study the sun and addition of the earth studies
    program on Skylab had added greatly to costs.
      Skylab was the flagship of the U S . manned space program. It was
    the â€œmost impressive machine ever built,â€ weighing 90 metric tons
    (100 U S . tons) and providing living quarters equal to a three-bedroom
    house. Scientists saw Skylab as the link between the first decade of space
    exploration and the 198Os, when the reusable shuttle would become
    operational. It would provide much information about effects on the
    human body of long periods in space. The last of three Skylab crews
    might stay in space for 70 days. â€œIf they make it that long without any
    serious side effects, they will have done as much for space exploration
    as any of the pioneers before them.â€ (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, A l )
February 12: A statement by Western Union International, Inc., Vice
    President Thomas S. Greenish that mainland China had no plans for
    establishment of a domestic satellite communications system was quoted
    by Aviation Week & Space Technology. Greenish had returned from

      cations Satellite Organization ( INTELSAT) went into effect, replacing
      the interim arrangements in effect since August 1964. Under the
      agreements, INTELSAT would operate under a four-component struc-
      ture of a Board of Governors, Assembly of Parties, Meeting of Signa-
      tories, and an Executive Organ. The Board would have primary
      responsibility for design, development, construction, establishment,
      operation, and management of the comsat system. The Assembly-
      composed of a representative of the government of each member
      nation-would meet every two years to consider matters of concern
      to the governments. The Meeting of Signatories-representatives        of
      governments or telecommunications entities-would convene annually
      to consider operational and other matters of interest to investors. Each
      member of the Meeting would have one vote.
         The Executive Organ would be headed by a Secretary General
      responsible to the Board of Governors for performance of financial and
      administrative services. Under the agreements, Communications Satellite
      Corp. would furnish technical and operating management services for

∞An Aviation Week & Space Technology cover photo showed orange and
     black particles brought back from the moonâ€™s Shorty Crater by Apollo
     17 astronauts during the Dec. 7-19, 1972, mission. Particles were
   . described by the magazine as 20 to 45 pm in size-â€œabout the size of
     terrestrial silt.â€ They were â€œglass, but in a process of devitrification,
     that is transition from non-crystalline form to crystalline minerals.â€ The
     orange soil was â€œrich in titanium-8%-and           iron oxide-22%-but
     is also high in zinc.â€ ( A v W k , 2/12/73, cover, 20)
  ∞The U.S.S.R. had launched three times as many reconnaissance satellites
     as the U S . during 1972 but had achieved only 25% more time in orbit
     because of the expanding U S . use of long-endurance â€œBig Birdâ€
     spacecraft, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. The U.S.S.R.
     had obtained 366 days in orbit for its Cosmos satellites; the U.S. total
     was 295 days.
         An improved design of U.S.S.R. reconnaissance satellites had been
     used for 80% of the launches, the magazine said. The new design
     provided for ejection of hardware-probably       a vernier propulsion unit
     -one or two days before spacecraft recovery. The propulsion unit was
     used to change the spacecraft orbital path to bring it directly over the
     ground target. Spacecraft might also be equipped with high-resolution,
     narrow-field-of-view cameras for a close-look mission.
         Three of a total eight U S . launches had been new-generation Big
     Bird satellites equipped with a giant high-resolution camera, the
     magazine said. The remaining satellites had been launched by a Titan
     IIIB-Agena booster, while the number of launches using the Thorad
     booster had continued to decline. The mission of the Titan IIIB-launched
     spacecraft was probably changing from mainly close-look to both close-
     look and search-and-find missions and used as gap fillers for the high-
     cost Big Birds. ( A v Wk, 2/12/73, 50-51)

Febrmry 13: Pioneer-G, the second Jupiter-mission spacecraft, arrived at
      Kennedy Space Center in preparation for the opening of the launch
      window on April 5. If successfully launched with an accurate trajectory
      in the first few days of window, the spacecraft, designated Pioneer 11,
      might be programmed to acquire sufficient speed from the Jupiter
      flyby to continue to Saturn. When the spacecraft reached the Jupiter
      vicinity in January 1975, Jupiter and Saturn would be nearly aligned.
      The spacecraft could, under favorable conditions, acquire part of
      Jupiterâ€™s orbital velocity during the flyby to speed it to Saturn. The
      predecessor Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972) had been the first
      spacecraft to undertake an outer planetary mission. It was due to arrive
      at Jupiter in December 1974. (KSC Release 27-73)

  ∞The mission of Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite-launched





    July 23, 1972, to determine feasibility of exploring earth from space-
    had exceeded all expectations, John N. Wilford said in a New York
    Times article. During seven months since the satellite had been put into
    a polar, sun-synchronous orbit, it had produced 125000 photos, sur-
    veyed earth resources, and monitored crop growth, glacier advances,
    and spread of pollution and population.
       With scanners measuring reflected light in both visible and infrared
    bands, Erts 1 had discovered previously unmapped fractures branching
    off the San Andreas fault, prepared a detailed map of cracks and faults
    in lhe Wind River Mountains, traced linear terrain features where India
    had slammed into Asia millions of years earlier, produced accurate
    maps of the U.S. underground water supply, discovered two hitherto
    unknown lakes in Iran, and provided better knowledge of the Amazon
    River basin. (Wilford, NYT, 2/13/73, 22)

February 15: NASAâ€™s      Pioneer 10 probe, on its way to the planet Jupiter,
     safely completed its crossing of the Asteroid Belt, NASA announced at a
     Headquarters press conference. Launched March 2, 1972, the space-
     craft had completed the 430-million-km (27O-million-mi), seven-month
     trip through the belt with no damaging hits from asteroid particles. Dr.
     William H. Kinard, Langley Research Center scientist, said NASA was
     â€œfirmly convinced that the Asteroid belt presents little hazard to future
     spacecraft going out to explore outer planets.â€ Pioneer 10 had en-
     countered an average of one large particle of 0.1- to 1-mm (0.004- to
     0.04-in) dia a day and had come within 1640 million km (400 million
     mi) of only one asteroid over 10 m (33 ft) in diameter. Particle encoun-
     ters had been observed by measuring sunlight scatter of particles by tele-
     scopes and by pressurized cells that leaked when penetrated by a
     particle. Pioneer 10 project scientist Dr. John H. Wolfe of Ames
     Research Center said the asteroid distribution was fairly uniform.
     Pioneer 10 had made the most distant observations of solar atmosphere
      and solar wind to date and had found that the sunâ€™s atmosphere ex-
     panded with distance while the solar wind slowed but heated up with
      distance. The spacecraft had covered 70% of its 1-billion-km (620-
      million-mi) flight and would reach Jupiter Dec. 3. After exploring
      Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere it would escape the solar system. Pioneer-G,
      scheduled for April launch, would travel a similar course to Jupiter.

    had indicated that aerodynamic (nonengine) noise might be a signifi-
    cant portion of total aircraft noise. Knowledge of sources could aid in
    designing quieter aircraft. Tests had been made with twin-engine,
    propeller-driven aircraft at Flight Research Center. Flights with twin-
    engine jet aircraft were planned for late January; flights with four-
    engine jet aircraft were being considered. (NASA Release 73-22)

  ∞Five hundredth anniversary of the birth of Polish astronomer Nicolaus
    Copernicus, who was the first to propound the theory that the earth
     moved around the sun. A New York Times editorial said: â€œToday, after
     centuries of development of Copernican ideas we know that the earth
     and this solar system are a relatively unimportant byway in a universe
     with billions of stars and of similar solar systems. Statistically, the
     probability is high that there are other sentient forms of life in the
     universe, separated from us by uncountable light years and perhaps
     exceeding our species in understanding. Copernicus thus should be
     honored today both as the founder of modern science and as a pioneer
     of a more realistic understanding of manâ€™s place in the universe.â€ ( N Y T ,

     NASA then had had bba    balanced and productive program which did not
     include any â€˜built-inâ€™ commitments that would require a higher total
     level of NASA funding in future years.â€
        NASAâ€™s FY 1974 budget represented a change in this plan. â€œTo meet
     the necessary constraints on total Government spending in FY 1973 and

      gram objectives were generally the same, â€œeven though some of them
      will necessarily be achieved at later dates. For this reason, NASA budgets
      in future years will have to increase. . . . This need is recognized in
      the preliminary projections for FY 1975.â€ NASA was â€œhandling the
      reductions in our FY 1973 and FY 1974 budget plans in a way that
      will not increase the levels of future funding required above those
      projected last year.â€ Dr. Fletcher believed this to be minimum level
      for space and aeronautics program U S . should support. The programâ€™s
      major elkmentsspace shuttle, unmanned planetary and scientific mis-
      sions, space applications and aeronautics program components, and
      others-â€œare ones that have been presented and approved in previous
      years.â€ NASA had â€˜â€˜squeezed and stretched the program about as far as
      we can. In some of the reductions we have made in FY 1973 and FY
      1974 we may have gone too far. Any further significant reductions
      would mean a real loss in a key element of the program.â€
          NASA was requesting FY 1974 funds for an advanced supersonic
      technology program to provide technology for future military super-
      sonic aircraft, data to assess environmental and economic impacts on the
      U S . of present and future foreign supersonic aircraft, and a â€œsound
      technical basis for any future consideration that may be given by the
      United States to the development of an environmentally acceptable and
      economically viable commercial supersonic transport.â€ The request did
      not include funds for initiating SST development and did not commit
      the US. to development.

    minish biological productivity of oceans, and adversely affect many
    useful insects. Emission of nitrogen oxide from SST engine exhaust
    would lessen ozone content of the upper atmosphere and increase the
    amount of uv radiation reaching the earth. In addition to increased

       Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight, testified that a thorough analysis of the space shuttleâ€™s possible
    environmental effects had been made in 1972 and a report had been
    filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. The shuttleâ€™s effect on
    atmosphere, water, and noise would be â€œminimal and below allowable
    limits.â€ Safeguards to be added would further minimize any potential
    environmental impact. NASA and Dept. of Defense studies with space-
    experienced companies to determine the reduction in satellite costs by
    use of the shuttle for launch and retrieval had shown â€œpayload costs
    reductions of 40 to 50 percentâ€ from â€œpresent-day payload costs.â€ Plans
    for FY 1974 called for â€œan orderly buildupâ€™â€™ in prime and subcon-
    tractor manpower for the orbiter and space shuttle main engine de-
    velopment and award of contracts for all remaining major elements
    of the shuttle, including the external tank and solid rocket booster.
    FY 1974 funds, although less than requested, would provide for â€œan
    expanded scope of design, development, and testing activities and for
    continuation of subsystems and component development.â€
        Director Douglas R. Lord of NASAâ€™s     Sortie Lab Task Force testified
    that the lab would be designed for installation in the space shuttleâ€™s
    cargo bay â€œto allow nonastronaut scientists to use nearly conventional
    laboratory equipment at orbital altitudes.â€ The lab would consist of
     a closed, pressurized module for experimenters and their laboratory
     subsystems and apparatus, as well as a pallet section exposed to space
     when the payload bay doors were opened, for large sensors requiring
     space exposure, such as telescopes. The pallet could be used either
     with the pressurized module or separately, mounted in the payload bay
     and supported by the shuttle orbiter. The sortie lab would provide â€œan

   tist, described â€œlunar cataclysm.â€ Lunar dust brought back by Apollo
   astronauts had been estimated to be as old as 4.5 billion yrs. But most
   lunar rocks were less than 4 billion yrs old and none were younger
   than 3 billion yrs. The best explanation was that 3.9 billion y ~ agos
   the moon was battered and bombarded on an unprecedented scale,
   creating so much heat that old rocks were destroyed and a new genera-
   tion of rocks was created. Since then the moon might have experienced
   minor volcanic eruptions but nothing like that period of cataclysm.
       Some scientists believed the moon had cooled and gone into a period
   of hibernation. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of the State Univ. of New York
   said even the orange soil found by Apollo 17 astronauts had turned out
   to be 3.71 billion yrs old, an age disappointing to scientists who had
   believed the moon had been formed by more recent volcanic activity.
       Dr. Keith A. Howard, US. Geological Survey geologist, compared
   the lunar landslide found near the ApoZlo 17 landing site to a large,
   high-velocity avalanche on earth. Dr. Howard suggested that gas within
   the lunar soil had been released during the slide. Apollo 17 samples
    would be searched for evidence of fluids.
       One Apollo 17 instrument placed on the lunar surface had made an
    atom-by-atom search for evidence of lunar atmosphere. Although the
    moon had no atmosphere, traces of argon, neon, and helium had been
    found. Dr. John H. Hoffman, associate professor of physics at the
    Univ. of Texas, said only argon appeared to have been generated from
    the moonâ€™s interior. Neon and helium apparently had been deposited
    by the solar wind.
       Conference attendees unanimously voted to congratulate NASA on
    completion of the Apollo program by sending a letter to Dr. James C.
    Fletcher, NASA Administrator: The conception, design, and implementa-
    tion of lunar exploration represented â€œan extraordinary human and
    technological achievement.â€ To explore another planet, it had been
    necessary for man â€œto achieve many successive levels of technological
    capability and to surpass formidable barriers. This was accomplished
    brilliantly by the dedicated engineers and astronauts of NASA in con-
    junction with skilled management. On this technical base a new branch
    of science has been built.â€ (Transcript ; Goddard News, 3/73, 2 ;

  ∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified on long-term objec-
     tives during the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space
    Sciences hearings on the FY 1974 NASA authorization. Among effects
     of space and aeronautics on â€œall Americans and, to a degree, people
     throughout the world, in 1985,â€ he foresaw a rise in air cargo revenues
     from the current $1.6 billion per year to $14 billion per year, with
     development of automated handling and compatible aircraft. Trade
     and tourism would flourish with the use of hypersonic jet aircraft,
     â€œwhich we will be thinking about in 1985 and maybe other nations
     will have developed.â€ Such an aircraft could fly from Washington to
     Peking in 1 / hrs. Hydrogen fuel that produced water rather than
                  12
     pollutant fumes would replace present aviation fuels.
        In space, Dr. Fletcher saw a proliferation of domestic satellites lead-
     ing to economic use of long-distance telephone calls for â€œdiscussing
     almost anything.â€ Large-scale digital computers-spinoffs of the space
     age-would be used educationally ; â€œcomputer-aided instruction is the
     coming thing. This is the quickest way to learn if we can afford to
     build the system, and by 1985, we think we can.â€ Other NASA objec-
                                            to 15 yrs were a satellite-operated

 ∞The House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on
   Aeronautics and Space Technology opened its hearings on the FY
   1974 NASA authorization. Rep. Ken Hechler (D-W. Va.) , Committee
   Chairman, said the Subcommittee would be particularly concerned
   with â€œthe extent of progress toward the enunciation of a national
   aeronautics and aviation policy.â€ The Subcommittee had been partially
   responsible, he said, for the reduction of emphasis on aeronautics be-
   cause it was â€œnot aggressive enough in its insistence that more em-
   phasis be placed on aeronautics during . . . the late 1950â€™s when the
   Committee was first established, and the early 1960â€™s when the tre-
                                                             .
   mendous emphasis on space tended to push aeronautics . . into the
   background.â€
      Roy P. Jackson, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and
   Space Technology, testified that reorientation of NASAâ€™sspace and aero-
   nautical programs to meet changing national goals had been completed
   â€œwithout jeopardizing the continuing development of a broad base for
   new knowledge, and the potential for meeting future, but presently un-
   seen, needs.â€ In the OAST aeronautics program the research and technol-
   ogy base took priority over experimental programs. The R&T base was
   â€œwork that is unparalleled in the U.S. It is the data base from which
   springs new ideas for development in the future.â€ When faced with
   the necessity to cut expenditures, â€œwe had to consider primarily a re-
   duction in our work on flight experiments and experimental programs.â€
   Among examples of meeting future needs, hydrogen as a long-term
   aircraft fuel for the distant future was a â€œconcept of potential major
   importance to the reduction of air pollution, while simultaneously con-
   serving our increasingly scarce petroleum reserves.â€ Hydrogen elimi-
   nated hydrocarbon pollution and was â€œa more efficient fuel, but the
   reduction of NO, [oxides of nitrogen] may require additional effort.â€
   The â€œearliest likely commercial use of hydrogen as an aircraft fuel will
   be about 15 to 20 years hence.â€ Hydrogen was â€œa low-density, cryo-
   genic fuel which represents problems of relatively large, insulated
   tanks, the need for materials to keep their strength through wide tem-
   perature variations, very low temperature hardware including pumps,
   valves, seals and associated maintenance. In addition to cost, hydrogen
                                        .
   is difficult to store and transport. . . Our experience with the prac-
   tical use of liquid hydrogen in NASAâ€™s     space program suggests that
   there will be some complexities to solve but these should not be in-
   surmountable.â€
      Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Tech-
   nology in OAST, reported on the quiet, clean, short-haul experimental
   engine (QCSEE)program to integrate and demonstrate technology re-
   quired for an environmentally acceptable and economical powered-lift
   propulsion system. â€œQCSEE will utilize a basic existing engine core,

      fans and turbines to build up an experimental engine. This, together
      with appropriate flight-type acoustic nacelles and wing section instal-
      lations, will be tested for noise and performance and operating char-
      acteristics. The design and test program will provide the technology
      base needed to help guide Government . . . environmental rulemaking
      and to provide industry with data to evaluate propulsion concept
      effectiveness and development risks.â€
         George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in
      OAST, described the status of aeronautics programs after revisions neces-
      sitated by FY 1974 budget restrictions. The General Electric Co. quiet
      engine contract had been completed and both engines delivered to
      NASA. Engines A and C were scheduled for extensive in-house research
      programs at Lewis Research Center. An in-house study underway at
      LeRc would determine the technical value of another contracted effort,
      for a second-generation quiet engine. â€œIn the meantime, we are work-
      ing to generate component noise design and performance data, so
      that a significant noise reduction below that demonstrated by the first
      Quiet Engine can be obtained in any future engine program. No im-
      portant area in aeronautical propulsion has been terminated, although
      funding levels for certain portions of the aeronautics programs have
      been readjusted based on a review of priorities. The F-8 high-speed
      supercritical wing verification project was not cut back or terminated.
      During FY 1973, the project was completed according to plan. The
      results were very encouraging and gave confidence as to wind-tunnel
      test results at transonic speeds.â€ A follow-on to the F-8 was under
      study. Depending upon results, a follow-on F-8 flight-test program
      might be undertaken in FY 1975. (Transcript)

      Science and Astronautics continued hearings on NASAâ€™s           FY 1974
      authorization. Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned
      Space Flight, identified locations for space shuttle development: Ken-
      nedy Space Center and Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., as the
      launch and landing sites; NASAâ€™s    Michoud Assembly Facility for the
      external tank production; and the Rockwell International Corp. facility
      at Downey, Calif., for orbiter and systems integration. â€œThe major
      unknown, at the moment, is where the solid rocket boosters will be
      produced and tested. We expect that this location will be identified when
      the solid fueled rocket booster contract is awarded this November.â€
         Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration
      in OMSF, contrasted a typical operational communications satellite pro-
      gram using expendable launch vehicles with one using the space shuttle.
      Launched on the Titan IIIB-Centaur launch vehicle, each spacecraft was
      estimated at 467 kg (1030 Ibs) . To fulfill 1979-1990 requirements for
      reliable communications services, 26 spacecraft would be required. Use
      of the Titan IIIB-Centaur would require 26 new spacecraft and 26
      new launch vehicles, at an average cost for each flight of $25.8 million.
         â€œIf the same program is carried out using the Shuttle and Tug, the
      cost changes significantly. First, with the Shuttle we can apply the
      low cost approaches to payload design. We are no longer constrained
      by weight limitations ; therefore, we can ruggedize the spacecraft
      structure, simplify the design and verification test program, and thus
      reduce both development and unit spacecraft cost.â€ The shuttle and

       map, and identify pollution in large lakes, bays and estuaries, as well
       as to obtain temperature information over land areas. NASA had shifted
       the emphasis of the earth observation aircraft program because of
       Erts 1 (launched July 23, 1972) and Skylab (scheduled for May
       launch). â€œHeretofore the aircraft program was principally used to test
       instruments and to investigate techniques. It is now to be used in sup-
       port of investigations associated with Earth observation spacecraft.
       The net effect is an increase . . . of aircraft flights, sensors and data
       processing. The aircraft program capability will be devoting approxi-
       mately 80 percent of its time to this latter effort and the remainder
       will be used in experimental work on new instruments.â€ (Transcript)

∞Roy P. Jackson, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space
    Technology, testified on aeronautical programs before the House Com-
    mittee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and
    Space Technology during FY 1974 NASA authorization hearings: â€œNASAâ€™s
    advanced transport technology (ATT) program is aimed at expediting
    technology advances that could facilitate development of environ-
    mentally acceptable, and economically superior, next-generation U S .
    air transports. The ATT system studies have shown that by the early
     1980â€™s a new subsonic/sonic transport-quieter,          cleaner, safer, and
    more economical than the current wide-body jet transports-could be
    realized through technology advances which could be ready for com-
    mitment to application late in the 1970â€™s. These advances would in-
    clude supercritical aerodynamics and related configuration treatment,
    techniques for suppression of engine noise and emissions, composite
     structures, and active control systems.â€ The studies would be extended
    in FY 1974 â€œby concentrating more heavily on the system improvement
    tradeoffs, and corresponding technology, involved in optimizing design
     for efficient terminal operations as well as cruise performance.â€
        An analysis and wind-tunnel test program would investigate the
     sources and the reduction of airframe noise. â€œRecent studies and flight
     tests have indicated that as we continue to reduce engine source noise,
     it may also be necessary . . . to treat airframe noise.â€ Further testing
     of airframe shielding and analyses would determine the operational
     and economic feasibility of new concepts like the yawed-wing, low-
     supersonic design being investigated at Ames Research Center. Pro-
     pulsion technology programs underway would examine further noise
     reduction potential than that already being demonstrated in the con-
     ventional takeoff and landing aircraft experimental quiet engine pro-
     gram. When results were promising, plans for a follow-on CTOL experi-
     mental quiet engine, Mark 11, would be developed.
        The terminal-configured vehicles and avionics program, â€œa major
     new thrust in NASA research,â€ was described by George W. Cherry,
     Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in OAST : â€œWhile under-
     taken primarily to achieve increased capacity and quieter operations
     in the terminal area, this research will also aim at . . . improved ac-
     curacy, reliability, and automation of instrument flight in the approach,

 ∞The House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee 011
   Aeronautics and Space Technology continued hearings on the FY 19743
   NASA authorization.
      George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in
   the NASA Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology, described the
   Dept. of Transportation Climatic-Impact Assessment Program ( CIAP) ,
   in which NASA was cooperating: The CIAP â€œundertakes to assess the
   potential impact on the atmosphere of large fleets of SSTS [supersonic
   transports] operating in the eighties and the biological consequences
   of their potential modification of the stratosphere. We are cooperating
   with DOT by contributing to the technology needs of CIAP, with partic-
   ular emphasis on the levels to which pollution can be limited.â€ Contra-
   dictory requirements for civil transport aircraft (low-fuel consumption
   engines required by SSTS for good range and payload characteristics,
   tended to be extremely noisy in terminal areas) might be best met
   by variable-cycle engines that varied their mode of operation in each
   condition of the flight profile. NASA would â€œintensively study variable
   cycle-engine concepts in FY 1974.â€
      Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Teeh-
   nology in OAST, testified that hypersonic research for potential appli-
   cation to military and civil airbreathing cruise vehicles was directed
   at â€œthe critical aspects of propulsion, structures, and aerodynamics
   for this flight regime where hydrogen is used both as the fuel and as
   a coolant.â€ Hydrogen was the most likely candidate for hypersonic air-
   craft fuel because its high coolant capacity was essential for a propul-
   sion system to survive in the high-temperature environment, and liquid
   hydrogenâ€™s coolant capacity could cool portions of the vehicleâ€™s struc-
   ture away from the engine area. NASAâ€™S structures and materials pro-
   gram provided essential technology for designing lightweight, reliable,
   actively cooled structures and advanced the technology of actively cool-
   ing structures heated to high temperatures. The program also extended
   shuttle technology on reusable surface insulation toward hypersonic
    cruise application.
      Flight Research Center test pilot Gary E. Krier testified on NASAâ€™s
    digital fly-by-wire program to develop an all-electric flight-control
   system using intelligence inserted into the digital computer memory.
    â€œWe did this by using refurbished Apollo equipment and two surplus
    [Navy] F-8 fighters. Using this approach, we estimate we flew about
   2 years earlier than we otherwise could have.â€™â€™ To date, NASA had flown
    15 DFBW flights with no major problems. â€œAirliners that weâ€™ll ride in
   the 1980â€™s could profit from fly-by-wire in the form of smooth flight
    at very high speeds and the near elimination of the response to tur-
    bulence by computer application of smoothing controls.â€ The â€œbest
    use of FBWâ€ was to build a control-configured vehicle [CCV] with
    reduced drag, increased lift, and slower approach and landing speeds.
    â€œIt has been estimated that landing speed could be cut by 25 percent

    and range increased 15 percent with no sacrifice in mission capability,
    just by modifying existing aircraft. A much larger improvement in
    performance could be gained by starting from scratch with FBW. We
    have been refining aircraft for years now, and the FBW/CCV combina-
    tion gives us a chance to make a quantum jump in aircraft perform-
    ance.â€ (Transcript)

  ∞Photo-mapping of Mars by Mariner 9 (launched May 30, 1971) had re-
    vealed multiple circular features surrounding both poles which might
    indicate that the Martian north and south poles had moved, California
    Institute of Technology scientists reported in Science. Some of the
    concentric patterns were centered on points displaced from the present
    north and south poles of Mars, implying that these were ancient po-
    sitions of the poles and testifying to a slow drift of the Martian spin
    axis. Such a drift of the earth axis could explain the evidence for radical
    climate changes in the past-fossil coral reefs in Greenland and fossil
    forests in the South Pole-and revive the debate with scientists who
    believed the climate changes were due to the constant moving of the

    tion from detailed design to development phase of NASAâ€™s
    gram (in which the first manned flight was planned for 1978) and
    the updated cost, performance, and status of the Skylab program (to
    be completed in 1973). The Subcommittee concluded that technology
    and resources existed for successful development of the NASA configu-
     ration for an earth-orbital shuttle and that the shuttle design would per-
    mit the total development cost to stay within $5.15 billion and the
    per-flight operational cost within $10.5 million. Success in meeting this
    cost was â€œparticularly sensitiveâ€ to the cost of the hydrogen-oxygen
    tanks and an acceptable recoverable and refurbishment cost of the
    solid-fueled rocket boosters. Space tug development was â€œof key im-
    portance to gaining full utility of the space shuttle.â€ Development of
    a low-cost space shuttle system was essential â€œif the nation is to realize

    The amount of water vapor could not produce dense clouds nor con-
    tribute significantly to a greenhouse effect. (Janssen et al., Science,

  ∞Problems of the European space program were described in a Science
    article by Dominique Verguese of Paris Le Monde: Since 1964 the
    European Space Research Organization and the European Launcher
    Development Organization had spent $1 billion on space. One third
    had been used for the successful launchings of seven satellites but the
    remainder had been spent on an expensive and yet unsuccessful booster.
    Interest in the booster had dissipated despite the French desire to con-
     tinue and the offer to pay for 60% to 70% of the costs.
        At two European conferences on space (December 1971 and Decem-
    ber 1972) plans were made to merge ELDO and ESRO into a single
    agency and to allow member nations to cooperate with NASA on build-
    ing a sortie lab for the space shuttle. France had threatened to leave
    ESRO unless more emphasis was placed on applications satellites and
     ESRO closed its plasma laboratory in Italy and its sounding rocket
     range in Sweden. France had also insisted that more use be made of
    national facilities and teams rather than ESROâ€™S technical center.
        Final agreements and objectives on a European applications satellite
     could not be made because of the conflicting interests of each nation.
    Nor could it be decided what role national programs should play. But
     Europe had successfully launched 26 satellites and had acquired an
     industrial competence which could easily provide a firm basis for more
     ambitious projects. (Science, 3/9/73, 9 8 4 9 8 6 )
  ∞Experiments by international groups using the intersecting storage rings
    of the European Nuclear Research Center (CERN) on the Swiss-French
     border had shown that protons grow when accelerated to great energy,
     the New York Times reported. New questions were raised as to what
     would happen within the nucleus of an atom that was packed with
     protons and neutrons and subjected to high-energy acceleration. Ex-
     periments had indicated that the proton-once thought a homogenous
     building block of the atomic nucleus-harbored processes and forces
     yet to be discovered. (Sullivan, NYT, 3/9/73, 1 )

    In a spacecraft so full of safety valves and designed redundancies â€œit
    had seemed incredible that two of three fuel cells from the two liquid
    oxygen tanks in the service module could go dead. . . . But to lose
    two fuel cells and then eventually two oxygen tanks? Not possible.â€
    Command module pilot John L. Swigert, Jr., had said after the mission
    that if anyone had thrown at the crew a simulation of what actually
    happened â€œtheyâ€™d have thought it unrealistic.â€ To have had less than
    this confidence, McElroy said, would have been unrealistic. The care
    and skill with which the many teams of NASA technicians work, plus
    the computers whose development may be â€œthe main reason NASA
    could achieve a moon landing so soonâ€ had created â€œan efficiency as
    unprecedented as the Apollo 13 disaster was implausible to the engi-
    neers at Houston Mission Control.â€ Cooperâ€™s â€œplain, detailed picture
    of the teams at their consoles and in discussion and over the intercom
    â€˜loopâ€™ and under the adroit supervision of Eugene Krantz, a flight di-
    rector who was unquestionably an executive hero of Apollo 13, gives
    their work a fascinating muscle and texture that might surprise those
    inclined to think this side of NASA boring.â€ (IVYT Book Review,

    significant current project is Viking, a program to continue the ex-
    ploration of Mars with two automated spacecraft during the 1975-76
    opportunity.â€ A Mariner spacecraft would be launched in October
    or November toward Venus. â€œAS the Mariner passes close to Venus
    its path will be bent and it will be accelerated toward . . . Mercury.
    If all goes well, we will make our deepest penetration toward the sun and
    get our first view of the sun-scorched Mercury. Pioneer G is ready
    for shipment to Cape Kennedy. It will be launched in April 1973 and
    will follow Pioneer 10 [launched March 2, 19723 through the asteroid
    belt to explore Jupiter.
       â€œWe are proceeding with the development of the two Mariner space-
    craft planned for launch to Jupiter and Saturn in 1977. The experi-
    ments and experiment teams have been selected. We are proceeding
    also with spacecraft design and will be purchasing some of the sub-

    common subsystems and leftover Viking hardware is helping us to
    minimize costs on this project. The major manned mission of 1973
    is . . . Skylab, which will have many scientific experiments aboard.
    The most important and the largest . . . is the Apollo Telescope Mount
     (ATM) , which contains five major experiments using eight scientific
    instruments, all devoted to observing and studying the sun. This com-
    plex assembly of solar instruments is designed to be man-operated in
    a manner similar to a ground-based observatory. The ATM is now
    assembled as part of Skylab, awaiting launch in May 1973. An inter-

    fied on special applications programs: â€œThe Earth and Ocean Physics
    Applications Program ( EOPAP) is an interrelated series of projects
    directed to the solution of important problems in earth and ocean
    dynamics that can best be addressed by the application of space tech-
    niques. Major areas of EOPAP are (a) global monitoring, reporting
    and forecasting of ocean-surface conditions and (b) monitoring of
    motions of the whole earth and its crust to obtain a better understanding
    of the processes that produce earthquakes, with the expectation that
    this will lead to the development of techniques for predicting the oc-

    nology Roy P. Jackson testified on the shuttle technology programs
    before the House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommit-
    tee on Aeronautics and Space Technology during FY 1974 authorization
    hearings: With the shuttle under development, the program had been
    converted from preparing technology to assisting in development. With
    this transition, â€œwe have reduced in fiscal year 1973, and will further
    reduce in fiscal year 1974, our rate of Shuttle-oriented resource invest-
    ments,â€ but wind tunnels and arc jets would play a key role in shuttle
    development. Aerodynamic and heat-transfer investigations at subsonic
    through hypersonic speeds in simulated shuttle ascent would focus
    on effects of the rocket plume and separation of rocket engines. Wind-
    tunnel and structural laboratory vibration tests of scale models would
    provide vehicle dynamic-response characteristics. Additional tests in
    high-temperature wind tunnels would determine structural behavior
    and integrity of thermal protection systems and supporting structure
    for simulated earth-atmosphere-entry environments. About 14 wind tun-
     nels would be used in the program.

    tricity at four to five times the approximately 6 percent efficiency of
    current RTGâ€™S [radioisotope thermoelectric generators]. Work in fiscal

    was intended to provide a multidisciplinary earth observations capa-
    bility to support the areas of meteorology, environmental quality, earth
    resources and, in some respects, the earth and ocean physics program.
    The system would be the first major shuttle-compatible spacecraft with
    modularity, giving ability to retrieve and repair modular elements of
    the spacecraft, and the spacecraft might also be modular in basic
    size. â€œWe may be able to build up a different size and weight space-
    craft, using these modular techniques.â€ Elements were expected to
    serve the several disciplines without significant changes in components
    through the modular buildup.

    revolution brought about by Apollo on the Moon with the simultaneous
    revolution brought about by new insight into the origins of ocean basins
    and continents on the Earth, we may begin to understand the great
    stresses and strains within our crust as ocean floors grow and continents
    move. These stresses and strains profoundly affect the everyday lives of
    people living within belts of present earthquakes and volcanic activity.
    Within future understanding of the frozen ocean of basalt of [Oceanus]
    Procellarum and the vast ridge and volcanic system that splits it, may
    lie the simplification of thought about past events that leads to the ex-
    pansion of thoughts about present events. I will be the first to admit
    that these last comments give free run to the imagination. However,
    knowledge never becomes a resource until it is married to imagination.
    It is thus . . . that the scientific legacy of Apollo will be realized.â€
       Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Marshall Space Flight Center Director and
    former Apollo Program Director, reported the status of the five scientific
    stations deployed on the moon during the Apollo program: The first
    station deployed by Apollo 12, in November 1969, â€œis still functioning
    over 3 years after its initial deployment in the very demanding environ-
    ment of the Moon. . . . The fact that this equipment can stand these
    rigors of temperature and vacuum . . . and still function , . . demonstrates
    one facet of the technology we have developed.â€ All five stations were
    still functioning, though some of the experiments had been lost. The
    first total station, on Apollo 12, had been designed for a one-year life.
    â€œAnd yet we have had it over 3 years . . . and the seismometers worked
    beautifully all 3 years.â€ The superthermal ion detector was â€œworking
    beautifully and had for 3 years, night and day.â€ NASA had â€œfive seismic
    units just giving us beautiful information on the seismic tremors of
    the Moon and meteorite impacts, so now we can locate them fairly accu-
    rately.â€
       Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Life Sciences in OMSF, reported:

      We are vastly wiser in many medical and technical areas for our
    â€˜decade in space.â€™ Much has been learned about the effects of the space
    flight environment upon man. We have found that some body systems
    respond to space flight factors . . . with changes . . . observable in the
    period immediately following space flight. Occasionally changes have
    been noticeable during the inflight period of the mission. None of
    these changes has been of such a severity as to cause any real concern
    for manâ€™s safety in space, but all changes are . . . being watched closely
    lest they have implications for long duration flight.â€ Cardiovascular re-
    sponses which showed the greatest changes also appeared most amenable
    to regulation by inflight countermeasures, such as lower body negative
    pressure. Medication had not proved of value in treating either the
    cardiovascular deconditioning or the loss of exercise capacity. Counter-
    measures were also being investigated for the small bone density losses
    noted. A decrease in heart size had been noted in both U S . and Soviet
    space crewmen and some Soviet crewmen had experienced postflight
    muscular difficulties. â€œBoth astronauts and cosmonauts have also re-
    ported sensations resembling sea sickness during spaceflight. On the
    whole, however, US. astronauts do not appear to be excessively plagued
    by motion sickness symptoms. The growth of opportunistic micro-
    organisms appears to be favored in the space environment.â€ (Tran-

    spacecraft for communications to the Soyuz spacecraft over the Soviet
    communications link; the Soviet TV camera used in the Apollo space-
    craft would be in a fireproof hermetically sealed container; and the
    still camera and film used by the cosmonauts in Apollo would be stored
    in a flameproof container. The U S . would provide a 16 mm camera
    for Soviet use during docked operations in both Apollo and Soyuz
    spacecraft. Agreements were reached on the prescribed procedure if
    either country encountered anomalous results during test activities that
    concerned the other country and on mission planning for rendezvous.
       The groups agreed that additional testing was required on the dock-
    ing seals, that the U S . would limit Apollo control system thrusting in
    the roll axis to two thrusters to preclude excessive structural loads on
    the Soyuz spacecraft, and that an additional docking test could be per-
    formed on the second day, with the Apollo systems passive and the
    Soyuz active, Both countries agreed to perform and exchange safety
    assessments in fire, pyrotechnic devices, cabin pressure, and propulsion
    and control systems.

    contribution toward environmental improvement, in a speech before
    the 37th Annual Meeting of the National Wildlife Assn. in Washington,
    D.C.: â€œNO part of the changing, moving face of the globe we inhabit
    is free of human influence or removed from human interest. We there-
     fore can afford to leave no part unmonitored. From forest fires to
    hurricanes, from the slow erosion of granite hills to the short-lived
    volcanic eruption or avalanche, from the atmospheric particulates to
     crop diseases to oil spills-we      need to know the condition of our
    environment, minute by minute.â€ From this knowledge would flow the
     interrelated set of local, national, and international measures â€œthat
     will make our planet what we want it to be.â€ The key was â€œto know
    how they will be deployed and how they will be used. I personally be-
    lieve that the greatest lag today is in the development of mature social
     and political institutions to collect, manage, and act on the whole new
     level of environmental information we are able to generate.â€ The major
     impact of current activities, largely data collection by Erts 1 Earth
     Resources Technology Satellite (launched by NASA July 23, 1972),
     would be â€˜â€™to force the development of a new level of maturity on
     society.â€™â€™ NASAâ€™s were to extract, display, and use the information
                       jobs
     its tools could provide. â€œWe must develop and expand natural and pre-
     dictive models of the new environment . . . to provide . . . real assess-
     ments so necessary in real-world decision making.â€ The larger job was
     the â€œdevelopment of competent local, regional, national, and global in-

March 19: President Nixon submitted Aeronautics and Space Report of
     the President: 1972 Activities to Congress. He said in his transmittal
     message : â€œThe Apollo program was successfully concluded with the
     flights of Apollo 16 and 17. These missions were designed to obtain
     maximum scientific return and provided almost half the lunar explora-
     tion time in the Apollo program. Though it is far too early to attempt
     a definitive assessment of the value of this program, it is clear that one
     result will be a quantum jump in both our scientific knowledge and our
     technical expertise. Our unmanned satellites include a variety of ve-
     hicles ranging from meteorological, navigational and communication
     satellites to a new experimental spacecraft providing information on
     our resources and environment. Increasing practical applications for
     satellite technology confirm the immediate value of our efforts in space,
     while observatory satellites and others carrying specialized scientific
     instruments provide accurate and dependable data never before avail-
     able to scientists on earth. The conclusion of the Apollo programs marks
     only another step in this Nationâ€™s push into space.â€
        The year 1972 had also seen advances in aeronautical research and

∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, with other NASA officials,
    testified on the FY 1974 NASA authorization request in hearings before
    the House Committee on Science and Astronautics.
       Dr. Fletcher pointed out that the NASA request of $3.016 billion was
    down $400 million from FY 1973 but said the agency program was
    significant. In 1972 NASA had completed the transition from manned
    exploration to a focus on practical benefits, unmanned exploration,
    and development of the space shuttle â€œas the means to make more
    practical and more economical all future uses of space, unmanned
    and manned, especially for applications of economic, commercial, in-
    ternational, or national security significance.â€ Work on uses of the
    shuttle was â€œreinforcing our view that the Space Shuttle system will not
    only provide the launch capability needed for future space activities
    of all types but will revolutionize the ways in which space is used as
    well. The more the specialists in various fields look at the shuttleâ€™s
    capabilities, especially in the sortie mode, the more they see how its
    weight and volume capacity and flexible operations will permit them
    to carry out experiments and useful applications in a much simpler
    and economical manner.â€
       Assistant Administrator for Institutional Management Joseph F.
    Malaga testified that NASA Hq. would have 1581 permanent positions
    in FY 174 after agency reduction in force, or 6.3% of the total NASA
    Civil Service employment. â€œThis is down 600 positions from the 1968
    peak, when it represented 6.7 percent of the NASA total. Headquarters
    has thus kept its size consonant with agency size.â€
               policy on disposition of manpower and equipment necessi-
       NASAâ€™s
    tated by FY 1974 budget cuts was described by Richard C. McCurdy,
    Associate Administrator for Organization and Management, in a pre-
    pared statement: â€œWe are already well into the organization and opera-
    tion of a comprehensive program to identify specific employee prefer-
    ences and abilities and corresponding suitable potential employers. We
    have set up training for staff members in gathering job information and
    in counseling employees, and have arranged for a coordinated flow of
    information about job openings throughout NASA, and other Federal
    agencies, state and local government units, educational institutions and
    private industry. . . . But even more basic . . . is our recognition that
    these people represent a virtually irreplaceable national resource.â€ He
    referred not only to â€œthis highly talented and trained professional-
    technical work force but also to the complex of sophisticated plant and
    equipment which must be partially idled. . . . It would be unconscionable
    to permit key elements of Americaâ€™s aeronautics and space capability
    to be disbanded or retired without making every effort to keep them
    available for further service to the nation.â€

     FY 1974 authorization: â€œThe objective of the engine refan program . . .
     at Lewis Research Center is to demonstrate the feasibility and cost of
     significantly reducing the noise of current civil fleet engines. The JTSD,
     which powers the Boeing 727 and 737 and the McDonnell Douglas
     DC-9, will continue in extensive civil fleet use well into the 1980â€™s. The
     first JTSD refanned engine ground test is scheduled for January 1974.â€
     Flight tests would occur in FY 1975. Analysis of benefits from refanning
     indicated that approximately 50% greater community noise improve-
     ment could be gained from a fleet-wide JT8D refan retrofit than from
     a fleet-wide JT3D refan retrofit. The JT3D powered the four-engine
     Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. â€œThis analysis resulted in the decision
     in January to concentrate, within available resources, on the JT8D and
     to defer work on the JT3D.â€ NASAâ€™s      experimental quiet engine program
     had achieved its major goals during FY 1973 and would be continued
     in FY 1974. â€œAltitude performance tests . . . will start soon in the
     christening run of the Lewis Propulsion Laboratory expansion autâ€˜hor-
     ized in 1967. After initial acoustic testing, a sonic inlet, which chokes
     off forward sound propagation, will be added to engine C.â€ Technology

     mercial uses, especially in a city-and we are proceeding post haste with

      1974 NASA authorization hearings with testimony by NASA Associate
      Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski :
      The NASA Communications Nrtwork (NASCOM) â€œduring the life of the
      Apollo program advanced the expansion of communications satellites
      throughout thr world by relying solely on them for direct reliable com-
      munications from certain remote tracking stations where previously
      marginal communications were available.â€ Innovations in data trans-
      mission had been introduced to meet Apollo program data requirements,
      â€œand many of these new techniques have been adopted by other Govern-
      ment agencies, industry, and the developing countries of the world.â€ Ex-
      amples included network technical control and monitor techniques,
      high-data-rate transmission at low error rates, and the use of a single
      wideband channel for voice, data, or teletype, or any combination of
      them. â€œWorld standards for data transmission which were unique for
      Apollo . . . are now becoming commonplace. The NASCOM . . . has not
      only successfully completed every task assigned to it in support of our
      complex program, but during the process . . . has advanced the level of
      performance in overall communications systems.â€
         Assistant Administrator for Institutional Management Joseph F.
      Malaga and Associate Administrator for Organization and Management
      Richard C. McCurdy testified on NASA manpower adjustments necessi-
      tated by FY 1974 budgetary restrictions. A prepared statement by
      McCurdy said that college recruiting figures showed junior professionals
      recruited by NASA had dropped from 965 in 1966 to 56 in FY 1972 and
      rose only to 118 for the first half of FY 1973. â€œThe necessary reinvigora-
      tion of the organization through the introduction of new blood is thus
       not yet in sight, nor will it be until some stability in staffing and sup-
      porting funding has been assured.â€
          Assistant Administrator for International Affairs Arnold W. Frutkin
      testified on the 1975 US.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: â€œThe
      cooperation achieved with the Soviet Union seems to offer very consider-
       able promise. If United States and Soviet manned spacecraft can
       rendezvous, dock, and transfer crew members, both countries will have
      increased their chance of rescuing astronauts under stress without com-
       mensurate increases in the cost of standby rescue capabilities.â€ If suc-
      cessful, the ASTP mission would â€œpoint the way to future joint activities
      which should help both countries gain more in space than they would
      from separate programs.â€ (Transcript)

March 26: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified before the
    House Committee on Appropriationsâ€™ Subcommittee on Housing and
    Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans during hearings on NASA
    FY 1974 appropriations: â€œI recognize that in the allocation of funds
    to support the multitude of agencies and programs in the overall budget,
    hard decisions must be made each year based upon overall considera-
    tions of national priorities and needs. And with respect to NASA, hard
    decisions have already been made-in the past in cutting NASA spending
    almost in half and again this year in cutting NASA about $400 million
    below the level approved for FY 1973. But when we consider the bene-
    fits of NASAâ€™S programs-in advancing scientific knowledge, in explora-
    tion, in the practical applications of aeronautics and space, in
    contributing to international cooperation, and perhaps most importantly
    in advancing technology-and when we consider the NASA portion of the
    overall Federal budget for FY 1974 amounts to less than 1.2 percent,
    down from 4.3 percent in 1965, a factor of more than three-I           am

March 26-27: Adm. Thomas H. Moorer ( U S N ) , Chairman of the Joint
    Chiefs of Staff, delivered the report United States Military Posture for
    FY 1974 to the Senate Committee on Appropriationsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Defense Appropriations: Strategic parity existed between the U.S. and
    the U.S.S.R. â€œWhile the Soviet Union has a substantial advantage, not
    only in the numbers of strategic missiles, but also in missile throw-
    weight, the United States still has a substantial advantage in other areas
    of key importance to the overall strategic balance-e.g., missile ac-
    curacy, MIRVS [multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles], sub-
    marine quietness, sonars, and numbers of bombers and bomber payload.
    And, while the Soviet Union has enormous advantage in air defense,
    without an extensive ABM (antiballistic missile] defense . . . the air de-
    fense could be substantially undercut by ballistic missile attack, par-
    ticularly . . . a large number of MIRVS.â€ The U.S. advantages were trans-
    itory, resting on a â€œtechnological lead that has been steadily narrowing
    over the past decade.â€ With the momentum of the Soviet offensive re-
    search and development program, â€œwe cannot preclude the possibility
    that our technological lead in this area may further diminish or disap-
    pear altogether during the current decade.â€ Adm. Moorer believed â€œthat
    the Soviet Union will soon succeed in its efforts to develop an effective
    MIRV system for its strategic missiles. Thus, the Soviet Union may be
    able to challenge our lead in both missile guidance and MIRVS . . . , and
    thereby pose a significant threat to our Minuteman force.â€ (Text)

April 3-May 28: The U.S.S.R. launched unmanned Salyut 2 scientific
    space station from Baykonur Cosmodrome into orbit with 260-km
     (161.6-mi) apogee, 215-km (133.6-mi) perigee, 89-min period, and
     5 1 . 6 O inclination. The Soviet news agency Tass announced objectives
     were to perfect design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct
     scientific and technical experiments in space flight. Tass said systems
     were functioning normally.
          Western observers speculated that a manned spacecraft would be
     launched to dock with Salyut 2 and establish a manned orbital work-
     shop, resuming Soviet manned space flight after a two-year hiatus. The
     large Soviet tracking ships Cagarin and Komurov had been sighted
     in March moving from the Black Sea toward positions in the Atlantic
     Ocean.
          On April 1 Tass confirmed earlier U S . press reports that Salyut 2
                        1
     had been maneuvered into a higher orbit. April 4 and 8 maneuvers had
     raised it to a 296-km (183.9-mi) apogee and 261-km (162.2-mi) peri-
     gee, with an 89.8-min period and a 51.6â€™ inclination. Stable radio
     communication was being maintained and the â€œimproved design of on-
     board systems and instrumentsâ€ was being tested. Tass said systems
     and instruments were functioning normally. The new orbit, out of
     normal range of a manned Soyuz spacecraft, indicated to some ob-
     servers a holding orbit because of delay in launching cosmonauts to
     join the station.
          Tracking data showed an increase in the number of fragments follow-
     ing the spacecraft after April 14. By the end of the month Goddard
     Space Flight Center listed 27 objects, of which 25 had reentered the
     atmosphere.
           On April 18 Moscow sources said the U.S.S.R. had no plans for a
     manned flight to link with the space station and that Salyut 2 was
     carrying out experiments in connection with the joint US.-U.S.S.R.
     Apollo-Soyuz mission planned for 1975. Earlier Maj. Gen. Vladimir A.
     Shatalov, chief of the cosmonaut training project, had said Salyut

    laboratories could gather information for weather forecasting, geology,
    transport, communications, agriculture, and environmental protection-
    without mentioning manned flight.
       By April 25 US. observers suspected that an April 14 failure, possi-
    bly an explosion or a wildly firing thruster, had sent the station tum-
    bling end over end, tearing off the four solar panels and damaging the
    compartment, making cosmonaut manning of the station impossible.
    Radio signals from Salyut 2 were reported to have ceased. On April
    28 Tass reported that Salyut 2 had â€œconcluded the programme of flightâ€
    and that the data obtained in the experiments confirmed â€œthe correct-
    ness of design and structural decisions and the properties chosen for
    the main systems and on-board equipment of the station. These data
    will be used in building a new spacecraft.â€ The spacecraft reentered
    May 28.
       Salyut 1, the worldâ€™s first experimental orbiting workshop, had been
    launched April 19, 1971. A three-man crew-launched aboard Soyuz 10
    April 23, 1971-had docked with SaZyut 1 but did not board, returning
    to earth after two days in space. Three more cosmonauts-launched on
    Soyuz 11 June 6, 1971-docked, boarded the station, and conducted
    scientific experiments for 23 days. During their return to earth in
    Soyuz 11 June 30, they died after a valve accidentally opened and
    evacuated the air from the spacecraft compartment. A second Salyut
    was believed by Western observers to have been launched in July 1972
    without achieving orbit. (GSFC SSR: 4/30/73; 5/23/73. Un Gen As-

     were being expanded, during NASA FY 1974 authorization hearings
     before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. A
     program memorandum on DOD shuttle use, to be coordinated with NASA,
     would include plans for early entry into the shuttle program, identify
     key DOD planning milestones, and treat funding and management is-
     sues. DOD would â€œplace increased emphasis on new concepts of payload
     design and operation . . . essential to achieving the Shuttleâ€™s full po-
     tential for more effective, less costly space operations.â€™â€™ Goals of DOD
     planning and coordination were to ensure that NASA knew and under-
     stood DOD needs so that the shuttle would be of maximum utility to
     DOD, to provide data essential to integrated planning and support de-
     cisions on future shuttle use, to explore ways to benefit most from the
     shuttleâ€™s unique capabilities, and to coordinate DOD shuttle activities
     with NASA to the best possible use of both agencies. The DOD Shuttle-
     User Committee had been established as â€œa focal point for our broad
     and varied interests in the future military use of space.â€ The Commit-
     tee, under Air Force chairmanship, included representatives of other
     military departments and the Joint Chiefs of Staff; NASA would be in-
     vited to provide an observer. The Committee would guide studies of
     payloads and missions, explore the transition from launching DOD
     payloads with expendable vehicles to using the shuttle, and possibly
     would identify experimental DOD payloads to be carried on shuttle re-
     search and development flights for NASA.

     It is such advances that have enabled the United States to retain its
    preeminence in high technology production. And it is the continuation
     of such preeminence that is at stake when we consider the future of
    our space program.â€ (Transcript)
April 4-26: Apollo 15 Astronaut James B. Irwin was hospitalized in
    Aurora, Colo., after a heart attack. He was released April 26 after
    three weeks treatment in the Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center in
    Aurora. A hospital spokesman said recovery ultimately would be com-
     plete, but â€œit will be considerable time before he can return to full
     action.â€ Since leaving NASA, Irwin had, worked for the Johns-Manville
     Corp. and had begun an evangelistic organization, High Flight, Inc.

April 5-26: NASAâ€™s     Pioneer 11 (Pioneer-G), second Jupiter probe, was
    successfully launched into an excellent trajectory from Eastern Test
    Range at 9:11 pm EST by a three-stage Atlas-Centaur-TE-M-364-4
    launch vehicle. Eighteen hundred persons watched the nighttime launch
    after touring the Kennedy Space Center Flight Training and Vehicle
    Assembly Buildings, where Skylab was being prepared for a mid-May
    launch.
        Pioneer 11 sped away from earth at a velocity of 51 800 km per h r
     (32 200 mph), equaling the speed of Pioneer 10 (launched March 2,
     1972, and still heading toward Jupiter), which flew faster than any
    previous man-made object. The primary objective was to obtain pre-
    cursory scientific information beyond the Mars orbit with emphasis
     on investigation of the interplanetary medium during the 609- to
    825-day journey, the Asteroid Belt, and Jupiter and its environment.
    The secondary objective was to advance the technology for long-duration
     flights to the outer planets.
        The 259-kg (570-lb) spin-stabilized spacecraft carried 12 scientific
     experiments to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and
     charged particles; the electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet, visi-
    ble, and infrared ranges ; and the asteroid-meteoroid population. During
     the encounter trajectory with Jupiter, the spacecraft would provide the
    best possible information on the radiation environment, provide good
     viewing conditions of Jupiter before periapses, and obtain a short
     occultation of the spacecraft by Jupiter.
        The spacecraft also carried a pictorial plaque identical to the one
     carried on Pioneer 10 for identification of its origin by any possible
     intelligent beings of another solar system.
        Six hours following launch the large number of thruster pulses used
     to precess the spacecraft and point the antenna toward the sun provided
     the impulse to deploy fully one of the two radioisotope thermoelectric
     generators that had failed to deploy completely at first. The mag-
     netometer boom was deployed and the spin rate stabilized at 5.4 rpm.
     On April 6 four science instruments-the helium vector magnetometer,
     charged particles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid,
     detector-were turned on.
        An April 11 midcourse correction moved the target point at Jupiter
     from slightly ahead of the planet as it moved on its orbit, and above
     the equatorial plane, to slightly behind the planet and below the equator.
     The adjusted course would allow several mission choices: to make an
     equatorial pass either close to or distant from the planet to inspect
     one or more of its moons; to pass over the flattened pole of the planet;

     to fly on to Saturn in 1980: or, like Pioneer 10, to leave the solar
    system and escape into interstellar space. The option chosen would de-
     pend on Pioneer 10 findings during its pass of Jupiter in December.
    Nine of the twelve experiments were turned on and were operating
     normally.
        The control center for Pioneer 11 was transferred April 16 from Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory to the Pioneer Missions Operations Center at
    Ames Research Center. On April 26 Pioneer 11, traveling at 9.34 km
    per sec (20 900 mph), was 14 350 000 km (8 920 000 mi) from the
    earth. A second midcourse correction was made. The operation of all
    spacecraft subsystems was normal and 11 of the 12 experiments were
     transmitting good data. Six to seven hits had been recorded by the
     meteoroid detector. The infrared radiometer remained to be turned on.
    The spacecraft was expected to enter the Asteroid Belt in August 1973
     and reach Jupiter in December 1974.
        The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by Ames Re-
     search Center. Pioneer 6 and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17,
     1966, to study the heliocentric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and
     9 (launched Dec. 13, 1967, and Nov. 8, 1968, to study interplanetary
     phenomena) continued to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar
     plasma, magnetic and electric fields, and cosmic rays. (NASA prog off;

∞NASA research to improve general-aviation-aircraft flight control systems

     and increase the use of new flight equipment was described by Flight
     Research Center and Langley Research Center engineers at the Society
     of Automotive Engineers Business Aircraft Meeting in Wichita, Kan.
     FRC flight tests of a new attitude-command-control system aboard an
     experimental aircraft had shown that a flight-path control system sim-
     ilar to an automobile's steering system was a great improvement over
     conventional control systems. Use of the new system, plus an improved
     flight display tested by FRC, could reduce the general-aviation workload
     throughout most flights. Astronautics Corp. of America was developing
     a low-cost flight director under NASA contract. The Univ. of Kansas
     would evaluate its economical, separate, surface-stability-augmentation
     flight control system on a modified commuter aircraft under a NASA
     grant. L a R C was developing structural design technology to provide the
      greatest chance of pilot and passenger survival in a crash. Full-scale air-
      craft crashes were simulated by using a 60-m (200-ft) pendulum to
     swing instrumented aircraft into the ground at controlled angles and
     speeds. Resulting data were used to design aircraft to absorb more of
     the crash forces without destroying the cabin areas. NASA stall and spin

  ∞Lewis Research Center scientists and the U S . Coast Guard were develop-
    ing an ice information system to reduce multimillion-dollar annual
    losses from ice that blocked commercial shipping on the Great Lakes,
    NASA announced. The system would use aircraft, or eventually satellites,
    with sensors to gather information on ice thickness, type, and distribu-
    tion. The information would be relayed in map form to ice breakers
    and cargo vessels. (NASA Release 73-66)
  ∞Long-operating orbital stations with changing crews would mark the main
    trend of Soviet cosmonautic development in the near future, Maj. Gen.
    Vladimir A. Shatalov, director of cosmonaut training and veteran of
    three space flights, said in a Moscow press interview. Along with space-
    craft to deliver scientists and technicians, instruments, fuel, and food in
    orbit, the stations opened unseen possibilities for global meteorology,
    observations of the wor1d's oceans, long-distance communications, and
    geological survey. (Tass, FBIS-SOV,   4/5/73, L3)
∞The Federal Aviation Administration released Aviation Forecasts, Fiscal
    Years 1973-1984. Airline passenger traffic was expected to increase 10%
    annually, passing the 500 million mark in 1984. The number of hours
    flown by general-aviation aircraft would increase from 27.7 million in
     FY 1973 to 46.6 million in FY 1984 and the general-aviation fleet from
     136 000 to 217 000 aircraft. U.S. airline passenger enplanements
    would increase from 200.4 million to 524 million in FY 1984, with
    international passengers increasing from 21.3 million to 62.8 million
    and domestic from 179.1 million to 461.2 million. Revenue passenger-
    miles recorded by US. air carriers were expected to reflect a continuing
    long-term trend of increased average passenger trip length ; the FY
     1984 total of 500.5 billion was expected to more than triple the FY
     1973 figure of 162.1 billion. The air carrier fleet would increase by
     1000 additional aircraft, bringing the total fleet to 3600, of which 60%
     would be wide-body aircraft accounting for 80% of available seat-
     miles.
        Operations at airport control towers were expected to rise from
     56.8 million to 112.5 million. Annual production of U S . civil aircraft
     would jump from 10 00 5 in FY 1973 to 24465 in FY 1984, with
     general aviation accounting for most of the gain. Annual air carrier
     aircraft production would increase from 205 to 265, while the general-
     aviation figure would soar from 9800 to 24 200. (FAARelease 73-60)

    ∞The dismantling of the Federal fellowship program would liquidate some
       excesses but, â€œon balance, is a destructive moveâ€ at a time â€œwhen the
       need for some kinds of scientists and engineers is actually growing,â€ a
      Science editorial said. â€œAfter Sputnik was launched, this nation engaged
      in a frantic effort to expand its scientific capabilities. For a number of
       years government funds available for research in the physical and
      biomedical sciences increased rapidly. At the same time, the Apollo
       program was implemented. These developments created a shortage of
       scientists and engineers.â€ When Government support ceased to grow
       and unemployment arose, those in the Government who wanted to dis-
       mantle the fellowship program had had a useful excuse. But the unem-
       ployment argument was no longer valid. â€œThe index of employment
       opportunities has climbed above 100. In some regions there already
       are shortages of engineers.â€ In years ahead, â€œthis nation will encounter
       many unexpected problems requiring the skills of scientists and engi-
       neers. We may well come to regret bitterly the fact that we have been
       unable to do better than follow destructive blow-hot, blow-cold educa-

    tional policies. We should adopt the more realistic assumption that this
    nation must have good science, good medicine, and good engineering,
     and we should make it possible for the top students, regardless of
     financial ability, to participate.â€ (Abelson, Science, 4/6/73, 13)
April 6-13: Two satellites, five aircraft, and ten surface vessels were used
     to study the New York Bight. The waters extending from Staten Island
     to more than 32 km (20 mi) east of Asbury Park, N.J.-used as a dump
     for sewer sludge, acid wastes, and dredging and excavation materials-
     were dyed green. Water circulation at and near the surface was mapped
     to plan balanced use of the coastal environment and to assess the impact
     of natural and man-made substances on the coastal zone. Data gathered
     by sensors on the aircraft and on Erts 1 (launched July 23, 1972) and
     Noaa 2 (launched Oct. 15, 1972) were checked for accuracy by
     measurements gathered by surface vessels. The program was managed

∞The April 6 announcement of the discovery of a distant quasar had
     strengthened the growing theory among astronomers that they had seen
     the edge of the universe, Walter Sullivan said in the N e w York Times.
     The implication was that, as Einstein believed, the universe was finite.
     â€œBeyond its expanding volume, . . . nothing exists--not even space,
     because, in this concept, over such great distances space curves back
     upon itself.â€ By determining the rate at which a quasar was flying
      away from the earth, astronomers could estimate its distance in terms
     of the time its light had traveled to the earth. The universe appeared
      to have originated in a â€œbig bangâ€ some 13 billion yrs ago, and the
     earliest quasars should be visible far enough away for their light to
     have been traveling earthward for that long. â€œBut looking across vast
                                                        can see out only to 12
      distances-and hence, far back into time-man
     billion years (in the most distant quasars) .â€ Hale Observatory astrono-
     mer Dr. Alan R. Sandage had said that in these quasars astronomers
      were seeing â€œthe edge of the world.â€ Astronomers had long suspected
      the existence of some sort of wall preventing them from seeing quasars
     in the region beyond 12 billion yrs. â€œNow it is beginning to look as
     though the â€˜wallâ€™ is real.â€ (NYT, 4/8/73, 63)

    magnetic properties of the lunar rock in the fissure. Ledge rocks aided
    Lunokhod 2â€™s movement. The vehicle did not stick in the loose ground
     and its velocity could be increased.
        On April 17 the lunar vehicle was halted to replenish electric power

     Spacelab (sortie lab) costs and configurations. The studies would end
     in July to allow the European Space Research Organization to decide
     on supporting Spacelab development. ERNO planned to offer two Space-

     criteria. The second would be more expensive but technically more ad-
     vanced. The MBB system used a common support system of a single
     module housing all general-purpose subsystems, with separate individual

∞Apollo 17 astronaut-geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt championed manned
    space flight in testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical
     and Space Sciences during FY 1974 NASA authorization hearings:

        Manâ€™s unique capabilities in space flight come into play in situations
     requiring special insight in dealing with complex processes or events
     occurring over relatively short timespans. This has been most obvious
     in space in the geological exploration of the Moon, for example, in the
     rapid and comprehensive collection of samples, photographs, and ob-
     servational data in the valley of Taurus-Littrow last December. This
     capacity will also be clear in certain aspects of Earth and solar observa-
     tion where short-term dynamic processes are involved and in many space
     laboratory situations where rapid adjustments to changing experimental
     conditions are necessary. The dynamic range of the human eye and the
     mindâ€™s capability for rapid visual integration of changing geometry,
     color, and lighting make up an extremely versatile sensor system. In
     addition, when combined with experience and training of the man, this
     system allows â‚¬or the efficient selection of other sensors pertinent to the
     problem at hand. By such selection man can intelligently reduce the
     quantity of data which analytical systems on the ground will be re-
     quired to sort and treat in detail. This capability for on-the-spot data
    selection is not a trivial aspect of manâ€™s presence at the data collection
     point. Probably one of manâ€™s most useful capabilities is the precision
    by which he can operate, adjust, modify, or repair equipment. There
     is as yet little competition for man in this area on Earth or in space
     flight.â€ (Transcript)

     J. H. Barnes, Director of International Planning & Programs in NASAâ€™s
     Office of International Affairs,, discussed US.-European cooperation on
     the space shuttle sortie lab (designated Spacelab by the European Space
     Research Organization). ESRO was sponsoring a Phase B design compe-
     tition between European industrial consortiums. Germany, Italy, Bel-
     gium, and Spain were participating, with other European countries
     expected to join. Germany had pledged to fund at least 40% of the
     program; Italy 20%. The programâ€™s hardware phase was expected to
     start in early 1974. ESRO would design, develop, and deliver one Spacelab
     flight unit to NASA. NASA would provide assistance and would purchase
     one or more production units. Participating European countries would
     receive preference over nonparticipating countries in future use of the
     Spacelab.
         Ludwig Boelkow, President of the West German consortium
     Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, described the status of European
     civil aircraft production: â€œThe resources which only the U S . had in

     enjoys a slight edge in SST [supersonic transport] technology, as evi-
      denced by the Concorde, and I believe equality in subsonic jets, as
     evidenced by the excellent progress in terms of cost, schedule, and test
     performance of the A300 B [European airbus] .â€ ( AIA Memorandum

∞The Astronomy Survey Committee of the National Academy of Sciences
    and the National Research Council issued Astronomy and Astrophysics
    for the 1970â€™s, VoI. 2, Report of the Panels. The report confirmed the
    Committeeâ€™s 1972 observation that the opening of the radio sky had
    suggested the presence of undiscovered physical laws and requirements
    for new observations and explanations. The observation had been made
    in Vol. 1, released June 1, 1972. The Panel on Radio Astronomy report
     said: â€œThe processes taking place in the radiation-emitting region of
    pulsars are the most extreme we know of in the galaxy and far surpass
    in energy production any power source yet invented.â€ The understand-
    ing of the generating mechanism through further detailed study would
    improve the understanding of physics and could lead to â€œmajor de-
    velopments in energy generation here on earth.â€ Suspicion was growing
    that the molecules already discovered in space were part of â€œa large
     group of molecules of ever-increasing complexity that may exist in
     space.â€ Belief was growing â€œthat interstellar clouds . . . and fast particles
    may form large organic molecules. Such molecules, which may be as
     complex as the amino acids and may be of equal importance in our
     understanding of life, may be discovered by observations made at radio
     frequencies.â€
        The Panel on Optical Astronomy noted that new technology for basing
     detectors in the upper atmosphere and in space had begun to make infra-
     red astronomy â€œrealistic.â€ The Panel on Space Astronomy said, â€œIt ap-
     pears that much of the energy emitted from astronomical objects and
     from the universe itself probably resides in the infrared, and hence some
     of the most important astronomical discoveries will be made in this

     tivity in the nuclei of galaxies was â€œprobably commonplaceâ€ and not
     due to thermonuclear processes. The report concluded: â€œMan has

∞ A lightweight version of the space shuttle was being refined by Rockwell
     International Corp.â€™s North American Aerospace Group for the major
     systems requirement milestone, Aviation Week & Space Technology
     reported. The lightweight version, with a gross liftoff weight of 1.86
     million kg (4.10 million lbs), was scaled down in size from the previous
     baseline configuration, which had a gross liftoff weight of 2.38 million
     kg (5.25 million Ibs). It had the same maximum payload capability of
     29 480 kg (65 000 Ibs) . The major weight reduction had been achieved
     by switching to a more efficient double delta wing on the orbitor. Also,
     a newly designed external fuel tank, which could be separated from
     the vehicle before orbital velocity was reached, would eliminate the
     need for a solid-fueled-rocket deorbit motor on the nose of the tank.
     The solid-fueled boosters were also redesigned to a lighter weight.

April 20-30:      Canadian domestic communications satellite Telesat-B--
     named Anik 2, Eskimo for brother-was successfully launched at 6:47
    pm EST from Eastern Test Range by a three-stage, long-tank, thrust-
     augumented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. Anik 2 was placed in a highly
     elliptical transfer orbit with a 36 480-km (22 667.6-mi) apogee, 212-km
     (131.7-mi) perigee, and a 26.7" inclination. After checkout and reorien-
     tation of the spacecraft, the apogee motor was fired at 5:OO pm EST
     April 23, bringing the spacecraft into near synchronous circular orbit
     with a 35 709-km (22 188.5-mi) apogee, 35 604-km (22 123.3-mi)
     perigee, 1430.7-min period, and 0.1' inclination. The spacecraft was
     drifting 3" per day toward its final operational position off the west
     coast of South America.
        Under NASA-Telesat Canada contract, the NASA mission objective was
     to place Anik 2 into an orbit of sufficient accuracy to allow the spacecraft
     propulsion systems to place it in a stationary synchronous orbit while
     retaining sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission life-
     time requirements. The objective was met and the mission was adjudged
     a success April 30.
        Anik 2-second in a series of Canadian domestic communications
     satellites-was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. under contract with Telesat
     Canada and designed to provide transmission of TV, voice, and data
     throughout Canada for seven years. The spacecraft system provided 12
     channels of communications to relay 10 color TV channels or up to
     9600 telephone circuits. Two channels would be protection channels for
     the 10 traffic-carrying channels.
        The spacecraft was 1.8 m in diameter and 3.4 m high (6 by 1 f t ) .1
     At launch it weighed 540 kg (1200 lbs) and its orbiting weight was
     270 kg (600 lbs) . The electronics system was powered by 23 000 solar
     cells with sufficient onboard battery capacity to maintain service during
     a sun eclipse of the solar cells.
        Anik I had been launched Nov. 9, 1972. The two-satellite system
     would act as space repeaters to receive transmissions from earth stations
     and retransmitt them to earth stations in Canada. A third satellite was
     retained on the ground as protection against space failure of the first
     two spacecraft and could be launched ini 1975 to expand the system if
      required.
        NASA would be reimbursed by Telesat Canada for costs of the Thor-
     Delta launch vehicle and services. The project was managed for NASA's

     had harmed the press, the public interest, the space program, and the
     astronauts themselves, Robert Sherrod said in a Columbia Journalism
     Review article released in advance of its May/June publication date. The
     contracts had brought relatively little money to all but a few astronauts
     and had distorted their individuality and diversity into a â€œdeodorized,
     plasticized, and homogenizedâ€ image. Under the contract system, NASA
     could censor whatever the astronauts signed. â€œEven though this censor-
     ship was rarely invoked, it was inhibiting; so was the necessity of
     Lifeâ€™s making the astronauts look good, and vice versa.â€ President
     Kennedy had originally opposed the contracts, but had been per-
     suaded in their favor by Project Mercury Astronaut John H. Glenn.
     Former President Johnson had supported the contracts in a letter Sher-
     rod received a few months before Johnsonâ€™s Jan. 22 death. Sherrod
     said the contract system had had no adverse affects on the flow of space
     news. â€œDue in large part to the exclusion policy, many members of the

     Force, would become president of the National Academy of Engineering
     in May and that the NAE council had voted to sever NAEâ€™S affiliation with
     NAS. NAS elected 95 new members.
        During the program devoted to cosmological questions and humanistic
     aspects of scientific research, Dr. Stephen Toulmin, Provost of the Univ.
     of California at Santa Cruz, said he had detected a lack of purpose
     among younger scientists that might be leading to the end of the in-
     tellectual era inaugurated by Copernicus.
        Dr. John A. Wheeler, Princeton Univ. physicist, said the collapse
     of the universe into a single, great â€œblack holeâ€ with the annihilation
     of all matter and all physical laws seemed inevitable. Black holes-
     superdense objects in space-had been predicted as end products of
     the collapse of large stars when they no longer produced sufficient heat
     to counter the weight of their own material. Black holes could serve as
     examples of what would happen if the universe ceased its expansion
     and began to fall back upon itself. Since its expansion did not have
     sufficient momentum to continue indefinitely, the universe could reach
     its maximum size in 40 billion yrs. Dr. Alan R. Sandage of the Hale
     Observatory said a five percent decrease in the brightness of galaxies
     for each billion years of their lifetime would alter the calculation and
     indicate indefinite expansion of the universe. (NAS Memo to Press;

April 23-26: The American Physical Society held its annual meeting in
    Washington, D.C. Dr. Edward H. Teller, Univ. of California physicist
    and atomic scientist, urged legislation to declassify all Government
    scientific secrets after one year. He predicted the action would force
    the U.S.S.R. to take similar action â€œin maybe 10 years,â€ because U S .
    science and technology would advance faster without secrecy. Naval
    Research Laboratory scientist Dr. Herbert Friedman said most as-
    tronomers who believed that creation began with a â€œbig bangâ€ also
    believed that at least as much gas and dust had been left behind when
    the stars were formed as had been consumed in star formation. Recent
    findings had been that two clouds moved out in opposite directions
    from an exploding galaxy to form equally shaped spheres and that
    radio galaxies left wakes as they plowed through space. â€œIn both cases
    you need great quantities of gas to put enough pressure on the clouds
    or the galaxies to slow them down. Galaxies moving through empty
    space leave no wakes or trains behind them.â€ (W Post, 4/25/73, A3;

     state about 15 billion yrs ago. The regions could have grown to the
     mass of galaxy clusters by the time the universe had cooled enough to
     go from a plasma to an atomic gaseous state. The theory would account
     for the sizes, mean densities, and rotational speeds of galaxies and was
     consistent with Dr. Steckerâ€™s interpretation of recently observed cosmic
     gamma radiation as resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation.

    who had noted that the delay times of the echoes varied from one
    signal to the next, but assumed a natural phenomenon. Lunan inter-

    days had been achieved by the time RM had reentered Feb. 7, 1971.
    The radiation experiment was partially successful, measuring the pulse-
    height distribution of electrons and of low-energy protons for spectral
    mapping of the South Atlantic magnetic anomaly. Above 50 mev the
    solid-state spectrometers malfunctioned. The meteoroid experiment had

∞US. space observers believed an accident to the Soviet Salyut 2 space

    station launched April 3 had prevented the U.S.S.R. from carrying out
    a maximum one-month mission manned by a Soyuz crew, Thomas
    Oâ€™Toole reported in the Washington Post. Their assessment was that
    Salyut 2 had begun tumbling in orbit when a maneuvering engine fired
    and then kept firing out of control. The firing had forced Salyut 2
    into cartwheel motion through space. Its solar panels had been torn
    loose, cutting the station off from almost all its electric power. The only
    electricity supplied to Salyut 2 after the accident had come from bat-
    teries that might now be burned out. A few US. observers thought
    the Soviet tracking ship that instructed the station to make the fatal
    maneuver had received details of the accident by radio from Salyut 2
    before communications ceased. The ship had left its station off New-
    foundland and had joined a sister ship in CuraCao, Dutch West Indies,
    where both had been refueled and refitted. The ships were now in
    Cuba, which had led some space observers to think they might put to
    sea again to await a further Soviet attempt to launch a Salyut station.

    However, our ability to find and produce domestic supplies of energy
    is not keeping pace with rising demand.â€ The U S . was becoming in-
    creasingly dependent on foreign supplies. â€œExcept for Alaskan discov-

    duction since 1967. Gas is already in short supply. . . . At current
    growth rates, demand could double within the next 12 years over what
    it was in 1970. Because of the growing imbalance between domestic
    supply and demand, we may have to import as much as 60 percent of
    all the oil and gas we need in 1985. Such reliance on foreign sources of
    supply could pose serious problems for our national security. . . . The

                                                 two
     craft in July and August 1976 was announced a t an Hq. press confer-
     ence. The two spacecraft were scheduled for launch on their year-long,
     740-million-km (460-million-mi) journey toward Mars in the summer
     1975. The sites had been selected by prominent scientists after a one-
     year evaluation of 22 potential areas for scientific interest and the
     probability of a successful landing. The possibility of finding water at
     these sites increased the chances of finding evidence of life. Backup
     sites were Tritonis Lacus and Alba.
        Arriving at Mars, the spacecraft would enter a highly elliptical orbit
     and then separate into two parts, an orbiter and a lander. Each lander
     would carry a miniature chemical laboratory to analyze Martian soil
     for signs of life. A 3-m (10-ft) retractable claw would scoop soil sam-
     ples for analysis. Other instruments would analyze the atmosphere and
     measure pressure, temperature, wind velocity, and quake activity. The
     orbiter would perform visual, thermal, and water-vapor mapping.

    total $11 million; and $500 000 for technology utilization, to total $4.5
    million. Overall R&D decreases were: $7 million in space flight opera-
    tions, to $548.5 million; $8 million in space science programs, to $37
    million; and $10 million in tracking and data acquisition, to $240
    million. The budgets for construction of facilities and research and pro-
    gram management remained at $112 million and $707 million.
       The Committee said its $10-million reduction in Skylab funding, to
    $224 million (within space flight operations), reflected a â€œsuccess pos-
    tured programâ€ without major problems and expressed confidence in
    NASA Skylab management. Space shuttle funding was increased $25
    million to provide more effective program implementation and hold total
    program funding â€œat or below the current projection.â€ Total reductions
    of $8 million in funding for orbiting explorers, physics and astronomy,
    and lunar and planetary exploration supporting research and technology
    would be applied to the Earth Resources Survey Satellite program to
    permit immediate reinstatement of the ERTS-B project, on which the
    Committee placed â€œthe highest priority.â€ In the aeronautics program,
    a $14-million increase-from $18 million to $32 million-was recom-
    mended â€œto investigate and demonstrate noise reduction modifications
    to current narrow-body jet aircraftâ€ and $20 million was added to re-
    instate the quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing ( QUESTOL)
    aircraft program terminated in January. The $10-million increase in
    space nuclear research and technology funding was â€œto maintain a
    viable, long-range capability in advanced nuclear power and propulsion
    research.â€ It was probable â€œthat any sensible energy research program
    undertaken by this nation would involve a significant part of this con-

     than 70 different foods prepared by an automatic meal-reconstitution
     module. Semisolid food could be eaten out of the can with a fork and
     spoon and prevented from flying around in the weightless environment

     place the potassium lost in weightlessness. The use of alcoholic beverages
     had been rejected because of medical drawbacks and public opinion.
     The astronauts arranged their own meals with the correct combinations
     of nutrients and calories. Frozen foods would be used the first time in
     the U S . space program. The cost of the Skylab food was $26.35 per

    prehensive picture of the interactions of man with his environment and
    of various body systems that are influenced . . . by the space environ-
    ment.â€ They would deal primarily with the metabolic and cardiovascu-
    lar systems, exercise capacity, and nutrition.
        Dr. Goetz K. Oertel, NASA Chief of Solar Physics, said the objective
    of Skylab astronomy was â€œthe study of the stars, including the sun, and
    other objects in space such as planets,\ comets, objects and libration
    points near the moon, and x-ray objects in the sky.â€ Emphasis would be
    placed on the study of solar activity known to influence general weather
    patterns and on solar flares, responsible for radio communication black-
    outs and interference. Skylab was unique in that it would be manned.
    The astronaut would be able to align the instruments and select targets
    of interest, taking advantage of phenomena as it occurred.
        Dr. Robert A. Parker, astronaut and Skylab program scientist, said
    that corollary experiments would study gas and particles surrounding
    the Skylab and their effect on sensitive instruments, collect micrometeor-
     oids, study man-made disturbances in Skylab and their effect on in-
    strument alignment, and study flammable materials and manufacturing

     foreign countries. EREP included six sensors, two camera systems, a
     spectrometer, a multispectral scanner, a radiometer, a scatterometer,
     an altimeter, and a thermal data channel. EREP was similar in function
     to Erts 1 (launched July 23, 1972) and could discriminate colors more
     completely, compare electronically and photographically derived im-
     agery, and put up microwave instruments to operate in the different re-
     gions of the frequency spectrum, which would allow a look through
     clouds and under the surface of the earth.
        Thomas L. Fischetti, EREP Project Manager at NASA Hq., said that if
     EREP failed the crew would have equipment to make corrections, modi-
     fications, or replacements. The flight plan could also be modified at the
     last moment for unfavorable weather conditions or new phenomena oc-
     curring on the earth. During the three missions EREP would return

      were â€œoppressively aware of the limits of the nationâ€™s resources and of
      the consequent restraints and constraints on national policy.â€ Skylab

May 14-June 22: The Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop and-11 days later-
      the Skylab 2 Apollo spacecraft carrying a three-man crew were
      launched into near-earth orbit to establish the first U.S. manned orbital
      laboratory, in the four-mission Skylab program. Skylab 1â€™s meteoroid
      shield was torn off and the solar array system damaged during launch,
      cutting power and raising temperature to threaten the mission, al-
      though the spacecraft achieved satisfactory orbit. Skylab 2, scheduled
      for May 15 launch, was delayed while damage was assessed and the
      flight plan modified. On May 25, Skylab 2 carried three astronauts to
      rendezvous and dock with the earth-orbiting Workshop. The crew
      boarded the Workshop, repaired spacecraft damage, and conducted
      medical experiments and studies in solar astronomy and earth resources
      for a record 28 days before undocking for a safe return to earth June 22.
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1973                         May 14-June 22

     May 14-24:      Skylab 1 (SL-1) was launched on time at 1:30 pm EDT
   from Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by a two-
   stage Saturn V launch vehicle after a nominal countdown. Liftoff was
   witnessed by US. and foreign TV viewers and by an estimated 500 000
   persons at KSC, including US. and foreign dignitaries and 26 former
   prisoners of war invited by NASA. The Skylab 2 crew-Astronauts
   Charles Conrad, Jr. (commander), Paul J. Weitz (pilot), and Dr.
   Joseph P. Kerwin (science pilot) -watched the launch from quarantine.
      Skylabâ€™s Saturn Workshop (SWS) cluster launched toward earth
   orbit included the Orbital Workshop (OWS) with its Apollo Telescope
   Mount (ATM) , airlock module ( A M ) , multiple docking adapter (MDA),
   and instrument unit (IU) .
      At 63 sec into the mission, indication was received that the meteoroid
   shield had deployed prematurely. The Workshop was placed in nominal,
   circular orbit with 438.2-km (272.2-mi) altitude, 93-min period, 50â€
   inclination, and 7649.4-m-per-sec (25 096.6-fps) orbital velocity. The
   payload shroud was jettisoned on time at 15 min and 25 sec after launch
   and the ATM deployed at 21 min 34 sec with normal deployment of the
   ATM solar arrays at 26 rnin 38 sec, but ground controllers received no
   indication that the Workshop solar array system (SAS), which was to
   have been released by an onboard computer, had been deployed.
       At 41 min, a ground command was sent to deploy the two SAS wings.
   They did not respond. The command was sent again 30 min later and
   a third time near the end of the first orbit, without result. During the
   first postlaunch press briefing, Director of Launch Operations Walter
   J. Kapryan said that if the arrays did not deploy â€œthe mission will be
   seriously degraded.â€ The crew was not set up to perform a fix-it-yourself
   extravehicular activity (EVA) and there were no controls for deploy-
   ment inside the Workshop.
       Anxious officials and flight controllers began analyzing radioed
   launch data. Analysis and later inspection revealed that the meteoroid
   shield had been torn off by vibration of the vehicle just after passing
   through mach 1 speed, near the time of highest dynamic pressure.
   Some early measurements indicated that the shield separation straps
   were still satisfactory, but later measurements indicated failure. The
   failure had released the securing mechanism on SAS Wing 2 and the wing
   ripped off. A piece of shield had wrapped around SAS Wing 1 and kept
   it from deploying. Loss of the wings, which were to provide power to
   the Workshop, reduced power to 50% of its average 8000-w output; the
   remaining 50% would be supplied by the four ATM solar panels.
       At 11:OO pm EDT Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider
    announced the Skylab 2 launch had been rescheduled to May 20 to
    allow assessment of damage and development of a new flight plan to
    maximize scientific return from Skylabâ€™s experiments with limited
    power. Fuel cells of the Skylab 2 command and service module (CSM)
    would be used to produce electricity, after joining the Workshop, but
    the CSM oxygen and hydrogen for the cells would last only 16 to 21
    days. It was too early to assess the effect on Skylab 3 and 4 missions,
    planned for 56 days each.
       On May 15 Skylab faced a new threat as temperatures inside the
    Workshop reached above 311 K (100Â°F). The lost meteoroid shield had
    also been designed to reflect sunlight and help cool the Workshop. LLWe
    think we can live with the electrical power shortage,â€ Schneider said,

                                  145

    â€œbut if we canâ€™t solve this thermal problem we have a serious situation.â€
    Schneider feared foods and film might be spoiled, plastic parts might
    begin to leak poisonous gases, and the laboratory might become un-
    inhabitable.
       The entire Skylab team was mobilized-at        Johnson Space Center,
    Marshall Space Flight Center, Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell
    Douglas Corp., TRW Inc., and Garrett AiResearch Co.-in          an all-out
    attempt to overcome the loss of the shield and solar arrays. Schneider
    said NASA was studying the possibility of the Skylab 2 astronautsâ€™
    putting â€œsome kind of a thermal blanket around the spacecraft,â€ but
    that would require a delay of the Skylab 2 launch beyond May 20.
    Astronauts would also inspect the solar wings, but whether they could
    make repairs was uncertain.
       The Skylab 2 crew returned to JSC May 15 to help flight planners
    salvage the mission.
       Special attitude maneuvers were run to obtain temperature data
    on the Skylab cluster and to limit Workshop temperatures, as internal
    temperature soared as high as 325 K (125â€™F). Temperature was re-
    duced by pitching the Workshop with the longitudinal axis pointed at
    the sun for one orbit and, on May 16, the Workshop was tilted 55â€
    away from the sun, with sufficient sunlight on the working solar panels
    to charge the batteries but moving the space station out of the sunâ€™s
    full glare.
       Teams continued to compute options to overcome the loss of the
    shield : astronauts could spray-paint Skylab 1â€™s side to alter radiation
    properties of the gold foil coating the Workshop shell, could wallpaper
    the critical area, or could deploy a solar sunshade. Choice of the third
    option was announced May 16. The astronauts were trained in three
    possible methods of deploying the sunshade and in procedures to deploy
    the jammed solar panel. If they failed with the panel, a near-normal
    16- to 21-day mission could still be realized by using the CSM power
    and curtailing some experiments. After that experiments would have
    to be severely cut back to reserve power for the CSMâ€™S trip home.
       On May 17 NASA announced postponement of the Skylab 2 launch
    until May 25 to allow the astronauts to practice techniques for deploying
    the sunshade and mission engineers to design, fabricate, and test hard-
    ware. Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz flew to MSFC to practice
    installing the sun shield in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator.
       On May 20 the Workshop was purged of any gases from the over-
    heated insulation material and turned slightly to allow the sun to warm
    the airlock module and prevent water stored there from freezing and
    causing breakage. Components of the astronautsâ€™ repair kit were
    shipped to MSFC for final testing before being installed in Skylab 2â€™s
    Apollo CSM.
       On May 22 the Skylab 2 astronaut crew flew to IGC to prepare for
    the May 25 launch. Three thermal shields were decided on at a May 23
    review: a parasol deployable from the Workshop through the solar
    scientific airlock, a backup twin-pole shield deployable by the crew
    during EVA, and a standup-EVA (SEVA)sail deployable by the crew from
    the CSM if both other methods failed.
       The Skylab 2 countdown resumed at 5:30 am EDT May 23 at KSC. It
    had been halted eight hours after Skylab 1 liftoff May 14. On May 24
    the three emergency sunshades and necessary tools were stored in the

    cells ; S020, x-ray/solar photography; T025, coronagraph contamina-
    tion measurements; M555, gallium arsenide crystal growth; equipment
    for S063, ultraviolet ( UV) airglow horizon photography; and spare
    equipment for TV coverage of the ATM EVA-were removed to accom-
    modate the additional 180 kg (400 lbs) of equipment. The crew would
    also carry an extra medical kit to replace medicines spoiled by high
    temperatures in Skylab 1.
       Lightning struck the Skylab 2 mobile service structure at 5:24 pm
    EDT May 24, but retests of the vehicle indicated no damage.
       At a May 24 press conference Program Director Schneider said there
    would be limited activity by the crew to deploy the partially opened
    solar panel. LLWeâ€™re   not too optimistic that weâ€™ll be able to do too
    much, although we will give Capt. Conrad the option to try it if it
    looks like a reasonable job.â€ NASA was â€˜â€˜very confident that . . . we will
    be able to deploy a [thermal] shield, we will get the spacecraft tem-
    peratures back under control, and we will have a good 28-day mission.â€
       May 25: Skylab 2 (SL-2) was launched from a s c Launch Complex
    39, Pad B, on a two-stage Saturn IB launch vehicle into heavy dark
    clouds on time at 9:OO am EDT. As Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and
.   Weitz headed toward the Skylab 1 Workshop they were to attempt to
    repair in orbit and man for 28 days, Commander Conrad told Mission
    Control, â€œWe fix anything.â€
       The CSM/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with
    224-km (139.2-mi) apogee and 150-km (93.2-mi) perigee 9 min 56 sec
    after launch. Six minutes later the CSM separated. The S-IVB stage
    deorbit maneuver was performed at 2 :23 pm EDT and the stage splashed
    into the Pacific Ocean.
       The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 4:30 pm EDT over the
    Guam tracking station on the fifth orbit. During 15 min of TV coverage
    the CSM flew around the Workshop, within 1.5 m (5 ft) of it. The
    astronauts confirmed that the SAS Wing 2 was missing and that the SAS
    Wing 1, deployed only 15â€, was restrained by a piece of the micro-
    meteoroid shield wrapped around the SAS beam fairing. Portions of the
    gold foil laminated to the Workshop skin for thermal protection had
    been torn and heat and uv radiation from the sun had scorched the
    skin.
       The astronauts soft-docked the CSM with the Workshop, using only
    three capture latches; ate dinner; and undocked to attempt to deploy
    the jammed solar panel. Weitz stood in the open hatch of the CSM with
    Kerwin holding his knees to keep him from drifting into space. He
    tried to free the solar panel with a shepherdâ€™s crook and a pole with
    pruning shears attached without success. Conrad told Mission Control
    that the panel appeared to be â€œhooked in there like itâ€™s nailed on.â€ The
    repair attempt was ended at 8 :12 pm EDT.
       The crew made four unsuccessful attempts to redock with the Work-
    shop. Working in bulky spacesuits and gloves, the astronauts evacuated
    the air from the Apollo cabin and hooked up a n electric cable to over-
    ride a suspected short in the docking probe. LLYea. got a hard dock
                                                        We
    out of it [a docking using all 12 sealing latches to seal the two space-
    craft together],â€ Conrad said at 11:50 pm EDT. The crew found one of
    the capture latches had stuck in the retracted position, but trouble-
    shooting procedures recommended by Mission Control restored the latch.

May 14-June 22

       May 26-June 21 : The Skylab 2 crew entered the multiple docking
    adapter on the Skylab Workshop at 12:45 pm EDT May 26 and per-
    formed activation and Workshop preentry tasks. A chemical detection
    device inserted into the passage indicated no lethal gas was present. At
    2:30 pm EDT Astronaut Weitz entered the Workshop wearing a gas
    mask, gloves, and soft shoes to protect him from the heat. Weitz told
    ground control, â€œThe ows appears to be in good shape. It feels a little
    bit warm as you might expect, like 90 to 100 degrees [F; 305 to 310 K]
    in the desert. I felt heat radiating from everywhere but I never felt
    uncomfortable. And nothing I touched felt hot to me. Itâ€™s a dry heat.â€
    Kerwin and Conrad followed Weitz. After a quick inspection, the crew
    closed the hatch.
       At 4:30 pm EDT the crew began to deploy the solar parasol-a mylar
    shade folded against a telescopic pole-through     the solar airlock. As
    they readied the parasol, the astronauts looked out of the windows and
    identified landmarks across the U S . Weitz recognized Seattle, Wash.,
    and Conrad spotted both launch pads used for the Skylab launches at
    I<SC.
       Conrad and Weitz popped open the shiny aluminum and orange
    canopy at 8:30 pm EDT May 26 (Mission Day 2) while Kerwin took
    TV photos from the attached Apollo CM. Significant external tempera-
    ture decreases were noted almost immediately after deployment. Internal
    temperatures decreased more slowly. The Workshop was headed back
    to solar inertial attitude.
       By May 27 the Workshop temperature had dropped to 309 K (97â€™F).
    The crew activated systems and experiments while their back-and-
    forth excursions through the Workshop were televised to the earth. The
    Washington Post later said they resembled â€œskin divers snorkeling
    through a cave in the Caribbeanâ€ or a scene from the film â€œ2001â€ with
    astronauts â€œin orange flight suits and white T-shirts swimming like fish
    through the big workshop, floating backwards and tumbling like
    gymnasts.â€
       On May 28 the astronauts began the first medical tests, taking and
    processing blood samples and checking the conditions of their circulatory
    and metabolic systems. Checkout and preparation of the (ATM) was
    begun. During a seven-minute televised space-to-ground news con-
    ference beginning at 1:09 pm EDT, Conrad said the crew had adapted
    rapidly. â€œNone of us has had any motion sickness. . . . It seems to be
    like the simulator except with the absence of gravity.â€ Kerwin con-
    cluded that the brain and eyes must override the bodyâ€™s vestibule sys-
    tem in the inner ear. â€œYou say to your brain, â€˜Brain, I want that way
    to be up.â€™ And your brain says, â€˜OK, then that way is up.â€™ . . . Your
    brain will follow YOU.'^ Conrad agreed, â€œWeâ€™re in good shape for 28
    days.â€
       Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, JSC Deputy Director of Life Sciences for
    Medical Operations, said later in the mission that it was â€œrather
    amazingâ€ that the crew had shown no signs of the expected motion
    sickness. Data received were preliminary, but prelaunch exercises in a
    whirling chair might have helped avoid nausea.
       Temperatures continued to drop slowly, reaching 304 K (88â€™F).
    A 8:50 pm EDT a 69-sec trim burn put the Workshop into a repeating
     t
    ground track about 96 km (60 mi) west of normal, to acquire earth
    resources data.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1973                           May 14-June 22

      On May 29 checkout of the ATM was completed and four passes
   were made. Kerwin trained an array of telescopes to observe x-ray
   emissions and examine the structure of the sunâ€™s atmosphere. He
   photographed three regions of the sun considered active by solar
   physicists and made detailed observations of the full solar disk and
   the corona. Conrad and Weitz prepared the earth-oriented cameras for
   earth resources experiment package ( EREP) passes. Two biomedical
   runs were made. During a private conversation with JSC, Conrad re-
   ported that the internal temperature had stabilized near 304 I( (88Â°F)
   and that, while this would be tolerable for the rest of the mission, he
   did not think the crew could carry out the full protocol on the bicycle
   ergometer (exercise device).
      On May 30 the solar telescopes were aimed at the active regions of
   the sun while scientists on the earth received excellent TV photos of the
   solar corona and the solar disk in the uv spectrum. The first EREP
   photo pass was made over a 3200-km (2000-mi) strip from Oregon to
   the Gulf of Mexico. Good pictures were obtained of the Great Salt
   Lake, gypsum beds in New Mexico, and the soil salinity of the Rio
   Grande Valley, as well as microwave measurements of the Gulf of
   Mexico.
                                                a reduced level of 45% to
      After the EREP pass, the batteries-at
   50% capacity-tripped off line and ceased to produce electricity. They
   had been designed to trip off at 20% capacity. One battery also lost
   the regulator that allowed the solar panel to recharge it, decreasing
   the total Workshop power by 6%, or 250 w, leaving 4200 w. The
   Workshop required 3600 w for maintenance, leaving only 600 w for
   experiments. The second EREP pass was canceled for a power evaluation.
   Sixteen batteries were brought back on line but two remained off line
   and were useless. Heat, fans, and lights were powered down.
      Workshop power continued reduced May 31 and EREP experiments
   were canceled. The crew continued medical experiments, each taking a
   turn in a rotating chair to provide data on motion sickness and maintain-
   ing balance in zero g. Weitz repaired the mirror system on the uv
   stellar photography experiment. Temperatures had dropped to 301 K
    (82Â°F).
      The Skylab astronauts took their first day off June 1 (Mission Day 8)
   and their first shower in space. On a 15-min color telecast they per-
   formed housekeeping chores and-to the music from the film â€œ2OOlâ€-
   did handstands, somersaults, and cartwheels in the zero-g atmosphere.
   Conrad led the crew in a run around the watertanks. Centrifugal force
   overcame weightlessness, so the men could keep their feet on the track.
   On the ground Skylab officials announced the decision to make a second
   attempt to free the jammed solar panel, while engineers and the backup
   astronauts, led by Russell L. Schweickart, tested EVA procedures.
      On June 2, Conrad and Weitz made a 10-min EREP photo pass from
   California to Central Mexico to gather data on earthquakes, volcanoes,
   pollution sources, mineral resources, and land-use patterns. On the
   ground Schweickart successfully tested three ways of freeing the jammed
   solar panel using a bolt cutter, a prying rod, and a surgeonâ€™s bone saw.
   The astronauts completed the third EREP pass over North America and
   the fifth ATM pass on June 3. The nuclear emulsion experiment, the
   transuranic cosmic ray detector, and the neutron analysis detector
   were deployed.

May 14-June 22

       Astronaut Conrad set a new world record for time in space at 1:17
    am EDT, surpassing the 715-hr 5-min mark set by Astronaut James A.
    Lovell, Jr. The first ball game in space was held in the Workshop.
    Conrad said a ball thrown in weightlessness â€œgoes straight as an arrow.â€
       The fourth EREP pass was made June 4, as well as five hours of ATM
    solar viewing. Dr. John Zeiglschmid, Skylab Flight Surgeon, told a
    JSC press briefing that the physical condition of the Skylab crew was
    excellent. They were consuming the proper amount of food and getting
    adequate rest. Conrad and Kerwin had lost only 0.5 kg ( 1 lb) ; Weitz
    had lost 1.8 kg (4 lbs). Top Skylab officials at MSFC agreed that solar
    wing deployment techniques developed by Astronaut Schweickart were
    feasible, without unusual safety hazards.
       On June 6 preparations were made for the next dayâ€™s EVA. Conrad
    said, â€œI guess we have a fifty-fifty chance of pulling it off.â€ The 16
    Workshop batteries were producing 4200 w-only 600 w more than
    the minimum necessary for the astronautsâ€™ survival. One battery was
    down to half charge and others were believed to have been damaged by
    the heat. The astronauts photographed hurricane Ava during an EREP
    pass, made an ATM pass, and photographed uv spectra of stars.
       Conrad and Kerwin opened the AM EVA hatch at 11:23 am EDT June 7
    and extended their umbilicals and a rigged-up 7.6-m (25-ft) pole fitted
    with cutters for releasing the jammed solar wing, as Weitz took TV
    photos from the Skylab and the CSM. Outsir] Kerwin had difficulty
    keeping a firm footing, with only makeshift nndholds and foot re-
                                                         antenna mount. His
    straints, as he secured the end of the pole to
    heart rate rose to 150 beats per minute and he 1 burning energy at
                                                         s

    2000 to 2500 BTUS an hour. Finally he extended the pole to the beam
    holding the wing and-with Conrad repeatedly telling him to â€œtake it
    easyâ€ and â€œcool itâ€-managed after several tries to fit the cutters around
    the small bolt that restrained the wing. Conrad moved hand over hand
    along the pole to the wing. Tangling of the 10.6- and 18.3-m (35- and
     60-ft) flexible umbilicals linking the astronauts to spacecraft life sup-
     port systems complicated their movements.
       Kerwin pulled a lanyard to snap the cutters and sever the bolt and
     then extended the wing using a rope attached to the upper surface.
     Conrad pulled a rope to break a frozen actuator. Two of the sections
     making up the wing were 40% deployed and the other about 30%.
       The two astronauts also changed a film magazine in a telescope
     camera and latched open a balky door on an x-ray telescope before
     reentering the Workshop and closing the AM EVA hatch at 2:53 pm EDT,
     concluding 3 hrs 30 min successful EVA.
        The Workshop was pitched up to expose the panels to more direct
     sunlight and unfreeze the hydraulic system that deployed them. After
     a few hours one section was 90% deployed, another 40%, and the
     third 29%. By the next day the sections were fully deployed. Additional
     electric power of 3000 w was obtained and all eight batteries supplied
     by the solar panels were charged and in good working order-paving
     the way for a full Skylab mission.
        From Mission Control Schweickart said, â€œEverybodyâ€™s shaking hands
     down here and we just wish we could reach up and shake yours.â€
     President Nixon sent a message: â€œOn behalf of the American people I
     congratulate and commend you and your crew on your successful
     effort to repair the worldâ€™s first true space station. In the two weeks

   since you left earth, you have more than fulfilled the prophecy of your
   parting words, â€˜We can fix anything.â€™ All of us now have new courage
   that man can work in space to control his environment, improve his
   circumstances and exert his will even as he does on earth.â€
      On June 12 the ninth EREP pass was made. Weitz said he could see
   pollution flowing into Lake Erie and he couldnâ€™t find Washington, D.C.,
   because of haze. Conrad melted an aluminum alloy to study the be-
   havior of molten metal in weightlessness and used an electron beam for
   welding inside a small vacuum chamber.
      On June 13 Dr. Hawkins told a JSC medical review that Kerwin and
   Weitz were no longer able to perform at preflight levels on the bicycle
   ergometer, indicating their cardiovascular systems had been weakened
   by weightlessness. The condition was not at dangerous levels and was
   not interfering with their normal day-to-day performance.
      Weitz photographed a massive explosion on the sun with the ATM
   solar telescopes June 15. The flare had erupted from the center of the
   sunâ€™s side facing the earth and covered an area 40 200 km (25 000 mi)
   wide. Conrad checked out the Apollo CSM for the return trip to earth,
   while Kerwin initiated the growth of bacteria in a culture medium and
   photographed its behavior in the space environment.
      On June 17 a trim burn corrected a cross-track error and positioned
   the vehicle for the start of the Skylab 3 mission. President Nixon
   telephoned the astronauts from Key Biscayne, Fla.: â€œI guess the way I
   could summarize this project is that it proves that man still matters.
   With all the technical machines . . . that you had to work with, it
   proved that when there were difficulties the ingenuity of men in space
   was what really mattered, and you have made us all very proud with
   the way you handled some difficult problems in this project.â€ The
   President invited the three Skylab astronauts to visit him at San
   Clemente, Calif., after splashdown.
      At 3:22 am EDT June 18 (MD-25) astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and
   Weitz surpassed the previous space endurance record held by the
   Soyuz I I cosmonauts (launched June 6, 1971). Conrad asked that a
   message be relayed to Soviet cosmonauts giving â€œour respects at this
   point in our flight to them and their comrades. Wish them good luck
   from us in the future.â€
      EVA-2 began at 6:53 am EDT June 19. Conrad and Weitz moved
   through space to retrieve and replace the ATM film cassettes while
   Kerwin photographed the EVA for TV from inside the Workshop. Conrad
   also freed a stuck relay by striking it with a hammer. One of two dead
   batteries began charging immediately. From the ground Schweickart
   said, â€œIt worked. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Youâ€™ve done it
   again.â€ The cameras for the white light coronagraph and x-ray
   spectroheliographic experiments were replaced by the astronauts to
   permit photography during the unmanned period between Skylab 2 and
   3. EVA operations ended at 8:29 am EDT, after 1 hr 36 min.
      During a June 20 press conference from space Kerwin said the
   astronautsâ€™ physical condition was â€œa pleasant big surprise. Iâ€™m
   tremendously encouraged about the future of long-duration flight.â€
      June 22: The astronauts undocked the CSM from the Skylab Work-
   shop at 4:55 am EDT on Mission Day 29. As the CSM pulled away and
   circled the Workshop, TV and photographic coverage were obtained
   by the crew. CM separation from the SM at 5:40 am EDT was followed by

   initial service propulsion system firing at 6:OS am EDT and a final
   deorbit maneuver at 9:11 am EDT.
      The CM splashed down at 9:50 am EDT 1340 km (830 mi) southwest
   of San Diego. A recovery helicopter dropped swimmers who installed
   a flotation collar and a sea anchor. The recovery ship Ticonderoga was
   maneuvered beside the CM and a crane lifted it aboard with the astro-
   nauts inside. Medical examinations on board the recovery ship found
   some dizziness and ill effects from weightlessness. The crew would
   travel by ship to San Diego and by air to Ellington Air Force Base,
   Tex., June 24.
      The Skylab 1-2 mission achieved its primary objectives of establish-
   ing the Skylab Orbital Assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data
   on the crew for use in extending the duration of manned space flight,
   and performing inflight experiments. It contributed significantly toward
   program objectives of determining manâ€™s ability to live and work in
   space for extended periods, extending the science of solar astronomy
   beyond the limits of earth-based observations, and developing improved
   techniques for surveying earth resources from space. Despite mission
   anomalies, 80% of the solar data planned was obtained; 12 of the 15
   earth resources data runs were accomplished; all 16 medical experi-
   ments were conducted as required and a time history of manâ€™s adap-
   tations to zero-g environment was obtained for the first time; and data
   were taken on all 43 experiments scheduled for Skylab 2 except those
   precluded by the use of the solar parasol and weight and power limita-
   tions. The performance of the flight crew was good and the mission was
   judged officially on July 14 to be a success.
      Major records set to date included the longest-duration manned
   flight, 28 days 50 min; the longest total time in space for one man, 49
   days for Conrad (veteran of Gemini 5 and 11 and Apollo 12 missions) ;
   the longest inflight EVA, 3 hrs 30 min by Conrad and Kerwin June 7;
   and the longest distance in orbit for a manned flight, 18 531 559 km
    (11 514 967 mi).
      Skylab 1-2 was the first U S . manned orbital workshop. Skylab 3
   was scheduled to be launched in August and Skylab 4 in November.
   The Workshop would be operated unmanned between manned missions.
   The Skylab program was directed by NASAâ€™s       Office of Manned Space
   Flight. MSFC developed and integrated the major program components
   including the OWS, AM, MDA, ATM, payload shroud, and most experiments
   and was responsible for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles.
   IGC managed launch operations. JSC was responsible for flight opera-
   tions, recovery, crew selection and training, and development of the
   modified CSM and the spacecraft launch adapter. Tracking and data
   acquisition was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the
   overall direction of the Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition. (NASA

    petty officer had sent one dayâ€™s pay after each manned flight in memory
    of his son who had been killed in the Korean war. A naturalized citizen
    from Eastern Europe had sent $100 in 1964 because he wished to be a
    part of the space program that would mean the survival of a free US.
    (NASA Release 73-98)
  ∞Manâ€™s ability to survive in space was discussed in New York Times and
    Washington Post articles. Of 33 astronauts who had made Apollo
    flights, 11 had suffered from motion sickness for the first few days in
    space. Apollo 13 (April 11-17, 1970), the aborted moon landing
    mission, had indicated. that men in danger would have a tough time
    surviving in space. Astronaut James A. Lovell, Jr., had lost 6 kg (14
    Ibs) during the six-day mission. John L. Swigert, Jr., had been so
    overcome by fatigue near the end of the flight that he made several
    errors in checking reentry procedures. Fatigue might also have con-
    tributed to the deaths of the Soviet Soyuz 11 (June 6-30, 1971) cos-
    monauts.
       Calcium loss in weightlessness, the most serious of potential medical
    problems, could lead to thinning of the bones and subsequent bone
    breaks after long periods in space. Other health problems included
    increased heart rates, weight loss, decreased oxygen consumption,
    reduced blood pressure, and the reduced flow of blood to the brain and
    kidneys.
       Psychological effects, as well as these problems, would be studied
    on Skylab missions. Were windows necessary? Should doors be door-
    shaped or would circular holes be sufficient? Would the crew tolerate
    sleeping upright in sleeping bags attached to the walls? (Schmeck,

    applications of solar energy. Lewis Research Center was especially active
    in joint work on requests for proposals on solar thermal areas, photo-
    voltaics (use of the generation of electromotive force when radiant
    energy fell between dissimilar substances), flat plate collection, and
    heating and cooling of buildings. NASA had made a preliminary inventory
    of its test facilities applicable to NSFâ€™S solar energy research program.
    NSF had requested NASA to review the status of solar insolation data
    from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, work-
    ing with NOAA, to examine the need for better data and methods. Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory and the Cal Tech Environmental Quality Labora-
    tory were jointly conducting workshops and studies in water heating and
    other solar technology applications. A NASA Wind Energy Workshop at
    LeRc would pursue plans for a wind energy research program. Other

     fense and space suppliers as Government agencies took increasingly
     active roles in mass transit, education, health, and environmental pro-

     are for the Skylab crew to blast off a week from today and install a sun-
     shade or awning to replace the missing thermal shield. If that can be
     done, the temperature problem will be solved and the astronauts will be
     able to begin living in the space station and to carry out at least some of
     the projected experiments. All these plans transcend past space feats, and
     if successful, will mark a major advance in the nationâ€™s space capabili-
     ties. But the task will not be easy and a happy ending is by no means
     guaranteed.â€ ( N Y T , 5/18/73,32)
        Chicago Daily News: â€œThe space station experiments not only look
     outward toward the sun and stars, but also down at the Earth. From
     270 miles [435 kilometers] up, men can learn much about the planet,
     its resources and its weather that they canâ€™t see on the ground. Much of
     the knowledge gained from Skylab can be expected to have practical
     application toward improving the quality of life on Earth.â€ (C Daily

    further strengthened the hypothesis that the universe was made up sym-
    metrically of ordinary matter and antimatter. In a joint project of the
    Soviet Institute of High Energy Physics and the Institute of Nuclear Re-
    search, nuclear physicists Valentin I. Petrukhin and Vladimir I. Rykalin
    and team had examined 400 billion particles over several months be-
    fore identifying four antitritium nuclei. It was the second identification
    of an antinucleus at the Soviet accelerator. In February 1970, Soviet
    scientists had reported the creation of antihelium. The search for anti-
    matter was being spurred by the theory that the mutual annihilation of
    matter and antimatter might ultimately yield a new form of useful en-

May 23: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified on the status
     of the Skylab missions before the Senate Committee on Aeronautics and
     Space Sciences hearing on the difficulties that had postponed Skylab 2,
     as the countdown resumed at Kennedy Space Center for May 25 launch:
     The micrometeoroid shield around the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop had
     been torn off about one minute after liftoff on May 14, during the time
     of maximum aerodynamic pressure. â€œAt the same time, some of the
     solar panels used to generate electricity for the laboratory were ap-
     parently also damaged, jammed, or torn away. We donâ€™t know which.
     The full impact of this malfunction was not known until several hours
     after launch; we still do not know the specifics of the actual damage.
     The net result was that Skylab was in a good orbit, but had only ap-
     proximately one-half of its power-generating capability in operation and
     also was overheating badly.â€ The overheating occurred because the
      damaged micrometeoroid shield was also to have provided thermal
     balance. f t was painted â€œto reflect the proper amount of sunlight so

    that the laboratory would stay cool.â€ The Skylab 2 astronauts hoped
    to repair the damage and then carry out a 28-day mission. â€œIf the
    planned repairs are successful, we will also be able to accomplish most
    of the activities scheduled for the two subsequent missions, each lasting
    56 days.â€ Skylab 2 would carry several sunshades. â€œWe donâ€™t know
    whether the micrometeoroid shield is completely severed or whether
    parts of it are obstructing some of the areas where the sunshade might
    be fixed, but . . . by carrying several different shades, we should at
    least have one which will be suitable.â€
       Dr. Fletcher described steps to be taken to deploy the solar panels.
    â€œIf it looks like an easy thing to do, if one of the panels . . . is partially
    deployed and is hung up on something and all it needs is a little tug,
    we will put a loop of twine around the end of it, play it out so that we
    are well away from the panel in case it starts to deploy, and give a little
    tug on the twine. If it deploys, fine; but if it does not, we will go on
    without it. But we are not going to spend too much time on that fix.
    There are too many uncertainties and we do not really need the power.â€

∞A New York Times editorial commented on the manned Skylab 2 launch:
    â€œThe possibility of repairing a damaged spaceship, now brought to the
    fore by the last two weeksâ€™ developments, points up one of the advan-
    tages of manâ€™s presence in space. If something goes awry with an un-
    manned spaceship, and there are no arrangements for bringing repair
    men to it, it is more probable than not that little can be done to save
    the mission. Now the world is faced with a major effort to overcome
    unexpected difficulties by assigning additional duties to the astronauts
    originally involved. The success or failure of these repair efforts in the
    period immediately ahead will provide important evidence for the future
    debates between the advocates of manned and unmanned efforts to ex-
    plore space.â€ ( N Y T , 5/25/73, 32)
∞Approval by both countries of results of the Feb. 12-17 Moscow meeting

    in structure of the earthâ€˜s crust, for recognizing them on space images
    to develop a classification system, and for studying the relationship be-
    tween the space imagery features and previously known subsurface
    geologic structures. The Group identified as a possible project develop-
    ment of remote-sensing methodology to determine vegetation produc-
    tivity and agreed to develop a plan for a joint project to measure soil
    moisture content using microwave techniques. The U S . would study
    a Soviet proposal to coordinate satellite water-temperature measurements
    with surface measurements obtained by a Soviet ship and to compare
    temperature, plankton, and color measurements by Soviet ships with
    US. satellite observations. The U.S.S.R. would study U S . proposals
    to test a hydrological simulation model using remote-sensing data and
    environmental factors to infer the presence of shallow aquifers-areas
    of water underground and close to the surface. (NASA Release 73-106)

    the corona is at a lower temperature and a lower density, and thereâ€™s
    some reason to believe that the solar wind comes out of coronal holes
    to a greater extent than from any where else on the Sun.â€ The first
    coronal hole had been recorded in 1966 but the significance of such
    holes had not been recognized until they were observed from NASAâ€™s

    was heated. Skylab instruments were observing a t a wide range of
    wavelengths generated by gases of different temperatures at different
    elevations in the solar atmosphere. Sharper images than so far received
    were hoped for. The images, thus far seen only through a TV system

∞ Abandonment of technology, a â€œsource of manâ€™s strength,â€ would be a
    senseless alternative to its further development and use, Dr. Jerome B.
    Wiesner, Massachusetts Institute of Technology President, warned in a
     Technology Review article. Manâ€™s exploitation of and dependency on
    the environment could not be changed through greater understanding
     of science and its application. Even a relevant technology alone would
    not suffice. Man needed â€œto develop the ability to estimate rationally
    and to choose among alternate courses of action, particularly when new
    technology is concerned. Above all, we need the humility to admit that
    we will not find any absolute answers or permanent solutions.â€ But the
    fallacy of the approaching doomsday argument was â€œthat it ignores
    the considerable evidence we already have that man can in fact modify
    his behavior fast enough to avoid the catastrophic disasters predicted by
    the doomsday-sayers.â€™â€™ The evidence included the fact that scarcely a
     decade after Rachel Carsonâ€™s warning against pesticides (in her book
     Silent Spring) â€œthose chemicals are severely controlled-possibly too
     much so-and      biodegradable equivalents are on the verge of being
     introduced.â€ Lake Michiganâ€™s marine life was nearing extinction 10 yrs
     ago; â€œby vigorous ecological controls it has been restored.â€
        Development and control of the rapidly changing synthetic environ-
     ment had become as important as contending with nature. Those who
     saw only evil in technology â€œfail to recognize that our situation would
     be much worse if the search for new technological solutions was
     stopped.â€ The challenge was â€œto move on from where we are to tech-
     nologies and ways of employing them that will avoid uncontrollable
     effects in the future. Stopping science will shut off new knowledge and
     weaken our efforts to reverse the present situation. Technology alone
     is not the answer, but without technological developments few answers
     are likely to be found.â€ More than 30 yrs ago Dr. Vannevar Bush had
     called science the endless frontier; â€œit remains that today. The range
     of exciting research now exceeds that which was imaginable when Dr.
     Bush coined the title.â€ (Tech Rev, 5/73, 10-13)

June 1: Skylab 3â€™s target launch date had been changed to July 27, NASA
    announced at a Johnson Space Center press briefing. SG3, to carry the
    second crew to the Orbital Workshop launched May 14, previously had
    been scheduled for Aug. 8. The new target date was set because unex-
    pected use of Skylab hardware during the Skylab 1-2 mission had ex-
    posed electronics, batteries, and systems to unusual environments. Dep-
    uty Skylab Program Director John H. Disher said a July 27 launch
    would give greater solar power input, because the relation of the sun to
    orbit plane at that date would give the spacecraft a greater percentage
    of time in the sun. The precise date would be set after the end of the
    Skylab 2 mission. (Transcript; NASA Release 73-111)
∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released a statement on private
    communications of crews of the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched
    May 14), after meeting with the Deputy Administrator, Dr. George M.
    Low; Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers;
    and Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs John P. Donnelly. A May
    3 memorandum had authorized private communications for morale pur-
    poses (weekly calls from Skylab astronauts to their families), for â€œex-
    tremeâ€ operational emergencies, and for medical reasons (to permit pri-
    vate doctor-patient relations) . Following objections from some newsmen
    to the May 29 Charles Conrad, Jr., private conversation on operational
    matters, Dr. Fletcher had decided to instruct Mission Controlâ€™s Capsule
    Communicator to query the seriousness of a situation before permitting
    a private conversation from Skylab.
       Dr. Fletcher said in his new statement that he would rescind this
    instruction because â€œwe believe it would be imprudent to discourage
    requests by the crew for private operational communications.â€ Para-
    phrases of the communications would be ieleased to the press. â€œWe will
     continue to leave it entirely up to the flight crew as to when to call
    for such a conversation, and will send no new instructions or clarifica-
    tion of instructions. This decision was reached so that we would in no
     conceivable way inhibit them from calling for a private conversation
     when they believe a need exists, and so that we will not jeopardize the
     safety of the mission.â€ (NASA Release 73-110)
∞A Chicago Tribune editorial hailed the Skylab 2 astronauts (launched May
     25 to man the crippled Workshop orbited May 14) as â€œtinkerers.â€ The
     men who overcame the senseless stubbornness of inanimate objects had
     been â€œsuperlatively trained and admirably persistent and are the prod-
     ucts of a highly scientific preparation. But the achievement also reflects
     the fine American heritage of tinkering. This was the quality that en-
     abled the Pilgrim fathers to make do with strange, native materials when
     they landed on our alien shores.â€ It was also â€œthe practical genius that
     has enabled four generations of young Americans to compel model Ts
     to live and snort again when it was obvious that they were clinically
     dead. Its magic has guided these astronauts and their ground advisers

∞The General Accounting Office released Comptroller Generalâ€˜s Report to the
     Congress: Analysis of Cost Estimates for the Space Shuttle and Two
     Alternate Programs. The review, made by GAO at the request of Sen.
     Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), said GAO was â€œnot convinced that the
     choice of a launch system should be based principally on cost compari-
     sonsâ€ and â€œnot certain that the Space Shuttle is economically justified
      (is less costly when the time value of money is considered), even though
              calculations show that it is.â€ Payload cost was the major element
     NASAâ€™s
     in program cost estimates for both the shuttle and alternate use of
     existing expendable launch vehicles. NASA had estimated $30.2 billion
     for the shuttle and $50.1 billion for the expendable systems. The $19.9-
     billion difference was due to estimated low-cost design of shuttle pay-
     loads which could be recovered, refurbished, and reused. GAO recom-
     mended that Congress â€œconsider the future space missions used in
              economic analysis . . . to determine whether these missions are
     NASAâ€™s
     a reasonable basis for space program planning at this timeâ€ and â€œreview
     the estimates for the Space Shuttle annually, giving due consideration
     to the appropriateness of the missions used in making those estimates.â€

∞Soviet journalist Victor Louis discussed U.S.S.R. plans for the Tu-144 su-
      personic transport aircraft in a N e w York Times article. The aircraft was
      scheduled to go into regular passenger service in 1975, when it was ex-
      pected to begin carrying 120 million passengers annually. Soviet ter-
      ritory was so sparsely populated that â€œfewer people will be troubled
      by noise than in Europe or the United States.â€ Soviet statistics showed
      3500 internal airfields in the U.S.S.R. Soviet aircraft flew to 63 major
      cities throughout the world-operating between Moscow and Santiago,
      Chile, and eastward between Moscow and Jakarta. SST watchers had
      calculated that the U.S.S.R. would not sell more than 20 Tu-144s initially.
      â€œTen are estimated to be sufficient to satisfy [Soviet national airline]

    said as the Skylab 2 astronauts considered ways to release a stuck solar
    wing on the Skylab 1 Workshop launched May 14: â€œIts funds have been
    cut drastically since the moon landings were accomplished. Skylab it-
    self is a vehicle costing $295 million. If it has to be abandoned the
    people will demand more expenditures be cut. So NASA is trying to prove
    that man really is boss of the machines he produces, that money is not

    temperature changes. It had taken the first measurements from the
    lunar surface of the luminosity of the lunar sky and had established that
    the moon was surrounded by a layer of dust particles in which the
    visible solar light and the reflected earth light were dispersed. Lunokhod
    2 had taken 86 relief panoramas and 80000 TV photos of the lunar

       drated corn. â€œThe bag failed at its seam. . . . Weâ€™ve got corn powder
       all over everything.â€ Kerwin said taking a shower was pleasant, but
       the water didnâ€™t â€œfly through the air, it sticks to whatever is there,
       mostly you and partly the walls. It takes forever to dry both oneâ€™s self and
       the walls . . . even using that inadequate little vacuum cleaner that
       weâ€™ve got.â€ The crew recommended allotting an hour for taking a shower
       on future missions. The astronauts were being awakened by the noise
       of the suction fan when the toilet was used at night. They found them-
       selves growing hoarse from shouting at each other across the roomy

       expensive Skylab program is in trouble and daring measures are being
       taken to stabilize the planned programs it was to introduce. Before the
       screams of those who would dissolve the space program reach the astro-
       nauts aboard Skylab, it might be well to consider some spinoffs from
       the space program that preserve and lengthen the lives of those who
       cry for its cessation.â€ Spinoffs included noise abatement, smog detec-
        tion, medical devices, and fabric fireproofing. â€œThe value of the space

    when unforeseen contingencies arise,â€ a New York Times editorial
    said. Skylabâ€™s future â€œnow looks brighter than at any time since the
    initial launch. Valuable information remains to be collected on the re-
    action of human beings to prolonged stay in space, and on the useful-
    ness of space stations for scientific and industrial activity. A promising
     start has already been made by this first Skylab crew; now it seems

June 10-20: NASA launched Explorer 49 (RAE-B; RAE 2) Radio Astron-
    omy Explorer by a long-tank, thrust-augmented, Thor-Delta launch ve-
    hicle from Eastern Test Range at 10:14 am EDT into a transfer trajectory
     for the moon. The second of two approved RAE missions and the last
    scheduled U S . mission to the moon, Explorer 49 was to measure galac-
     tic and solar radio noise at frequencies below ionospheric cutoffs and
    outside terrestrial background interference, using the moon for occul-
     tation, focusing, or aperture-blocking for increased resolution and dis-
     crimination.
        At 17 min after launch, the spacecraft separated from the launch ve-
     hicleâ€™s 3rd stage. One midcourse correction was made at 11:28 am EDT
     June 11; the planned second correction was not required. During the
     transfer trajectory, data acquisition from telemetry systems was excel-
     lent. The lunar orbit insertion motor was fired at 3:21 am EDT June 15,
     putting the spacecraft into lunar orbit with 1334-km (828.9-mi) apolune,
     1123-km (697.8-mi) perilune, 241-min period, and 61.3â€™ inclination.
     On June 18 the lunar insertion motor was jettisoned and the hydrazine-
     fueled velocity-control propulsion system placed Explorer 49 in a lower,
     near-circular orbit with a 1063-km (660.5-mi) apolune, 1052-km (653.7-
     mi) perilune, 221.2-min period, and 38.7â€™ inclination.

    tion, the dipole would be retracted and the orbit adjusted as needed.
    The two main V antennas, joined in an X shape, would then be de-
    ployed to 183 m (600 ft). After another week, the V antennas would
    be deployed to their full 229-m (750-ft) length to achieve the missionâ€™s
    gravity-gradient, three-axis-stabilization mode.
       The 200-kg (442-lb) spacecraft was the first known to use boron fila-
    ment for the inertial booms that helped stabilize it during the lunar
    trajectory.
       Explorer 38 (RAE 1 )-the first successful radio astronomy satellite,
    launched July 4, 1968-had measured galactic radio sources and traced
    the movement of sporadic radio outbursts from the sun beyond the
    orbit of Mercury for four years. Explorer 38â€™s receivers, however, had
    been saturated 25%-40% of the observing time by interference from
    the earthâ€™s radio noise. Explorer 49, in lunar orbit, would be shielded
    from terrestrial noise as it orbited the moonâ€™s far side.
       The RAE project was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under
    the direction of the NASA Office of Space Science. GSFC designed, con-
    structed, and tested the spacecraft and provided the scientific instru-

∞Radio glow, a new phenomenon observed by U.S.S.R. scientists, was de-

    scribed in Pravda by Soviet radioastronomer Vsevolod Troitsky. The
    phenomenon was caused by charged particle flux from radiation belts
    in the lower layers of the earthâ€˜s ionosphere and was thought to be gen-
    erated at altitudes up to 100 km (60 mi) and related to changes in the
    area of solar spots and chromospheric flares. Observations had been
    made simultaneously in the far eastern, northern, and southern parts of
    the U.S.S.R. Irregular radiation on superhigh frequencies would permit
    study of dynamic processes in the ionomagnetic sphere of the earth.

     NASA% August 1972 invitation to provide experiments for one of two
     Pioneer spacecraft to probe Venus in 1978 was announced by NASA.
     Mission objectives were to gather information on the Venusian atmos-
     phere and clouds. Participating scientists would define experiments
     studying composition and structure of the atmosphere down to the sur-
     face, the nature and composition of the clouds, the circulation pattern
     of the atmosphere, and the radiation field in the lower atmosphere.
        The mission-comprising a bus, a large probe, and three small probes
     -would use a spin-stabilized, solar-powered spacecraft. The trip from
     earth to Venus would take 125 days. The probes would be separated
     from the bus 10 to 20 days before entry into the Venusian atmosphere.
     The large probe would descend through the atmosphere in 1y2hrs; the
     small probes would fall free to the planetâ€™s surface about 75 min after
     entry. The bus would be targeted to enter the Venus atmosphere at a

        is really the question is whether we want to develop the full potentials
        of space flight or only a part of them. Because if you eliminate man
        from the loop, you significantly reduce our options to explore and use
        space.â€ (NSC Notice, 6/6/73; NASA Activities, 7/15/73, 1 1 4 6 )

  ∞The dizziness and nausea of Skylab 2 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr.,
    Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on their return to the earth
    June 22 were probably due to problems of the inner ear, the W d l Street
    Journal quoted Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, Johnson Space Center Deputy
    Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, as saying. The symp-
    toms had occurred particularly when the men moved their heads from
    side to side. Dr. Hawkins had theorized that the fluid in the semicircular
    canal, whose movement transmitted impulses via tiny hairs in the ear
    to the brain, was out of action because of the long period of weightless-
    ness. When the astronauts had come under the sudden influence of
    gravity, the inner-ear mechanism became unusually sensitive to almost
    any head movement. Ordinary movements could produce the symptoms
    of motion sickness. The inner-ear balancing mechanism could adapt to
    gravity quickly. Dr. Kerwin, the most affected, had returned to normal
    after 12 hrs. (Bishop, W S J , 6/25/73)

      GAD representatives: â€œa. The five noneconomic issues cited by G A O â€˜ ~        ~
      major considerations in the decision to develop a space shuttle are valid
      and proper elements in the original decision to proceed and in the
      future evaluation of the progress and pace of space shuttle development.
      b. Cost, performance and schedule goals and estimates are both a valid
      and essential element in the decision making process of the Congress

      and the GAO studies in these areas . . must have suflicient depth to
      encompass all major cost considerations. c. The fragmentary arguments
      with respect to costs advanced by GAO reports are so incomplete as to fail
      to validate the CAO conclusions drawn from them. d. That GAO should
      continue review of the space shuttle program development in conjunc-
      tion with the legislative and oversight activities of the responsible com-

    scientist, said during an EREP review that the EREP experiments had
    gathered good data for 145 principal investigators on 13 km (8 mi) of
    magnetic tape. Data were collected over six foreign countries-Mexico,
    Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. There were 186

    on the bicycle ergometer study. In the motion-sensitivity study-with
    two crew members participating-the           preflight threshold level (the
    point at which motion sickness symptoms would begin) of science
    pilot Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin was 12yz rpm in the rotating chair, at
    which speed he could perform 50 head movements. Pilot Paul J. Weitz
    'had a preflight threshold of 15 rpm and 40 to 50 head movements. Both
    men could do 150 head movements in flight at preflight speeds without
    symptoms. During tests immediately following splashdown both men
    had experienced vestibular disturbances with even the slightest head
    movement. The symptoms had disappeared within two days and both
    crewmen had performed at preflight speeds on the third day following
     recovery, completing 150 head movements without symptoms. (Tran-

    surpriseâ€ to find out â€œhow easy it was to live in zero-g, and how good
    you felt. Itâ€™s easy to move, itâ€™s easy to work.â€ He said that future
    missions could go on open-ended as long as the individual crew member
     could â€œpool a reasonable amount of blood in his legs . . . and provided
    his response to exercise, his appetite, his body weight, general feeling
    of well being, and ability to do workâ€ continued without significant
     change.
        Paul J. Weitz said that the easy adjustment in space was due partially
     to the â€œextremely high fidelity equipmentâ€ on which they trained.
     â€œThere were many times that you could look around and you really
     didnâ€™t know . . . if you were in the trainer or you were in the vehicle.â€

June 30: A seven-minute, four-second, total solar eclipse, one of three
    seven-minute-plus total solar eclipses in the 20th century, began at
    sunrise in Brazil and crossed Guyana, Surinam, the Atlantic Ocean, the
    Cape Verde Islands, Mauretania, Mali, Algeria, Niger, Chad, the
    Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and the Somali Re-
    public. It ended at sunset in the Indian Ocean between India and
    Madagascar. A partial eclipse was visible for 3200 km (2000 mi) on
    both sides of the totality track. Previous total solar eclipses had been
    June 8, 1937, for seven minutes four seconds, and June 20, 1955, for
    seven minutes eight seconds. The next solar eclipse in the current
     66
       saros,â€ or 18-yr period, would be July 11, 1991, for 6 minutes 54
    seconds, but the June 30 eclipseâ€™s duration would not be exceeded for
     177 years, British astronomer Peter MacDonald said later in a New
    Scientist article.
        The African eclipse was witnessed by an estimated 5000 amateur
     astronomers and tourists and by 2500 international scientists on land,
     on sea, and aboard research aircraft. Concorde 001, the specially in-
     strumented Anglo-French supersonic transport aircraft, carried seven
     US., U.K., and French scientists across North Africa in lunar shadow
     at altitudes to 17000 m (56000 ft) during a two-hour six-minute
     flight. They observed total eclipse conditions for 74 min.
        The Skylab 1 Workshop, unmanned since Skylab 2â€™s June 22 splash-
     down, saw only about 10% of the eclipse because its orbital position and
     telescope mechanisms were not suited for maximum effectiveness. Its
     cameras operated from 7 am EDT until midnight, and eclipse films taken
     would be retrieved by Skylab 3 astronauts scheduled for July 27
     launch. Other scientific observations of the eclipse by at least 28 na-

     single-stage fan to reduce exhaust velocity, incorporating acoustic
     treatment to muffle fan noise in new nacelles for the refan engines, and
     adding two booster stages to the low-pressure compressor to maintain
     proper airflow to the engine core.
        Pratt & Whitney would receive $14.6 million to modify six engines,
     make analyses and design studies of the JT8D engine and components,
     fabricate engine-modification hardware, and support tests by the air-
     frame manufacturers. Boeing Co., under a contract to be signed later,
     would study design of the sound-absorbing nacelle, identify modifications
     to the 727 aircraft to accommodate the nacelle, ground-test refanned 727
     aircraft, and evaluate nacelle configurations with varying acoustic treat-
     ments. Douglas Aircraft would receive $6.9 million tu develop experi-

     $504 659 000, an increase of $22 032 000 over FY 1973. The increase
     would be used to employ computers, satellites, ocean buoys, automatic
     weather stations, remote sensing, and automated data-handling tech-
     niques to improve weather services with reduced manpower. NOAA
     would increase its expenditures for weather radars, satellite operations,
     new computers, and expanded weather-dissemination systems. The Dept.
     of Defense would add more weather radars, expand its satellite data-
     processing programs, and install advanced instrumentation aboard storm
     reconnaissance aircraft. The DOD surface and upper-air weather observ-
     ing program would be decreased because of curtailed military activities.

∞The Skylab 1 Investigation Board appointed to determine the cause of the
     anomaly that lost the Orbital Workshopâ€™s meteoroid shield and one solar
     array wing during launch May 14 reported its findings and recommen-
     dations to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator. The Board,
     chaired by Lewis Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, said the
     most probable cause was inadequate venting of the pressure in a tunnel
     beneath the shield. Differential pressure buildup in the tunnel had forced
     the shield away from the Workshop shell and into the supersonic air
     stream. The shield then broke the tiedowns holding the solar array
     wings onto the spacecraft. About 10 min into the flight one solar array
     wing was torn away completely when it was struck by the exhaust plume
     of the 2nd-stage retrorockets. The remaining solar array wing would not
     deploy until the astronauts cut the strap which had curled around
     the wing and penetrated the metal fairing housing the array.
        The Board had found that â€œthe significance of the aerodynamic loads
     on the meteoroid shield during launch was not revealed by the extensive
     review processfy and recommended that complex, multidisciplinary sys-
     tems like the shield â€œshould have a designated project engineer who is
     responsible for all aspects of analysis, design, fabrication, test and as-
     sembly.â€™, There was no evidence that the shieldâ€™s design deficiencies had
     resulted from or been masked by the Skylab management system. â€œOn
     the contrary, the rigor, detail, and thoroughness of the system are doubt-
     less necessary for a program of this magnitude.â€ (NASA Release 73-135;

July 16: ITOS-E Improved Tiros Operational Satellite, launched by NASA
    for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, failed to
     reach orbit after a 1 O : l O am PDT liftoff from Western Test Range on a
    two-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster. Early flight
     data indicated that abrupt cessation of the hydraulic pump output 270
     sec after 2nd-stage ignition had caused loss of hydraulic pressure and
     thrust vector control. The spacecraft tumbled and failed to achieve or-
    bital velocity. Investigation was begun immediately at Goddard Space
     Flight Center.
         The meteorological spacecraft had been intended for sun-synchronous
     orbit to make day and night cloud-cover observations, to make continuous
     observations of weather features from its synchronous altitude, and to
     obtain global-scale quantitative measurements of the earthâ€˜s atmospheric
     structure.

     spacecraft in a series of second-generation meteorological satellites. Noaa
     1 (ITOS-A) was launched Dec. 11, 1970, and was operational for nine
     months. ITOS-B was launched Oct. 21, 1971, but did not achieve orbit be-

     Conrad said the mission had proved the feasibility of maintaining a
     large space station for manufacturing in space. â€œI think the data will
     show that you can do all the things up there that you can do down here
     and many of them perhaps better.â€ Skylab 1-2 earth resources and
     solar telescope data would show â€œthat eventually space has a very definite
     role in helping mankind and in solving some of these problems that are
     in front of us. After all, the Sun is probably the most single efficient nu-
     clear device that we know about. We do have an energy crisis. We need
     to better understand that. We just scratched the surface with our 30,000
     photographs we brought back. I think you will find that the Earth re-
     sources data, when coupled with . . . ERTS [Earth Resources Technol-

    trapolate a 56-day mission â€œwithout difficulty.â€ He felt the inflight por-
    tion would be â€œa piece of cake.â€ Postflight, the Skylab 3 astronauts
    might â€œfeel a bit loggier than we did.â€ But Skylab 1-2 had demon-
    strated that this was a â€œminor illness . . . that you get from being 28
    days in space and that you can return very rapidly to normal.â€
        Weitz said Skylabâ€™s earth resources survey equipment permitted a
    more selective data acquisition than that of unmanned ERTS. â€œI think
     we have shown in the past with unmanned satellites that part of the
     problem is that you have a continuous data flow, not all of which is
     usable, but all of which must be processed and reduced and analyzed in

July 17-18: NASA launched a series of 26 meteorological experiments on
     rockets and balloons from Wallops Station to provide an in-depth com-
    â€˜parison between remote sensors on satellites and sensors on rockets and
     balloons from a mid-latitude site. The project-divided into a day and
     night series to provide data both with and without solar energy input-
     was conducted in conjunction with Nimbus 5 (launched Dec. 10, 1972)
     and Noaa 2 (launched Oct. 15, 1972) satellites.
         Four Nike-Cajun sounding rockets were launched carrying Goddard
     Space Flight Center acoustic grenades to measure temperature and
     winds. The grenades were ejected and detonated in flight, one at a time,
     from 30- to 95-km (19- to 59-mi) altitude. The first Nike-Cajun was
     launched July 17 and reached an altitude of 117.4 km (72.9 mi). The
     rocket performed satisfactorily. Thirty of the thirty-one grenades were
     successfully detonated and the sound returns were received by the ground
     microphone array.
         The second Nike-Cajun launched 79 minutes later reached an altitude
      of 116.2 km (72.2 mi) and detonated all of its 12 grenades successfully.
         The third Nike-Cajun was launched July 18 to a 114.9-km (71.4-mi)
      altitude. Rocket performance was satisfactory and all 31 grenades were
      successfully detonated.
         The final Nike-Cajun was launched two hours later to an altitude of
      120.7 km (75 mi). The rocket performance was satisfactory and all 12
      grenades were detonated successfully.
         In addition to the Nike-Cajuns, the launches included 4 balloonsondes,
      3 Viper Darts, and 15 Super Lokis instrumented to obtain density and

July 17, 19, 23, 24: The House Committee on Science and Astronautics
    held hearings on Federal policy, plans, and organization for science
    and technology. Dr. H. Guyford Stever on July 17 explained his dual
     role as National Science Foundation ,Director and, as of July 1, Science
     Adviser to the President: â€œI am aware of the need to maintain a strong,
     independent position as Science Adviser. I do not believe there will be
     insurmountable difficulties in dealing with this challenge. The newly
     established Science and Technology Policy Office will be the strong staff
     arm to help me carry out these new duties. . . . . I have structured this
     office to maintain a maximum degree of objectivity and impartiality on
     science policy matters. . . . I intend to call upon the significant and
     broad capabilities existent within the Foundation. . . , I will also call
     upon other Government agencies for assistance whenever appropriate.â€
         Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Executive Vice President for Research and
     Development and Planning with Gould, Inc., and former Presidential
     Science Adviser, on July 24 commented on NSFâ€™S new role as â€œthe
     Governmentâ€™s highest level policy and advisory body with technical
     competence.â€ He saw the new arrangement at NSF as unstable, with
     â€œformidable and demandingâ€ tasks. He saw two possible resolutions: NSF
     could restrict itself to science and academic research or it could transcend
     its historic past and achieve the national stature necessary to influence
     agencies and departments on technical programs that cut across operat-
     ing boundaries and to serve as the technological beacon for other agen-
     cies.
         Science, Dr. David said, had not been downgraded. â€œScience and
     technology will continue to-be the warp and woof of our society,â€ but
     the national scene had changed. The former White House apparatus,
     1957-1965, had been â€œmore weighted toward space and military mat-
     ters. Importantly, the apparatus was also responsible for development of
     programs to strengthen the infrastructure of science and engineering.
     . . . In recent years we have seen the emphasis shifting toward consumer
     and public-oriented technologies in energy, transportation, health, edu-
     cation, natural resources, ecology and environment, and social systems.
     This shift brings with it a powerful new set of policy issues which illus-
     trate the necessity to include not only science and technology, but also
     economic, social, legal, and political factorsâ€-consumer             markets,
     public preferences, and political beliefs, â€œmatters with which the
      Federal establishment has little experience or expertise. It is in such
     matters that the new NSF office must exert leadership and influence.â€

July 19: NASAâ€™s     X-24B lifting body [see July 5-61, flown by NASA test
     pilot John A. Manke, successfully completed its first captive flight from
     Flight Research Center, attached to a B-52 aircraft. Erratic B-52 power
     resulted in unintelligible telemetry traces and forced a switch to X-24B
     internal power. The telemetry cleared and excellent traces were returned.
     X-24B performance was adjudged satisfactory but the scheduled glider
     flight was postponed until July 24 to allow for battery recharge.
        The X-24B had been built around the existing basic structure and
     subsystems of the X-24A, which, like other lifting bodies, had been de-
     signed for reentry from space flight. But the X-24B had a new double-
     delta shape with small blended wings and three vertical tails-parts of
     a configuration representing a forerunner of future aircraft capable of
     hypersonic (above mach 5 ) flight. Like its lifting-body predecessors,
     the X-24B would be air-launched by a B-52 aircraft from 12000-m
      (40 000-ft). Subsequent flights would use the XLR-11 rocket engine to
     increase speed and altitude performance in the joint NASA-USAF pro-

     welding specimens represented the first effort to obtain basic engineer-
     ing and scientific data for materials processing in space. The samples
     would be analyzed and the results compared with similar data from
     earth-processed samples to learn how to fabricate and repair structures
     in space, develop unique or improved materials for use on the earth,

     trajectory toward Mars. All systems performed satisfactorily, Tass re-
     ported. The spacecraft would reach Mars in February 1974 to continue
     scientific exploration of the planet and the space near it begun by
    Mars 2 (launched May 19, 1971) and Mars 3 (launched May 28,1971).
     United Press International reported Western sources as saying the ap-
     parent aim of Mars 4 was to softland research instruments and TV
     cameras on the Martian surface.
        Mars 4 would be the fourth Soviet spacecraft to reach Mars. Mars 1
      (launched Nov. 1, 1962, to fly by Mars) had transmitted data to the
     earth for more than four months during its journey, before communica-
     tions went dead. Mars 2 had been put into orbit around the planet and
     transmitted data to the earth into August 1972. An instrumented capsule
     from the spacecraft crashlanded on the Martian surface Nov. 27, 1971,
     becoming the first man-made object to reach the surface. Murs 3 had
     also attempted to softland an instrumented capsule, during a dust storm.
     TV pictures were transmitted to the earth for 20 sec before transmission
     ceased abruptly. The spacecraft ended its mission in August 1972.

    palms, Legion of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross with nine Oak
    Leaf Clusters, Medal of Merit, and the Congressional Medal of Honor
     for downing 26 German aircraft and at least 4 enemy balloons. He be-

July 26: The Skylab 3 astronauts arrived at Kennedy Space Center to
    prepare for their July 28 launch to join the Skylab Orbital Workshop
     (launched into earth orbit May 14) for a 59-day mission. During a
    press briefing at Patrick Air Force Base, Astronaut Bean said, â€œWeâ€™re
    very anxious to get up there and put out 100 percent of what we have
    to do.â€ (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 7/27/73, A l )
∞Skylab science and medical briefings were held by NASA at Johnson Space
     Center. Results from the first Orbital Workshop mission, Skylab 1-2
     (launched May 14 and May 25), were discussed and science plans for
     the Skylab 3 mission, scheduled for launch July 28, were announced.
         At an Apollo Telescope Mount briefing Dr. Robert A. MacQueen,
     a Skylab principal investigator and High Altitude Observatory scientist,
     said that a first look at available data indicated that the objectives-
     to examine the solar corona on a regular basis, deduce the three-
     dimensional structure and geometry of the corona, understand the
     evolution of the corona and its relationship to the solar disk, and
     understand the outflow of the solar wind from the corona-would be
     met. The most important conclusion drawn was that â€œin appearance
     the corona is now a less dynamic subject than other solar phenomena.â€
     Dr. Edward M. Reeves, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said
     that an ATM scanner had observed â€œvelocity changes in whole large
     areas of the Sun in lines of the transition region and the corona which
     have never before been seen in this part of the spectrum.â€
         At the medical science briefing, Dr. Michael W. Whittle, Principal
     Coordinating Scientist, said that the weight losses of the three Shylab 2
     astronauts-1.8 kg (4 lbs) for Charles Conrad, Jr., 2.7 kg (6 lbs) for
     Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and 3.6 kg (8 lbs) for Paul J. Weitz-were
     66 pure and simple adaptation to weightlessness. . . . Increased nitrogen,

     calcium, and phosphorus, the major constituents of muscle tissue, had
     appeared in the urine and indicated the muscle loss. Dr. Stephen L.
     Kimsey, a Skylab principal investigator, said that experiments had
     shown â€œno abnormal changes in red cell metabolismâ€ in amount of
     energy stored, change in the integrity of the cell membrane, or change
     in the red cellsâ€™ ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the tissue.
         Dr. Verl R. Wilmarth, earth resources experiment package project
     scientist, said during an EREP briefing that the objective of mapping
     the depression of the sea surface of the Puerto Rican trench using
     altimeter data had been met.
         At a briefing on the corollary experiments Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger,
     Associate Director for Science at Marshall Space Flight Center, said
     that the materials processing and welding experiments would help verify
     methods of construction and assembly in weightless conditions. Among
     the first things built in space might be a reflector for microwave!
     energy, to transmit large amounts of energy from one point of the earth
     to another. A reflector of the size needed could not be launched in one
     piece but would have to be assembled in space.

July 28-September 25: The Skylab 3 Apollo spacecraft carrying a three-
     man crew was launched into near-earth orbit, rendezvoused with the
     Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14), and docked with the
     space laboratory for the second manned mission in the Skylab program.
     A series of problems threatened to disrupt the mission, but corrective
     actions and workarounds permitted it to proceed successfully, setting
     new manned flight records. The astronauts collected significant data in
     medical experiments, solar astronomy, and earth resources surveys for
     59 days before undocking for a safe return to earth Sept. 25.
        July 28-31: Skylab 3 (SI-3) lifted off on time at 7:11 am EDT
     from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad B, on a two-stage
     Saturn IB launch vehicle, watched by some 100 000 persons on Florida
     beaches and at ICSC, as well as by U S . and foreign TV viewers. The
     14 168-kg (31 234-1b) Apollo command and service module (CSM-117)
     and its crew-Allan L. Bean (commander), Jack R. Lousma (pilot),
     and Dr. Owen K. Garriott (science pilot)-soared through ground fog
     into broken clouds.
        The CSM/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with
     224-km (139.2-mi) apogee and 150-km (93.2-mi) perigee at 10 min
     2 sec after launch. Eight minutes later the CSM separated from the stage
     as planned. The galactic x-ray mapping experiment mounted in the
     instrument unit (IU) was deployed. At 5 hrs 19 min 53 see after launch

   the S-IVB/IU deorbit maneuver was commanded, and the stage im-
   pacted the predicted Pacific Ocean area after planned maneuvers.
        During CSM maneuvers to rendezvous with the Workshop, a leak was
   detected in the CSM reaction control system (RCS) quad B thruster, one
   of four assemblies of rockets used to stabilize the spacecraft or to
   change its velocity and also used as a backup for bringing the CSM
   back from orbit. Analysis indicated the oxidizer valve was stuck open
   or partially open. Quad B was isolated; analysis showed that all deorbit
   mission rules could be satisfied.
        The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 3:38 pm EDT on the
   fifth orbit. Rendezvous, fly-around, and docking were covered by 23
   min of TV. The crew entered the multiple docking adapter (MDA) a t
   4:OO pm EDT and began Workshop activation, but activation was cur-
   tailed because the crew quickly began to feel motion sickness. Lousma
   was experiencing nausea and Bean and Garriott were uncomfortable.
   Bean said he and Garriott tended â€œto be fairly careful of how we move.
   And since we are moving rather slowly, then itâ€™s taking a little bit
   longer than weâ€™d planned.â€
        Motion sickness continued the second day, July 29, and the astronauts
   were taking scopolamine-dexedrine tablets. Bean communicated, â€œWe
   feel okay, except in the stomach. . . . And our thinking is that weâ€™re not
    going to be able to work much faster than we are right now. . . . Thereâ€™s
   a desire to maybe take a break for an hour or two and get in the bunk
   and stay still for a while.â€ Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson told
   the press at JSC that extravehicular activity (EVA) to install a new
   sun shield and retrieve and install Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) film
   probably would be delayed from July 31 to Aug. 1 at the earliest. Four
    to five hours of work were carried over from July 28 and 29.
        Still suffering from motion sickness, the astronauts continued Work-
    shop activation July 30 (Mission Day 3 ) . The first EVA was delayed
    to Aug. 2 and later rescheduled to Aug. 4 to ensure the astronautsâ€™
    complete recovery. Activation was completed July 31 ( M D 4 ) and
    research began as the crew improved slightly. Bean told ground control:
    â€œWeâ€™re getting better; itâ€™s just taking a little longer than we thought.
    . . . Everybody feels pretty good between meals. Then mealtime comes,
    and weâ€™re caught . . . in the squeeze. Weâ€™re trying to decide whether
    we ought to eat all we have to . . . to keep our strength up, or eat about
    what we want to, which isnâ€™t very much.â€
        A TV broadcast from the space station July 31 showed minnows for
    a biomedical experiment swimming in their plastic aquarium in tight
    spirals and sometimes apparently trying to swim toward the surface,
    but with their heads pointed straight down. Garriott said, â€œApparently
    they canâ€™t make up their minds which way is up and down, either.â€ He
    also turned a spider named Arabella loose in a plastic cage to observe
    her web-spinning abilities in zero-g conditions. Later in the mission
    Garriott reported baby minnows hatched in space performed in water
    â€œas if theyâ€™d already adapted while they were still in the egg.â€ They
    LC
       felt right accustomed to zero-g.â€
        August 1-September 24: Bean told ground controllers after break-
    fast Aug. 1 (MD-5): â€œThis is the first morning weâ€™ve been up here
     . . . that after a meal everybody felt good. Everybody feels real good
     right now. Best since weâ€™ve been here.â€ During live TV the astronauts

     ate a hearty lunch to music. Bean demonstrated his proficiency in
     eating while hanging upside down.
        A medical briefing below at Johnson Space Center suggested that
     moving quickly from the confined CM to the large Workshop might have
     contributed to the motion sickness. The milder nausea experienced on
     the May 25-June 22 Skylab 2 mission could have been caused by a
     more gradual transition into the Workshop. â€œ1 think that it is merely
     a matter of room in which you can exercise your vestibular mechanisms,
     and that the workshop simply presents more of that space. . . . perhaps
     it was too much too soon.â€
        On Aug. 2 a master alarm buzzer awakened the astronauts at 6:45 am
     EDT. Pressure and temperature were falling rapidly in the CSM reaction
     control system quad D because of an oxidizer leak. Because of quad Bâ€™s
     July 28 leak, only A and C of the four quads remained fully operational.
     The quad D leak lasted two hours, losing an estimated 5 kg (12 Ibs) of
     nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. Apollo Flight Director Glynn S. Lunney
     said at a morning press briefing that the spacecraft was flyable with
     the loss of the two quads but â€œit would be flown in a mode which is not
     entirely standard.â€™â€™ The main concern was â€œthat we have had two
     problems which are related, at least they seem to be related.â€ A flaw
     common to the whole RCS could necessitate the crewâ€™s immediate return
     to the earth or accelerated preparation of the Skylab 4 spacecraft to
     make it available as a rescue vehicle should the CSM become unusable.
        Full activation of Skylab-rescue-vehicle preparation was authorized.
     Launch and checkout crews began working a 24-hr-day, 7-day-week
     schedule, preparing two additional couches and other equipment for
     installation. Earliest possible date for a rescue mission was established
      as Sept. 5. The EVA rescheduled for Aug. 4 was again postponed, for
      24 to 48 hours to free the crew for system checks, to free ground
     controllers to troubleshoot the problem, and to give time to work out EVA
     procedures for the new spacecraft configuration. While reentry pro-
     cedures were being rewritten for the new configuration, the astronauts
      continued scientific experiments.
         By the afternoon of Aug. 2 Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., JSC
     Director, was able to tell the astronauts that troubleshooting the RCS
      had indicated no apparent generic problem, but two unique quad fail-
      ures, and there was now confidence that the two remaining quads would
      ensure attitude control should immediate reentry become necessary.
      â€œWeâ€™re proceeding . . . as if weâ€™re going to have a normal mission.â€
      Astronaut Bean replied: â€œFine. You just said the right words. . . . weâ€™re
      pretty happy with the way things are going, at the moment . . . and we
      agree 100 percent with what you just announced. . . . everybodyâ€™s happy
      up here.â€
         On Aug. 3 Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said at a
      JSC press briefing that continuing investigation indicated the two quad
      failures were unrelated and reexamination of reentry capabilities showed
      three ways of returning to the earth: using the primary service
      propulsion system, using the RCS with the two operational quads, and
      using the hybrid RCS in the CM. â€œWeâ€™re feeling considerably better
           ..   . yesterday morning.â€™â€™ A slowdown was ordered in the emer-
      than
      gency rescue preparations. The Apollo CM would be outfitted in a

   five needed for a rescue mission. The slowdown would delay rescue
   readiness until Sept. 10.
      Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma conducted their first full
   day of experiments and prepared for an earth resources experiment
   package pass. Garriott held the TV camera at the window to telecast
   a good view of the US. from North Dakota to North Carolina. Later
   the first of 26 EREP passes was made, to gather data for oil exploration,
   ocean temperatures, mapping, land use surveys, crop inventories, and
   pollution studies.
       A master alarm sounded in the CSM Aug. 4, later attributed to a
   short-circuit in Skylabâ€™s solar telescope system. The short knocked out
   one of the two TV systems in the ATM but did not affect Skylabâ€™s main
   power system. Ground crews investigated problems in the primary and
   secondary coolant systems Aug. 5. One had been slowly leaking since
   the Skylab 1 launch May 14 and was expected to become inoperative
   in 16 to 20 days. The secondary loop was thought to have a small leak,
   begun during the Skylab 2 mission and giving the loop a predicted
   60-day lifetime. Possibly additional coolant would have to be carried
   u p by the next manned mission, Skylab 4, but Program Director
   Schneider said there was â€œno immediate danger to the crew.â€ By Aug.
   6 evaluations showed that only the primary loop was leaking; the
   second was sound and could operate for the rest of Skylab 3 as well as
   for Skylab 4.
       Flight surgeon Paul Buchananâ€™s nightly bulletin said Aug. 5 that the
   crew â€œcontinues to report good health and optimistic outlookâ€ and had
   asked about an increase in their menus â€œto match their growing ap-
   petites.â€ Fluid intake and output was â€œoptimal.â€
       The first EVA was performed Aug. 6. Garriott and Lousma stepped
   outside the orbiting laboratory at 1:30 pm EDT to install the 3.6- by
   7.3-m (12- by 24-ft), paper-thin, aluminized Mylar awning over the
   Workshop to reflect the sunâ€™s rays away from the spacecraft skin,
    damaged when the meteoroid shield was torn off during the May
   launch. Garriott, standing in the Skylabâ€™s open hatch, pieced together
    the two 16.8-m (55-ft) poles from metal sections and handed them to
    Lousma. Lousma attached them to a bracket to form a â€œVâ€ over the
   Workshop. The sunshade was slowly pulled up by a system of pulleys.
    One rope kept twisting around the poles and the sunshade folds did
    not straighten immediately, but after four hours-twice the time ex-
    pected-the    sunshade was successfully deployed. Workshop tempera-
    tures were lowered before the EVA ended. Astronaut Bean said Garriott
    and Lousma worked â€œat a slow and steady paceâ€ and were not tired.
    Lousma retrieved and replaced film in four ATM experiments, installed
    two new cameras, removed a door latch from an ATM experiment, and
    fixed the particle-collection experiment to the rim of the ATM.
       Lousma also inspected the two leaking quads in the CSM RCS and
    looked for coolant leaks. He noted some evidence of micrometeorite
    pitting but no clues to causes of the malfunctions. The astronauts
    completed the EVA at 8:Ol pm EDT, after 6 hrs 31 min, surpassing the
    3-hr 30-min record set June 7 by Skylab 2 Astronauts Charles Conrad,
    Jr., and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin.
       Garriott, first solar physicist in space, focused the ATM cameras on
    the sun Aug. 7 for the first time during the mission. TV audiences
    watched him work at the ATM panel.

         By Aug. 8 Dr. Lawrence F. Dietlein, JSC Deputy Director for Life
     Sciences, reported the astronauts were â€œin excellent spirits and have no
     health problems.â€ They had completely recovered from motion sickness.
     Their weights had stabilized after a loss of 1.8 to 2.3 kg (4 to 5 lbs)
     each. Data obtained on the rotating chair indicated their sensitivity
     to motion had lifted. Since deployment of the sunshade, temperatures
     in the Workshop had dropped to 296 K (74â€™F).
         The crew photographed a coronal transient with the ATM camera two
     hours Aug. 10. It was the first time a transient-protons         and free
     electrons expelled violently from the sunâ€™s limb at a speed of about
     312 km (194 mi) per sec, a phenomenon that occurred two or three
     times a year-had been observed at that range and time resolution.
         Program Director Schneider announced Aug. 14 that Skylab 3 would
     continue its full 59-day mission. From analyses of the CSM and Work-
     shop, he had â€œconcluded that there is no imminent need for rescue,
     and . . . we have made the decision to proceed with a normal test flow
     on an accelerated basis at Cape Kennedy.â€ Skylab 4 was being pre-
     pared for a normal mission but would be available for a rescue mission
     if necessary. The earliest launch date could be Sept. 25. Schneider
     said, â€œWeâ€™re reasonably confident that [CSM] 117 is a good vehicle.â€
     â€œLooks like they got a renewed burst of confidence down there,â€ Bean
     said when told of the decision. â€œWe feel that way up here.â€ JSC an-
     nounced Aug. 21 that the astronauts would install a new â€œsix-packâ€
     of gyroscopes during an Aug. 24 EVA, to replace faulty ones. The
     six-pack had been carri2d up on the Skylab 3 CM.
         Meanwhile the crew continued with experiments, requesting more
     work Aug. 14 because all had spare time and â€œyou just canâ€™t sleep 8
     hours up here.â€ They photographed tropical storm Brenda Aug. 19
      as it moved across theYucatan Peninsula toward the Gulf of Mexico.
         On Aug. 21 Astronaut Bean discovered and photographed through
     ATM telescopes what Skylab principal investigator Dr. Robert MacQueen
      called â€œcertainly one of the biggest solar eventsâ€ seen on the Skylab
      missions. Bean said the complex series of events on the solar limb
     looked â€œlike a big bubbleâ€ sitting on the edge of the disc. He observed
     it with the white light coronagraph and x-ray instruments and reported
      it to be three fourths the size of the sun. NASA scientists alerted other
      facilities to make observations from ground instruments and other
     satellites. Dr. MacQueen said the event might have been caused by an
      explosion on the back side of the sun. â€œIt was a beautiful event.â€ The
      crew â€œdid a fine job.â€™â€™
         Schneider announced Aug. 23 (MD-27) that the Skylab 3 crew had
      been given permission to continue the mission for another seven days.
      Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, JSC Deputy Director of Life Sciences for
      Medical Operations, told the press that he saw nothing in the medical
      data thus far â€œthat would indicate that we could not press on with
                         .
      the mission, and . . we feel we can go the full 59 days as planned.â€
         EVA-2 began at 1 2 ~ 2 4 EDT Aug. 24 with AM depressurization
                                  pm
      by Lousma and Garriott. Lousma completed installation of the six
      redesigned gyros mounted inside the spacecraft by connecting cables
      to a computer system outside, and the new gyro system was put into
      operation. The astronauts installed a sail sample on a hand rail to test
      durability, replaced ATM film, retrieved and stored cassettes from one

   experiment, and removed the aperture door ramp latch from two ATM
   experiments, concluding EVA-2 at 4:31 pm EDT, after 4 hrs 30 min.
      At 8:Ol am EDT Aug. 25 (MD-29) the Skylab 3 astronauts surpassed
   the single-mission endurance mark of 28 days 50 min set in June by
   Skylab 2. They had completed 404 earth orbits and had traveled 18.5
   million km (11.5 million mi). And at 6:11 am EDT Sept. 5 ( M D 4 0 )
   Astronaut Bean surpassed the space flight record for one man of 49
   days 3 hrs 38 min 36 sec, set in June by Charles Conrad, Jr., on
   Skylab 2.
      EVA-3 began at 7:18 am EDT Sept. 22. Bean and Garriott moved
   through space to retrieve and replace ATM film and retrieve experiments
   and parasol samples. EVA operations ended at 9:59 am EDT, after 2 hrs
   41 min.
      During the mission, spiders Arabella and Anita first spun webs in
   corners of their cage, without the normal circular pattern. Each day,
   however, each improved web formation, adding more radials, adjusting
   to weightlessness. Garriott said of Arabella Aug. 9 that â€œshe learned
   very rapidly in zero-g without the benefit of any previous experience.â€
   She â€œfigured out a very nice solution to the problems of zero gravity.â€
   Later ground controllers told Garriott to share his filet mignon with
   the spiders to keep them alive for the entire mission. Anita, however,
   was found dead Sept. 16, possibly from inadequate diet.
      September 24-25: The Workshop was deactivated and, on Sept. 25,
   the CSM powered up. The CSM undocked f-rom the Workshop at 3:34 pm
   EDT, separating at 3 :50. The service propulsion system engine made the
   deorbit maneuver at 5:38 pm EDT and the CM splashed down upside
   down at 6:20 pm EDT 400 km (250 mi) southwest of San Diego, Calif.
      The astronauts righted the CM and remained inside until the recovery
   ship U.S.S. N e w Orleans maneuvered alongside and a crane lifted the
   CM aboard. Immediate medical examinations found the crew in excellent
   spirits and surprisingly good condition. Blood pressures and heart rates
   were within normal range. The astronauts would remain aboard ship
   in San Diego for physical checks and would fly to Houston Sept. 26.
   They would be quarantined for one week.
      The Shylab 3 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing
   unmanned Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital
   assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending
   manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. Despite
   mission problems, 150% of scheduled ATM observing time was accom-
   plished and EREP sensors were operated on 39 Z-axis local vertical data
   runs and 5 solar inertial data runs, completing 218 of the 386 earth
   resources task sites. All medical experiments were successfully carried
   out. All but one of the corollary experiments achieved or exceeded
   objectives. Of 13 student experiments, 9 were completed. Added un-
   scheduled tests and experiments had significantly increased the data
   yield above premission planning and Skylab was left in an excellent
   position to complete the final SL-4 mission. Skylab 3 was officially
   adjudged a success Oct. 11.
      Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration
   manned space flight to date, 59 days 11 hrs 9 min; the longest cumula-
   tive time in space for one man, 69 days for Bean (who had spent 10
   days on the Nov. 14-24, 1969, Apollo 12 mission) ; the longest distance
   in orbit for a manned mission, 41 000 000 km (25 500 000 mi) ; the

     longest EVA, 6 hrs 31 min on Aug. 6; and the longest cumulative
     orbital EVA time, for one astronaut, 13 hrs 40 min for Garriott.
        In the first mission to man the Orbital Workshop May 15-June 22,
     Skylab 2 astronauts had conducted medical, solar, and earth resources
     experiments for 28 days, as well as repairing the Workshop to salvage
     the mission. The Workshop would be operated unmanned until the
     November Skylab 4 launch for a third and final mission. (NASA prog

July 30: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, praised NASAâ€™s      success-
     ful efforts to save the ShyZab 1-2 mission during testimony before the
     Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Science hearing to review
     the Skylab Investigation Report [see July 131: â€œWe were able to save
     Skylab because of the tremendous depth and breadth of the NASA team
     and the dedication and skills of thousands of people on that team. There
     certainly isnâ€™t another country that could have reacted as we did. I doubt
     whether there is another team within this country that could have re-
     acted in this manner. Our team could do it because of years of training,
     working hard on highly exacting projects, and working as a team to
     drive toward a technical objective. The performance of the team on the
     ground, and of course the magnificent performance, skill and courage
     of the astronauts, saved Skylab. I would hope that this is remembered as
     the real story of Skylab, not the failure which caused it to happen.â€ NASA
     was â€œtaking all the steps we know how to prevent a future failure due
     to similar causes in other programs.â€
        Director Bruce T. Lundin of Lewis Research Center testified that,
     throughout six years of reviews and certifications, â€œthe principal atten-
     tion devoted to the meteoroid shield was that of achieving a satisfactory
     deployment. Never did the matter of aerodynamic loads on the shield
     or aeroelastic interactions between the shield and its external pressure
     environment during launch receive the attention and understanding
     during the design and review process which in retrospect it deserved.â€
     The omission had not been surprising. â€œFrom the beginning, a basic
      design concept and requirement was that the shield be tight to the
     tank.â€ The question of whether the shield would remain tight against
     the tank under the dynamics of flight through the atmosphere â€œwas
     simply not considered i n any coordinated manner.â€ Possibly contribut-
     ing to the oversight â€œwas the basic view of the meteoroid shield as a
     piece of structure.â€™â€™ No full-time subsystem engineer had been assigned
     to the shield. â€œWhile it is recognized that one cannot have a full-time
     engineer on every piece of equipment, it is. . . possible that the complex
      interactions and integration of aerodynamics, structure, rigging pro-
     cedures, ordnance, deployment mechanisms, and thermal requirements

    ment.â€ (Testimony)
  ∞Navy development of hydrofoils and surface effect ships (SESS) with speeds
    to 177 km (110 mi) per hr was seeking to make the Soviet navy obso-
    lete, the Washington Star-News reported. R/A George G. Halvorson,
    Director of the USNâ€™S Surface Ship Acquisition Div., had said the USN
    was already ahead of the U.S.S.R. in â€œfast navyâ€ technology. â€œWe are
    now on the verge of the biggest advance in ships since the change from
    sail to steam.â€ Four hydrofoils and two SESS of patrol size were already
    in Navy service and the first of two destroyer-size SESS, with speeds to
    177 km per hr, was to be added by 1978. The USN was buying 2 of 30
    hydrofoil patrol boats planned for Italian, German, and U S . fleets in
    Europe. From the success of test ships, Adm. Halvorson could visualize
    a nuclear-powered, 177-km-per-hr aircraft carrier. Existing destroyers
    and carriers had a top speed of 64 km (a per hr.
                                                  mi)
       Hydrofoils rode above the water on stilts supported by underwater
    wings. A jet aircraft engine powered a pump to force water from jets
    below the stern to drive the ship. SESS, or hovercraft, glided on a cushion
    of air. Their sides extended underwater where propellers or water jets
     drove the ships. ( W Star-News, 7/30/73, 31)

∞The National Science Foundation released Graduate Student Support and
    Manpower Resources in Graduate Science Education ( NSF 73-304) .
    Graduate science enrollment in doctorate departments applying for
    NSF traineeships declined 3% from 1970 to 1971 in all scientific areas
    except psychology and the social sciences. The number of students
    enrolling for the first time dropped 4% in 1970 and 8% in 1971.
    Graduate enrollment of foreign students declined 2% in 1971, after
    having increased 10% from 1967 to 1968 and another 11% by 1969.
    The enrollment dropoff of nearly 2% in full-time graduate science stu-
    dents was attributed to an acute financial squeeze, during which several
    leading universities began restricting enrollment, and to student disen-
    chantment with science and technology because of rising unemployment

∞Preliminary results of the Naval Research Laboratoryâ€™s SO09 experiment
    aboard the Skylab 1 Workshop (launched by NASA May 14) were pub-
    lished by Naval Research Reviews. NRL scientist Dr. Maurice M. Shapiro,
    principal investigator for S-009, had said the experiment, to study the
    heavy atomic nuclei among the cosmic ray particles that constantly
    bombarded the earth from outer space, had obtained more accurate
    measurement of the relative abundances of nuclei in the primary cosmic
    ray influx than had previously been obtained from the exposure of
    sensitive detectors flown on high-altitude balloon flights. Comparisons
    had already been made between the source composition of cosmic rays
    and the element abundances in the solar system and in nearby stars.
    These suggested that certain nuclear processes occurring on a very short
    time-scale during the explosion of a supernova could be important to the
    production of cosmic ray nuclei. (Naval Research Reviews, 7/73, 32)

∞The House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Manned Space Flight held a hearing on the Skylab 1 Investigation
    Report [see July 131. A Senate hearing had been held July 30. Lewis
    Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, Skylab 1 Investigation Board
    Chairman, testified that the failure to recognize design deficiencies in
    the Orbital Workshopâ€™s meteoroid shield that led to its loss during the
    May 14-June 22 S k y h b 1-2 mission and the failure to communicate the
    importance of proper venting of the shield must be attributed to â€œan
    absence of sound engineering judgment and alert engineering leader-
     ship . . . over a considerable period of time.â€ There had been no evi-
     dence to indicate that â€œthe design, development and testing of the
     meteoroid shield were compromised by limitations of funds or time.
     The quality of workmanship applied to the shield was adequate for its
     intended purpose.â€ Testing emphasis on ordnance performance and
     shield deployment had been appropriate. â€œEngineering and management
     personnel on Skylab, on the part of both contractor and Government,
     were available from the prior Saturn development and were thus
     highly experienced and adequate in number.â€
        The Investigation Board had suggested corrective action : omit the
     meteoroid shield on any future Workshops, coat the Workshop for
     thermal control, and rely on meteoroid protection from the Workshop
     tank walls. If further protection was required, the Board had favored a
     fixed, nondeployable shield. To reduce the probability of separation
     failures as had occurred at Saturn S-I1 interstage second separation
     plane, linear-shaped charges should be detonated simultaneously from
     both ends, and all ordnance applications should be reviewed for a
     similar failure mode. Structural systems that had to move or deploy, or
     that required other mechanisms or components for operation, should
     not be considered solely as structure ; and complex, multidisciplinary
     systems should have a designated project engineer.

August 3: A New York Times editorial commented on the Aug. 2 discovery
    of an oxidizer leak that threatened the safety of the Skylab 3 astronauts
    (launched July 28 to man the Orbital Workshop launched May 14) :
    â€œEven though it finally proved unnecessary to order three men back to
    earth immediately, two points did emerge with special clarity from this
    short-lived scare situation. First, not all difficulties that can arise in
    manned space missions can be repaired by men on a troubled vehicle.â€
    Second, â€œand more fundamental, this latest incident again brings into
    sharp focus the need for standby rescue rockets for manned space ven-
    tures. The lack of rescue vehicles in the past has come in for justified
    and severe criticism. This time NASA has demonstrated that it has learned
    the lessons of history.â€™â€™ An Apollo spacecraft was being readied as a
    rescue vehicle for the Skylab 3 crew if a new emergency arose. â€œMen in

    and Development Center. Earlier measurements using Apollo helmets
    as dosimeters had indicated that a significant 1% of certain nonregen-
    erative motor-control cells in the bodies of astronauts in space would
    be killed by radiation from densely ionizing, heavy atomic nuclei with
    the current Apollo spacecraft shielding. Doses of heavy particles pene-
    trating the CMS of Apollo 8, 12, 14, and 16 correlated well with calcu-
    lated effects of solar modulation of the primary cosmic radiation.
    Differences in doses at different positions inside the CMS had indicated
    that the redistribution of mass within the spacecraft could enhance
    safety from the biological damage that would otherwise be expected on

    earth and was scheduled to make history's first visit to Jupiter in
    December. When the spacecraft, the earth, and the sun were aligned in
    inferior conjunction, Pwneer 10's sun sensor would look almost directly
    at the sun, interfering with the sensor's count of the spacecraft rotation
    rate. To avoid the problem, ARC flight directors were keeping the point-
    ing direction of the spacecraft's radio beam and sun sensor 1.5" from
    the sun and 1" from the earth.
       Pioneer 11 (launched toward Jupiter April 5, 1973) was 150 million
    km (93 million mi) from the earth. Both spacecraft were functioning
    well. ( A R C Release 73-84)
∞Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory held the first public
    demonstration of its new heart pacemaker that used electric and elec-
    tronic components designed by NASA for spacecraft use. The new pace-
    maker, smaller and longer lasting than conventional models, could be
    implanted more quickly and easily. It had no life-limiting components
    or radioactive emissions, was immune from outside interference sources,
    and could be recharged by patients at home. It incorporated modified
    space satellite power cells. (NASA Release 73-150; Cohn, W Post,

August 9-16: The U.S.S.R. launched its Mars 7 probe from Baykonur
    Cosmodrome at 10:00 pm local time ( 1:00 pm EDT) into an earth park-
    ing orbit from which it was inserted into a trajectory toward Mars. The
    parameters of the trajectory were as planned, Tass reported. Mars 7
    was the fourth in a series of spacecraft launched by the U.S.S.R. to-
    ward Mars during the month-long window when the earth and Mars
    were in alignment for a space launch. Mars 4 and 5 were launched
    July 22 and 25. Mars 6 was launched Aug. 5.
       Mars 7 , which would reach its destination in mid-March 1974, was
    similar in design and mission to Mars 6 . Both spacecraft-intended for
    exploration of Mars, near-Mars space, and the interplanetary medium-
    carried Soviet- and French-built scientific equipment. All four Mars
    probes would carry out research in combination. Tass said Mars 4
    would perform experiments using instruments on Mars 6 while Mars 5
    would work in conjunction with Mars 7 .
       On Aug. 10, at 4:OO am Baykonur time (7:OO pm EDT, Aug. 9 ) ,
    Mars 4 was 6 432 000 km ( 3 997 000 mi) from the earth; Mars 5,
    5 067 000 km (3 148 000 mi) from the earth; Mars 6, 1 535 000 km
     (954 000 mi) from the earth; and Mars 7 , 102 000 km (63 000 mi)
    from the earth. Tass reported that all spacecraft were proceeding ac-
    cording to their programs.
       A midcourse correction of the Mars 6 trajectory Aug. 13 and of the
    Mars 7 trajectory Aug. 16 put the flight paths â€œwithin the pre-set limits.â€
    Tass said onboard systems of all four probes were functioning normally
    and measurements were being made of physical characteristics of in-
    terplanetary space. (CSFC SSR, 8/31/72; FBIS-SOV,8/10/73, L1;

    Ray Crowley said in the Washington Star-News. Neglected had been
    <<
       human intuition, communications between the men working on differ-

    had submerged the individual. Missing had been â€œthe old-fashioned
    â€˜chief engineerâ€™ with few managerial duties who brought his total
     experience and spent most of his time integrating all elements of the

     cussion between the groups of men working on the project.â€ The in-
    vestigators had cautioned that management must counteract the natural
     tendency of engineers to believe a drawing is the real world. One team
     had found that extensive use of computers for complex analyses could
     serve to remove the analyst from reality. Attention to rigor, detail, and
     thoroughness, â€œif carried too far, can inject an undue emphasis on
     formalism and documentation.â€ This caused too little thought to be

    totaled 7100, the largest influx over the past 20 yrs. The major factor
    in the decrease of immigrant scientists and engineers appeared to be
    revisions by the Dept. of Labor in regulations for certifying scientists
    and engineers applying for immigration. Since Feb. 4, 1971, these im-
    migrants were certified only if they had a job offer for which U S .

    independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVS) .
       New York Times: â€œSince the Soviet MIRV tests have been anticipated
    for so long, there is no justification for a panic reaction from Washing-
    ton, or a further fattening of the strategic weapons budget. The latest
    Soviet tests increase the urgency of concluding a MIRV limitation accord,

    achieving it.â€ (NYT, 8/20/73, 20)

    the Sovietsâ€™ giant missiles-especially given their present numerical ad-

    â€œprecisely this Soviet potential which argues for a serious, effective and
    non-wasteful approach to the circumstances in which we now find our-
    selves. This . . . is no time to proceed with turkeys and lemons, or to
    box ourselves into investments in weapons systems whose cost is ex-
    ceeded only by their irrelevance to such danger as we would be confront-
    ing a few years hence if the â€˜worst caseâ€™ regarding Soviet armament
    came true.â€ Before the issue of phasing out the present U.S. arsenal in
    favor of less vulnerable sea- and air-based forces, â€œone reaches the more
    immediate question of how this Soviet development can or cannot be
    tamed within the context of the current phase of the arms negotiations.â€

    fraction of hydrogen became deuterium and accepting the theory that
    deuterium had been created moments after the â€œbig bangâ€ believed to
    have started the expansion of the universe, the scientists had calculated
    the amount of matter created and the average density of the current

    km (340.6-mi) perigee, and 27.3â€™ inclination.
               primary objectives were to conduct design, performance, and
        NASAâ€™s
    flight-readiness reviews for the Federal Communications Commission;
    to ensure compatibility of INTELSAT spacecraft with NASA launch ve-

     F-7 into a transfer orbit that permitted the apogee-kick motor to insert
     the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit on the equator over the Atlantic
     Ocean. During a design life of seven years the spacecraft would add 12
     TV channels to those available between the US. and other countries
     and would increase the telephone capacity by 3500 two-way circuits.

    around the North Pole and the large areas of first-year ice varied sig-
    nificantly within one freezing season. Even greater changes occurred
    around Antarctica.
       Nimbus 5 also was measuring daily rainfall distribution over the

  ∞A Chicago Sun-Times editorial praised the â€œmapmakingâ€ of the Skylab 3
    astronauts (launched July 28 to man the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop
    launched May 14) : â€œWe were particularly impressed to read about
    their assigned job of photographing a swamp in southern Sudan as they
    zipped over North Africa.â€ Such tasks â€œpoint up the way in which a
    space shuttle can be used to facilitate jobs on Earth and, no less impor-

September 5: President Nixon submitted to Congress Science Indicators,
     1972, the fifth annual report of the National Science Board of the Na-
     tional Science Foundation. The proportion of the gross national product
    spent for research and development 1963-1971 declined in the US.,
     France, and the United Kingdom, but increased in the U.S.S.R., Japan,
     and West Germany. By 1971, U S . R&D expenditures were 2.6% of GNP,
     Soviet 3.0%, U.K. and West Germany 2.0%, and Japan and France
     1.8% each. The number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D per
     10 000 persons declined in the U S . after 1969, but continued to increase
     in the U.S.S.R., Japan, West Germany, and France. All countries reduced
     the national defense proportion of their R&D expenditures significantly
     between 1961 and 1969. U S . defense expenditures dropped from 65%
     to 49% of total Government R&D spending. Increases in the U S . and
     most other countries occurred in space, community services, and eco-
     nomic development.
        The US. had a favorable but declining â€œpatent balanceâ€ between
      1966 and 1970, with a reduced number of patents of U S . origin in
     France, West Germany, and the U.K. and increased US. patents of
     Japanese origin. The U S . had an increasingly favorable position in the
     sale of â€œtechnical know-howâ€-including patents, techniques, formulas,
     franchises, and manufacturing rights-during 1960-1971 ; Japan was
     the major purchaser, surpassing all of Western Europe after 1967. The
     favorable U S . balance of trade in technology-intensive products grew
      1960-1971, but was increasingly negative in nontechnology-intensive
     areas. Within technology-intensive areas, products with the fastest rising
     trade surplus were aircraft, computers, and plastics. ( P D , 9/10/73,

    the space shuttle program, the tugâ€™s fiscal impact on the program and
    the overall manned space flight budget, the operational impact on NASAâ€™s
    latest proposed mission model and on projected cost-per-flight of the

    Donlan, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight,
    and Capt. Robert F. Freitag (USN, Ret.), Deputy Director of Advanced
    Programs, presented an overview of the tug program Sept. 5 but made no
    recommendations, pending completion of a study. NASA would later rec-
    ommend program approach and supporting rationale.
        Representatives of General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., McDonnell
     Douglas Astronautics Co., Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Martin
    Marietta Co. Denver Div., and Grumman Aerospace Corp. presented
    results of efforts to date, with supporting data to substantiate the options
     afforded NASA in proceeding with tug development. Options under study
    included liquid-storable and cryogenic systems for a growth-stage tug,
     the Centaur as an expendable or recoverable launch vehicle, an expend-
    able Thor-Delta vehicle, an expendable or recoverable Agena vehicle,

     selected from 145 proposals by U S . and foreign scientists, with those
     which could include Soviet participation contingent upon Soviet Acad-
     emy of Sciences agreement.
        Four astronomy and space physics experiments would search for
     sources of extreme ultraviolet radiation in the night sky, measure inten-
     sity and distribution of helium-fluorescent radiation in night-sky regions,
     measure concentration of atmospheric constituents, and map celestial
     x-ray emissions in the 0.1- to 1.0-kev range.
        Six space applications processing experiments would use a small mul-
     tipurpose electric furnace to study properties and processes in zero
     gravity. Two other applications experiments would study electrophoresis
     and the structure of the earthâ€™s gravity field. Five life sciences experi-
     ments would investigate effects of weightlessness on human cells impor-

September 7: NASA held a Skylab solar activity briefing at Johnson Space
     Center, while Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott,
    and Jack R. Lousma completed their 42nd day working aboard the
    Skylab I Orbital Workshop. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
    istration scientist Joseph Hirman said that a flare photographed by the
    Skylab 3 crew was about 17 times the cross-sectional area of the earth
    and â€œoptically the biggest flare weâ€™ve had during ATM and perhaps the
    biggest for this entire year.â€ Within 30 min after the event â€œhigh
    energy protons made it from the Sun to the earth as a consequence of
    this flare.â€ Confirmation had also been given by x-ray satellites and by
    short-wave fade-out and other ionospheric disturbances on the ground
    of a very intense x-ray event. Within two days, with the arrival of
    subsequent particles, an aurora would be visible at the latitude of Chi-
    cago and enough geomagnetic activity would occur to disrupt power
    lines in high latitudes. Hirman said that the flare had created enough
    energy to â€œrun everything in the United States and the rest of the world
    combined for 500 years.â€ (Transcript)

September 10: President Nixon sent a message to Congress on national l e g
    islative goals. Of defense spending he said: â€œI continue to be adamantly
    opposed to attempts at balancing the overall budget by slashing the de-
    fense budget. . . . In constant dollars, our defense spending in this
     fiscal year will be $10 billion less than was spent in 1964, before the
    Vietnam war began. . . . Further cutsewodd be dangerously irrespon-

    national security. . . . The arms limitation agreement signed with the
    Soviet Union last year has at last halted the rapid growth in the numbers
    of strategic weapons. Despite this concrete achievement, much needs to
    be done to ensure continued stability and to support our negotiation of
    a permanent strategic arms agreement. A vigorous research and devel-
    opment program is essential to provide vital insurance that no adversary
    will ever gain a decisive advantage through technological breakthrough
    and that massive deployment expenditures will therefore not become
    necessary. Yet the Congress is in the process of slashing research and
    development funding below minimum prudent levels, including elimina-
    tion of our cruise missile and air defense programs. The Trident and
    B-1 programs, which are critical to maintaining a reliable deterrent
    into the next decade, are also facing proposals to cut them to the bone.â€
       The President reiterated his request that Congress authorize creation
    of Dept. of Energy and Natural Resources and â€œa new, independent
    Energy Research and Development Administration so that we can make
    the very best use of our research and development funds in the future.â€
    R&D efforts could produce â€œthe most helpful solutions to the energy

    annually, but OMB impoundment of funds had cut NASAâ€™s 1974
    budget to about $3 billion and â€œit appears OMB will hold the space agency
    to about $3.235 billion in fiscal 1975.â€ Inflation had aggravated NASAâ€™s
    problems and $85 million had been cut from the FY 1974 shuttle de-
    velopment budget. â€œBut now NASA is suggesting what some aerospace
    contractors are stating explicitly: That if the OMB squeeze stays on, then
    NASA will have to cut back on new starts in scientific programs. This is
     an odd irony, indeed, since the very purpose of the shuttle is to serve
    these new programs.â€ The Sun felt â€œthat if NASA accountants are told
    to sharpen their pencils they can keep the shuttle alive as well as pro-
    vide for initiation of the new scientific programs. The Nixon OMB
     consistently has given science short shrift, however, and it would be
     sad indeed if the space program were hobbled at the very time it is
    beginning to show immense scientific promise.â€™â€™ (B Sun, 9/10/73, A l l )

     ergy was recognized as a â€œcurrently viable and relatively unpolluting
     energy resource.â€ Its importance depended upon development of new
     technologies and â€œresolution of institutional constraints.â€ NSF was rec-
     ommending a program to develop necessary technologies and â€œto syn-
     thesize these into pilot plants capable of generating power from a variety
     of geothermal sources.â€ An advantage of geothermal energy was â€œthat
     construction of power plants can be carried out in a relatively short
     time.â€ With solution of the technical problems in extracting the earthâ€™s
     heat and converting it into electricity, â€œthe commercial impact of geo-
     thermal energy could begin to be felt within this decade. Geothermal
     energy is, therefore, counted on to contribute at least regionally to a
     resolution of the energy crisis in the short term as well as to provide
     sizable blocks of energy in the remaining years of this century.â€ (Tran-

  ∞Climatic changes on Mars indicated by Mariner 9 (launched by NASA

     Dr. Carl E. Sagan and team: â€œThe equatorial sinuous channels on Mars
     detected by Mariner 9 point to a past epoch of higher pressures and
     abundant liquid water. Advective instability of the martian atmosphere
     permits two stable climates-one close to present conditions, the other
     at a pressure of the order of 1 bar [lo0 kilonewtons per sq mi] de-
     pending on the quantity of buried volatiles. Variations in the obliquity of
     Mars, the luminosity of the sun, and the albedo of the polar caps each
     appear capable of driving the instability between a current ice age and
     more clement conditions. Obliquity driving alone implies that epochs of
     much higher and of much lower pressure must have characterized mar-
     tian history. Climatic change on Mars may have important meteorologi-

September 17: The liquid-fueled â€œcoreâ€ vehicle of the Titan-Centaur launch
     vehicle was moved from the Vertical Integration Building to the Solid
     Motor Assembly Building in the Titan complex at Kennedy Space Cen-

     attached to the core. The Titan-Centaur, scheduled to be launched on its
     proof flight in January 1974, mated the Titan I11 core vehicle and
     its twin solid-fueled rockets with the Centaur high-energy liquid-fueled
     final stage. The 49-m (160-ft), 3610-kg (7959-1b) configuration was
     designed to carry heavy payloads on orbital and planetary missions,
     such as the Viking Mars mission and the joint U S . and West German
     Helios mission to the sun, during the mid- and late 1970s. The liftoff
     thrust of the twin solid-fueled boosters was 10.8 million newtons (2.4
                 .
     million lbs)
        On its proof flight the Titan-Centaur would carry a mass model of
     the Viking spacecraft and a 66-kg (145-lb) Space Plasma High Voltage
     Interaction Experiment (SPHINX) spacecraft, to measure in orbit for
     one year the interaction of space plasmas with high-voltage surfaces.
     The main purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate that the launch
     vehicle and launch facilities could support operational missions and
     that the Centaur could perform an operational two-burn mission and an
     operational three-burn mission carrying a payload to a synchronous al-
     titude of 35 888 km (22 300 mi).
        The effort to integrate the Titan with the Centaur had begun in the

    The program, being carried out by Jet Propulsion Laboratory with as-
    sistance from Lewis Research Center, was â€œan exciting experimental
    effort to bring old and new technology to bear on one of the major
    problems of modern society.â€
       In Phase 1,begun in April for conclusion in December, small amounts
    of hydrogen gas were being injected into a lean gasoline and air mix-
    ture to be burned in a standard automobile engine, first in a laboratory
    and later in an operating automobile with bottled hydrogen carried in
    its trunk. Preliminary laboratory tests had shown â€œa significant reduc-
    tion in pollution without an increase in fuel consumption. In fact, our
    preliminary figures indicate that hydrogen injection may even produce
    a fuel saving. This comes both from the direct effect of the hydrogen
    on the combustion process and from the better atomization of the fuel
    mixture.â€ Work was progressing at LeRC on a laboratory model of a
    generator in which the hydrogen would be produced from gasoline and
    water. Phase 2 would attempt to solve engineering problems in integrat-
    ing the hydrogen injection system, generators, and fuel controls into a
    smooth-running automobile. ( N A S A Activities, 10/15/73, 1 8 3 4 )

    farther into space than any man-made object, NASA announced. The
    spacecraft, when it swung by Jupiter on Dec. 3 to give man his first
    closeup look at that planet, would set a speed record of 132 000 km
     (82000 mi) per hr, breaking its own earlier mark of 51683 km
     (32 116 mi) per hr set at launch. After the Jupiter encounter, Pioneer
     10 would be hurled by the planetâ€™s gravity beyond the solar system
    toward the red star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus. It was ex-
    pected to cross the orbit of Pluto in 1987 still transmitting scientific
     data to the earth. The onboard experiments had been designed to yield
     useful data as far as 30 to 40 astronomical units, 4.5 billion-6.0 billion
    km (2.8 billion-3.7 billion m i ), away. The spacecraft had been tracked
     and controlled so precisely that it would arrive at Jupiter within less
     than a minute of the time predicted at launch.
        NASA had submitted three applications to the National Aeronautic
     Association and the Federation A6ronautique Internationale for Pioneer

     launched toward Mars July 22 and 25 and Aug. 5 and 9-would soft-
     land near the Mars south polar cap to test the physical properties of
     Martian soil and surface rocks and check the possibilities of transmitting
     TV pictures of the surrounding terrain to earth, Roald Sagdeyev,
     Director of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of
     Sciences, said in a Tass interview. Mars 4 and 5 were 19 515 000 km
      (12 126 000 mi) and 18 584 000 km (11548 000 mi) from the earth
     and would reach Mars in February 1974. Mars 6 and 7 were 16 664 000
     km (10 354 000 mi) and 15 623 000 km ( 9 708 000 mi) from the earth
     and would reach Mars in March 1974. Radiation and magnetic measure-
     ments were being made and cosmic rays were being studied, Sagdeyev
     said. The stations also would investigate solar noise in the meter wave
     band as well as register the flux of solar plasma.

September 24: A Memorandum of Understanding on international co-
     operation in NASAâ€™s space shuttle program was signed in Washington,
     D.C., by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Alexander
     Hocker, Director General of the European Space Research Organization
      (ESRO) . Nine EsRO-member countries would design, develop, manu-
     facture, and deliver a Spacelab flight unit to be carried in the space
     shuttle orbiter. The Spacelab would comprise a pressurized manned
     laboratory module and an instrument platform, or pallet, to support
     telescopes, antennas, and other equipment requiring direct space ex-
     posure. The Spacelab would be transported to and from orbit in the
     orbiter payload bay and would be attached to and supported by the
     shuttle orbiter throughout 7- to 30-day missions. At the missionâ€™s end,
     the Spacelab would be removed and prepared for its next mission.
        The estimated $300-million to $4OO-million Spacelab cost would be
     borne by Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, The
     Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland-the European nations that signed,
     with the US., the Intergovernmental Agreement for space shuttle co-
     operation [see Aug. 141. The agreement was open for signatures by
     other nations as well. Under Memorandum of Understanding terms NASA
     would manage all operational activities, including crew training and
     flight operations, following delivery of the Spacelab unit in late 1978,
     about one year before the space shuttleâ€™s scheduled first operational
     flight. NASA planned to carry a European flight crew member on the
     first shuttle flight and subsequent European flight crew opportunities
     would be provided in conjunction with ESRO or EsRo-member-govern-
     ment projects. NASA would make the shuttle available for Spacelab
     missions on either cooperative or cost-reimbursable basis. NASA would
     procure from ESRO any additional Spacelab units needed for US.

         Final signature of the Memorandum of Understanding having estab-
      lished the cooperative Spacelab program, NASA had decided to use

     also the most productive.â€ Skylab results to date had made two con-

     longer in orbit. Second, stations in space are potentially as productive
     of scientific and technological benefits as the most optimistic predic-
     tions had suggested. There is every reason now to suppose that these
     benefits will range from the discovery of new mineral deposits on earth
     and early warnings about the formation and movement of storms to
     new and more effective methods of predicting the turbulence on the sun

     Sen. Magnuson, with Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) and Sen. John V.
     Tunney (D-Calif.), introduced the bill Sept. 27.
        The bill, the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act,
     would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to
     provide â€œan organization within NASA to carry out programs . . . to
     resolve critical national problems. This would expand an activity al-

     which has already exhibited an impressive record of success.77The
     programs would be determined by a National Technology Resource
     Council of Cabinet members and heads of technological agencies, which
     would make its recommendations to the President.

     underpinning of strong research and development programs-vital to
     our technological advance-is being downgraded to a serious degree.
     There is an alarming scarcity of private sources of financing for the

     profit industry, traditionally averaging a profit about half that of other
     manufacturing industries, we lack the resources for reinvestment,
     cushioning against risk, and attracting investors. Above all, there is
     uncertainty in this transitional period about future national goals which
     might utilize our capabilities. Will we continue to contribute primarily
     to space exploration, defense, and long-range air travel, or will we
     next find ourselves emphasizing such efforts as environmental control,

September 27-29: The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 12, carrying cosmonauts
     L/C Vasily G. Lazarev and flight engineer Oleg G. Makarov, from
     Baykonur Cosmodrome at 5:18 pm local time (3:18 pm Moscow time;
    8:18 am EDT) into earth orbit with 229-km (142.3-mi) apogee, 180-km
     (111.8-mi) perigee, 88.6-min period, and 51.7â€ inclination. Soviet
     news agency Tass announced the objectives of the two-day mission were
     to test improved flight systems, test manual and automatic control in
    various flight conditions, and obtain spectrographic data of separate
    sections of the earth (â€˜for the solution of economic problems.â€ The
     flight would further improve development of manned spacecraft.
        After six hours in flight the cosmonauts reported they had adjusted
     to weightlessness and were carrying out all scheduled activities. All
    spacecraft systems were functioning normally. During the first day,
    Lazarov-45-yr-old air force test pilot and physician-and Makarov-
    40-yr-old engineer who had taken part in developing the control board
    and flight program for Yuri A. Gagarinâ€™s Vostok I mission of April 12,
     1961-maneuvered their spacecraft in orbit to test manual and auto-
    matic control and piloting techniques. The spacecraft was moved into a
    higher and nearly circular orbit, with parameters reported by Tass as
     345-km (214.4-mi) apogee, 326-km (202.6-mi) perigee, 91-min period,
     and 51.6â€ inclination.
        The cosmonauts also made spectrographs of natural formations of the
     earthâ€˜s surface. They were reported Sept. 28 to be in high spirits and
     good physical condition. Tass reported a new spacecraft design and a
     new spacesuit, â€œvery simple and comfortable,â€ were being tested.
     Spacesuits were worn for launch and descent but not during the flight
     itself.
        On Sept. 29 the crew oriented their spacecraft and fired the braking
     engine. The landing module separated from the spacecraft and entered
     descent trajectory. The parachute system was deployed at 7.6 km
      (4.7 mi) above the earth and engines softlanded the craft 400 km
      (250 mi) southwest of Karaganda in the Kazakhstan Steppe at 2:34
     pm Moscow time (7:34 am EDT) . A medical check at the landing site
     showed â€œthe state of [the cosmonauts~]health is good.â€
        Soyuz 12 was the first Soviet manned space flight since the 1971
    Salyut 1-Soyuz 11 mission. Soyuz 10 (launched April 23, 1971, carry-
     ing three cosmonauts) had docked with the orbiting Salyut 1 space
     laboratory (launched April 19) but the cosmonauts had not boarded.
     American observers believed the Soyuz spacecraft had spun out of
     control, causing the cosmonauts to become ill and necessitating an early
     return to earth. Three cosmonauts launched June 6, 1971, on Soyuz 11
     had docked with and boarded Salyut 1. They worked successfully in
     orbit for 24 days but were found dead on landing, from pressure loss
     in the landing craft. (GSFC SSR, 9/30/73; FBIS-SOV,9/28/73, U1-4;

  ∞Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma, and Dr. Owen K.
    Garriott arrived in San Diego, Calif., aboard the recovery ship U.S.S.
    New Orleans and were flown to Houston, Tex., on an Air Force C-141
    troop carrier aircraft. Blood samples from all three astronauts were
    flown to Johnson Space Center for analysis. The astronauts were under
    limited quarantine for one week to protect them from infection.

  ∞In a Skylab 3 postflight medical briefing at Johnson Space Center, Dr.
    Willard R. Hawkins, JSC Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical
    Operations, said that the condition of the Skylab 3 astronauts, who
    splashed down Sept. 25 after a 59-day mission aboard the Skylab 1
    Orbital Workshop, â€œdid slightly exceed our expectations.â€ They were
    in better shape than the Skytab 2 crew (launched May 25 on a 28-day
    mission). Alan L. Bean had lost just over 3.6 kg (8 Ibs) ; Dr. Owen K.
    Garriott and Jack R. Lousma had both lost between 2.7 and 3.6 kg
     (6 and 8 lbs) . All three crew members had lost between 2.5 and 3.8 cm
     (1 and 1.5 in) in calf circumference. They had been able to complete
    the full routine through the maximum stress level of -50 mm of
    mercury in the lower-body pressure experiment. Heart rates and blood
    rates were well above their preflight measurements. The crew was
    experiencing slight vestibular disturbances, particularly associated with
    any head movement, but these were gradually disappearing. (Tran-

  ∞Newspaper editorials commented on the safe Sept. 25 return of Skylab 3.
        Baltimore Sun: The mission had been â€œan immense scientific success
    which produced unprecedented and extremely valuable data especially
    on solar activity.â€ It would be â€œmere superstition to believe nature is
    co-operating with man by producing solar flares and comets just when
    we would most like to have them. But the Skylab missions so far have
    had a lot of good luck.â€ (B Sun, 9/27/73, A14)
        Miami Herald: â€œAll told, the Skylab missions appear to promise
     rewards even greater than the enlargement of knowledge created by the
    Apollo moon voyages. The outreach of the human mind is inexorable.â€
     (M Her, 9/27/73)
        Chicago Sun-Times: â€œWith casual aplomb, the astronauts performed
    their sophisticated experiments, floated weightlessly through, outside
     and around the Skylab, and fixed their spacecraft like mundane
     mechanics when something went haywire. It all seemed so routine. In
    the austere domain of space, as on Earth, how quickly does the miracu-
    lous become absorbed into the commonplace.â€ (C Sun-Times, 9/27/73)
        Christian Science Monitor: â€œEven those most intimately involved
    with the space program, slated now for more international participation
     as well as applause, would admit we may now but dimly grasp the full
     significance of our space sorties.â€ The names of the Skylab 3 astronauts
     would, nonetheless, be added â€œto the list of welcomed home heroes of
    mankindâ€™s young space chapter.â€ (CSM, 9/27/73)
        Philadelphia Inquirer: â€œSpace exploration has matured to space
    work. During 59 days in earth orbit-more than doubling the space
     flight record set earlier this year by three astronauts in the same
     Skylab-assignments      were carried out with diligence and precision.
     Scientific experiments and observations could â€œproduce long-range
                                                                extraordinary
     dividends, not immediately apparent.â€ Despite NASAâ€™s
     safety record space was â€œa hostile environment posing hazardous

     come not from derring do but from workmanlike execution of assign-
     ments with down-to-earth relevance to needs of mankind.â€ ( P Znq,

  ∞General Dynamics Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David S.
     Lewis told the press in St. Louis, Mo., that he had signed an agreement
     with Dzherman M. Givishiany, Vice-chairman of the Soviet Committee
     for Science and Technology, for scientific and technical cooperation.
     The agreement covered commercial shipping, telecommunications
     equipment, asbestos mining, aircraft, computer-operated microfilm
     equipment, and navigation and weather buoys. (AP, T d u y , 9/28/73)
∞L/C Harold E. Turner (USAF, Ret.), the first commanding officer of White
     Sands Proving Ground (which became White Sands Missile Range in
     1958) died in El Paso, Tex., at age 75. He had been transferred from
     White Sands to Patrick Air Force Base, Fla., where a proving ground
     was to be built on Cape Canaveral. There Col. Turner supervised the
     firing of Cape Canaveralâ€™s first rocket, the two-stage Bumper 8 ( a V-2
     first stage with a Wac Corporal 2nd stage) July 24, 1950. He was later
     medically retired after suffering cerebral damage during an accident
     at the Cape. (AP, W Post, 9/29/73, D1; A&A 1915-60)
September 28: Processed samples from Skylab 3 experiments carried on
     the 59-day mission (launched July 28 to man the Orbital Workshop,
     launched May 14) were returned to Marshall Space Flight Center. They
     were opened, x-rayed, and photographed before being delivered to
     principal investigators who would report within six months. Among the
     samples were 1 of solidification (crystal growth performed in the M-
                      1
     518 multipurpose electrical furnace system) and the remains of spiders
     Anita and Arabella, who died after spinning webs in zero g for the
     first time. The spidersâ€™ bodies would be given to the Smithsonian
     Institution for display later in the week, following examination by a
     student experimenter. Preliminary examination had shown that Arabella
     died of malnutrition. Anita had died in space of probably the same
     cause Sept. 15. (MSFC Release 73-146)
∞Newspaper editorials commented on the Sept. 25 successful splashdown of
     SkyZab 3 [see July 28-Sept. 251.
        The Wmhington Star-News: The astronauts couldnâ€™t have selected a
     worse evening to return to the earth â€œin the whole 20th Century.â€ Their
     reentry had been â€œupstaged, unfortunately,â€ by Vice President Spiro T.
     Agnewâ€™s vain attempts to clear himself of allegations of bribery and
     income tax evasion, â€œand, of course, the Watergate hearings persisted
     as a distraction. But these latest Skylab voyagers still must receive the
     recognition they deserve for the longest and most voluminously re-
     warding space flight in history.â€ Skylab was â€œthe proper program in
     space for the years just ahead, because it promises many more revela-
     tions about the earth and seas-the condition and potentials of our
     planet.â€ ( W Star-News, 9/28/73, A18)
        The WdZ Street Journal noted that the Skylab 3 crew could anticipate
     a small pleasure that eluded most returning travelers. â€œUnlike the rest
     of us, they have numbers of people who are absolutely hungering to see
     the photographs they brought back, despite the fact that theyâ€™ve re-
     turned with no fewer than 77,600 shots of the sun and 16,800 of the
     earth.â€ (WSJ,9/28/73)

     would total $32 733 000. (NASA Release 73-198; JSC Release 73-129)
September 29: A Washington Post editorial praised the Skylab program:
     â€œThe prospect of permanently orbiting manned space laboratories used
    to be the stuff of dreams. The Skylab program underscores how rapidly
    such science fiction is becoming scientific fact. It shows how quickly
     man is becoming more at home in space and more accustomed to the
     reality of extended space flight-to the extent that the most impressive
     human and technological feats have come to be regarded by laymen as
     almost routine. Since the first â€˜giant leap for mankind,â€™ NASAâ€™s   achieve-
     ments have produced a quantum jump in manâ€™s comprehension of the
     universe. The task now is to build on that new foundation, and to secure
     an equal measure of political progress to insure that this new capability
     will be used for universal benefit.â€ ( W Post, 9/29/73, A14)
∞Tass special correspondent Aleksander Romanov quoted a spokesman for
     the U.S.S.R. flight control team of the Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 manned
     mission as saying that in the future space flights â€œwill become longer
     and will be made farther and farther from the Earth. Therefore, it is
     important to improve constantly methods of autonomous navigation. In
     the opinion of the crew members the instruments designed for these
     purposes have given a good account of themselves. The night vision
     apparatus has their preliminary approval.â€ (FBIS-SOV,      10/1/73, U2-3)
September 30: Sqyuz 12 cosmonauts L/C Vasily G. Lazarev and Oleg G.
     Makarov arrived in Moscow from Karaganda, following their successful
     Sept. 27-29 orbital mission. The crew was met at the airport by mem-
     bers of a state commission, specialists from flight control, scientists,
     engineers, relatives, and friends. Before leaving Karaganda, the cosmo-
     nauts had held a press conference, in which they said they had imple-
     mented their flight program â€œin full.â€
        Gen. Georgy T. Beregovoy-cosmonaut and chief of the Soviet cosmo-
     naut training center-speaking in Zvezdny Gorodok, said Lazarev and
     Makarov had displayed â€œhigh professional skills,â€ carrying out a com-
     prehensive checkup of improved onboard systems, further development
     work on manual and automatic control of the ship in different flight
     modes, and spectrography of areas of the earthâ€˜s surface. (Moscow

  ∞Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford-speaking         in Beverly Hills, Calif .-con-
      gratulated Soviet Cosmonauts Vasily 6. Lazarev and Oleg G. Makarov
     on the successful completion of their Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 mission.
     Stafford, U S . crew commander for the US.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test
     Projectâ€™s planned 1975 space flight, spoke highly of the Soyuz flight and
     said he was happy that it had ended with success. He noted that many of
      the new systems that would be used on the 1975 joint flight were tested
     by Soyuz 12. (Tass, FBIS-SOV,10/1/73, B8)
  ∞A New York Times editorial commented on the successful Sept. 27-29
     Soyuz 12 manned mission: â€œThe purpose . . . was not primarily to set
      new records. Its main goal was to test the latest improved version of the
      Soyuz spacecraft. . . Americans as well as Soviet citizens have reason
      to rejoice. . . . In 1975 present plans call for the historic docking of a
      Soviet Soyuz craft with a United States Apollo vehicle. Thus Soviet and

    American astronauts must want each otherâ€™s space ships to be as safe
    as possible. And beyond the docking experiment in 1975 lies the prospect
    of a future fully integrated Soviet-American joint space program.â€

During September: Soviet plans for a reusable space shuttle had been re-
    vealed by Cosmonaut Gherman s. Titov and Soviet Academician Andrey
    Shikarin, according to a Vienna correspondent quoted by Znteravia.
    The Soviet shuttle would consist of two vehicles coupled pick-a-back,
    each in delta configuration and designed for hypersonic operating
    speeds. One would be the booster, the other the orbiter. The spacecraft
    was designed for horizontal takeoff from a runway. The manned booster
    would carry the orbiter until it attained a 22-km-per-sec (4900 mph)
    speed corresponding to a 2- to 3-g acceleration. The stages would sepa-
    rate at about a 30-km (19-mi) altitude and the booster would descend
    in a controlled glide to land on the runway. The orbiter would accelerate
    to a more than 100-km (60-mi) altitude, complete its mission, and glide
    back to the earth. Construction was expected to begin during the 1970s.

∞The Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space of
    the House Committee on Science and Astronautics published Research
    and Development Collaboration with the U.S.S.R. and Japan. The report
    summarized discussions with Soviet and Japanese officials during the
    Subcommitteeâ€™s July visit to the U.S.S.R.-U.S. Aeronautical Technology
    Symposium and Display in Moscow and a subsequent visit to Tokyo.
    The Subcommittee had found that â€œalthough military and space parity
    had been achieved with the United States, the U.S.S.R. is far behind in
    virtually all consumer products. There are also glaring weaknesses in
    certain areas of high technology.â€ Soviet leaders had accepted the fact
    that, â€œif their plans for the massive expansion and improvement of their
    commercial air transportation system are to succeed within the proposed
    time frame, assistance will be required from abroad where superior
    technology exists. We believe the U S . aerospace industry is the best,
    though not the only, source for such high technology products, and
    evidently the responsible Soviet officials think so, too.â€ As one of the
    worldâ€™s most highly developed technological countries, Japan had â€œmuch
    to offer to any cooperative venture in science or space.â€ The Subcom-
    mittee urged the National Science Foundation to explore possible col-
    laboration with the Japanese government in its Sunshine Project, a
    proposed large-scale effort to develop new energy sources. (Com Print)
  ∞US. scheduled airline passenger traffic had increased 7.376, to 76400
    million revenue-passenger-miles, during the first half of 1973, Znteravia
    reported. Traffic for local service carriers alone rose 13.2%, to 4600
    million revenue-passenger-miles, and for scheduled domestic service,
    7.7%, to 60 400 million. Available seat-miles increased 7.5%, to 120 200

  ∞The â€œmuch vaunted European challengeâ€ to U S . aerospace industry would
    bL
       remain a myth,â€ an Znteravia editorial said. Recent agreements for
    U S . companies to provide European manufacturers access to their high
    technology might seem against U S . interests, but â€œsuch agreements are
    in fact usually followed by orders for US.-designed aircraft.â€ It was
    LC
       not simply that the currency crisis has made the US product much
    cheaper than the competitive European design, but also that the Ameri-
    cans are in a position to contract out production work on a proven sales
    success.â€ European commercial aircraft industry products would â€œnever
    achieve the success expected of them.â€ Europeâ€™s total share of the West-
    ern market for commercial aircraft-just over 9%-was â€œsteadily drop-
    ping as the early model BAC 111s and Caravelles are withdrawn from
    service and there are no advanced versions to replace them.â€ However
    tempting technologically the advanced commercial aircraft offered by
    European industry might be, â€œthey are not what many airlines want
    in the present economic climate.â€ There â€œseems little or no inclination in
    Europe to accept inter-dependence in high technology areas. There is ap-
    parently more of a readiness to cooperate across the Atlantic than across
    the European frontiers. If the European aerospace industry wishes to
    remain a viable, independent force on the world scene, then the time
    has surely come when something more than lip service must be paid to
    the European ideal.â€ (Interuwia, 9/73, 939)
  ∞The Hawker Siddeley 146, the first major new British aircraft launched in
    a decade, was to be developed under a program funded jointly by
    Hawker Siddeley and the United Kingdom government, Armed Forces

    sengers for 1900 km (1200 mi). ( A F J ,9/73, 24)
∞U.S.S.R.â€™s Aeroflot had transported 82.5 million passengers and 21 000
    million kg (46300 million lbs) of freight and mail, and its crop-
    spraying aircraft had treated 833 389 sq km (321 773 sq mi) of land
    in 1972, Znteravia reported. Forecasts for 1973 included the transporta-
    tion of 87 million passengers and 2100 million kg (46300 million lbs)
    of mail and freight and the treatment of 869 800 sq km (335 830 sq mi)
     of land. The Aeroflot network continued to be extended and the num-
    ber of scheduled services had risen from 2974 in 1972 to 3068 in 1973.

  ∞The National Science Foundation released Federal Scientific, Technical,
     and Health Personnel, 1971 (NSF 73-309). In 1971, as in most years
     since 1966, Federal scientific, technical, and health professional person-
     nel increased little compared with the early 1960s. The Dept. of Defense
     remained, as in prior years, the largest employer of scientific and tech-
     nical personnel. About 29% of Federal scientists and engineers per-
    formed research and development. The greatest concentration of R&D
     personnel was at NASA. More than one half of NASAâ€™s     scientists and en-
     gineers performed R&D activities. Salaries of Federal scientists and en-
     gineers increased between 1966 and 1971, largely to meet statutory
     requirements that they be comparable with non-Federal salaries. Women,

     (aboard Freedom 7, May 5, 1961).
               future role was described by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA
        NASAâ€™s
    Administrator: â€œUnless and until Congress sees fit to change our role,
    I think NASA should continue to have this one primary mission: to do
    the necessary research and development in space and aeronautics to
    identify promising opportunities and meet national needs. In perform-
    ing this primary mission, we will continue to work closely with user
    agencies in government and with the aerospace industry.â€ NASA also was
    transferring its technology and experience to nonaerospace sectors of
    the economy and helping other Government agencies solve societal prob-
    lems. â€œIt so happens that we have the reservoir of technology, and also
    some available manpower, at a time when the Environmental Protection
    Agency and other government departments need our help.â€ NASA had
    â€œunique capabilities to help bring into being a pollution-free, resource-
    saving hydrogen economy, and to facilitate extensive use of the ultimate
    energy source, solar power.â€ NASAâ€™s   traditional function as the Nationâ€™s
    civilian space and aeronautics R&D manager â€œassures us a challenging
     and rewarding future during NASAâ€™snext 15 years.â€ (Program; Pre-

        During its first 15 yrs NASA had completed 277 major US. and in-
    ternational launches, with 210 successful and one still under evaluation.
    With the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs successfully completed
     and Skylab progressing, NASA had established 15 768 man-hours in
    space. Astronauts had spent about 40 hrs in inflight extravehicular ac-
     tivity and more than 90 hrs on the moon. NASA manned spacecraft had
     spent nearly 400 hrs on the moon and had returned more than 385 kg
      (850 Ibs) of lunar material. Of 38 Americans who had flown in space, 3
    had made four space flights, 4 had made three, 10 had made two, and
     22 had made one flight each. A dozen astronauts had walked on the
     moon, and 24 had flown around it. Man had learned he could live and
     work in space.
        In unmanned space exploration NASA had launched thousands of
    sounding rockets carrying U.S. and foreign experiments. Mariner 9
     probe (launched May 30, 1971, and still orbiting Mars) had produced
     7300 pictures of the planet, showing it to be dynamic and geologically
     active. Satellites had studied stars beyond the solar system through
     x-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Oar, 1 (launched Dec. 7, 1968)

    and Oao 3 (launched Aug. 21, 1972) had returned a wealth of informa-
    tion on the Milky Way and more distant galaxies. Pioneer 10 (launched
    March 2, 1972, toward Jupiter) had revolutionized manâ€™s study of the
    sun. The entire electromagnetic spectrum had been opened to manâ€™s
    examination by study of stars in ultraviolet and x-ray. Observations
    from NASA-launched weather satellites had enabled forecasters to observe
    weather systems from space as they developed and to forecast their
    effects as they moved into inhabited parts of the world. Man had learned
    what instruments in space could provide in information about the
    earthâ€™s resources and their efficient use to facilitate decision making,
    improve the lot of developing countries, and preserve and improve
    conditions in countries like the U S .
       NASA had provided technological advancements to preserve the US.
    position as world leader in civil and military aeronautics. The joint NASA,
    Air Force, and Navy X-15 rocket-powered aircraft program had, during
    10 yrs of flight, studied effects of hypersonic flight on aircraft skin
    friction and thermal expansion, pioneered the use of ablative coatings,
    aided efficient structural design, and served as a workhorse test-bed for
    nearly 40 experiments. NASA contributions also included the single-pivot
    variable-sweep wing, which allowed efficient flight at both high and
    low speeds; supercritical wing and fuselage shapes that permitted an
    aircraft to cruise at 15% higher speed without increased fuel consump-
    tion; and the worldâ€˜s first digital fly-by-wire control aircraft with
    a computer-controlled electronic system. The clean combustion program
    was providing new concepts to reduce pollution from engine exhaust. The
    aircraft noise-abatement program focused on development of an avionics
    system, refinement of operational procedures, and the demonstration of
    two-segment flight paths for quieter landing approaches. The refan
    program was demonstrating JT8D engine and nacelle modifications to
    reduce noise of existing jet aircraft.
       In applications the knowledge gained in 15 yrs was being applied in
    science, medicine, navigation, communications, agriculture, crime pre-
    vention, and commerce. NASA-developed technologies were producing
    safer buildings, bridges, and aircraft and improved tires, roads, and
    railbeds. In international cooperation, NASA had conducted 18 coopera-
    tive satellite and space probe projects and flown 25 international experi-
    ments on its spacecraft. The global system of Intelsat communication
    satellites comprised 12 satellites launched by NASA.
       Ahead were completion of Skylab 4, the third and final manned
    Skylab mission ; the July 1975 joint US-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission
    to dock a U S . and a Soviet spacecraft in space; and the introduction
    of the revolutionary space shuttle with its European-built Spacelab in the
    1980s. In unmanned exploration Mariner 10, scheduled for launch to-
    ward Mercury and Venus in early November, was expected to provide
    the first photos of Mercury. Pioneer 10 was headed for a year-end
    rendezvous with Jupiter, and Pioneer 11 (launched April 5, 1973) was
    scheduled for a second reconnaissance of Jupiter in December 1974.
    Work was proceeding on two Mariner spacecraft for 1977 launch toward
    Jupiter and Saturn.
       Major thrusts expected for the 1980s were outlined in a statement
    released to the press by Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Ad-
    ministrator. NASA would be vigorously developing and demonstrating
    systems and technologies that would make space activities useful to

    sources, developing electric power from the sun, and using space as a
    laboratory for new technology and processes. Continued scientific ex-
    ploration of the earth, space, and the solar system seemed inevitable.
    And the 1980s might well be a period of preparation for continued
    manned exploration and exploitation of the solar system, the two-way
    direct transfer of information between satellites, a long-duration manned
    space laboratory, automated outer planet orbiters and atmosphere
    probes, and probably, before the end of the century, a program to es-
    tablish a manned lunar base for exploration and research. (NASA Re-

  ∞Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah), Chairman of the Senate Committee on
    Aeronautical and Space Sciences, said on the Senate floor that NASA
    had been â€œsecond to none in its record of accomplishments during its
    first decade and a half.â€ The past 15 yrs had seen the U S . go â€œfrom
    the depths of postsputnik depression to undreamed of heights in both
    the exploration and exploitation of the benefits of space.â€ The Skylab 3
    crew (launched July 28 to man the Orbital Workshop launched May 14)
    had â€œjust completed 59 highly successful days in space, in a mission
    already being hailed as perhaps the most productive in our history.

October 1-18: A 47-member NASA delegation led by Apollo-Soyuz Test
    Project Director Glynn S. Lunney met with Soviet counterparts in
    Moscow for two weeks of discussions of technical problems of the joint
    US.-U.S.S.R. mission scheduled for July 1975. Discussions culminated
    in an Oct. 18 midterm review of the project by Dr. George M. Low, NASA
    Deputy Administrator, and Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of
    the Intercosmos Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Dr. Low had
    arrived in Moscow Oct. 14; his stay included visits to the Institute of
    Geochemistry, the Institute of Space Research, the Cosmonaut Training
    Center, and the Space Flight Control Center.
        In an Oct. 18 communique Dr. Low and Academician Petrov con-
    firmed their satisfaction with the ASTP project status. All major mile-
    stones were being met on schedule and, Dr. Low said, progress made
    indicated that the scheduled launch date could be met. Soyuz orbital
    and Apollo docking module drawings had been exchanged and agree-
    ment had been reached that US. specialists would participate in pre-
    flight final checkout of flight equipment at the Soviet launch site.
    Specialists would be exchanged to fit-check compatible equipment at
    U S . and U.S.S.R. launch sites. Academician Petrov told the press that
    US. specialists would be permitted at the Soviet launch site â€œup to the
    very minute of launching.â€
        During the visit US. officials learned the deaths of three cosmonauts
    on Soyuz 11 June 30, 1971, were caused by accidental triggering open
     of an exhaust valve rather than by a hatch leak. The valve tripped open
     just after the reentry capsule separated from the larger orbiting module
     in a maneuver including firing of 12 explosive bolts. At least two crew
     members tried to close the valve but were unable to move fast enough.
    Unconsciousness from rapid decompression came in less than 10 sec;
     ground tests showed it would take 27 sec to close the valve by hand.
    US. officials said they were satisfied that subsequent modifications to
     the valve and crank mechanisms-tested         on two unmanned flights,
     Cosmos 496 and 573, and on the manned Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 mission
     -were sufficient to prevent reoccurrence of the accident. (NASA Releases

    Dr. Owen K. Garriott and Jack R. Lousma-said that the crewâ€™s health
    had been â€œgood the whole time.â€ Sufficient exercise, meals on time, and
    plenty of sleep had accounted for their happiness and well-being. Having
    a scientist-astronaut aboard had created a â€œgreater variety of interchange
    around the dinner table,â€ making â€œa better mission for everybody.â€
    The mission would have been â€œ50% less productive if Owen had not
    been there. He added a great amount to it . . . because his point of view
    is, just different.â€ Garriott said that a longer mission would necessitate
    6C
      a somewhat less strenuous program,â€ but he could have spent eight
    hours a day at the wardroom window with a camera in each hand and
    a good supply of film â€œand never have any tendency to become bored.â€
    Lousma said he still felt â€œa little less energeticâ€ than before the mission,
    but within two weeks â€œIâ€™ll be back to the same condition.â€
        Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, JSC Deputy Director of Life Sciences for
    Medical Operations, said that the crew was â€œin very good shapeâ€ but
    still had dizziness with specific head movements. Strength of the flexor
    and extensor muscles had decreased 20%. The astronautsâ€™ weights were
    steadily climbing toward their preflight weights. Early blood tests had
    shown the red cell mass was down an average of 12% for all three
    crew members. The blood plasma was also down 15% to 20%.
        In an overview of Skylab 4, the third and final manned Skylab mis-
    sion, Skylab Program Office Manager Kenneth S. Kleinknecht said that
    the spacecraft (Command and Service Module 118) and crew members
    Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue were
    being readied for Nov. 11 launch. Final decision on the launch date
    would be made after further evaluation of the mission. In preparation,
     140 kg (300 lbs) of operational equipment had been deleted from
    stowage. It had been replaced with another 150 kg (300 lbs) of opera-
    tional equipment, 60 kg (130 Ibs) for Skylab experiments, and 70 kg
     (150 Ibs) of special equipment for Comet Kohoutek observations. After
    Oct. 8-10 flight readiness tests, only servicing, stowage, pyrotechnic
     installations, countdown demonstrations, and launch would remain.
    CSM-119, the rescue vehicle, was being prepared and would be avail-
     able for a Jan. 6 launch if needed.
        Alfred A. Bishop, Manager of the JSC Missions Office, said that, after
    the first two weeks of acclimation, the Skylab 4 crew would pe rfom 28
     man-hours of experiments each day, an increase from the 19 to 221/2
    man-hours on Skylab 3. The increase would provide an additional 200
    experiment man-hours. The crew would observe Comet Kohoutek, per-
     form 12 experiments using the Apollo Telescope Mount, observe Mercury
     crossing the sun Nov. 10, observe a solar eclipse, and perform 10 to 14
     new earth resources experiment package passes. (Transcripts)

    Tass reported. Milchail Kolesov of the Institute of Radio Engineering
     and Electronics of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences had said the
     maximum concentration of matter was at 10 km ( 6 mi) from the lunar
     surface. Origin of the plasma was unknown but the plasma was believed
     to be greatly affected by solar wind. (FBIS-SOV,10/3/73, U1)

       Kenneth W. Gatland of the British Interplanetary Society later said
    in a Christian Science Monitor article that the satellites possibly were
    being used as a maritime communications system "to keep shore bases
    and command centers in contact with far-ranging elements of the Soviet
    fleet." Since 1971 two eight-satellite systems had been orbited each year
    four to five months apart. Gaps of seven to nine months occurred be-
    tween launches during the winter, when the Soviet northern fleet was
    hampered by sea conditions. The last Soviet eight-satellite launch was
    June 8, into similar orbits. (GSFC SSR, 10/31/73; CSM, 11/13/73; SBD,

    a 268-km (166.5-mi) apogee, 205-km (127.4-mi) perigee, 89.2-min
    period, and 65.4" inclination. The satellite reentered Oct. 9. Cosmos 596
    was the first of seven Soviet satellites launched and returned in quick
    succession, leading to Western speculation they were reconnaissance craft
    monitoring the Arab-Israeli war [see Oct. 151. (GSFC SSR, 10/31/73;

October 4 : President Nixon issued a statement about NASAâ€™s       15th anniver-
    sary [see Oct. 1J : â€œAt mid-twentieth century, the United States found
    itself drawn by international necessity, and driven by national pride
    and pioneering instinct to view the heavens no longer as the stuff of
    romance, but as a practical environment for the extension of manâ€™s
    dominion over the earth. Since then, four administrations have com-
    mitted our industrial resources, our technological and scientific capacj-
    ties and the national will to the proposition that America can and must
    play a role in outer space equal to its responsibilities as a great nation.â€
                                                  accomplishments. â€œThe men
    People of all nations stood in awe of NASAâ€™s
    of NASA have undertaken one of the greatest human adventures with
    such consummate skill, cool exactness in the face of untold dangers, and
    professional disdain for the sensational that we have come already to
    take for granted the legitimacy of manâ€™s place in an environment en-
    tirely alien to him. But neither the courage, skill and devotion of the
    men of NASA, nor the benefits of their efforts, should be taken for
     granted. In every phase of our national life, new products, new tech-
    niques and new understanding have resulted from our efforts in space.
    And in relations between nations, the prospects for a lasting peace have
    been enhanced by the now absolute awareness that the primary interests
    of mankind are identical and shared in common. On the fifteenth an-
     niversary of NASA, we look ahead to the same ordered progress into
     our space future which has characterized our first tentative steps into

∞Aerospace Industries Assn. of America, Inc., issued its semiannual analysis
    of aerospace employment. Continued restraints in Government spending
    and an increase in foreign competition for existing markets were cited
    as causes of an expected continued decline in aerospace industry em-
    ployment through June 1974. Employment had dropped by 33% since
    1968. Nearly 950000 persons had been employed in June 1973, but
    by June 1974 payrolls were expected to have been cut by about 32 000.
    The most significant decline would be among scientists and engineers-
    a reduction of 6000, 3.6% below December 1972. Employment of pro-
    duction workers was expected to decline by 13 000 jobs, leaving 460 000
    employed by the end o f FY 1974. Missiles and space employment was
    expected to decline by 28 000 workers between December 1972 and June
    1974. Aircraft group employment faced a similar period of decline, from
    556 000 to 533 000. Employment in the helicopter and general-aviation
    field was expected to increase 500 from June 1973, resulting in a work
    force of 22 500 by June 1974. Employment in the general-aviation air-
    craft field alone was expected to rise more than 20% during FY 1974.

    Stever had met with presidents or principal officers of most of the major
    scientific and engineering organizations and had indicated â€œthat he
    would welcome policy advice and recommendations concerning per-
    sonnel. As specific problems arise, the appropriate organizations will
    be tapped. Thus it seems that a major difference between the new and
    the old apparatus will be the replacement of a small, formal, elite group
    by more broadly based ad hoc groups. The concept is worth a try.
    Whether it will be viable will depend on how effectively it is implemented
    by both sides.â€ (Abelson, Science, 10/5/73, 13)

October 7-13: The International Astronautical Federation (IAF) held its
    24th Congress in Baku, U.S.S.R. In a message of greeting, the Soviet
    Council of Ministers said : â€œNowadays, when important positive changes
    take place in international situations, ever more favourable opportuni-
    ties for development of scientific communication, exchange of experi-
    ence and uses of scientific achievements for practical needs of mankind
    open to scientists.â€ Academician Sergey Vernov of the Soviet Academy
    of Sciences said Soviet artificial satellites, placed simultaneously in
    different orbits, had facilitated studies of many regions of earthâ€˜s radia-
    tion belts, including those where no space station had been before. He
    hypothesized the existence of an â€œunstable radiation zoneâ€ beyond the
    outer radiation belt where Soviet Electron satellites had recorded a flux
    of electrons with energies over 150 000 ev. He believed the zone to be a
    necessary link in the formation of the earthâ€™s radiation belts.

    during 70 yrs of flight, Marquis Childs said in his Washington Post
     column. The doubters had â€œalways been proven wrong.â€ In astronautics,
     Skylab was continuing successfully and work was progressing on the
     space shuttle. â€œAs for the scientific benefits, perhaps only a few special-
     ists can give a proper evaluation. But the cynics who spoke derisively
     of spending billions to put some clown in the sky are wrong on several
    scores.â€™â€™ The aircraft prcduction record was equally impressive. In 1972
     the US. had made 79% of the aircraft being operated by the worldâ€™s
     airlines, exclusive of the U.S.S.R. and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
     The achievements in US. production, discovery, and invention were â€œin
     painful contrast to the failures in self-government illustrated by the
     grim mess in Washington, It may not be too much to say that if we
     find a way out of the morass, the swamp of intrigue, deceit and doubt,
     it will be thanks to American productivity.â€ The Smithsonian Institu-

October 9-12: A radical new growth hormone theory evolved from Ames
     Research Center studies was introduced by ARC scientist Dr. Richard E.
     Grindeland during a Baltimore, Md., symposium on growth hormones.
     Dr. Grindelandâ€™s theory that the growth hormone in blood was chem-
     ically different from that in the pituitary gland had originated from ARC
     research to determine effects of physiological stresses like acceleration,
     simulated weightlessness, chemical agents, thermal extremes, and nutri-
     tional status on the human body. The theory, which the symposium sug-
      gested would have profound effect on the understanding of growth
     hormone physiology, showed that radio immunological methods de-
     tected only a minute fraction of the concentration of growth hormone in
     the blood. (ARC Astrogram, 10/25/73, 1)

October 12: NASA research pilot Einar K. Enevoldson conducted the first
    flight of a new remotely piloted research vehicle ( RPRV) . A three-eighths
    scale model of an Air Force high-performance F-15 fighter-air-
    launched from a B-52 aircraft from Flight Research Center at 14 000 m
     (45 000 ft) -was controlled by Enevoldson from a ground cockpit with
    flight instruments and a TV screen. His commands were fed through a
    computer programmed with F-15 flight characteristics to the RPRV;
    flight information from the RPRV and video signals from its TV camera
    were transmitted to the ground control station. After a nine-minute
    flight, the RPRV descended 5000 m (15 000 ft) and a series of para-
    chutes were deployed to slow the descent rate. An Air Force helicopter
    recovered the RPRV in mid-air and lowered it to the ground for reuse.
    Eventually the 7-m (23-ft) model would be flown through stall and
    spin maneuvers using the new mc-developed flight research technique
    to reduce the cost of flight-testing experimental aircraft and spacecraft.

 ∞Soviet news agency Tass reported that Soviet scientists, first in Gorky
    and later in other parts of the U.S.S.R., recently had picked up signals
    from outer space that might have been â€œsent by a technically developed
    extraterrestrial civilization.â€ Observation of such signals was supervised
    in the U.S.S.R. by Soviet astrophysicist Vsevolod Troitsky and more

    the U.S.S.R., Tass said. (Reuters, B Sun, 10/17/73)
∞ The National Science Foundation published Continued Growth Planned for
    Federal Civilian R&D Programs (NSF 73-314). Federal support for ci-
    vilian research and development had risen 9.1% per year for the past
    five years. The chief areas of growth were health, transportation and
    communication, environment, and crime prevention and control. In
    1969 civilian-oriented programs had constituted nearly 25%, or $3.6
    billion, of a $15.6 billion total; they were expected to form 33.3% of
    the 1974 $17.4 billion total. National security took up more than 50%
    of the R&D total each year. In 1974, its growth in R&D obligations was
    expected to be $478 million, making the national security share of the
    Federal R&D total 54.2%, higher than any other year since 1969. Space
    remained the second function in funding size 1969-1974, but reflected
    the greatest loss in priority. Space R&D obligations showed a steady an-
    nual decrease, and the share in the R&D total had declined correspond-
    ingly, from 23.9% in 1969 to 14.1% in 1974. From 1973 to 1974, total
    R&D obligations for space were expected to drop by $234 million, the
    largest decrease for any function. (Text)
October 17: NASA and National Oceanic a nd Atmospheric Administration
    researchers had devised a system to anticipate and counter the effects of
    lightning at Kennedy Space Center, NOAA announced. A network of in-
    struments measured the areaâ€™s electric field and a weather radar moni-
    tored rain-cloud precipitation, and a computer displayed electric-field
    contour maps of the launch area. ICSC personnel would be able to forecast
    lightning while a launch vehicle was on the pad and during the low-
    altitude portion of its ascent, so that persons and equipment could be

 ∞Maryland State Police officials ordered troopers to search the sky for any
    abnormal light phenomena after receiving hundreds of reports of lights
    in the sky. One report came from a State Police helicopter pilot, who
    said he had seen a â€œvery largeâ€ airborne vehicle with bright lights.
    Flight controllers at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., later said the object
    might have been a â€œspecial experimental aircraft testing an innovative
    lighting system â‚¬or NASA.â€ (B Sun, 10/18/73, A3)

October 18: NASA announced plans to study Comet Kohoutek with an exten-
    sive array of electronic eyes. The comet, now some 400 million km (250
    million mi) from the sun, was expected to be visible in the Northern
    Hemisphere around Christmas time. It was expected to be as bright as
    a full moon and to be larger than Halley's Comet, which had appeared
    last in 1910. NASA scientists would use optical telescopes, radiotelescopes,
     and radar to study Kohoutek in visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light
    from the ground and a high-altitude C-141 aircraft, as well as satellites,
     sounding rockets, and Skylab 4 telescopes and cameras-to learn more
     about whether planets were remnants of the formation of the solar sys-
     tem or interstellar matter captured by the sun. Scientists would try to
     determine possible existence of a solid comet nucleus. Kohoutek was be-
     lieved to have a 20- to 30-km (12- to 19-mi) nucleus with a probable
     head diameter of 96 000 km (60 000 mi). (NASA Release 73-207)

∞Lewis Research Center scientist Stanley G. Young had applied cavitation-
    erosion of metal by tiny cavities formed by uneven pressure gradients
    in liquids-to restoring serial numbers obliterated by filing or grind-
     ing, NASA reported. In the process, of use to police in identifying stolen
    property, an ultrasonic vibrator generated very-high-frequency vibra-
     tions in water, creating millions of microscopic bubbles. The bubbles
     struck the metal surface on which serial numbers had been erased,
     weakening particles that filled the serial number grooves. Conventional
    methods of restoring serial numbers used chemicals or mechanical
     processes that might obliterate remaining traces of the numbers. {NASA

October 23: Two fuel tanks on the Saturn IB launch vehicle scheduled to
    launch the Skylab 4 astronauts toward a Nov. 10 rendezvous with the
    Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) buckled slightly after fueling at
    Kennedy Space Center. The dome-shaped top sections of the tanks sank
    after ground crews pumped 163 cu m (43 000 gal) of kerosene fuel
    into the Saturn IBâ€™s four giant tanks and then drained some off to pre-
    vent expansion or overpressurization. A plastic cover protecting the
    tanks from a rainstorm prevented air from rushing into the aluminum
    tanks as the fuel was drained. The resulting vacuum buckled the tanks
    inward. Metallurgy experts were flown to ICSC from Marshall Space
    Flight Center to assess the problem. ( W Ster-News, 10/24/73, A23;

∞A five-week Ames Research        Center experiment to determine womenâ€™s
    qualifications for space flight had shown women to be as physically fit
    for travel in weightlessness as men, NASA announced. The experiment-
    in which 8 of 12 Air Force flight nurses had two weeks of total bed rest
    in weightlessness simulation, while 4 acted as ambulatory controls-was
    one of a series to investigate responses to space flight conditions, looking
    forward to use of the space shuttle by other than pilot-trained astro-
    nauts. NASA emphasized that the test was to determine womenâ€™s qualifi-
     cations for space flight and did not represent a commitment to add
     women to the astronaut corps. Dr. Harold Sandler, head of the experi-
     ment team, said the bedridden nurses were weaker after the experiment
     and showed a 50% reduction in their tolerance to various stresses. â€œBut
     the same is true of men astronauts.â€ (NASA Release 73-218; AP, P Znq,

    Data Acquisition, said in hearings on NASAâ€™s tracking program before
    the House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Aeronautics and Space Technology that the percentage of spacecraft
    requiring real-time control would increase from 70% to 90% in 1975.
    With increased number of satellites and volume of data, as well, new
    tracking capability would be required. NASA proposed a new Tracking
    and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) for the late 1970s-possibly
    leased from the private sector-to support low-earth-orbit spacecraft.
    Two synchronous satellites would relay telemetry, voice, and video data
    from other spacecraft to a single U.S. earth station, or from the station
    to the spacecraft. TDRSS would support all spacecraft below 5000 km

October 25-31: NASA launched Explorer 50 (IMP-J) Interplanetary Moni-
    toring Platform by a long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch
    vehicle from Eastern Test Range at 10:26 pm EDT to study the cislunar
    environment during a period of decreasing solar activity. The spacecraft
    entered orbit halfway to the moon, with a 228 808-km (142 174.7-mi)
    apogee, 197.5-km (122.7-mi) perigee, 117.1-hr period, and 28.7â€™ in-

       The apogee kick motor was fired at 1:00 am EST Oct. 29, placing
    Explorer 50 in its mission orbit with 288857-km (179487.4-mi)
    apogee, 141 184-km (87 727.7-mi) perigee, 12-day period, and 28.7â€
    inclination. The spacecraft was oriented to the ecliptic and spun up to
    23 rpm.
       Explorer 50 would make detailed and near-continuous studies of the
    interplanetary environment for orbital periods comparable to several
    rotations of active solar regions and study particle and field interactions
    in the distant magnetotail, including cross-sectional mapping of the tail
    and neutral sheet.
       Over a two-day period beginning Oct. 30, 1 of the 12 experiments
                                                     1
    were turned on. On Nov. 12 they would be turned off while four 60-m
     (200-ft) antennas would be deployed. The experiments would be turned
    back on Nov. 13 and 14 along with the 12th experiment. The experi-
    ments were supplied by Goddard Space Flight Center, National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, and uni-
    versities.
       Explorer 50 was the 10th and final spacecraft in the IMP series, which
    had monitored solar radiation during an entire solar cycle. The series
    had provided the first accurate measurements of the interplanetary
    magnetic field, the magnetosphere boundary, and the collisionless mag-
    netohydrodynamic shock wave associated with the interaction of solar
    wind with the geomagnetic field. The first spacecraft in the IMP series,
    Explorer 18, was launched Nov. 26, 1963; the most recent, Explorer 47,
    was launched Sept. 22, 1972.
       The IMP program was directed by NASAâ€™s Office of Space Science and
    managed by GSFC. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by GSFC
     under the direction of the Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition.

      this field.â€ He said NASA would consider Mrs. Harrisâ€™ recommendations
      and suggestions and â€œwill adopt those we feel will be helpful.â€ He ap-
      preciated her effort and respected her â€œfor having expressed her opin-

      administrative and management skill required of her position, because
      she has been unwilling to share the broader problems of management
      with her peers, and because she became a seriously disruptive force
      within her own office, I concluded that she should not continue to serve.
      . . . In so concluding, I also concluded that Dr. [Dudley G.] McConnell
      [Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity] can successfully do
      the job he has been assigned provided he has the good will and working
      support of all NASA employees.â€

∞A Science article commented on President Nixonâ€™s Oct. 3 speech announc-

     ing National Medal of Science winners [see Oct. 31 : â€œHow serious Nixon
     is about achieving the objectives cited in his remarks will be indicated
     by future budgetary activities. In recent months, however, there has
     been plenty of evidence that the Administration wants to make changes
     not only in the substance of science policy, but also in the way that
     policy is made. The most obvious indicator was the shift of the science
     advisory apparatus from the White House to NSF. Underlying the change
     seems to have been not just a dissatisfaction with the science advisory
     machinery, but also with the basic relationship between the scientific
     community and its federal patrons which has prevailed since World War
     11.â€ It would be wise for the scientific community to examine carefully
     the new terms which President Nixon seems to be offering. â€œHowever,

     directed to scientists and engineers in general.â€ (Walsh, Science, 10/

        Dr. Fletcher presented 1973 Payload Model: Space Opportunities
    1973-1991, a study of the number and kinds of payloads that could be
    launched through 1991 with the space shuttle and Spacelab using
    budgets at the FY 1973 level. The study was not a program plan but an
    estimate of kinds of payloads that could be flown. Dr. Fletcher felt â€œthe
    full range of the space capability offeredâ€ by the a u t t l e was even
    greater than the model indicated.
        Anticipated possible annual space payloads for all NASA programs and
    the user community, excluding DOD, began with 12 in 1973 and moved
    through 18 in 1974, 38 in 1980 (when the shuttle was to begin its
    operational phase), 61 in 1985, to 70 in 1990 and 59 in 1991. The 70
    payload opportunities in 1990 included 21 automated and 27 sortie
     (Spacelab) payloads for NASA and 17 automated and 5 sortie for non-
    NASA, non-DOD users. Anticipated requirements through 1991 totaled
    810 payloads, 572 for NASA and 238 for nOn-NASA, non-DOD users. NASA
    and other nOn-DOD agencies were expected to use 69% of the shuttle
    traffic and DOD 31%.
        The model anticipated NASA automated payloads through 1991 might
    include 77 for astronomy, 43 for physics, 49 for planetary exploration,
    8 lunar, 26 life science, 53 earth observations, 22 earth and ocean
     physics, 2 communications and navigation, and 6 space technology.
    Anticipated user totals were 120 automated communications and navi-
     gation payloads, 59 earth observations, and 9 earth and ocean physics.
        Possible NASA sortie payloads were forecast at 58 in astronomy, 52 in
    physics, 24 in earth observations, 43 in space processing, 24 in earth
     and ocean physics, 1 for communications and navigation, 28 in life
                            1

  ∞A need â€œto shift gears and return to the main line of development in space
    flightâ€ was underlined by Michael A. G. Michaud in a Spaceflight
    article: The purposes of space flight â€œgo far beyond our lifetime. U1-
    timately, our journey away from Earth will determine the future of
    the human race ; this millennial, evolutionary effort must not founder
    now for lack of a satisfying rationale.â€ The basic purpose of space
    flight was â€œto expand the realm of Man.â€ Reasons were to challenge
    human abilities, learn more about the universe we live in, search for
    extraterrestrial intelligence and prepare for contact with it, develop and
    test technologies for earth use, stimulate and employ advanced sectors
    of the economy, improve orbital applications of space technology with
    immediate benefits, develop and test military technology, and encourage
    international cooperation. Michaud proposed a medium-term program
     to the year 2000 to assemble a manned space station in earth orbit,
     build a base on the moon, land human beings on Mars by 2000, prepare
     for interstellar flight, search for planets in other systems, a;â€d begin the
     search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A long-term program beyond
     2000 would plan to send unmanned probes to the most promising nearby
     stars, create a permanent colony on Mars, experiment in planetary engi-
     neering-possibly on Venus, â€œwhere orbiting space vehicles could intro-
     duce materials into the atmosphere that might change its compositionâ€

November 1: A variable-sweep-wing testbed F-111 aircraft with NASAâ€™s
    supercritical wing made its first flight, in a joint Air Force and NASA
    program at Flight Research Center. Prime pilots were USAF Maj. Stu
    R. Boyd and NASA research pilot Einer K. Enevoldson. The transonic
    aircraft technology (TACT) program would investigate application of
    supercritical wing technology to high maneuverable aircraft at transonic
    speeds. Wind-tunnel studies of the new airfoil shape-based on research
    by Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, Head of Langley Research Centerâ€™s 8-
    Foot Tunnels Branch, and almost directly opposite to conventional
    shapes-had shown it could delay rise in aerodynamic drag and allow
    an aircraft to perform more efficiently at higher speeds. The new wing,
    with flat top and upward-curving rear portion of the bottom side, was
    expected to improve the tactical advantage of military aircraft in air-to-
    air combat. (NASA Release 73-215; NASA Photo 73-H-1073)

November 3-13: NASAâ€™s       Mariner 10 (Mariner-J) Venus-Mercury probe was
    launched into a parking orbit from Eastern Test Range at 1 2 ~ 4 am EST
                                                                        5
    by an Atlas-Centaur D1-A launch vehicle. After a 25-min coast, a 130-
    sec burn of the Centaur engines injected the spacecraft into a helio-
    centric orbit that would allow Mariner 10 to pass within 5300 km (3300
    mi) of Venus Feb. 5, 1974. Using the gravitational field of Venus to
    change the speed and flight path of the spacecraft, Mariner 10 would
    travel toward a March 29 encounter with Mercury, approaching the sun
    more closely than any other planetary mission. Mariner 10 would be
    the first spacecraft to use gravity assist in a dual-planet mission and the
    first to explore Mercury.
       The primary objective was to measure Mercuryâ€™s environment, at-
    mosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investi-
    gations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in
    the interplanetary medium and to obtain experience with a dual-planet
    gravity-assist mission.

       The seven experiments aboard the octagonal 503-kg (1108-lb) space-
   craft included a TV camera and an infrared radiometer to investigate
   the planetâ€™s surface ; plasma science experiment, charged particle tele-
    scope, and magnetometer to investigate the environment around the
    planet and the interplanetary medium ; dual-frequency-radio science
   experiment and ultraviolet spectrometer to measure characteristics of the
   Mercury neutral atmosphere and ionosphere if they existed; and celes-
   tial mechanics experiments to measure planetary mass characteristics
    and test the theory of relativity. All experiments had been designed and
    selected for their Mercury scientific objectives but also would obtain
    important data at Venus and during the cruise phases.
       The Tidbinbilla, Australia, tracking station was unable to maintain
    command lock with the spacecraft following spacecraft injection. Ac-
    quisition of the star Vega by the spacecraft Canopus tracker also was
    delayed, but two-way communications were established within an hour
    and, after repeated commands, Vega was acquired. Solar panels, high-
    gain and low-gain antennas, and plasma science and magnetometer
    booms were deployed. On Nov. 45 four moon and three earth TV pic-
                                       -
    ture mosaics were completed.
       By Nov. 6 the spacecraft was 1394 000 km (866 000 mi) from the
    earth, traveling at a speed of 4.32 km (2.68 mi) per sec. All science
    experiments except the infrared radiometer and electrostatic analyzer
    had been turned on. The scanning electron spectrometer portion of the
    plasma science experiment was not operating properly and the problem
    was being analyzed.
       Four trajectory correction maneuvers were scheduled during the
    mission. The first, Nov. 13, successfully adjusted the flight path for
    closest approach to Venus on Feb. 5, 1974, as planned. A second would
    be made Jan. 18, 1974. On Feb. 9 and March 1, 1974, after the Venus
    encounter, maneuvers would target the Mariner 10 to pass Mercury at
    1000-km (620-mi) altitude.
       The Mariner program, including mission operations and tracking and
    data systems, was managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the di-
                        Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center, with
    rection of NASAâ€™s
    contractor General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., was responsible for
    the launch vehicle. Previous missions had been made to Mars, including
    Mariner 4, 6, 7 , and 9 (launched Nov. 28, 1964; Feb. 24, 1969; March
    27, 1969; and May 30, 1971). Mariner 9 had been the first spacecraft to
    orbit a planet other than the earth. All others had been flyby missions.

November 3-January 9, 1974: NASAâ€™s           Pwneer 10 interplanetary probe
     (launched March 2, 1972) became the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter
     during a two-month encounter, returning new findings about the giant
    planet and continuing toward Uranus and eventual exit from the solar
    system.
       November 3-December 3: Encounter operations were begun Nov. 3
     by Ames Research Center controllers and scientists and on Nov. 4
    Pioneer 10 began sending photopolarimeter images of Jupiter to the
    earth three to eight hours a day. By Nov. 6 the spacecraft, 25 000 000
    km (15 500 000 mi) from Jupiter, had begun measuring the plapetâ€™s
     atmosphere above Jupiterâ€™s orange-and-blue-striped cloud tops and the
     characteristics of particles making up the dense clouds.
        On Nov. 8 the spacecraft crossed the orbits of Hades and Poseidon,

   the first two of Jupiterâ€™s outer moons, and on Nov. 9 and 11 it crossed
   the orbits of Pan and Andrastea.
      At a Nov. 19 press briefing at ARC Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Asso-
   ciate Administrator for Space Science, said that low temperature in that
   area of the solar system slowed evolution and scientists hoped to find
   objects not very different from what they were at their formation. â€œThe
   passage of Pioneer 10 past Jupiter also marks the gateway to the ex-
   ploration of the outer solar system. This is an exploration which is crit-
   ical if we truly want to understand the formation and evolution of our
   solar system.â€ Dr. William H. Kinard, Langley Research Center scien-
   tist, said that Pioneer 10 had encountered 100 times more space dust
   than expected during the journey between the Asteroid Belt and Jupi-
   ter. He expected that 30 times more particles would be detected as the
   spacecraft neared Jupiter.
      Pioneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiterâ€™s moons Demeter, Hera, and
   Hestia Nov. 22 and was 11400 600 km ( 7 084 000 mi) from Jupiter.
       By Nov. 25 a charged particle detector aboard the spacecraft had
   begun to show traces of particle radiation. Preliminary indications were
   that the probe was beginning to cross into Jupiterâ€™s magnetosphere, es-
   timated to be 20 times stronger than the earthâ€™s. The planetâ€™s radiation
   belts contained particle concentrations up to 1 million times higher
   than the earthâ€™s Van Allen Belt and were considered by some scientists
   to be extremely dangerous to the spacecraftâ€™s electronics. At a distance
   of 8 336 400 km (5 180 000 mi) from Jupiter, spacecraft instruments
   began returning pictures of Jupiterâ€™s great red spot.
       The final spacecraft-attitude change before encounter was made Nov.
   26 and a 24-hour day of imaging and polarimetry began. At 3:30 pm
   EST Nov. 26 Pioneer 10 successfully crossed Jupiterâ€™s bow shock wave
   at a distance of 7 709000 km (4790000 mi)-with great turbulence
   when the solar wind hit Jupiterâ€™s magnetic field. The spacecraft was un-
   affected by the turbulence hut data from 6 of its 1 instruments changed
                                                       1
    dramatically. Solar wind speed abruptly decreased to half the normal
   velocity and solar wind temperatures rose sharply. On Nov. 27, at a
    distance of 6 760 000 km (4 200 000 mi) from Jupiter, the spacecraft
    crossed into the planetâ€™s true magnetic envelope, the region of inter-
   planetary space into which the solar wind could not penetrate. Pioneer
    10 crossed the magnetopause, entering the magnetic field for the first
    time at 3:30 pm EST.
       At a Nov. 29 press briefing ARC scientists said new data had shown
    the reach of Jupiterâ€™s magnetic field to be greater than predicted. It
    stretched more than 13 000 000 km (8000 000 mi) in diameter and its
    strength was 40 times that of the earthâ€˜s magnetic field. Its direction
    was south, rather than north as predicted. The strength of the magnet-
    ism at 6 400 000 km ( 4 000 000 mi) from the planet seemed to rise
    and fall in a regular 10-hour phase, possibly because of the planetâ€™s
    rotation. Jupiterâ€™s mass was also found to be greater than estimated
    and the spacecraft was being drawn toward Jupiter faster than planned;
    it would arrive at its closest approach two minutes earlier than pre-
    dicted.
       On Nov. 30 Pioneer 10 recorded a sharp drop in magnetic and ra-
    diation measurements, indicating disappearance of the magnetic field.
    Eleven hours later the spacecraft again crossed the magnetopause, which
    had apparently been driven toward the planet by a disturbance in the

                                   309

    solar wind. At 1 4 2 7 5 0 0 km (887000 mi) from the planet, the space-
    craft entered Jupiterâ€™s dipole magnetic field. Preliminary data indicated
    that the outer portions of Jupiterâ€™s magnetic field did not rotate with
    the planet and were more flattened than the earthâ€˜s field. Also, the mag-
    netic dipole center was appreciably offset, both radially and toward the
    north from the center of the planet. The magnetic axis was tilted from
    the spin axis.
       Pwneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiterâ€™s innermost moons-Callisto,
    Ganymede, Europa, and Io-Dec. 2-3. As it came within 446000 km
     (277 000 mi) of Ganymede, the infrared radiometer indicated the
    moonâ€™s surface temperature was 125 K (-235â€™F). Six hours before
    its closest approach to Jupiter the probe entered the dangerous region
    of intense radiation and, soon after, the imaging system ceased return-
    ing picture data. Radio commands switched the system back to normal
    operation within 30 minutes, however. The press later reported that
    NASA attributed the mishap to an unidentified flight control room guest
    who had inadvertently pressed against a cathode ray display, pushing a
    button that cut out eight instruments.
        December 3-11: As the gold and silver spacecraft approached
    Jupiter and radiation intensity increased 10-fold every two hours, reach-
    ing 65 million ev 90 min before periapsis, tense scientists paced the
    floor of ARCâ€™S Mission Control with fingers crossed. At 9:25 pm EST
    Dec. 3, after a flight of 641 days and 826 000 000 km (513 000 000 mi),
    Pioneer 10 sped past Jupiter at an altitude of 130 000 km (81000 mi),
    traveling 155 140 km per hour (96400 mph), the fastest speed ever
    achieved by a man-made object. The spacecraftâ€™s 11 instruments sent
    back readings and pictures that came in loud and clear, taking 46 min-
    utes to reach a jubilant team on earth.
        â€œNeedless to say, weâ€™re elated,â€ Dr. John Wolfe, Pioneer Project
    Scientist, told cheering newsmen.
        The Fashington Post later described the scene at ARC: â€œSO deluged
    were Pioneer scientists with transmissions of the spacecraftâ€™s instru-
    ments, they were literally changing their minds about Jupiterâ€™s physics
    and chemistry every hour.â€ Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator,
    said, â€œSome of us have been looking through telescopes at Jupiter since
    our early teens. This is more than we ever dreamed of.â€
        The spacecraft suffered no apparent failures and continued to function
    as planned. However, preliminary estimates of radiation belt parameters
    and observed effects on the spacecraft and instrumentation indicated
    that the margin of survival had been small.
        As Pioneer 10 flew by Jupiter, the spacecraft was accelerated and
    slung by the planetâ€™s gravity into a new trajectory that would take it
    past the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and, traveling at a
     constant 40 000 km per hr (25 000 mph) , out of the solar system toward
    the constellation Taurus. Pwneer 10 would be the first spacecraft to
    leave the solar system. By 7:OO pm EST Dec. 4, it had traveled nearly
     1600 000 km ( 1 000 000 mi) beyond Jupiter.
        December 11-Janwtry 9: ARC Mission Control ended Jupiter picture-
    taking Dec. 11 and returned to routine interplanetary operations. The
    spacecraft recrossed the bow shock wave Dec. 12 and continued into
    interplanetary space. By Dec. 14 the spacecraft was 10 881 000 km
     ( 6 761 000 mi) from Jupiter, traveling at 83 525 km per hr (51 900
     mph) toward the edge of the solar system.

        Preliminary findings from the encounter included the discovery of
    an ionosphere (implying a tenuous atmosphere) surrounding Jupiterâ€™s
    moon Io, detection of helium in Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere, new density
    measurements of the entire Jovian system that would affect current
    theories on the formation of the universe, and new temperature meas-
    urements of Jupiter that indicated little difference between average day-
    time and nighttime temperatures.
        Pioneer 10 was expected to continue collecting and returning data until
    it reached the orbit of Uranus in 1980, almost 320 0000 000 km
     ( 2 0 0 0 00 0 00 0 mi) from the earth. Data returned would determine
    whether the second Jupiter probe, Pioneer 11 (launched April 5 and
    crossing the Asteroid Belt since August) , could safely be retargeted
    closer to the planet. The Pioneer 10 mission was officially adjudged a
    success Jan. 9, 1974.
        The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by ARC. Pioneer 6
    and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17, 1966, to study the helio-
    centric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and 9 (launched Dec. 13,
    1967, and Nov. 8, 1969, to study interplanetary phenomena) continued
    to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar plasma, magnetic and
    electric fields, and cosmic rays. (NASA  prog off; ARC Release, 11/6/73;

November 6-29: NASA launched Noaa 3 (ITOS-F) National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration meteorological satellite from Western Test
    Range at 6:02 am PST on a two-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-
    Delta 0300 launch vehicle. The satellite entered near-nominal orbit with
    a 1509.2-km (937.8-mi) apogee, 1500-km (932.1-mi) perigee, 116.09-
    min period, and 102.08O inclination.
       The primary objectives were to place the spacecraft in sun-synchro-
    nous orbit with a local equator crossing time of 8:30 am to permit the
    spacecraft to accomplish its operational mission requirements, make an
    in-orbit evaluation, and check out the spacecraft before turning opera-
    tional control over to NOAAâ€™S National Environmental Satellite Service
             .
     (NESS)
       Operational responsibility for the spacecraft was transferred to NOAA
    Nov. 29. Excellent data were being returned. The orbit would permit
    regular, dependable daytime and nighttime meteorological observations
    in both direct-readout and stored modes of operation in support of the
    National Operational Meteorological Satellite System ( NOMSS) . Noaa 3
    was the second operational spacecraft to provide temperature soundings
    of the earthâ€™s atmosphere as well as direct-readout and globally recorded
    cloud-cover data. The three-axis-stabilized satellite carried redundant
    very-high-resolution radiometers, vertical-temperature-profile radiome-
    ters, and scanning radiometers.
       Noaa 3 was the fourth in the Improved TIROS Operational Satellite
    series of second-generation meteorological satellites. The prototype had
    been Itos 1 (launched Jan. 23, 1970), and the first NoAA-funded space-
    craft, Noaa 1, had been launched Dec. 11, 1970. Noaa 2 (launched Oct.
    15, 1972) continued to provide meteorological data. The first series of
    spacecraft had included nine satellites-Essu 1 through Essa 9 (launched
    1966-1969).
       The TOS program was a joint NASA and Dept. of Commerce effort
    under a Jan. 30, 1964, agreement. Goddard Space Flight Center was
    responsible for the design and development of the spacecraft and
    ground systems, launch checkout and evaluation, tracking and data
    acquisition, and the Thor-Delta launch vehicle. NESS was responsible for
    operating the spacecraft and processing the data. (NASA prog off; GSFC

∞Skylabâ€™s contribution to better understanding of solar processes, leading
    to possible generation and control of solar energy for earth use, was
    described by NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight
    Dale D. Myers in a speech before the Poor Richard Club in Philadelphia:
    The sun was the â€œoriginal model of nuclear energy,â€ understanding of
    which could lead to fusion control and its efficient use for power genera-
    tion. â€œThe Skylab investigators are concerned with this and also with
    explaining how solar events affect the Earth, particularly solar flares
    that trigger auroras and disrupt radio transmission. Because sunspot
    activity correlates with temperature and density variations in the
    Earthâ€˜s upper atmosphere, it is conceivable that the injection of energy
    into the atmosphere by solar particles may trigger world-wide weather
    phenomena. Our astronauts saw flares shooting up 100000 miles
     [160 000 kilometers] above the surface and they watched giant snake-
    like clouds erupting in the corona that disturbed radio transmissions
    here on Earth. Two massive flares exploded on the Sun, producing
    auroral lights on Earth; . . . each one could supply the worldâ€™s energy
    needs for the next 500 years.â€ (Text)

November 7: A five-day delay in the launch of Skylab 4, third and final
     manned Skylab mission, was announced by Skylab Program Director
     William C. Schneider at a Kennedy Space Center press briefing. The
     delay was caused by the discovery of cracks in the Saturn IB launch
     vehicle fins [see Nov. 61. The earliest rescheduled launch time would
     be 9:27 am EST Nov. 15. Director of Launch Operations at IGC Walter
     J. Kapryan said the 3.8-cm-long (1.5-in-long) cracks probably were
     caused by stress erosion-exposure of the material to the elements com-
     bined with stress from the weight of the fueled vehicle-and would have
     caused the breakup of the vehicle at 12 000 m (40 000 ft), where the
     rocket underwent maximum aerodynamic stress. All eight fins would
     be replaced. New fins were being shipped from Michoud Assembly
     Facility for replacement on the launch pad. (Transcript; Oâ€™Toole, W

    ing, the first operational prototype geostationary meteorological satellite
    was a forerunner of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
    tionâ€™s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sys-
    tem. Once the satellites were placed in orbit and checked out by NASA,
    they would be turned over to NOAA as a part of the operational system,
    which could observe the earthâ€˜s surface day and night, using visible-
    light and infrared sensors, and acquire in situ data from ocean buoys,
    aircraft, ships, river stage stations, and other ground-based remote sta-
    tions. The GOES system-of two satellites in geostationary orbit viewing
    the western U S . and Pacific Ocean area and the eastern US. and
    Atlantic area-would provide near-continuous surveillance of all tropical
    Atlantic storms, all tropical storms of the central and eastern Pacific
    Ocean, and all storms of observable size within the limits of the US.,
    its territories, and its surrounding coastal waters, except Alaska. Im-
    proved sensors were expected to provide new and improved data on

∞President Nixon addressed himself to the energy crisis in a speech over

     shmtages of energy since World War 11. Our supply of petroleum this
     winter will be at least 10 percent short of our anticipated demands, and
     it could fall short by as much as 17 percent. Now, even before war
     broke out in the Middle East, these prospective shortages were the
     subject of intensive discussions among members of my Administration,
     leaders of the Congress, Governors, mayors, and other groups. From
     these discussions has emerged a broad agreement that we, as a Nation,
     must now set upon a new course. In the short run, this course means
     that we must use less energy-that means less heat, less electricity, less
     gasoline. In the long run, it means that we must develop new sources of
     energy which will give us the capacity to meet our needs without relying
     on any foreign nation.â€ The President announced steps to lower energy
     consumption. He asked the Atomic Energy Commission to speed licens-
     ing and construction of nuclear plants and would ask development of an
     emergency energy act. (PD,     11/12/73, 1312-8)

    gyroscopes, the crew proceeded successfully, making four space walks
    and setting new manned flight records. The astronauts collected signifi-
    cant data in medical experiments, astronomy (including 121 observa-
    tions of Comet Kohoutek), and earth resources surveys for 84 days
    before undocking for a safe return to earth Feb. 8, 1974.
       November 16-21: Skylab 4 (SL-4) lifted off on time at 9:Ol am EST
    from Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s Launch Complex 39, Pad B, on the two-
    stage Saturn IB-208 launch vehicle. The Apollo command and service
                                                    P. Carr, Dr. Edward G.
    module (CSM-118) and its crew-Gerald
    Gibson, and William R. Pogue-roared into a clear blue sky. Traveling
    at 1600 km per hr (1000 mph) the spacecraft successfully endured
    maximum dynamic pressure at 72 sec after liftoff, proving the relia-
    bility of the Saturn IB launch vehicle and relieving the tense atmos-
    phere in Mission Control at IGC. During the prelaunch period cracks
    discovered in the fins and body of the launch vehicle had twice post-
    poned the launch date for replacement of the Saturn IBâ€™s eight
    stabilizing fins [see Nov. 6, 12, and 131. Director of Launch Operations
    Walter J. Kapryan said he â€œpersonally sweated out those first 72 seconds
    through max q.â€
       The CSMJS-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with a
    222.3-km (138.1-mi) apogee and 148.2-km (92.1-mi) perigee 9 min
    45 sec after launch. Eight minutes later the CSM separated from the
    stage. The S-IVB/IU deorbit maneuver was commanded on the third
    orbit and the stage impacted in the Pacific Ocean at 3:OO pm EST.
        After five rocket maneuvers the CSM rendezvoused with the Orbital
    Workshop during the fifth orbit. Docking was achieved at 5:02 pm EST
    after two unsuccessful attempts. Carr radioed down to Mission Control,
    â€˜â€˜Great to be home.â€
        During rendezvous and docking Pogue suffered from motion sickness
    and vomited. Later, in a conversation unintentionally taped by the as-
     tronauts and transmitted to the ground the astronauts decided not to
     report the incident to ground controllers. Capsule communicator Alan
     B. Shepard later told the crew, â€œWe think you made a fairly serious
     error in judgmentâ€™â€™ in the attempt to cover up Pogueâ€™s condition. Carr
     agreed, â€œIt was a dumb decision.â€ Pogue recovered by late evening,
     Carr suffered only minor motion sickness problems, and Gibson re-
    mained in good health.
        Carr, Gibson, and Pogue entered the multiple docking adapter at
     9:32 am EST Nov. 17 (Mission Day 2) and began Workshop activation.
     They found a welcoming note on the teleprinter: â€œJerry, Ed and Bill,
     welcome aboard the space station Skylab. Hope you enjoy your stay.
     Weâ€™re looking forward to several months of interesting and productive
     work. Signed, Flight Control.â€ In addition they found three dummies
     dressed in tan flight suits left by Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Dr.
     Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma.
        Pogue replenished the fluid in the Workshopâ€™s primary cooling sys-
     tem, which had developed a leak during the Skylab 3 mission [see July
     28-Sept 251. The 51/2-hr task required Pogue to punch a hole into the
     plumbing lines to inject the fluid. Spacecraft activation was completed
     Nov. 21.
        November 22-February 4: The first extravehicular activity (EVA-
     1 ) begao at 12:44 pm EST Nov. 22. Pogue and Gibson moved through
     space to install film cassettes in the Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM)

   cameras, deploy experimental hardware, and repair the control system
   for an earth-scanning antenna that had jammed during the Skylab 3
   mission. Gibson, anchored in a portable foot restraint on the bottom of
   the spacecraft, held onto Pogue while Pogue rewired the instrument,
   bypassing a short circuit and restoring the antenna to 80% of its
   original capacity. Gibson and Pogue reentered the Workshop and began
   pressurization at 6:19 pm EST. The 6-hr 35-min EVA surpassed the 6-hr
   31-min record set Aug. 6 by Skyjab 3 Astronauts Garriott and Lousma.
        At 3:45 am EST Nov. 23 one of three moment gyros which controlled
   the spacecraft overheated and was ordered shut down by Flight Con-
   troller Philip C. ShaBer. Shaffer told the press at Johnson Space Center
   that a near-normal mission could still be flown but it would take more
   time and fuel to make maneuvers. Pogue began extensive photographic
   study of Comet Kohoutek. By the end of the mission Comet Kohoutek
   had been observed and recorded 121 times as it approached, looped
   around, and retreated from the sun.
        The first full day of scientific research was scheduled for Nov. 27.
   While photographing a barium cloud-created by the launch of a
   Black Brant IVA sounding rocket from Poker Flats, Alaska-the space-
   craftâ€™s thruster attitude-control system used three times the amount of
   nitrogen gas fuel anticipated. The extra fuel use, in addition to poor
   weather conditions, forced postponement of the first earth resources
   experiment package ( EREP) pass while ground teams designed improved
   techniques for managing attitude control and fuel consumption. For the
    first time Carr pointed the space stationâ€™s six large solar telescopes at an
   unusually active region of the sun.
        The first EREP pass was made Nov. 29 during a 23-min 8850-km
    (5500-mi) sweep from the southwestern U S . to South America. In a
   Johnson Space Center press conference Skylab Program Director
   William C. Schneider said that the ground team had concluded that
    the Nov. 28 problem had been caused by an incorrect input of initial
    conditions into the fuel management program. Restrictions on maneuvers
    were eliminated and, with proper fuel management, the mission could
    66
       continue essentially as planned.â€
        On Dec. 1 the astronauts photographed a laser beam pointed at them
   by Goddard Space Flight Center scientists who were testing the lasers
    as a reference point for possible use in spacecraft navigation and com-
    munications. Earlier attempts to spot the flashing green laser had failed.
        In a Dec. 13 Mission Day 28 Review of the first third of the mission
    Program Director Schneider said the S k y h b 4 crew had accomplished
    84 hrs of ATM solar viewing, 45 separate observations of Comet Kohou-
    tek, 80 earth observatiob experiments, and 12 EREP passes, although
    a significant portion of the data from 9 passes had been lost because of
    wrong camera filters. Schneider said that the crew was in good physical
    and mental health and that their performance had been outstanding,
    but flight planners had needed to adjust work schedules to the pace of
    the crew.
        A spectacular limb prominence on the sun, estimated to be the
    largest observed in 25 yrs, was recorded by the crew Dec. 18-19.
        Astronauts Carr and P o p e opened the hatch for EVA-2 at 11:55
    am EST Dec. 25, Christmas Day. Pogue mounted three special cameras
    to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek before it passed behind
    the sun. Photographs were taken of the cometâ€™s tail and coma. Carr

    replaced film cassettes in the ATM and repaired a jammed filter on an
    ATM camera. The constant movement of Carr and Pogue outside the
    spacecraft disrupted Gibsonâ€™s efforts to aim the laboratory cameras
    at Kohoutek and the thruster attitude control system used more fuel
    than planned. Carr and Pogue reentered the Workshop and closed the
    hatch at 6:56 pm EST after a 7-hr 1-min spacewalk that surpassed Gib-
    son and Pogueâ€™s Nov. 22 record.
       The Dec. 28 perihelion passage of Comet Kohoutek was marked with
    a live ground-to-air televised conference between Dr. Lubos Kohoutek,
    discoverer of the comet (1973F), and the Skylab 4 crew. Gibson said
    that the comet, as seen on the white-light coronagraph, was growing
    dramatically. The tail fanned out 20â€ from the central axis and could be
    seen back to a distance three times the diameter of the coma. Dr.
    Kohoutek congratulated the â€œfirst human beings studying a comet from
    outer spaceâ€ and wished them a flawless splashdown in February.
       The crew began EVA-3 at 12:29 pm EST Dec. 29. Carr and Gibson
    moved outside to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek as it began
    its trajectory away from the sun. Gibson said the comet had a spike and
    a tail. â€œThat spike is very evident. It is not 180 degrees out from the tail,
    but more like 160 degrees. It is yellow and orange . . . just like a flame.
    It seems to be the same distance out as the tail, and there is a diffuse
    amount of material which goes out and joins up with the tail.â€ The
    astronauts recorded other astronomical phenomena, retrieved samples
    from the magnetospheric particle collector, and retrieved the comet
    observation camera. At 3:58 pm EST Carr and Gibson moved back in-
    side the Workshop and closed the hatch after 3 hrs 29 min.
        On Jan. 10 the mission was given a go-ahead for a seven-day exten-
    sion, with weekly reviews through the end of a tentative 84.day total
    mission. In the 56-day mission review at JSC, Skylab Program Director
    Schneider said the crew was â€œin good spirits and excellent physical
    condition and the spacecraft is in good shape to continue.â€
        On Jan. 13 and 14 the Skylab 4 crew photographed a solar flare from
    beginning to end-the first opportunity for scientists to study the com-
    plete life cycle of a solar flare.
        At 10:10 pm EDT Jan. 14 Carr, Gibson, and Pogue had been in orbit 59
     days 1 hrs 9 min, surpassing the record manned flight time in space on
             1
     a single flight set by Skylab 3 Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma
     during their July 28-Sept. 25 mission.
        Mission controllers struggled with gyroscope problems with increas-
    ing frequency throughout the mission. On Jan. 22 the second control
     moment gyro was in the distress position for six hours, causing Skylab
     officials to order the recovery force into port at San Diego three days
     earlier than planned. EREP passes were limited and other maneuvers
     reduced to conserve fuel and reduce stress. Despite nearly three dozen
     gyro 2 stress periods, gyros 2 and 3 held up for the rest of the mission.
        At 1:46 pm EDT Jan. 25 (MD-71) the crew passed the record cumu-
     lative time in space of 69 days 15 hrs 45 min set by Bean during the
    Skylab 3 mission.
        The hatch was opened for E V A 4 at 11:19 am EDT Feb. 3. Gibson
     and Carr measured the atmosphere surrounding the Skylab solar in-
     struments to evaluate the light-scattering produced when photos of the
     sun were taken. The astronauts also photographed the sun with an
     x-ray sensitive camera, retrieved film from ATM cameras, and removed

   a plate and piece of rubberized material from the side of the spacecraft
   for a study of effects of nine-month exposure to the space environment.
   EVA operations ended at 4:38 pm EDT after 5 hrs 19 min.
      February 5-8: Deactivation of the Workshop was begun Feb. 5
   (MD-82). A three-minute firing of the steering rockets at 4:48 pm EDT
   Feb. 6 raised the Workshop's altitude to about 450 km (280 mi) to
   reduce atmospheric drag and extend the orbital lifetime to an estimated
   nine years, increasing chances for a future revisit to the laboratory,
   although it could not be inhabited again. The crew left hehind samples
   of food, film, teleprinter paper, and electrical cables for possible in-
   spection during the 1975 US.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mis-
   sion or during U S . space shuttle flights planned to begin in 1979.
      The CSM undocked from the Workshop at 6:34 am EDT Feb. 8
   (MD-85) and made a fly-around inspection of the Workshop. One of
   two redundant CSM rocket thruster systems developed a leak during re-
   entry preparation, forcing the astronauts' to reenter without a backup
   thruster system. Just before SM jettison at 10:45 am EDT, a procedural
   error caused circuit breakers to open, blocking the stabilization and
   control thrusters from firing. Carr quickly took manual control for re-
   entry. The CM splashed down upside down at 11:17 am EDT Feb. 8,
   282 km (175 mi) southwest of San Diego and 5 km ( 3 mi) from the
   recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans-ending         1214 revolutions of the
   earth. The capsule was righted by flotation bags while the carrier
   maneuvered alongside, and the CM was raised by a crane to the hangar
   deck about 40 min after landing. Immediate medical examinations
   found the crew had no apparent severe effects from their long exposure
   to weightlessness. They had grown one to two inches taller from stretched
   spinal columns in space and had lost some muscle mass, with body
   fluids readjusted for zero gravity; but they lost most of the slim-trim
   look on return to the earth. They were back to normal in a few days.
      The astronauts would remain aboard ship in San Diego for medical
   examinations and, after a brief dockside ceremony Feb. 10, would fly to
   Houston. The men would be allowed to rejoin their families but contact
   with the general public would be restricted for one week.
      The Skylab 4 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing
   Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital assembly
   in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending the duration
   of manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. All 58
   planned scientific and technical experiments in biomedicine, solar
   astronomy, solar physics, and engineering were accomplished. EREP
   instruments were operated during 39 passes over the earth and the crew
   spent 338 hrs photographing the sun and Comet Kohoutek with ATM
   instruments. Skylab 4 was officially adjudged a success Mar. 29, 1974.
      Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration
   manned space flight to date, 84 days 1 hr 16 min; the longest cumulative
   time in space for a man, 84 days each for Carr, Gibson, and Pogue;
   the longest orbital EVA, 7 hrs 1 min Dec. 25; the longest cumulative
   inflight EVA time for one mission, 22 hrs 24 min; and the longest dis-
   tance in orbit for a manned mission, 55.5 million km (34.5 million mi).
      Skylab 4 was the third and final mission to man the Skylab Orbital
   Workshop. Skylab 2 astronauts had worked aboard the laboratory 28
   days, May 15-June 22, conducting experiments as well as making re-
   pairs to the orbital assembly to salvage the Skylab program. The

     Skylab 3 crew collected data in medical experiments, solar astronomy,
    and earth resources surveys for 59 days, July 28-Sept. 25. There were
    no plans to send another crew to inhabit the Workshop, which would be
    g-dormant-lacking      in power, air conditioning, and atmosphere-by
    Feb. 9. Skylab 1 was expected to remain in orbit for nine years before
    reentering the earthâ€™s atmosphere and burning up. (NASA prog off; JSC

November 16: President Nixon issued a statement following the launch of
    Skylab 4: â€œThe Skylab flight that begins today marks-the conclusion
    of the single most productive program in the history of manâ€™s quest
    for knowledge about himself and his world. The crew of Skylab will
    mark in space the 16th anniversary of Americaâ€™s first step toward the
    heavens. From the launch of a 30-pound [13.6-kg] space satellite, we
    progressed to the exploration of the Moon, which is helping to determine
     Earthâ€™s place in the universe. Now we are moving to determine
     through space technology manâ€™s own place in the universe, and to
    greater understanding of our own planet. As we are grateful for the
    success of our previous ventures into space, and as we look to the
    success of that which is imminent, let us never take for granted the skill
     and courage and devotion of those who labor on behalf of the United
     States space program. Let us rather pause to reflect with pride upon
    what we have done, asking Godâ€™s blessings upon our efforts, and Godâ€™s
     grace upon those who bravely place their lives at the service of peace
    for all mankind.â€ (PD,     11/19/73, 1338)
∞A Today editorial commented on Skylab 4 on the day of launch: â€œWe now
    talk about the strong probability of an 85-day mission. It will be the
    extreme test of manâ€™s ability to function i n a world of weightlessness,
    and it should settle once and for all the question of whether man can
     begin to seriously think of visiting other planets in his solar system.â€

     rocks could also be found in samples from previous Apollo missions.
     â€œHowever, unusually high zinc concentrations in the orange soil and the
    exceptionally low Ni content of the basalts suggest different source
    materials than for previously returned igneous rocks. The trace element

       The Apollo Field Geology Investigation Team reported on the ApoUo
    17 Taurus-Littrow landing site. Impact-generated breccias underlay
    the massifs adjacent to the valley â€œand basalt has flooded and leveled
    the valley floor. The dark mantle inferred from orbital photographs
    was not recognized as a discrete unit; the unusually thick regolith of
    the valley floor contains a unique high concentration of dark glass beads
    that may cause the low albedo of much of the surface.â€
       Apollo 17 scientist-astronaut Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt described the
    geological investigation of the Taurus-Littrow valley as reported in
    â€œthe last major report of observations by the crews during the Apollo

November 18-Dec. 1: US. flight crews for the July 1975 US.-U.S.S.R.
    Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission visited the U.S.S.k. for familiariza-
    tion with the Soyuz spacecraft and discussions with Soviet counterparts
    on the flight plan. The discussions, held mostly at the Yuri A. Gagarin
     Center for Cosmonaut Training near Moscow, included joint crew ac-
    tivities and onboard documentation. Astronauts participating were
    Thomas P. Stafford, U S . ASTP commander; Vance D. Brand, command
    modale pilot; and Donald K. Slayton, docking module pilot; backup
     crew Alan L. Bean, Ronald E. Evans, and Jack R. Lousma; support
     crew Robert F. Overmyer and Karol J. Bobko; and Eugene A. Cernan,
     Special Assistant to the U S . ASTP Technical Director. At a press con-
     ference following the Nov. 29 concluding meeting, Maj. Gen. Vladimir
     A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, said the U.S.S.R. planned
     further manned space flights-individual Soyuz missions and linkups
     of Soyuz with .the Salyut orbital platform-before the joint US.-
     U.S.S.R. mission. Stafford told newsmen he was completely satisfied
     that the Soyuz would be â€˜â€˜a great ship to fly.â€ He said there would be
     two joint training sessions in 1974, in Moscow in July and at Johnson

    display systems on the individual console.â€ The building housing Mission
    Control was in two sections. â€œOne is sort of a wing where the main
    operations Control Room is and some auxiliary rooms and equipment.â€
    Another wing held equipment for teletype, intercom, and TV.
        Lunney said a US.-built docking system and a U.S.S.R. docking sys-
    tem, â€œactually almost two docking systems, that were brought over by
    members of the Soviet test team,â€ had been undergoing tests at JSC
    since September. â€œThe tests are almost complete with the mandatory test
    points that have to be taken. Thereâ€™s a period . . . where some additional
                                  .
    test points may be taken . . and that will probably go on for the
         .
    rest . . of November.â€ To date, the tests had gone smoo2hly. â€œI think
    what they are telling us is that the assumptions that went into the de-
    sign appear to be verified and that indeed we can expect that same
    kind of results when we use the production hardware in the qualification
    test next year.â€
        Lunney said US. delegates had learned that the Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12
    flight had tested fixes to the spacecraft to prevent reoccurrence of the
    fatal June 30, 1971, Soyuz 11 accident in which three cosmonauts died
    from decompression. He said that â€˜â€˜all the fixes worked properly.â€
    Modifications included use of spacesuits for launch and reentry, a gas
    supply and hose system, and a strong cap on the valve that had been
    triggered open accidentally; the cap now had to be fired pyrotechnically
    to release. Firings to separate the reentry module were modified and a
    manual override on the valve was made more accessible to the crew.
    Discussions had given cbafairly full treatment of the problem, to the
    point where we are satisfied that we know what happened and we know
    what the fixes are and they appear indeed to be very substantial.â€ (Tran-

    had also observed extended x-ray sources identified with clusters of
    galaxies like those in the Perseus, Coma, Virgo, and Centaurus constel-

    galaxy were affecting the entire Perseus cluster of several thousand
    galaxies. They also believed the x-ray emission detected in the Seyfert
    galaxy might be associated with the inverse Compton effect, in which
    high-velocity electrons traveling near the speed of light collided with

     identified the spacecraft as an unmanned Soyuz. It was brought down
     by parachute near Karaganda Jan. 30, 1974, after orbiting the earth
     60 days, a record length of flight for any Soviet spacecraft recovered in-
     tact. Cosmos 613 flew the same orbital track as other manned Soviet
     spacecraft but at a higher altitude, leading to speculation that the pur-
     pose of the mission was to test the ability of Soyuz spacecraft to fly
     higher and the durability of its systems as a prerequisite to a possible
     two-month manned mission. (GSFC SSR, 11/30/73 ; 1/31/74; SBD,

    submitted the report The Nationâ€™s Energy Future to President Nixon
    in response to the Presidentâ€™s June 29 request for recommended energy
    research and development programs for inclusion in the FY 1975

    Research and Development Administration by July 1, 1974, to plan
    and coordinate the total program and direct the major share of the
    Federal program; conduct an annual program review to reallocate funds
    among programs as required; ensure full consideration of energy con-
    sequences of all Federal actions to achieve nonenergy goals; promote

    the cutbacks in 1969 and 1970, there was no panic. An influx of retirees
    from the North and from southern Florida had caused a shortage of

    much energy as it receives from the sun. When all the knowledge
    Pioneer has transmitted has been absorbed and categorized by NASA
    scientists, it should provide clues to new energy sources for earth, par-
    ticularly solar energy and the sunâ€™s rays. All these possibilities are be-
    yond the comprehension of an energy-conscious nation that in four
    years has grown b l a d about man walking on the moon. But they open
    the door for the scientists to apply on earth the potential resources of
    the solar system.â€ ( D News, 12/5/73)

    since formation of the sun and the planets, was offered by Dr. L. Bier-
     mann of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in

    checkout would be completed by Dec. 31.
       The Explorer 51 mission would consist of two phases. During Phase 1,
    excursions would be made at two- to four-week intervals, each lasting
    several days. The spacecraft perigee would be lowered in steps through
     a range of 150 to 125 km (95 to 80 mi). At each perigee step, te-
    lemetry data would be acquired. Phase 2 would begin after eight months
    and last four months; the spacecraft would be placed in a series of
    circular orbits ranging between 250 and 800 km (155 and 500 mi)
    in altitude.
       Explorer 51 carried 14 scientific instruments provided by a research
    team of scientists from nine institutions. In addition to the investigation
    of solar uv activity, the instrumentation would examine particle fluxes,
    airglow intensities, plasma densities, and temperatures and magnetic
    fields at low altitudes.
       To use the full spacecraft and instrument capabilities, a new rapid-
    response data system would provide data reduced to physical parameters,
    allowing the spacecraft to operate as a laboratory-in-space periodically
    reprogrammed to make optimum measurements in the light of interim
    results rather than gathering data in predetermined modes.
       Explorer 17 (launched April 2, 1963), the first AE satellite, had con-
    firmed that the earth was surrounded by a belt of neutral helium. The
    second, Explorer 32 (launched May 25, 1966), was placed in a higher
    orbit than planned but the higher altitude enhanced the resolution of the
    measured atmospheric parameters. The spacecraft continued to return
    useful data for 10 mos.

    Lunokhod had traveled from the plains into the foothills of the Taurus ,
    Mountains. Samplings taken near the landing site in the Lemonnier
    Crater at the eastern end of the Sea of Serenity had shown 6% iron
    and 9% aluminum. The ratio changed to 4% iron and 12% aluminum
    near the uplands. The change in content of aluminum was a distinctive
    feature of lunar geology; on the earth the amount of aluminum re-
    mained constant in continents and the ocean bottoms. Soviet scientists
    hoped to compare the lunar soil data with samples returned by the
    Apollo 17 astronauts (launched Dec. 7, 1972), who explored the Taurus-
    Littrow Valley 225 km (140 mi) away. (Shabad, NYT, 12/17/73, 66)

    He had been honored on his 100th birthday in 1972 by having a site
    on the moon named after him by the International Geophysical Union.
    Dr. Abbot, an astrophysicist, had specialized in solar energy. In 1938
    he had patented a solar engine that focused sunlight, using mirrors and
    sapphire lenses, into a steel cylinder where superheated air performed
    the same function as expanding steam in a locomotive or turbine. He
    refined the engine in a later patent, but never found anyone to build a
    prototype. At his 100th birthday celebration he said, â€œThe sun will be
    there long after we need it. I wish I had gotten to work on this sooner.â€

December 18-26: The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 13 carrying cosmonauts
    Maj. Pyotr IUimuk (commander) and Valentin Lebedev (flight engi-
    neer) from Baykonur Cosmodrome at 4:55 pm local time (2:55 pm
    Moscow time; 6 :55 am EST) into earth orbit with a 246-km (152.9-mi)
    apogee, 188-km (116.8-mi) perigee, 88.9-min period, and 51.6â€ in-
    clination. With Skylab 4 astronauts in earth orbit since Nov. 16, the
    launch of Soyuz 13 made it the first time in the history of space travel
    that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had men orbiting the earth simultaneously.
        The Soviet news agency Tass announced the objectives of the mission
    were to observe stars in the ultraviolet range using a special system of
    telescopes, survey separate sections of the earthâ€˜s surface and obtain
    data â€œfor the accomplishment of economic tasks,â€ continue comprehen-
    sive verification of onboard systems, and test manual and automatic
    controls and methods of autonomous navigation in various flight con-
    ditions. Western observers also expected the cosmonauts to study Comet
    Kohoutek as it approached the sun. The Western press reported that
    Soyuz 13 was the same kind of modified Soyuz capsule as would be used
    for the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project scheduled for 1975.
    I t would test a new navigational system that would increase the cosmo-
    nautsâ€™ ability to fly the spacecraft themselves rather than relying on
    ground control, ensuring that the quality of the spacecraft support sys-
    tem would match that of the Apollo.
        During the fifth orbit the spacecraft moved into a higher orbit with
    parameters reported by Tass as 272-km (169-mi) apogee, 225-km
     (139.8-mi) perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination. At 5:30 pm
    Moscow time (9:30 am EST) Soyuz 13 had made 18 orbits of earth.

    The cosmonauts reported they had adjusted to weightlessness and were
    carrying out their scheduled scientific program.
       Tass reported Dec. 20 that the crew had harvested the first crop of
    nutritive protein mass in an onboard experimental biological system,
    Oasis 2. In a closed system of two kinds of microorganisms, the waste
    products from the synthesis of the first were used by the second to ac-
    cumulate protein mass. During the eight-day mission, the cosmonauts
    also aimed the telescope at preset areas of the sky, photographing con-
    stellations; studied cerebral circulation under weightless conditions;
    studied natural resources on the earth; took x-ray photos of the sun;
    and photographed light effects before sunset and sunrise along the line
    of the terrestrial horizon to further development of autonomous navi-
    gation for future interplanetary journeys.
       Soyuz 13 landed successfully in a snowstorm and cyclonic winds at
    11:50 am Moscow time (3:50 am EST) Dec. 26, 200 km (125 mi)
    southwest of Karaganda in the Kazakhstan Steppe. A medical examina-
    tion indicated the cosmonauts were in good health.
       Soyuz 13 was the second Soviet manned launch in 1973. Soyuz 12,
    during a successful two-day mission Sept. 27-29, had tested improved
    flight systems, tested manual and automatic control in various flight
    conditions, and obtained spectrographic data of separate sections of the
    earth. Soyuz 12 had been the first Soviet manned flight since the death
    of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 1 in June 1971. (GSFC SSR, 12/31/73;

    Maran, director of Goddard Space Flight Centerâ€™s Operation Kohoutek
     said at a Johnson Space Center news briefing. Dr. Sdeneka Sekanina,
     Smithsonian Observatory scientist, said that although the comet might
     be a disappointment to the general public, it would be the first comet
     to be studied during its first close pass of the sun and therefore, scien-
     tifically, â€œthe most important comet weâ€™ve had since Halleyâ€™s.â€ The comet
     would be difficult to see by naked eye from ground because it would be low
     on the horizon and because of light pollution from the earth and lack
     of light-reflecting dust. (Transcript)
  ∞The approach of Comet Kohoutek had taken on special significance in con-
     servative religious circles, the New York Times News Service reported.
     Its Christmas season timing had revived speculation about the nature
     of the star reported to have led the Wise Men to Bethlehem. One theory

    had been that it was a comet similar to Kohoutek. Some Protestant
    fundamentalists had ascribed religious significance to Kohoutek and
    saw it as a possible sign of the second coming of Christ. Others inter-
    preted it as a warning of impending doom. ( B Sun, 12/27/73)
December 28: Comet Kohoutek passed perihelion, 21 million km (13 mil-
    lion mi) from the sun, at 5:24 am EST, completing the sunward swing of
    its ertimated 75 000-yr voyage, and began its journey back into distant
    space. (AP, B Sun, 12/28/73, A?)
∞NASA released details of Langley Research Centerâ€™s planned program to
    heat and cool a 5000-sq-m (53 000-sq-ft) Systems Engineering Building
    by solar energy. The program had been announced by Dr. James C.
    Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in Nov. 13 testimony before the House
    Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Energy. The
    program was to obtain realistic engineering and operating experience
    with a source of clean power as an alternate to fossil fuels and other
    conventional energy sources. Planned for mid-1975 completion, the
    building-believed to be first of its size for which solar energy would
    provide a significant part of its heating and cooling system-would use a
    1400-sq-m (15 000-sq-ft) solar collector to provide most of the heating
    and some of the cooling requirements. It also would test energy-storage
    capacity. NASA believed the solar collector to be the pacing component
    in the system and had established heating and cooling cost goals of $1
    to $2 per 0.09 sq m ( 1 sq ft) over a 15-yr life span. (NASA Release

    would carry them up to 560 km (350 mi) over portions of Montana,
    Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and California en route to an ocean target
    in the Phoenix Islands, southwest of the Hawaiian Islands. No nuclear
    components would be carried; a safety destruction package would be
    carried in place of the normal warhead. The launches were to provide
    important test data and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of
    the Minuteman strategic deterrent force. (DOD Release 615-73)

    set forthâ€ in the Space Act of 1958; now NASAâ€™s     emphasis should shift
    from space techniques to â€œmission management and the science and

                                 Summary

During 1973: The US. put 26 payloads into orbit in 23 launches and the
    U.S.S.R. orbited 107 payloads in 86 launches. The U.S. total included
    13 spacecraft orbited by the Dept. of Defense in 10 launches ( 2 of them
                                                 13
    multiple launches) and 13 by NASA. NASAâ€™s successful launches out
    of 14 attempts nearly matched the agencyâ€™s 1972 record of 17 flawless
    launches out of 17 attempts.
             Skylab program successfully launched the first US. experimen-
      NASAâ€™s
    tal space station-the Orbital W o r k s h o p a n d three successive crews to
    man it. Skylab 4, the final mission and the longest-duration manned space
    flight to date (84 days 1 h r 16 min), also set records for manâ€™s cumu-
    lative time in space (84 days), duration of extravehicular activity (7
    hrs 1 min), cumulative orbital EVA time for one mission (22 hrs 21
    min), and distance in orbit for a manned mission (55.5 million km;
    34.5 million mi). By the yearâ€™s end the Workshop had circled the earth
    more than 3350 times and housed nine astronauts. The Skylab 2 crewâ€™s
    repair in space of the Skylab 1 Workshop, after aerodynamic forces
    damaged it during liftoff, salvaged the endangered program and proved
    man could do difficult construction work in space. The Skylab 2 crew
    spent 28 days in space and the Skylab 3 crew 59 days, each mission a
    record at the time. The missions proved man could live and work in
    space for extended periods; expanded solar astronomy beyond earth-
    based observations, collecting much valuable new data that might revise
    understanding of the sun and its effects on the earth; and improved
    techniques for surveying earth resources from space, returning more
    information than planned.
       In NASAâ€™s  unmanned program, Pioneer 10 (launched in 1972) swept
    past Jupiter in December 1973 at a distance of 130 000 km (81000 mi).
    The first spacecraft to fly beyond the orbit of Mars and to penetrate
    the Asteroid Belt capped its two-year, 826-million-km (514-million-mi)
    journey by returning more than 300 closeup photos of Jupiter and its
    inner moons and providing new information on the planetâ€™s atmosphere
    and magnetic field. By the yearâ€™s end Pioneer 10 was beginning its
    five-year extended mission to reach Saturnâ€™s orbit in 1976 and the
    orbit of Uranus, the limit of spacecraft communications with the earth,
    in 1979. Thereafter it was to become the first man-made object to es-
    cape the solar system. Pioneer 11, launched in April, had passed safely
    through three fourths of the Asteroid Belt on its way to its December
    1974 encounter with Jupiter. Mariner 10, headed toward Mercury via
    Venus, was more than 14.5 million km ( 9 million mi) from the earth;
    it would pass by Venus in February 1974 and would provide the first
    closeup view of Mercury in March.
       NASA also selected landing sites for the Viking projectâ€™s landing of
    two spacecraft on Mars in 1976. Orbiter and lander critical design re-
    views, spacecraft thermal and structural tests, and other hardware tests
    were completed during the year.

During 1973

        Scientific satellites launched in 1973 included Explorer 49 in lunar
    orbit to measure galactic and solar radio noise using occultation of the
    moon to reduce background interference, Explorer 50 to complete a
    study of the interplanetary environment over an 11-yr solar cycle, and
    Explorer 51 to study the earthâ€˜s outer atmosphere. As December ended,
    scientists were studying Comet Kohoutek with optical telescopes, radio-
    telescopes, and radar from the ground; high-flying aircraft ; and instru-
    ments on unmanned satellites, sounding rockets, and Skylab 4.
        Nom 3, launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration, would provide atmospheric soundings and very-high-
    resolution, day-and-night cloud-cover imaging. Two communications
    satellites, Zntelsut-ZV F-7 for the International TelecommunicationsSatel-
    lite Organization and Anik 2 Canadian domestic comsat, were success-
    fully launched, as well as Nnss 0-20 Transit navigational satellite for
    the Navy.
        Erts 1, launched in mid-1972 as the first Earth Resources Technology
    Satellite, completed its 7000th photo-taking orbit of the earth, demon-
    strating the great potential of remote-sensing of the earthâ€™s resources by
    providing data for use throughout the world.
        All but one prime contractor for the space shuttle had been selected
    and design was proceeding on schedule. Most of the shuttle orbiter sub-
     contractors were lined up, with fabrication to begin in FY 1975. Nine
     nations in the European Space Research Organization agreed to build
     the Spacelab for a wide variety of applications as a shuttle payload.
     NASA and DOD made joint system studies for the space tug and tentative
     agreement was reached for DOD to develop an initial tug stage for the
     shuttle.
        The first two powered flights of the X-XB lifting body were success-
     fully made in the NASA and Air Force hypersonic aerospacecraft research
     program. NASA also vigorously pursued solutions to problems of aircraft
     noise, pollution, safety, and operational efficiency and technology for
     future-generation aircraft. Flight tests of NASAâ€™sdigital fly-by-wire ad-
     vanced flight control system indicated the system improved handling
     qualities of aircraft in all flight conditions, with the reduced aircraft
     weight increasing payload potential and reducing fuel consumption,
     The JT8D engine refan program progressed to scheduling ground tests
     for February 1974. The engine modifications-in 727, 737, and DC-9
     aircraft, models that made up 60% of the domestic commercial fleet-
     were expected to reduce areas affected by aircraft noise by 75%. A
     67% reduction in 727 aircraft landing noise was anticipated from a
     two-segment landing procedure being tested in the NASA and Federal
     Aviation Administration noise abatement program. Automobile engines
     were used to demonstrate an internal combustion concept for reducing
     pollution emissions while increasing engine efficiency for general-aviation
     aircraft. New flight research programs included the remotely piloted re-
     search vehicle project in which the pilot flew scale models from a
     ground-based cockpit, eliminating risk to the test pilot and reducing
     test-flight costs more than 50%.

      tions in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions of the electromagnetic
     spectrum ; and supported other programs. Rocket launches provided a

    reference for calibration of equipment on Skylabâ€™s Apollo Telescope
    Mount. Forty-nine balloons were flown for scientific research and for
    development of new technology for long-duration orbital missions.
       DODâ€™S year included further development and implementation of satel-
    lite communications and navigation systems, development of new mili-
    tary aircraft, and construction of advanced medium STOL prototypes.
       The U.S.S.R.â€™s record 86 launches topped 83 in 1971 and 74 in 1972.
    The 107 Soviet payloads included 85 Cosmos satellites, 2 Intercosmos,
    1 Luna, 2 Meteor, 1 Prognoz, 1 cooperative Soviet-French Oreol, 2
    manned Soyuz, 1 Salyut, 4 Mars probes, and 4 Molniya I and 4 Molniya
    I1 comsats. The Luna 21 probe landed the Lunokhod 2 self-propelled
    vehicle on the moon for lunar studies. Soyuz 12 carried two cosmonauts
    into orbit on a two-day mission in September, the first Soviet manned
    flight since 1971, and Soyuz 13 carried two cosmonauts on an eight-day
    mission in December. Spacecraft system tests and experiments were
    reported successful on both flights. (Pres Rpt 1974; NASA Release 73-

  NASAâ€™S 15th anniversary year-memorable     for advances in earth resources
    technology, aeronautics progress, expanded international cooperation in
    space, and increased promise for future manned and unmanned plane-
    tary exploration-boosted the US. space program from the spectacular
    orbit of Apollo lunar exploration to a steady program of extended serv-
    ice to science and mankind. Skylabâ€™s triumph heralded the approach
     of the shuttle era that would weld with the earth the vast regions of
    near-earth space, extending manâ€™s transportation system into regions
    beyond land, sea, and air. The newest Pioneer probes began penetration
    into the mysteries of outer planetary space.
        Budget restrictions in line with President Nixonâ€™s January $250-
    billion target for total Government spending slowed space shuttle man-
     power buildup, suspended work on the High Energy Astronomy
     Observatory, and required phase-out of communications satellite work
     and curtailment of work on nuclear propulsion. But Skylab, the space
     shuttle, the scheduled US.-U.S.S.R. 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
     mission, the Viking, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, and many
     applications and aeronautics projects were retained in a balanced and
     productive program.
        Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for the past seven
     years and member of the NASA staff since October 1958, retired at the
     end of the year. Dr. Newell had been Science Program Coordinator in
     the Nationâ€™s first satellite program, the Naval Research Laboratoryâ€™s
     Project Vanguard, before establishment of NASA.
        Tight funding and the near completion of the Skylab missions brought

      total to the required 24 970 ceiling.
         Aerospace industry employment in the Nation increased to 946 000 in
      June but declined to 935 000 by the yearâ€™s end.
         Techniques developed for aerospace activities were applied to earth-
      quake prediction, development of residential solar heating, and fuel-
      saving integrated systems for housing. NASA added 550 technical briefs
      to its more than 5000 technical innovations already available for U.S.
      industry use. More than 68 000 U.S. industrial and commercial firms
      requested additional data on these innovations. Some 3000 firms spent
      $625 000 for special assistance from NASAâ€™s     Regional Dissemination
      Ceaters; 1500 firms purchased 1891 computer programs and related
      documentation for $221 530. NASA liberalized its patent-licensing pro-
      cedures to speed technology transfer and during 1973 five exclusive
      patent licenses, the largest number since the programâ€™s inception, were
      granted. A NASA liaison office was opened in New York City to work
      directly with city agencies on public safety, drug detection, and fire
      prevention.
         A rechargeable heart pacemaker was developed under NASA auspices
      by the Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory. Electronic
      components designed for space use were incorporated in the device,
      which could be recharged at home by the patient, eliminating the need
      for surgery every two years to replace conventional devices. A new
      radio transmitter temperature pill allowed doctors to check localized
      internal body temperature changes. A portable visual testing device
      permitted early detection of eye disorders. A test hospital room for
      paralyzed patients used space-developed devices for remote operation of
      communications systems and appliances.
         The NASA FY 1974 appropriation of $3.002 billion was $13.9 million
      below the budget request, $62.4 million below the $3.0645-billion FY
       1973 authorization, and $406 million below the FY 1973 appropriation
      of $3.408 billion. (A&A 1972;A&A 1973;Aerospace, 2/74,6-11; NASA

*   In its program of international cooperation, NASA launched Anik 2 domes-
      tic communications satellite for Telesat Canada and Intelsat-IV F-7 for
       Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Tele-
       communications Satellite Organization.
          A significant milestone was the Intergovernmental Agreement on U.S.
       and European cooperation on Spacelab, signed by the U.S., Belgium,
       France, West Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. To be
       funded and developed by nine members of the European Space Re-
       search organization, the Spacelab would be carried into orbit by NASAâ€™s
       space shuttle orbiter and would accommodate experiments and per.
       sonnel on missions of 7 to 30 days.
          Notable progress was made in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, with the
      joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission on schedule for
       July 1975 launch. Working groups met in both countries and a Novem-
       ber Moscow meeting familiarized eight U.S. astronauts with the Soviet
       Soyuz spacecraft. Docking system designs were essentially completed
       and all hardware construction was on schedule. Joint dynamic testing
       of test units began at Johnson Space Center. Flight crews were selected
       in both countries.

       Eighty-three nations entered into Definitive Agreements for INTELSAT,
    permanently establishing the global communications satellite system
    envisioned in the US. Communications Satellite Act of 1962.
        Scientists from other nations cooperated in NASA studies ranging from
    investigations of the solar system to practical applications of space
    technology. Erts 1 and Skylab environment and resources data were
    used throughout the world. Scientists from 37 countries and the United
    Nations participated in Erts 1 experiments and Brazil and Canada
    established their own ERTS data-acquisition facilities. Four foreign ex-
    periments were carried on Skylab missions and foreign scientists par-
    ticipated in the Apollo solar telescope program and in correlated
    astronomy sounding rocket programs. Scientists in 19 countries and the
    U.N. participated in 40 Skylab data-analysis investigations.
        German and Australian scientists were coinvestigators for Pioneer 11
    experiments and French and U.K. scientists for Mariher 10. Investiga-
    tors from 40 nations and ESRO were selected to participate in the ApoZh
    17 lunar sample program. A joint working group of the U.S.S.R.
    Academy of Sciences and NASA held the third and fourth meetings an
    space biology and medicine, exchanging information on manned space
    flight.
        Parallel communications channels using Intelsat and Molniya comsat
    systems were planned for 1974 to support the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Direct
    Communications Link, with construction of earth stations in both
    countries for access to each otherâ€™s satellites,
        Work went forward for future cooperative satellite projects. Agree-
    ment was reached with Italy to fly San Marco G 2 in 1974. Negotiations
    were underway with West Germany for 1974 launch of the AEROS-B
    aeronomy satellite and work continued on the experimental CTS comsat
    to be launched with Canada, the HELIOS solar probe with Germany, the
    INTASAT ionospheric beacon with Spain, the UK-5 stellar x-ray satellite,
    Canadaâ€™s Anik Cy and U.K.â€™s X4 technology spacecraft.
        Negotiations were also underway on NASA launch services for the
    French-German Symphonie comsat in 1974 and two ESRO test comsats in
     1976 and 1977. The U.S. and ESRO were about to enter agreement for
    an air traffic control and navigation satellite system.
        During the year NASA launched 30 sounding rockets from ranges in
    other countries, including rockets carrying foreign payloads or coopera-
     tive experiments. New sounding rocket agreements were signed with
    Australia, Brazil, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

  A burgeoning worldwide energy shortage led President Nixon to propose
     in June the establishment of a Cabinet-level Dept. of Natural Resources,
     an Energy Research and Development Administration, and a Nuclear
     Energy Commission. The shortage reached crisis proportion with the
     embargo by Arab nations on oil shipments to the US. in retaliation for
     U.S. support to Israel during the October Arab-Israeli war.
        In a November speech President Nixon noted the U.S. was on the
     verge of â€œthe most acute shortage of energy since World War 11.â€ He
     called for reduced use of heat, electricity, and gasoline; announced
     Federal Government steps to lower energy consumption; asked the
     Atomic Energy Commission to accelerate licensing and constructing
     nuclear power plants; and asked for an emergency energy act.
        Nine energy bills, passed in rapid succession by the first session of

    the 93rd Congress, included authorizations for mandatory fuel alloca-
    tion programs, construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, a return to
    year-round daylight saving time, a speed limit on interstate highways,
    and the National Emergency Act. Soaring prices of all kinds of fuel,
    long lines of cars and banned Sunday sales at gas stations, and airline
    fare increases and schedule cutbacks marked closing months of the year.
       Economists forecast a possible depression as energy shortages ag-
    gravated an already recessed economy. Scientists sought additional
    sources of fossil fuels and, for the future, new sources of energy to
    make the U S . energy-autonomous. The focus turned to NASA and its
    pioneering expertise in the technologies of solar energy and develop-
    ment of hydrogen as a substitute for gasoline in automobiles and air-
    craft. At the yearâ€™s end pending legislation endorsed NASA cooperation
    with other appropriate agencies in solving the worldwide energy short-
    age and in providing the U S . with future sources of non-fossil-fuel
    energy. (A&A 1973; Library of Congress, Congr Research Service,

∞Aerospace industry sales increased to an estimated $24.9 billion, more
    than 10% above 1972â€™s $23.5 billion. Commercial aerospace sales
    increased 43.l%, to $5.8 billion, reflecting deliveries of wide-bodied
    transports, helicopters, and general-aviation aircraft. Major aerospace
    sales included $13.8 billion to the Dept. of Defense, up from $13.2
    billion; missile sales at $5.6 billion, up from $5.2 billion; and aircraft
    sales at $13.4 billion, up from $11.6 billion.
       Sales in the space area alone declined to $2.9 billion, from $3.0
    billion in 1972. Executive and utility aircraft sales increased from
    $558 million in 1972 to $826 million-up 48%. Units delivered in-
    creased 39.1%. Civilian helicopter sales increased from $90 million in
    1972 to $121 million in 1973, a gain of 48%.
       Aerospace export dollar value rose 27.6% because of two US. dollar
    devaluations, to a total of $4.9 billion; aerospace imports increased
    37.5% to $777 million. Aerospace industry profits were expected to
    increase by 2.7% of sales after taxes. The 1973 profit rate for all
    manufacturing industries was expected to be 4.6%. (Aerospace, 2/74, 3)
  US. scheduled airlines flew 161 billion passenger-miles carrying more
    than 200 million passengers, nearly 4 million tons of freight and express,
    and some 16 billion letters for the U S . Postal Service. The US. fleet
    of 2250 aircraft was composed primarily of jet aircraft, valued at over
    $12 billion. Air freight accounted for a record billion dollars of operat-
    ing revenue. Total operating revenue was just under $12 billion, but
    earnings, hard hit by rising fuel costs, were less than $200 million.

                   A CHRONICLE FOR 1973

   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard
C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Cone
gress. Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite
Situation Report compiled by the Operations Control Center at Goddard
Space Flight Center; and public information releases of the Department
of Defense, NASA, NOAA, and other agencies, as well as those of the Com-
munications Satellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public
Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, translations from the Tass News
Agency, statements in the Soviet press, and international news services
reports. Data on satellites of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public
Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, governmental announcements, and
international news services reports.
   This tabulation lists payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as probes,
ascended to at least the 6500-kilometer (4000-mile) altitude that tradi-
tionally has distinguished probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or (c) con-
veyed one or more human beings into space, whether orbit was attained
or not. Furthermore, only flights that have succeeded-or at least can be
shown by tracking data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe
or manned flight-are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at
the launch site. An asterisk by the date marks dates that are one day earlier
in this tabulation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean
Time. A double asterisk by the date marks dates of Soviet launches which are
a day later in this compilation than in listings which are referenced to
Greenwich Mean Time.
   World space activity increased slightly over last year. Total successful
launches increased-109 against 106 in 1972-as did total payloads orbited
-133 against 126 in 1972. The difference between launches and payloads
is of course accounted for by the multiple-payload launches (DOD, the prin-
cipal user of this system in the past, made 2 multiple launches in 1973,
 orbiting 5 payloads; NASA made none, for the first time since 1966; the
U.S.S.R. made 3 multiple launches, orbiting 8 satellites in each).
   Of the 1973 world total, the United States launched 23 boosters carrying
 26 payloads. In 1972 30 US. boosters launched 35 payloads. The U.S.
 booster total for 1973 also declined about 25 percent from the previous
 year, and both booster and payload totals were the lowest since 1960. Of
these 1973 totals, DOD was responsible for 10 launches and 13 payloads. Of
        13
NASAâ€™s launches, 4 were non-NASA missions-Anik 2 for Canada, Intelsat-

IV F-7    for ComSatCorp, Now 3 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and a navigation satellite, Nnss 0-20, for the Navy. The
Soviet Union once again far exceeded United States space totals, launching
107 payloads with 86 launches-both world records. It had launched 89
payloads with 74 launches in 1972.
   The year was dominated by the marathon flights of the US. Skylab
program. Each three-man crew exceeded the records and accomplishments
of the former, and the three separate flights that began in May 1973 and
ended in February 1974 proved that man could live and work in space for
extended periods. The final Skylab flight lasted a record 84 days and, to-
gether, nine U.S. astronauts lived in space for nearly six months.
   Pioneer 10, launched in March 1972, became manâ€™s first spacecraft to
reach Jupiter, passing 130 000 km (81 000 mi) from the planet on Dec. 3,
1973. A second Jupiter probe, Pioneer 11, was launched early in 1973 and
emerged undamaged from the Asteroid Belt March 20, 1974. It was scheduled
to pass Jupiter in December 1974 and to fly by Saturn in 1979. Mariner 10,
launched late in 1973, photographed Venus during a February 1974 flyby
and used that planetâ€™s gravity for a first-ever encounter with Mercury during
March 1974. NASA launched three different scientific satellites: Explorer 49
was placed in lunar orbit to investigate galactic and solar radio noise;
Explorer 50 monitored interplanetary radiation froin an orbit halfway be-
tween the earth and the moon; and Explorer 51â€™s highly elliptical orbit
allowed it to dip into the earthâ€˜s lower atmosphere for aeronomy investiga-
tions. The Department of Defense also placed two improved communications
satellites in synchronous orbit.
   The Soviet Union, in its most prolific year to date, resumed its manned
efforts and continued a program of scientific, interplanetary, and applica-
tions satellites-not all with success. Early in the year, its unmanned orbital
laboratory SuZyut 2 broke up after 10 days in earth orbit. A similar orbital
laboratory attempt a month later met with failure in orbit and was called
Cosmos 557. The two-day Soyuz 12 mission, carrying two cosmonauts, was
the first Soviet manned flight in more than two years and demonstrated
Soviet confidence in the redesigned Soyuz capsule. The December two-man
flight of Soyuz 13 lasted nearly eight days in an apparent test of the modified
Soyuz craft to be used for the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz docking mission. The
Soviets also sent four spacecraft toward Mars, two orbiters and two landers,
but only one orbiter performed properly upon arrival in February 1974.
Luna 21 landed successfully on the moon and deposited the unmanned
Lunokhd 2, which traveled 37 km (23 mi) over its surface. During 1973
the Soviets also launched eight communications satellites, two meteorological
satellites, and OreoZ2, a cooperative Soviet-French scientific satellite.
   This year was the first since 1969 that no third natioh launched a satellite
of its own.
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
 appendixes is never complete, because of printing time and the inescapable
lag behind each flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.
