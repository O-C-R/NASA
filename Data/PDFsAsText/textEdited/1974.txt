                              Foreword
    New technology in a rapidly advancing space age remains a challenge, but
this chronological collection of aeronautical and space events of 1974 shows
that the emphasis in technology has shifted from the problems of how to
operate in air and space to the practical use of those environments to meet
human needs.
    Of NASAâ€™s payloads launched during the year, 7 were operational
                 16
satellites, expected to produce profits for their owners. Three of the nine
experimental spacecraft were launched to develop technology for applica-
tions. Although the immediate use of technology was emphasized in 1974,â€™
NASA also looked to the future. A little more than a third-six spacecraft-
were launched for scientific investigations, an investment in tomorrow.
    Other nations and commercial interests increasingly joined us in efforts
to explore and use space. In NASAâ€™s total, 11 spacecraft were paid for
                                         1974
by non-NASA users; 10 were international. In addition, two Italian launches
used NASA launch vehicles.
    Operational satellites-all of whose costs, including launch costs, were paid
 for by others-included six for comunications, two of them the first US.
 domestic communications satellites and four for other nations or international
groups. And a new operational weather satellite joined the network that
reports data from pole to pole. Meanwhile, new technology for improved
services was pursued : NASA launched the first Synchronous Meteorological
Satellite, for continuous day-and-night weather monitoring, and orbited an
experimental communications satellite for France and West Germany.
   NASAâ€™s 6 Applications Technology Satellite demonstrated a new use
            Ats
for powerful communications satellites, transmitting educational courses
and health services to small low-cost receivers in remote areas. And remote
sensing by satellite and aircraft, though still experimental, found increasing
use around the globe for monitoring the earthâ€˜s geology, ecology, resources,
and pollution.
   NASA continued the systematic exdoration of the solar system and the
observation of the universe in 1974. Studies of the sun, the planets, and the
stars added to knowledge of atmospheric processes, geological formations,
energy sources, azd physical laws that affect the earth. The German-American
Helws I probed interplanetary space to within 45 million kilometers of the
sun, closer than any previous spacecraft had flown. Three planetary probes
launched in previous years gave us the first close look at Mercury, new clues
to the origin and evolution of Venus, and new information on the weather,
atmosphere, and radiation belts of Jupiter. Juoiter was found to be a ball
of liquid hydrogen, its great red spot a gigantic cluster of storms at least
400 years old. These Mariner and Pioneer probes were sweeping on toward
further planetary investigations even as preparations continued for future
probes to softland on Mars and to fly past Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. Scien-
tific satellites of the earth, sounding rockets, balloons, and aircraft were used
to study spectra of the stars, celestial x-ray and gammh ray sources, and the
                                       iii

earthâ€™s own atmosphere and magnetic field and interaction with the solar
wind.
   Manned space flight continued to demonstrate manâ€™s capability to live and
work in space. Skylab 4,manâ€™s longest mission to date, extended into 1974,
gathering data fox 84 days on his ability to work in space, his physiology,
the sun, and the earth. The Apollo-SoyuzTest Project neared readiness for its
mid-1975 US.-U.S.S.R. flight to test compatible docking systems and conduct
joint experiments in space. Development of the first true space transportation
system moved nearer its goal of a reusable space shuttle and reusable space
laboratory, as the shuttle reached test and fabrication stages and the European
Space Research Organization awarded the prime contract for its contribu-
tion, Spacelab, to be carried into orbit and back in the shuttle.
   Aeronautical research was reoriented, with more emphasis placed on re-
ducing both the amount of energy required for transportation and the pollu-
tion produced by transportation. NASA sought new solutions for the problem
of noise, pollution, and safety, while experimenting with alternate fuels and
composite materials. Flight tests began on a new general-aviation wing, the
GAW-1, the X-24B lifting body tested maneuverability and landing abili-
          and
ties of a vehicle designed for reentry from space.
   NASA made advances toward low-cost production of solar cells to convert
sunlight into electricity and demonstrated the use of solar energy to cool and
heat houses. Wind-driven electric generators and ways to reduce fuel con-
sumption and pollution by cars were other targets of research during the year.
   Thus this nation, in cooperation with others, turned capabilities that man
has never before possessed toward solution of todayâ€™s problems, while invest-
ing significant resources to increase our knowledge and technology so that in
future decades we will be in a better position to help meet humanityâ€™s cultural
and economicneeds.

                                Preface
   The 14th volume in the NASA series of day-by-day records of aeronautical
and space events has somewhat narrowed its scope and selectivity in its brief
accounts from immediately available, open sources. This year the emphasis
is even more directly focused on concrete air and space activities. More
coverage has, perforce, always been given the national space agencyâ€™s own
activities, plans, and achievements, and that is true of this volume, but the
text continues to reflect some events in other agencies and countries.
   The 1974 Chronology includes fewer examples of public comment and
reaction and less technical detail in more condensed summaries. New tech-
nological advances in other fields-such as medicine and ground and sea
transportation, except when related to NASAâ€™s    programs-have been dropped,
as have most death notices. Air and space highlights of the Presidentâ€™s budget
are given in tables in the text. The more routine notices of satellite launches,
when little information is available beyond the fact of launch, are now given
in Appendix A only, not in the text. Most sounding rocket launches and
lifting-body test flights also have been dropped from the text; two new
appendixes, Appendixes D and E, present the data in table format. Routine
missile and nuclear tests, defense contracts, and disarmament items are no
longer covered.
   Corrections for errors found in previous volumes of this series are carried
 on Errata pages following the index. This innovation will be continued in
later volumes.
   The sources, identified by abbreviations that are explained in Appendix F,
were those immediately available in NASA and other Government agencies, the
Congress, and the professional societies, as well as the press. Contradictory
accounts have been resolved and doubtful ones verified whenever possible by
 querying participants. Cross-references are given in the text, and the detailed
index will aid in tracing related events through the year. The index also
 serves as a glossary of acronyms and abbreviations.
    Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1974 was written by Nancy L. Brun of the
NASA History Office, with contributions from other staff members and the
History Office Summer Seminar. General editor of the volume was Frank W.
Anderson, Jr., Prtblications Manager of the Office, and technical editor was
 Carrie E. Karegeannes. Archivist Lee D. Saegesser collected and verified
 documentationand provided research assistance.
    The assistance of many persons throughout NASA and other Federal agencies
has contributed to reliability and comprehensiveness of the volume. Com-
ments, additions, and corrections are always welcomed by the NASA History
 Office.

1 January: Appointment of Gerald J. Mossinghoff as Assistant General Coun-
     sel of NASA became effective. Mossinghoff had been Deputy Assistant
     Administrator for Legislative Affairs since 1971, after earlier serving
     as Director of Legislative Liaison. He would continue to serve as Acting
     Deputy Assistant until a successor was appointed. (NASA Ann, 3 Jan 74;

  ∞Josef Boehm, rocket pioneer from Peenemuende, Germany, and Chief of
     Marshall Space Flight Centerâ€™s Electromechanical Engineering Div.,
     died at the age of 65. An associate professor of kinematics before join-
     ing Dr. Wernher von Braun in 1939 at the Rocket Research Center in
     Peenemuende, Boehm came to the United States in November 1945 with
     Dr. von Braun under US. contract. He was instrumental in designing
     and engineering the first US. spacecraft for the Army Ballistic Missile
     Agency, beginning with Explorer 1 (launched 31 Jan. 1958) , and con-
     tinued with MSFC after it was formed in 1960. He had a major role in
     developing the Skylab Workshopâ€™s Apollo Telescope Mount. (Marshall
     Star, 9 Jan 74,4; Huntsville Times, 1Jan 74)
2 January: Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and
     William R. Pogue, launched 16 Nov. 1973, discussed their changed
     attitudes during an inflight press conference held on their 48th day
     aboard the Orbital Workshop. Science Pilot Gibson said that from space
     â€œyou see the Earth as one unit, you see the Sun as a star, and you can see
                                    .
     all the other stars out there . . and just the number of possible com-
     binations . . . which could create life, . . . makes [life elsewhere in
     the universe] seem very much more likely.â€ Pogue said that the mission
     had had a great spiritual impact on him. â€œAt the beginning of the mis-
                                              ..
     sion, I tried to operate like a machine. .     Now Iâ€™m trying to operate
     as a human being within the limitations I possess.â€ Now he would â€œfeel
     much more inclined toward humanistic feeling toward other people.â€

4 January: Twenty-seven spacecraft on twenty-six vehicles-eleven for NASA
    and fifteen cost-reimbursable launches for other organizations-were
    scheduled for launch by NASA during 1974. For the first time, NASA
    would launch more spacecraft for other organizations than for itself.
        Included in the NASA launches were two Synchronous Meteorological
    Satellites (SMS) to be launched in cooperation with the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration; a proof flight of the Titamcentaur
     booster carrying a mass model o Viking spacecraft and a Space Plasma

∞Goddard Space Flight Center launched an Aerobee 200 sounding rocket
    from White Sands Missile Range to study Comet Kohoutekâ€™s ultraviolet
    rays. The rocket carried cameras, spectrometers, and other instruments
    to 232.6-km altitude to determine amounts of oxygen, hydrogen, and
    carbon dioxide in the comet. The flight was â€œhighly successful,â€ Dr.
     Stephen P. Maran, GSFC Manager of Operation Kohoutek, said.
        The comet, discovered 5 May 1973 by Czechoslovak astronomer Dr.
     Lubos Kohoutek, was once predicted to be the â€œcomet of the centuryâ€
     as it passed near the earth on its 75 000-yr journey around the sun. It
     was only twice as bright as nearby stars but reflected enough light to
     permit instruments to be aimed at it precisely. (Maran, interview, July

     after passing within 130 000 km of the giant planet 3 Dec. 1973 on a
     course that would carry it past Pluto and out of the solar system in 1987.
    Pioneer 11, launched 5 April 1973, had been in flight across the Asteroid
     Belt since August 1973, on its way toward a Jupiter encounter in Decem-
    ber 1974. (KSC ReIease 2-74)
∞The Shuttle Avionic Integration Laboratory (SAIL) was being established
     at Johnson Space Center to provide a central facility for testing and

     ment for the space shuttle. Testing in SAIL would provide information
     on system operation before each major step in the shuttle flight tests.

∞North American Air Defense Commandâ€™s count of objects in orbit
     around the earth totaled 624 payloads and 2349 pieces of debris, left

     rate of one piece a day, but NORADâ€™S tracking and impact prediction pro-
     gram analyzed the decay trajectory of each satellite that might survive
     reentry and predicted the time and area of impact, issuing warnings if
     any were deemed hazardous. Most returning objects were burned up by
     friction heat on reentry and most of the rest fell into oceans and seas. To
     date, the only fatality caused by space debris was a cow killed nearly
     13 yrs ago when an 88-kg chunk of metal from a US. space probe struck
     the earth near a Cuban village.
         Eventually, however, increasing space debris and reentries might
     require traffic control assistance for supersonic aircraft and spacecraft.

        The scientific brains that have gone into the Pioneer project are one of
     Americaâ€™s greatest resources. They underwrite the technological-
     scientific lead that is perhaps this countryâ€™s greatest asset. The momen-
     tum must be maintained if our rivals-the Russians, the Germans, the
     Japanese-are not to pass us.â€™â€™ (B Sun, 4 Jan 74)
6 January: The Aerospace Industries Assn. of America, Inc., predicted â€œa
     slight declineâ€ in sales in 1974 after a jump of more than 10% in 1973,
     the New York Times reported. Industry sales were expected to total $24.7
     billion in 1974, 1%lower than the 1973 boom that had pulled the
     industry out of a five-year slump. AIA President Karl G. Harr, Jr., had
     said, however, that the energy crisis could bring a greater decline. Fuel
     shortages already had softened markets for commercial aircraft, and
     jet transport orders could taper off, although the Department of Defense
     was beginning a new generation of tactical and strategic weapons.
         Aerospace industry business with the space program was expected to
     continue its five-year decline, dropping by about 2.7% to sales of $2.3
     billion in 1974.
         Profits of the industry had risen in 1973, to an average of 2.7% of
     sales after taxes, but employment dropped 1%to 935000 persons in
     1973, and was expected to fall to 915 000 in 1974. (Finney, NYT, 6 Jan
     74)
7 January: A 5-million-km hydrogen cloud surrounding Comet Kohoutek
    was photographed by a Naval Research Laboratory camera aboard a
    NASA Aerobee 200 sounding rocket. The rocket, launched from White
     Sands Missile Range, reached an altitude of 193.1 km. The image of the
    cloud, invisible from the earth because it glowed at an ultraviolet wave-
    length that. did not penetrate the atmosphere, was obtained by photo-

    New York City at 2:40 pm EDT. Within minutes, conversations were
    relayed by Canadaâ€™s Anik 2 satellite (launched by NASA 20 April 1973)

    exchanged congratulations.
       Operated by RCA Global Communications, Inc., and RCA Alaska Com-
    munications, Inc., for the parent RCA Corp., the system used earth relay
    stations near New York, San Francisco, Juneau, and Anchorage. These
    were to be joined by others in 1976, when RCA hoped to have three satel-
    lites of its own. Transmission charges for coast-to-coast messages were
    less via satellite than by earthbound systems; a telephone circuit rented
    for $1700 a month rather than the $2298 charged by American Tele-
    phone & Telegraph Co. for a similar land-based private circuit. Quality
    also was better because a connection could be completed with fewer relay
    points, one relay to the satellite and another from the satellite to the

  ∞The Library of Congress Congressional Research Service published United
    States and Soviet Progress in Space: Summary Data through 1972 and
    a Forward Look (74--35SP), prepared by DT. Charles S. Sheldon 11,
    Chief of the Science Policy Research Div. In its manned program the
    U.S.S.R. had launched a Salyut 2 space station 3 April 1973 but a
    failure-possibly a wildly firing thruster-had damaged the station,
    which reentered the earthâ€™s atmosphere May 28. Other later attempts
    to launch and man a space station also appeared to have failed. Two
    manned launches, Soyuz 12 and Soyuz 13, had been successful in Sep-
    tember and December, the second spacecraft remaining in space eight
    days to conduct astrophysical, biological, and earth resources experi-
    ments.
        By 30 June 1974 the United States expected to have spent $75 biIlion
     on combined military and civilian space programs since the beginning
     of the space program, spending about $4.7 billion in FY 1974. The
     Soviet Union did not publish space budget data, but its program was
     thought to be â€œat least of the same magnitude as that of the United States
     at its former peakâ€ of $7.7 billion a year.
        The U.S. had several major space research and development centers
     operated by the military and private industry as well as NASA. There was
     no reason to believe the Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped
     but missiles of similar capabilities and different design philosophies
     which had appeared in Moscow parades â€œsuggest the existence of more
     than one design and development team for space work.â€
        The US. had launch vehicles scaled to lift payloads weighing from
     9 kg to 136000 kg. The Soviet Union had started to use in 1957 its
     original intercontinental ballistic missile and still used the same basic
     vehicle with stages added to improve performance. The very large Soviet
     vehicle predicted by NASA officials had not been seen.

        A Soviet lunar landing did not seem imminent but was still expected,
     as part of Soviet long-range plans, as soon as the problems of unreliable
     hardware were solved. US.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space efforts was
     â€œthe hope of well-intentioned people everywhere.â€ Two motives for
     cooperation were to lessen tension and to save money. Although there
     was already exchange of information between scientists and engineers,
     66
       no assessment of the overall prospects can be made successfully without
     forecasting the future political climate.â€ (Text)
8-31 January: NASAâ€™s      Mariner 10 probe, launched 3 Nov. 1973, met a num-
     ber of problems but continued its flight miIIions of kilometers from the
     earth toward a 5 Feb. flyby of Venus and 29 March flyby of Mercury.
        Despite the loss of the prime power chain, causing automatic transfer
     to the backup system, Mariner 10â€™s instruments continued scientific
     studies. Comet Kohoutekâ€™s taiI was observed in the extreme ultraviolet
     range. On 13 Jan. hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensity, beginning 20â€ from
     the cometâ€™s nucleus, climbed rapidly as the nucleus region drifted toward
     the uv airglow spectrometerâ€™s field of view. The nucleus was scanned
     16 Jan.
        On 17 Jan., while the spacecraft was powered down for its second
     trajectory correction maneuver, shutting off several instrument heaters
     allowed the TV optics heaters, which had failed to function earlier, to
     turn on. Scientists had feared that below-freezingtemperature might pre-
     vent camera operation during the Venus encounter. On 21 Jan., instru-
     ments for Comet Kohoutek and solar wind experiments were turned on.
        On 22 Jan. the uv spectrometer measured hydrogen Lyman-alpha in-
     tensities out to 17â€ to map the cometâ€™s hydrogen cloud. Comet Kohoutek
     was scanned seven hours 24 Jan. by the UY spectrometer-the only instru-
     ment of its kind to observe the comet from outside the earthâ€™s own
     hydrogen cloud.
        During the seventh and final roll calibration maneuver 28 Jan., telem-
    etry indicated a rapid increase in the use of attitude control gas, the
     nitrogen gas supply dropping from 2.7 to 2.1 kg. The gyros were turned
     off and the spacecraft put into celestial control, with the SUR and the star
     Canopus as references. Nitrogen-gas-use rate returned to normal and
     estimates of the supply indicated a comfortable margin for reaching
     Mercury and executing experiments. The backup electric power system
     was still in use, as studies of that problem continued.
        On 31 Jan. Mariner 10 was 3 200 000 km from Venus and 38 800 000
     km from the earth, traveling at 30 238 km per hr. (JPL Mariner Venus/

11 January: Solar energy would be used by Marshall Space Flight Center
     engineers to heat and cool three house trailers parked together to simulate
     a residence. The system would take from the sun three fourths of the
     thermal energy needed for the simulated living quarters and furnish
     2.7 metric tons of air conditioning in the summer and 20.5 kw of heat
     during winter, with surplus energy in storage for operation at night
     and through three cloudy days. A conventional system would still be
     necessary to make up for undercapacity and provide energy during ex-
     tended cloudy periods.
        The system, a project sponsored by the NASA Office of Applications
     to develop solar energy technology, would use a 120-sq-msolar-collector
      roof, a storage tank, pumps, coils, a modified air conditioner, plumbing,
     an auxiliary heater, and automatic controls. (MSFC Release 74-6)
  ∞The National Science Foundation was spending more than $1 million in
     FY 1974 on wind research programs and to build a large windmill, the
      Wall Street Journal reported. Wmdmills, for thousands of years one
     of manâ€™s basic machines, were again being taken very seriously in
     the worldwide energy crisis. Researchers believed windmills could be
     grouped to form power stations and provide a significant portion of
     U.S. energy needs, becoming com etitive with other energy sources. The

     NASA team would look into methods of storing electricity for periods
      when the wind was not blowing and of generating current at a constant
      60 cps, the rate all large appliances were designed to use. Other re-
      searchers were working on windmill complexes based at sea, where

    vestigating the October 1973 dismissal of a NASA official, Mrs. Ruth Bates
    Harris, after she and two coauthors asserted in a report that the agency
    was not moving fast enough to hire women and minority workers and
                  proportion of minority employees was the lowest in the

∞Hazard analyses and quality control techniques developed by NASA in the
     Apollo program would improve the reliability of safety and antipollu-
     tion equipment used in the offshore drilling of oil wells, NASA announced.
     At the request of the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA teams at Marshall
     Space Flight Center, the Mississippi Test Facility, and the Michoud
     Assembly Facility had recommended development of subsurface safety
     valves, activated either automatically after sensing increased velocity in
     the oil line or by remote control from a surface location, to protect the
     marine and coastal environment. (NASA Release 7 6 1 0 )
∞Development of a two-man version of the F-5E International Fighter had
     been initiated by the Air Force, the Air Force Systems Command an-
     nounced. Designated the F-5F and to be built by Northrop Corp., the
     two-seater would have the same performance and weapon capability as
     the single-seat F-5E but was to provide the capability of training fighter
     pilots in all aspects of fighter aircraft operations. The first test aircraft
     was expected to fly in September 1974. (AFSC Release OIP 002.74)

      Service quoted Lockheedâ€™s Chairman of the Board Daniel J. Haughton
      as saying in a London news conference. Haughton had expressed con-
      fidence that Lockheedâ€™s bankers would provide the necessary funds. In
      addition he had expected that a long-term solution-possibly a merger-
      would be found by June. Lockheedâ€™s financial problems had begun with
      severe technical setbacks during development of the L-loll TriStar

 22 January: The U.S.S.R. proposed that the United Nations establish a center
      for collection and distribution of data from earth-orbiting satellites. The
      proposal was made in response to a U.S. offer to supply the U.N. with a
      master copy of all information obtained from Erts I Earth Resources
      Technology Satellite, launched 23 July 1972, if a facility would be avail-
      able to process the data. The Soviet proposal suggested a single interna-
      tional center, under the U.N. or another international organization and
      financed by voluntary contributions. The U.S.S.R. previously had been
      unwilling to bring in any international authority. U.S. space experts
      later suggested the new proposal was a significant development in closer
      Soviet-US. cooperation, reached by the scientific exchanges between the
      two countries. Another view was that the U.S.S.R. was trying to head off

23 January: President Nixon transmitted a message to Congress outlining
    legislative proposals and executive actions to deal with the energy crisis.
    Proposals to meet the short-term emergency included a special act to per-
    mit restrictions on public consumption of energy and temporarily relax
    pollution control requirements for power plants and automotive emis-
    sions, a windfall profits tax to prevent private profiteering at public
    expense, unemployment insurance to help those who lost their jobs
    because of the energy crisis, and establishment of a Federal Energy Ad-
    ministration. To meet the long-range goal of energy self-sufficiency,pro-
    posals would allow market pricing of new natural gas, permit surface
    mining of coal in an environmentally safe manner, permit development
    of deepwater port facilities o f shore, eliminate depletion allowances for
                                   f
    foreign oil and gas production, and accelerate licensing of construction
     of nuclear facilities.
        The President concluded that, although shortages had been long in
     appearing, the oil embargo-imposed on the US. by the Arab oil pro-
     ducing countries because of American support of Israel during the Octo-
    ber 1973 war-â€œopened our eyes to the short-sighted policy we had
    been pursuing.â€ The US. must never again allow itself to be overly
     dependent on foreign supplies of a vital good. â€œBy 1980. . . I believe we

           equal employment opportunity program was reviewed during a
∞NASAâ€™s

     hearing before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sci-
     ences. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said that during
     the 1970s NASA faced the challenge of catching up in a most important
     area of human need. The challenge would be diflicult because the NASA
     work force had decreased by nearly one third. In addition, 47% of the
    NASA work force were scientists and engineers. Of these, 3.4% were
     minorities, while the nationwide percentage of minorities in this cate-
     gory was 3.596, and these persons were in high demand in private
     industry, where starting salaries were $1200 to $1700 per year higher.
        Dr. Dudley G. McConnell, NASA Assistant Administrator for Equal
     Opportunity Programs, said NASA would during 1974 achieve a minority
     complement of 6.1% of the total permanent work force, hiring 80

     tion NASA would help increase the availability of technically trained
     women and minority members by NASAâ€™s       cooperative education program
      and by initiating an aerospace fellowship program.
        Mrs. Ruth Bates Harris, former NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator
     for Equal Opportunity Programs, testified that NASA had turned away
     qualified women and minority applicants. She said NASA ranked 22 out
     of 26 agencies in percentage of female attorneys. Also, although NASA
     had a 47% scientific and engineering work force, in the 53% non-
      scientific and technical category NASA had a 3.7% minority participa-
     tion, not significantly better than the 3.6% in the scientific and engi-

       changes in solar wind dynamic pressure. The thermal structure of Jupiter
       was found to be closely related to the visual appearance of the planet, with
      illuminated and nonilluminated sides having the same brightness tem-
       peratures. The net thermal energy of the planet was twice the solar

     earthâ€™s, Venus should also have similar temperature, but the temperature
    had been found to be very high, 755 K (900OF). And the atmosphere
     was 100 times denser than the earthâ€™s, in one theory acting as a blanket,
    absorbing the radiation that tried to leave the surface and giving a
    <<
      greenhouse effect.â€ Further, the Venus atmosphere had been deter-
    mined by measurements from the earth and by U.S.S.R. spacecraft to
    be mostly carbon dioxide.
        Chief questions were: Why such a high temperature? Why such a
     heavy atmosphere? Why did the earth get all the liquid water and on
    Venus everything stayed in the atmosphere? The earth had life because
     it had oceans. Why did it happen on earth and why did it not happen
     on Venus? And what could happen to the earth if pollution or other
    causes should increase its temperature? â€œHow much increase in tem-
    perature do you need to have the whole thing go this way, and you
    become like Venus, not next week, but [in] millions of years. Is a
    process like that feasible at all on the earth?â€ (Transcript)
∞Chairman Don Fuqua (D-ma.) and members of the Subcommittee on
    Manned Space Flight of the House Committee on Science and Astro-

    contract to $36 467 389, provided for prelaunch, launch, and postlaunch

During January: A 65% noise reduction during l p d i n g had been demon-
    strated by 38 United Air Lines, Inc., flight crews in a n in-service evalua-
    tion of a NASA-developed landing technique under visual and instrument
    flight conditions, NASA announced. Using the NASA technique, a Boeing
    727 aircraft approaching on a two-segment path exposed only a 50-sq-km
    area to greater than 90 effective perceived decibels of noise. The program
    was closely coordinated with the Department of Transportation, the
    Federal Aviation Administration, and the Environmental Protection
    Agency. Program guidance was provided by a Panel on Noise Abate-
    ment Flight Procedures with members from FAA, DOT, aircraft and avi-
    onics manufacturers, airlines, and pilotsâ€™ associations. (NASA Aeronautics

 ∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in his article â€œAre Skylab
    and the Space Shuttle Worth the Investment?â€ in Government Executive
    that everything done in the Skylab program-with total runout costs
    of $2.6 billion through FY 1974chad been necessary for future progress
    in space. He believed the Skylab team had â€œtaken another giant leap
    for mankind comparable to the first step upon the Moon or the first
    satellite in Earth orbit.â€
        And even if the shuttle were not expected to save $1 billion a year in
    launch and payload costs, as it was-after        an $S-billion 1972-1991
    investment-the US. â€œshould still build it. We cannot run Spaceship
    Earth without it.â€ We could not â€œbegin to think of obtaining solar power
     from collectors in space without the Shuttle; we cannot hope to unlock
     the still hidden energy secrets of the Sun and stars without improved
    space observatories launched by the Shuttle; we cannot hope to develop
    the tools for management of natural resources and protection of our
    environment on a global scale without manned and unmanned Earth
    observatories launched and serviced by the advantages of a â€˜hydrogen
    economyâ€™ in the future unless we are willing to support such important
     steps toward that future as a hydrogen-fueled Shuttle. In short, there is
     no new frontier in space for America and mankind without the Shuttle.â€

1 February: Selection of Hughes Aircraft co. for negotiation of a cost-plus-
    award-fee contract for continuing design of the Pioneer Venus spacecraft
    system was announced by NASA. Proposed cost of design work was $3
    million, with an option for final design, development, fabrication, and
    testing of two flight spacecraft and launch support at $55 million. Two
    Pioneer Venus missions, planned for 1978, would launch one spacecraft
    to orbit Venus, transmitting data for nearly eight months, and another
    to explore the planetâ€™s atmosphere down to the surface by ejecting four
    probes transmitting data during their hour-long descent. (NASA Release

∞A $24 475 000 cost-plus-award-fee contract extension awarded to Boeing
    Co. for support services at Kennedy Space Center became effective. Serv-
    ices included test support management, plant engineering and mainte-
    nance, supply and transportation operations, security services, and fire
    protection and rescue through 31 Jan. 1975, bringing the total contract
    amount to an estimated $98 952 758. (KSC Release 21-74)
1-2 February: Congressmen and staff of the House Committee on Science and

2 February: The US. exported a record $5.125 billion worth of aerospace
    equipment during 1973 according to Dept. of Commerce figures, the
    Aerospace Industries Associati9n of America announced. Aerospace ex-
    ports were 6.4% of total US. exports and had increased 34.1% over
    1972. Much of the increase was from exports of complete aircraft, which
    totaled $3.096 billion in 1973, up from $2.028 billion in 1972. (MA
    Release 74-3)
∞Four US. schools would be heated by solar power in a National Science
    Foundation project, the Washington Post reported. The project would
    evaluate solar energy systems in practical situations. All four systems-
    in Osseo, Minn.; Boston, Mass.; Baltimore, Md.; and Warrenton, Va.-
    would augment rather than replace the existing heating systems. The
    system in the Warrenton school was expected to cut heating costs in the
    five affected classrooms from $1600 to $10 a year. Built by InterTech-
    nology Corp. under a $173 000 NSF contract, the Warrenton system con-
    sisted of a 230-sq-mglass, plastic, and coated metal solar collector through
    which ran 1-cm pipes. Water heated in the pipes was pumped from the
    collector into underground storage tanks and from there into conven-
    tional hot water radiators. The tanks would provide heat through five
    straight sunless days. The only outside energy required would be elec-
    tricity to run the pumps, less than 1% of that re-wired to power a base-
    board system. (Ringle, W Post, 2 Feb 74, D5)

4 February: President Nixon, in his message transmitting the U.S. budget
    for FY 1975 to Congress, said the budget emphasized fiscal balance and
     continued â€œmoderate restraintâ€ on the economy to curb inflation, a strong
     defense force, a comprehensiveenergy program to â€œreestablish our ability
     to be self-su5cient in energy,â€ the â€œNew Federalism philosophy of
     strengthening the role of State and local governments,â€ and a â€œmore in-
     tensive focus on the tangible results that programs achieve.â€
         The $304.4-billion budget proposed an increase for defense from $79.5
     billion in N 1974 to $853 billion, â€œso that we can increase our defense
     preparedness and preserve present force levels in the face of rising costs.â€
     Despite dollar increases caused by rising costs and by pay raises accom-
     panying transition to an all-volunteer armed force, the President said,
     the proportion of defense costs to the total budget had fallen from 44%
     in 1969 to an estimated 29% in 1975, after the end of US. combat in
    Vietnam.
         Project Independence, to reestablish US. self-sufficiency in energy,
     would require about $10 billion for accelerated energy research and
     development over the next five years and would encourage an even larger
    private R&D investment. Higher prices would be necessary to stimulate
     development of fuel supplies, but the emergency windfall profits tax
     had been proposed to curb excessive profits. The national energy policy
    included reorganization of Federal administrative machinery, stringent
    energy conservation measures, mandatory allocation of petroleum prod-
    ucts, mandatory reporting on oil production and inventories, moderniza-
    tion of railroad regulations, accelerated development of domestic oil
     and gas reserves, increased use of coal reserves, deveIopment of a fast-
     breeder nuclear reactor, faster approval of energy facility sites, faster
     construction of nuclear power plants, and increased research into ad-
    vanced energy sources, including fusion power and geothermal and solar
    energy.
         Shortages of clean fuels would mean â€œsome temporary variances from
     air quality plansâ€ would be necessary to meet high-priority energy needs.
     cc
        The progress we have made in pollution control in recent years, how-
    ever, along with reductions in energy consumption, should insure that
    overall air quality will continue to improve.â€ (CR, 4 Feb 74, H407-14;
    PD,11Feb 74,161-70)
∞President Nixon sent a $304A-billion FY 1975 US. budget request to
    Congress, an increase of $29.8 billion over N 1974. With 90% of the
    increase mandatory under existing law, the budget included few new
    programs and few cuts. Federal funds for research and development
    would increase by 9% from N 1974, to $19.8 billion total obligations,
    < C reflecting recognition of the larger potential contribution of science

     and technology to the solution of critical national problem.â€ A substan-
                                                      $2.05 billion in N 1975
    tial increase was requested for energy R ~ D ,
    from $942 million in FY 1974.
         The N 1975 R ~ D     request proposed investment in priority national
    needs, but included basic research as well as efforts to speed the use of
    federally sponsored R ~ D .The non-Federal investment in R ~ D      was ex-
    pected to be $16 billion, 45% of a national total of $36 billion.
                 total budget request of $3.247 billion was $245 million above
         NASAâ€™s
    the FY 1974 appropriation and $96.2 million above the 1974 budget
    plan. If approved, the increase would be NASAâ€™s since 1965, except
                                                         first

    budget request of $467.1 million, a $77.8-million increase, included
    space and environmental programs.
       The Federal Aviation Administration requested $845.4 million within
    a Department of Transportation total of $2.2 billion. Although the DOT
    total was a decrease from FY 1974, it included an increase for R&D.
      The Atomic Energy Commissionâ€™s $3.06-billion request included a
    30% increase in energy activities and more funds for civilian efforts than
    for defense for the first time.

 ∞Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the budget statement
   he had given at a 2 Feb. press briefing. The FY 1975 NASA budget plan
   for new authorization of $3.247 billion and spending of $3.273 billion,
   although a â€œconstrained budget,â€ would carry forward the programs
   planned in N 1974. Goals and major programs were the same, with
   three new projects in space science and applications, but the space shuttle
   had been slipped four to six months.
       NASAâ€™sY 1974 budget had â€œreflected a sharp temporary reduction,
              F
                                                  ..   . , below the $3.4 bil-
   because of Government-wide fiscal problems
   lion level previously planned as the long-term level.â€ Increases in FY
   1975 and later years were therefore â€œin order to approach again the
                                    .
   level required to maintain . . advances in space and aeronautics
   for the rest of the decade.â€ The FY 1975 increase of LLabout     $100 mil-
   lion,â€ however, was less than required to return to NASAâ€™s   complete pro-
   gram as planned, and adjustments had been necessary. Principally, the
    first manned orbital flight of the shuttle was rescheduled to the second
   quarter of 1979, instead of the end of 1978, but NASA had a â€œfirm com-
   mitment nowâ€ that there would be no more slips for budgetary reasons,
   and none was expected for technical reasons. NASA Comptroller Wil-
   liam E. Lilly said at the briefing the stretchout was expected to increase
   shuttle costs about $50 million â€œin 1971 dollars.â€ The $800 million re-
   quested for the shuttle was $89 million less than NASA had submitted to
   the Office of Management and Budget.
       In the three new space flight projects, Pioneer Venus had top scien-
   tific priority as the next step in planetary exploration. Two missions
    launched in 1978 would study the Venus atmosphere for a better under-
   standing of that planet and of the earthâ€™s atmosphere, meteorology, and
   climatology.
       In the second new start, SEASAT, an experimental applications satel-
   lite, would measure ocean characteristics to aid scientific understanding
    of ocean dynamics and determine if a forecasting system could be
   developed. SEASAT-A was to be launched in 1978. The third start, the
   Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) , would launch an Explorer
   satellite in 1977 to make thermal measurements of the earthâ€™s surface
   to help find mineral resources and potential geothermal energy sources
    and to discriminate rock structures for planning civil works such as
   highways.
       NASA was asking $6 million to build the worldâ€™s first large infrared
    telescope, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, for planetary research to complement
   planetary space flights, especially to provide data for the 1977 launch
   of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probe.
       Another new thrust, still in the planning stage, was the Tracking and
    Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) ,to return the large amounts of data
   expected from the shuttle in the 1980s and permit phase-out of some
   tracking stations. NASA would not develop the spacecraft for the TDRSS
    but would lease satellite services from a private organization, beginning
   in CY 1979.

       Analysis of data from the Skylab missions that were ending with the
    8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4 would continue for many years. Apollo-
    Soyuz Test Project joint engineering and training activities with the
    U.S.S.R. were on schedule. All shuttle hardware prime contractors and
    most subcontractors had been selected, and the Dept. of Defense ten-
    tatively planned to modify an existing upper stage for use as an interim
    space tug with the shuttle. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, was still work-
    ing well, exceeding its design life by more than six months. ERTS-B,
    previously planned for 1976 launch, had been moved to 1975. Amumber
    of NASA and 11 commercial applications launches were scheduled during
    the year. A nominal communications satellite research program would be
    continued. In space astronomy, OSO-I was scheduled for 1975 and the
    HEAO series would be resumed, with launches planned for 1977, 1978,
    and 1979. Astronautics programs would continue to develop technology
    to improve fuel economy, reduce noise, and improve performance of
    U.S.-built civil transport aircraft.
               Civil Service employment was to be stabilized at the end of.

    introduced 19 Sept. 1973 to authorize NASA research toward develop-
    ment of economical, energy-conservingsystems with clean emissions and
    improved performance. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Adminis-
    trator, testified 4 Feb. that Lewis Research Center was testing EPAâ€™S
    experimental engine, under a June 1973 agreement with EPA on work
    toward a low-pollution gas-turbine-powered vehicle. Upgraded engine
    work would be completed by mid-1975 and vehicle performance eval-
    uation before the end of CY 1975. First results of Jet Propulsion Labo-
    ratory investigations of hydrogen injection into fuel to improve effici-
    ency and reduce pollution in conventional automobile engines promised
    achievement of 1977 Federal emission standards with 25% improve-
    ment in fuel economy.

       L ~ R CDirector Bruce T. Lundin testified that, in addition to the gas
    turbine engine, a broader, longer range, advanced technology program
    was under way, with 13 industry contracts for such improvements as
    a low-emission combustor, higher-temperature heat exchangers, lower-
    cost turbine discs, turbine wheel cooling, and low-cost fuel controls.
    Dr. William H. Pickering, JPL Director, reported a test automobile using
    bottled gas to inject hydrogen into the fuel had already met the carbon
    monoxide emission standard and had almost met the nitrogen oxide
    standard, although the hydrocarbon emissions remained a problem.
    With engine modifications to produce hydrogen from gasoline, instead
    of using bottled gas, performance per gallon of fuel was expected to
    improve 25% over the conventional engine. (Transcript)
4-8 February: The first meeting of the International Telecommunications
    Satellite Organizationâ€™s Assembly of Parties was held in Washington,
    D.C. Seventy-two of the eighty-four member governments were rep-
    resented. Raymond J. Waldmann (US.) was elected Chairman and
    Dr. Osama Anani (Jordan) was elected Deputy Chairman. Elected as
    Vice-chairmen were Ambassador Alejandro Orfila (Argentina) , Am-
    bassador Adolfo Alessandrini ( Italy) , Ambassador Leonard 0. Kibinge
     (Kenya), and Ambassador Motoo Ogiso (Japan).
       The Assembly of Parties found that the proposed US.Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and maritime satellite sys-
    tem would not interfere with the INTELSAT system. GOES was technically
    compatible with the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital
    space by the existing or planned satellites. The maritime satellite system
    would not prejudice direct satellite telecommunication links. The As-
    sembly refused a United Nations request for free use of INTELSAT
    satellites, although a priority access arrangement, for periods not ex-
    ceeding 90 days during an emergency, would be worked out. (INTELSAT

5-22 February: Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, passed within 5800 km of
    Venus-within 15 km of the planned aim point-at 1:Ol pm EDT 5 Feb.
    The encounter sequence was accomplished according to plan and data
    were transmitted over the 45 million km between the earth and Venus
    at a rate of 117.6 kilobits per sec. Excellent ultraviolet cloud-structure
    pictures and new data on particle environment and mass, density, and
    shape of the planet were returned.
       Because Mariner 10 approached Venus on the dark side, the TV
    sequence was not begun until shortly before the encounter, at 12:21 pm
    EDT. The spacecraft flew behind Venus at 1:07 pm EDT for 20 min; TV
    signals were stored on tape and recovered without difficulty after Mariner
    10 emerged from the occultation zone. During occultation, the space-
    craftâ€™s radio antenna was aimed toward the edge of the planet so that the
    radio signals were bent around Venus by the extremely dense atmosphere
    and sent on to the earth.
       All science instruments functioned normally except the scanning elec-
    trostatic analyzer. The TV sequence was completed 13 Feb. after some
    4165 pictures were returned to the earth. During the flyby, the 503-kg
    spacecraft used the gravitational field of Venus to slow its speed and direct
    the flight path toward a 29 March encounter with Mercury. By 22 Feb.
    Mariner IO-its speed increasing as it came nearer the sun-was travel-
    ing 3 million km per day toward the planet.

         Preliminary science results were presented at a press briefing 7 Feb.
      at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Herbert S. Bridge, Massachusetts In-
      stitute of Technology scientist, said the solar wind was interacting with
      the ionosphere of Venus, producing a magnetic tail that could be detected
      as a modified plasma flow as far out from the planet as 500 Venus radii.
      Dr. James A. Dunne, Mariner project scientist, said the magnetic field
      doubled just before radio occultation but that no evidence of an intrinsic
      planetary magnetic field was found. Preliminary radio science results
      indicated that Venus was very round, 100 times less obIate than the
      earth, and confirmed that Venus had a dayside ionosphere. The mass of
      the planet was slightly less than that derived from previous data. Hy-
      drogen was a major element of the Venus cloud deck, ppssibIy present in
      droplets of sulfuric acid as well as water vapor. Marzner 10 found no
      evidence of deuterium on the planet, indicating that the hydrogen had
      originated from the solar wind. Helium, carbon, and atomic oxygen were
      found in the atmosphere, with possible traces of argon and neon. Outer
      atmosphere temperature of 590 K (600â€™F) was suggested.
         TV data indicated a uniform main cloud deck with three or four layers
      and a stratified haze layer. TV pictures in uv showed a classical â€œYâ€
      feature that originated in the equatorial region and spiraled toward the
      pole. Clear circulation patterns could be seen at the poles, caused by rising
      gas transporting excess solar heat from the equatorial zone by convection.
      The atmosphere was smooth, with no swirling storms. (NASA MOR, 1            1

5 February: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented NASAâ€™s
     $3.247-biIlion FY 1975 budget requestâ€™ and program [see 4 Feb.] to
     the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences to open
     hearings on the NASA authorization bill. In a review of FY 1974 accom-
     plishments, Dr. Fletcher pointed out that as the Skylab program came
     to an end the three crews had traveled some 113 million km and orbited
    the earth 2475 times in a working scientific laboratory-chalking up
     â€œabout 100 miles per gallon of fuel.â€™â€™ Skylab had focused on the sun,
    the earth, and man. â€œApollo extended manâ€™s reach to the moon; Skylab
    added near-Earth to manâ€™s domain.â€
        In answer to questions Dr. Fletcher said the principal difference
    between NASAâ€™s     minimum request to the Office of Management and
    Budget and the final figures sent to Congress by the President was the
    $89 million subtracted from the shuttle program, causing a four- to six-
    month delay. Other differences brought a total decrease of $124 million
    below â€œwhat we could have gotten by with without any major changesâ€
                 program. The proposed minimum budget would not have
    in NASAâ€™s
    restored any of the programs NASA had had to drop because of Fâ€Y 1974
    budget cuts and therefore had been â€œwell below the constant levelâ€
    envisaged for NASA in FY 1973. Of $7.9 million cut from aeronautics
    programs, the chief reduction was in the quiet propulsion lift technology
   program, deleting the system integration model effort. Deletion of $1
   million from the requested technology utilization increase canceled
   proposed increases in numbers of dissemination centers and reduced
   buildup of support to state and local governments. A $5.7-million cut.
   in the amount requested for earth observations instruments had deferred
    their development.

      discussions during the past several monthsâ€™â€™ of an OMB proposal to con-
      solidate weather satellite programs under the Department of Defense.
      NASA, DOD, OMB, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-

   ∞Dr. James R. Schlesinger, Secretary of Defense, said in l?Y 1975 budget
      hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee that, although it
      was the first time in more than a decade the budget did not reflect support
      of US. forces in combat, it had to support a minimum peacetime defense
      and deterrence posture. The $85.5-billion budget appeared large because
      of inflation, increased military and civilian pay, and increased retire-
      ment benefits.
         An F 1974 supplemental request of $6.2 billion included $480
               Y
      million in increased fuel prices and $231 million for extra costs of arms
      for rsrael during the October 1973Mid-East war.
         The FY 1975 budget included programs to maintain and improve
     ballistic missile systems; continue strategic systems research; increase
     the active air defense of the US.; and increase the total airlift and sealift
     capability. (Testimony)

∞Prof. Nikolay A. Kozyrev, Soviet astronomer, had obtained convincing
      proof that Mercury had an atmosphere, Tass reported. A glowing halo
      around the planet, indicating the existence of an atmosphere, was seen
      in a spectrogram made while Prof. Kozyrev tracked the planetâ€™s path as it
      crossed the sunâ€™s disc. He calculated the refraction of light in the atmos-
      phere to be 0.002 of the earthâ€™s refraction and the pressure 0.02 of the
      earthâ€™s atmospheric pressure. The thickness of the atmosphere, estab-
      lished from the brightness of the halo, was 600 km. Kozyrev had said the
      thickness indicated the presence of a light gas, probably hydrogen. He
      believed that Mercuryâ€™s atmosphere was continuously replenished by the
      Aow of protons from the sun. (Tass, FBIS-SOV, 1Feb 74, U1)

∞Francis C. Schwenk, Director of the Research Div. in NASAâ€™s Office of Aero-
      nautics and Space Technology, testified on four NASA projects in hearings
      on space nuclear propulsion and power before the House Committee on
      Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space
      Technology. Early research had shown that high-temperature thermionic
      converters combined with a compact nuclear reactor could provide an
      efficient power plant for advanced planetary missions. NASA technology
      would now focus on thermionic energy conversion for achieving highly
      efficient operation at lower temperatures. During the ApolIo and Pioneer
      programs, NASA had proved the advantages of a small (40- to 70-w)
      radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator power system, which had operated
      at 6% efficiency at a cost of $20 million per kilowatt. NASA was develop-
      ing technology for a 0.5- to 2.0-kw gas-turbine conversion system (Bray-
      ton energy conversion system) to achieve efficiencies of 25% and reduce
      costs to one fourth.
         Gaseous-core nuclear rocket research had led to plasma-core reactors
      as advanced energy sources for terrestrial as well as space propulsion
      uses; use of uranium hexafluoride as plasma fuel was expected to achieve
      efficiencies of more than 50%. Lewis Research Center research into
      superconducting magnets and plasma confinement and heating in ad-
      vanced steady-state schemes was expected to show within a year whether
      a superconductive magnetic apparatus (SUMMA) could produce fusion-
      like plasmas as predicted. (Text)

     revised emergency plans at field installations for increased readiness
     for a broader range of emergencies. The agencyâ€™s contract policies had
     contributed to maintenance of a broad industrial base of small businesses
     to meet conditions of a national emergency. ,Research and development
     programs contributing to energy solutions included studies of new
     aeronautical technology, solar and wind energy, clean fuel production,
     improved use of coal, and more efficient fuels. Technology utilization

     successfully completed manâ€™s longest space journey and brought to an
     end one of the most scientifically producthe endeavors in the history
     of human exploration. From the Skylab program, we have learned that
     we can live and work in space for long periods of time. And we haw.
    found that the results of these efforts can be of enormous practical
    value to life on earth.
        â€œSkylab now joins the ranks of the Santa Maria, the H.M.S. Beagle,

    with development of the space shuttle.
        Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said 30 earth resources
    passes had been lanned and 39 accomplished during the Skylab 4
    mission. There ha I been 350 hrs of Apollo Telescope Mount observations

    included 13 by the Apollo Telescope Mount and 111 by other instru-
    ments. All 28 planned corollary experiments and all major medical and
    student experiments had been completed. Original planning had called
    for 140 days in orbit for the three manned missions; 172 were accom-
    dished. Skylabâ€˜s greatest achievement â€œwas to prove . . . there is no

      before a brief welcoming ceremony at dockside in San Diego, Calif.
      The astronauts then flew to Ellington Air Force Base, Tex., for a reunion
      with their families. Medical tests would continue throughout the week
      and the three men would continue to eat the precisely controlled diet

    ∞A New York Times editorial noted that the 8 Feb. safe return of the Skylab 4

      astronauts â€œwas considered so certain that the television networks had
      decided well in advance not to broadcast the splashdown.â€ It â€œreally was
      a public tribute to the high technical achievements of the Skylab pro-
      gram and of previous manned American space projects.â€ With Skylabâ€™s
      record and dividends, â€œthe case for a permanent manned station in
      space can now be regarded as proved.â€ (NYT, 10 Feb 74)
    ∞The success of the Skylab program had made the idea of continuous occu-

      pation of an orbital base more concrete to the directors of the American
      space efforts, a New York: Times article reported. Such a base could be
      assembled by flights of the space shuttle being developed by NASA and
      could be used to observe the sun and the earth and for manufacturing
       special materials under weightless conditions. Skylab Program Direc-
      tor William C. Schneider had said in an interview, â€˜â€˜We have shown
      that there is no man or machine limitation on whatever we want to
       do in space.â€ The confidence of space scientists had been strengthened
      by the apparent adaptation of the astronauts to space, although the
      Times reported Skylab 2 Astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin and Johnson
      Space Center Director Christopher C. Kraft as cautioning that nine
      men â€œis a very small statistical sample.â€ More long test flights would
      have to be made. However, if the medical data held true, the design
      of future space stations could be made much simpler and the number
      of space shuttle flights to establish it would be fewer. Schneider had
      noted that the conflict between the Workshopâ€™s need for power and its
      program for observation was still to be solved. The current design called
      for Workshop solar panels to point toward the sun rather than the
      earth. In a future space station, observatories might be placed on long
      booms which could turn on their own, minimking the stationâ€™s need to
      maneuver. (McElheny,NYT, 10 Feb 74,40)
    ∞Computer enhancement of multispectral photographs from Erts I satellite

       (circling the earth since 23 July 1972) had been proved useful for
      finding mineral and water deposits on the earth. Computer image
      enhancement, first used at Jet Propulsion Laboratory to improve early
      spacecraft pictures of the moon and Mars, had identified surface signs
      of known mineral deposits for JPL and U.S. Geological Survey investi-
      gators. Twenty ERTS-identified points had been verified in a test area,
      exploratory drilling had uncovered water-bearing rock 12 m below an
      ERTS-indicated water hole, and fractures indicating other drilling sites
      had Keen revealed. (NASA 7 4 2 7 )

      flight was an accepted and almost routine part of life, John N. Wilford
      commented in the New York Times that â€œit is only natural that after
      surveying the canyons of Mars, the clouds and haze of Venus and the
      radiation belts of JuDiter. men turn back and take a new look at the
      earth and, in the words of T. S. Eliot, â€˜know the place for the first time.â€™ â€

10-12 February: Soviet space probes Mars 4 and 5, launched 22 and 25 July
       1973, neared Mars after a journey of 460 million km. Mars 4 approached
      the planet 10 Feb. Because of faulty functioning of one onboard system,
      the braking engine was not fired and the spacecraft flew by Mars a t a
       distance of 2200 km. TV pictures were taken during the flyby and trans-
      mittal of information on outer space characteristics was to continue.
         Mars 5 was put into orbit around Mars at 6:45 pm Moscow time
       (11:45 am EDT) 12 Feb., with a 32 500-km apogee, 1760-km perigee,
      25-hr  period, and 35" inclination.
         Mars 6 and 7, launched 5 and 9 Aug. 1973, would approach Mars in
      March. During a 22 Sept. 1973 interview with Tass, Director Roald
      Sagdeyev of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of
      Sciences had said one of the four Mars probes would softland near the
      Martian south polar cap to test the physicaI properties of the soil and
      surface rocks and check the possibilities of transmitting TV pictures of
      the surrounding terrain to earth. (Tass, FBIS-SOV, 14 Feb. 74, u1;

11 February: The Titan IIIE-Centaur proof-fiight vehicle (TC-11, launched
      by NASA from Eastern Test Range Complex 41 at 9:48 am EDT carrying a
      Viking spacecraft model and the SPHINX satellite, was destroyed after
      the Centaur engine failed to start. At 8.1 min from launch, after normal
      separation from the Titan booster, the Centaur main-engine start failed
      and the vehicle automatically went into the restart sequence. A second
      attempt to start the engine failed at 9.2 min after liftoff. Since the vehicle
     had not achieved orbital velocity the Range Safety Officer at the Antigua,
     West Indies, tracking station transmitted destruction commands and
      the Centaur was destroyed at 12.5 min after the liftoff. The vehicle fell
     into the Atlantic Ocean 3530 km downrange. Inflight data indicated that
     the liquid-oxygen boost pump had failed to operate during both at-
     tempted engine starts. A committee was formed to investigate the failure
     and recommend corrective action.
         Although the primary objective of demonstrating the capability of
     the Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was not accomplished, some objectives
     were fulfilled: demonstration of the capability of the launch facility to
     support a Titan-Centaur launch, structural irntegrity of the vehicle,
     Centaur guidance and control of the Titan, Titan-Centaur separation,
     and Centaur standard shroud capability.
         The Viking Dynamic Simulator had been instrumented to verify flight
     loads for the two planned 1975 missions to Mars. Remaining attached
     to the Centaur stage, the VDS was to have flown a typical Viking launch
     trajectory with a shortened burn to limit the spacecraft to a low earth
     orbit, to test the guidance system, and estimate injection accuracy.
         The SPHINX Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment space-
     craft had been intended for launch into an elliptical orbit to investigate
     the effect of charged particles in space on high-voltage solar cells, insula-
     tors, and conductors.
         The launch vehicle combined NASA's        versatile high-energy liquid-
     hydrogen and liquid-oxygen Centaur upper stage with the Air Force-
     developed Titan I11 booster, a two-stage liquid-propellant core rocket
     augmented by two strap-on solid-fueled rocket motors. It was designed to
     fill the performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and the
     Saturn vehicles and boost NASA's    heaviest unmanned payloads into orbit
     or interplanetary trajectories. The first of six scheduled operational mis-

    the proof flight.
        The Titan-Centaur program was managed by NASAâ€™s        O5ce of Space
     Science. Lewis Research Center was responsible for the Titan-Centaur
     system. The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Organization was re-
    sponsible for the Titan IIIE booster, including aerospace ground equip-
     ment and Launch Complex 41 site activation. Kennedy Space Center di-
    rected launch operations at ETR. (NASA MORS, 25 Jan, 24 June 74; NASA

∞ A standardized solar-electric propulsion stage ( SEPS) that could become
    part of a space transportation system for payloads in planetary and earth-
     orbital missions was under study at Marshall Space Flight Center. SEPS,
     one of several concepts under study, would be able to accept modules
     such as a docking subsystem for earth-orbital missions or a science pack-
    age for planetary missions. Another concept, for an attachable SEP
    module, would provide propulsion only and depend on spacecraft sub-
     systems for all other functions. SEPS would carry a cluster of six to nine
    thrusters, fueled by ionized mercury, and two lightweight 27-m solar-
     array wings to supply 25 kw of power to the thrusters and payloads. It
    was being designed for use with the space shuttle and space tug, and
    application of an attachable SEP module to a Mariner spacecraft was
     being studied. The tug, supplemented by SEPS, would be able to deploy
    and retrieve a 2500-kg geosynchronous equatorial payload in 100 days,
    tripling the amount the unaided tug could deliver. After one delivery, the
    SEPS could continue to operate between the shuttle orbit and intermediate
    orbits, delivering and retrieving 20 more payloads before the thruster
    life was used up. (NASA Release 74-38; NASA OMSF, interview)
∞A vertical-axis windmill was under study at Langley Research Center as
    a potential source of nonpolluting energy. The windmill, based on a
     1927 principle, had two four-meter curved blades attached at the top
    and bottom to a five-meter vertical shaft, set on a simple gear system,
    and a generator that converted wind power to electricity. The airfoil-
    shaped blades rotated in almost any wind and were expected to achieve
    enough revolutions per minute to provide the energy requirements of a
    single-family house at an estimated construction and installation cost
    of $500 to $1000. A much larger windmill project at Lewis Research
    Center, for the National Science Foundation, was studying large con-
    centrations of windmills for industrial use [see 1 Jan.]. ( NASA Release

   ∞An Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial said the FY 1975 aero-
      space budget request offered the aerospace industry â€œits best prospect
       in a decade.â€ The dollar increases were â€œsignificant because they were
       aimed at alleviating problems caused by a decade of neglect in basic
      weapon system development and diplomatic euphoriaâ€ and recognized
      that aerospace was an â€œimportant sinew of national power and economic
      strength.â€ It was the first budget in many years that had no major
      program cancellations or cuts. The worst cut, $89 million, meant a
      six-month delay in the first shuttle Bight but was accompanied by a
      written guarantee of future support-â‚¬or full funding of the program.
      The military budget was well balanced between research, development,
      and procurement. While the NASA program would not satisfy the space
      buffs, it was a strong continuing effort supplemented by $500 million
      in military space activities and the growing communications and appli-
      cations space activity in other agencies. The aerospace industry must
      now spend extra effort in delivering the hardware and performance
      to meet the chalIenge required by this budget. (Holz, Av Wk,1 Feb         1

14 February: Tentative NASA plans for launching 810 payloads into space
    in the next two decades were outlined by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA
    Administrator, in an address before the National Space Club in Wash-
    ington, D.C. The total, for late 1973 to 1991, included non-NASA pay-
    loads for Government agencies (other than the Dept. of Defense), for-
    eign agencies, and private industry. The tentative payload model-pre-
    sented to Congress in October 1973 to show â€œwhat could be done in the
     1980sâ€ when the space shuttle was in use-included as many as 10
    missions to the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn.
    In 1990 and 1991 two very heavy payloads might be sent to orbit one
    of Jupiterâ€™s moons and land an instrument package. Tentative missions
    to the inner planets included five missions to Venus, one of them with
    a lander, and two spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Tentative Mars missions
    included one spacecraft to orbit the planet, two landers, and two to return
    samples from the two moons of Mars. Lunar missions under considera-
    tion included a lunar polar orbiter in 1979, two other orbiters in the
    1980s, two lunar rovers in the 1980s, a lunar halo satellite to ensure
    communications with the hidden side of the moon, and two lunar rovers
    in 1990 and 1991 that could return samples to the earth from any point
    on the moon. Other plans under consideration were a flyby and ren-

     applications field were large Earth Observatory Satellites. And NASA
    expected to orbit 120 communications and navigation satellites for other
     agencies or private industry through 1991, not including those for DOD.
        Of some 300 payloads to be flown in the Spacelab, most would be
     NASA payloads in the fields of astronomy, physics, earth observations,
     earth and ocean physics, communication and navigation, life science,
     and space technology. Of non-NASA payloads, 10 would be for private
     industry space processing, beginning in 1985. Some 10% were expected
     to be flown for foreign users.
       The large number of contemplated missions, even with the increasing
    number of U.S.S.R. launches, was expected to have very little impact
     on the environment. Effects of the major constituents of the solid-fueled
    rocket booster exhaust-water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride,
    and aluminum oxide-would be negligible. (Text)
  ∞France reluctantly decided to cut back construction of the Anglo-French
    Concorde supersonic airliner and to scrap production of the Mercure
    short-range twin-jet airliner, at a special meeting of Premier Pierre
    Messmer and five ministers. France had been demanding production of
    eight Concorde aircraft but would now accept as few as six in the
    knowledge that, with a Labor Party victory in the 28 Feb. British
    elections, the U.K. might be willing to scrap the entire project. The
    press said the French decision came after a report from Franceâ€™s rocket
    testing center suggesting a $9O-million fuel-tank modification to boost
    range at the expense of reduced transatlantic loads. A suggested 10%
    increase in engine thrust, requiring 8% more wing area at a cost of
    as much as $400 million, was believed rejected at the meeting.
       The decision to scrap the 120-seat, 1200-km range Mercure was taken
    after an initial production run of 10 aircraft and writeoff costs reported
    by the press at $120 million. Competition from the already established
    DC-9s and Boeing 727s and 737s was too great for the Mercure, whose
    one buyer was Air Inter, the internal French airline. (Randal, W Post,

    Representative to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
    Outer Space Working Group and Task Forre on Remote Sensing-
    reviewed U.S. environmental and earth resources programs before the
    Working Group and Task Force. The U.S. had designed tape recorders
    and studies on Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched
    23 July 1972) for foreign use of the data, but the â€œextent and vigor of
    foreign interest was perhaps greater than we expected.â€ Brazil and Canada
    had built ground stations to receive data directly and, by agreement with
    the U.S., were disseminating data. Italy also would establish a ground
    station, and nine other countries had expressed interest.
        Erts 1 performance had shown that data collection with a spatial res-
    olution of 100 m was economical and adequate for a wide range of signif-
    icant applications. Although total discontinuance of photographic im-
     agery was not planned, the speed, reliability, and flexibility found in
    computer analysis indicated that future systems would increasingly use
    automated methods.
       The mapping accuracy of the satelliteâ€™s instruments was adequate for
    1 :IO00 000 and even 1:250 000 scale when system errors were removed
    by computer processing. Processing and disseminating data was a key
    factor in the cost of an earth observation program. No one data-processing

    The improved version of the four-stage M U 4 S was the first guided
    booster Japan had used. The satellite entered orbit with a 3229-km
    apogee, 283-km perigee, 121.7-minperiod, and 31.2â€ inclination. KYODO

18-26 February: The cooperative Italian-NASA Sun Marco 4 (San Marco c2:1
    Explorer satellite was successfully launched by an Italian crew from the
    San Marco launch pIatform off the coast of Kenya on a NASA Scout
    booster. Liftoff was at 1:05 pm local time (6:05 am EDT) ,2 hrs 50 min
    late because of low cloud cover. The satellite entered orbit with a 930.5-
    km apogee, 234.5-km perigee, 96-min period, and 2.9â€™ inclination to
    measure diurnal variations of the equatorial neutral atmosphereâ€™s den-
    sity, composition, and temperature. The data would be correlated with
    data from Explorer 51 (launched 15 Dec. 1973) for studies of the physics
    and dynamics of the thermosphere. The launch had been delayed from
    6 Feb. to allow NASAâ€™s    Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN)
    to give better support for the 8 Feb. Shylab 4 splashdown.
       The Italian-built 170-kg Sun Marco 4 carried three experiments: an
    Ttalian density-drag accelerometer to measure atmospheric drag, a US.
    omegatqon to measure the temperature and density of thermosphere
    molecular nitrogen, and a US. neutral mass spectrometer to measure
    primary constituents of the neutral atmosphere. Data gathered by Sun
    Marco 4 in the equatorial zone and Explorer 51 in the auroral zone would
    provide a good picture of the effects of magnetic storms on the thermo-
    sphere and differences in the thermosphereâ€™s response to energy coming
    from the sun to the poles and the equator.
       The omegatron experiment was activated 19 Teb. and the neutral mass
    spectrometer 22 Feb. By 26 Feb. both instruments were acquiring worth-
    while scientific data. The Italian density-drag accelerometer, activated
     shortly after launch but not performing properly, was being investi-
     gated. All spacecraft systems were functioning as planned.
       Sun Marco 4 was the fourth satellite launched under cooperative
     agreements between NASA and the Italian Space Commission. Sun
     Marco 1 was launched 15 Dec. 1964; Sun Marco 2,26 April 1967; and
     Sun Marco 3, 24 April 1971. Under the latest agreement, signed 6 Aug.
     1973, Italy had designed and built the spacecraft, provided one experi-
    ment, and conducted launch operations. The US. provided the Scout

     Myers testified on the manned space program before the House Committee
      on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight
     during FY 1975 authorization hearings. Myers said NASAâ€™s             ability to_
     hold close to the original cost target for the space shuttle in spite of
     schedule adjustments in the last two years was â€œdue to bringing on our
     contractors below our cost estimatesâ€ and the ability bf the management
     structure to remain dynamic and react to changes and â€œsurprise prob-
     lems.â€™, He was confident that the average-cost-per-flightcommitment of
     $10.5 million in 1971 dollars would be maintained. However, resolution
     of the protested selection of Thiokol Corp. for the solid-fueled rocket
     motor contract was necessary before work on the motor could begin; â€œa
     timely start of this . . . activity is very important to orderly progress in
     the shuttle development schedule.â€
        In the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the ASTP spacecraft was to be de-
    livered to Kennedy Space Center in the fall, joint docking system quali-
    fication testing and preflight docking system compatibility tests were to
    be completed during the winter, experiment hardware was to be qualified
     by early spring, and flight readiness activities were to be comdeted by
    spring, leading to the July launch. NASA had allocated $13 million for
    experiments for ASTP. More than 140 proposals from the scientific com-
    munity had been evaluated by eminent scientists and medica1 doctors.
    The final, â€œfirst-rateâ€ experiment package had been given final approval

        Following ASTP, two Saturn Vs, two Saturn IBs, one complete and one
    partially complete command and service module, the unused Skylab
    backup Workshop cluster, and one ASTP docking module and system
    would remain unused. Acquisition cost of the hardware was $870 million.
    With the conclusion of the programs, the hardware would be stored. Total
    storage costs per year would be $100 000. After FY 1975, disposition of
    the hardware wouId have to be considered. (Transcript)

    blood cell reduction. However, after the 59-day Skytab 3 mission the
    compensating response of the blood-forming elements was faster, re-
    turning the mass almost to the preflight level within two weeks after
    splashdown-rather than the six weeks required after the 28-day Sky-

    faster return to preflight levels after the 84-day mission, indicating
    adaptive changes to the space environment. The space life sciences pro-
    gram sought to understand the mechanisms of adaptive changes and
     would â€œundoubtedly assist our understanding of basic body physiology
    of man here on earth.â€
        Capt. Chester M. Lee, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Program Director,
    said that during Skylab missions the orbital altitude and the limited
    number of ground stations had permitted communications coverage
     only 38% of the time. The lower orbital altitude for ASTP would reduce
     communications coverage to 17%. To alleviate the problem, the Apollo
     command module was being modified for communications via the ATS-F
     Applications Technology Satellite, scheduled for 1974 launch. Com-
    munications would move from a manned spacecraft through an un-
    manned communications satellite to the ground for the first time.
    Coverage would be increased to 50%. The present configuration of the
    communications network would furnish minimum real-time data to meet
     experimental requirements. (Transcript)

     recording emissions of stars in ultraviolet. Remote luminaries up to
     12th stellar magnitude had been recorded. The biomass of the microbe

22 February: NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs George W.
     Cherry testified in hearings on technology for subsonic aircraft before
    the House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Aeronautics and Space Technology. NASA aeronautical programs were
     structured to provide the airframe industry and its airline customers
     an efficient and environmentally benign technology base for a new-
     generation subsonic aircraft. The supercritical aerodynamics program
     included studies to improve structural efficiency without increasing
     drag, thrust, or fuel consumption. F-8 and F-111 aircraft flight tests
     with the supercritical wing had shown that using supercritical aero-
     dynamics on passenger transports would increase profits 2.5% over
     those of conventional aircraft, or $78 million a year, on a fleet of 280
    two-hundred-passengeraircraft.
        Advanced transport technology studies showed that aircraft exten-
    sively employing composite materials would show a yearly profit of
     2.70/0, or $100 million, on a fleet of 280 two-hundred-passenger aircraft.
        NASA propulsion technology had initiated an advanced multistage
     axial-flow experimental compressor weighing 60% less than conven-
    tional coppressors. This, with technology advances in other compo-

∞Large underwater oscillations, called â€œinternal wavesâ€™â€™ and usually invisible
      at the surface, had been detected by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration scientists Dr. John R. Ape1 and Robert Charnell, using
      images from NASAâ€™s       Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite
       (launched 23 July 1972), NOAA announced. The scientists speculated that
      internal-wave formation by lunar and solar tides and their subsequent
    â€˜breaking and dissipation of energy were important processes in the
      gradual lengthening of the day over millions of years. The waves also
      affected the propagation of sound in the ocean and contributed to the
      mixing processes in its upper layers. Internal waves changed the way
      sunlight was reflected from the ocean surface overlying them, and the
      change was detected in the satellite images. (NOM Release 74-32)

   ∞A Washington Post editorial commented on solar heating legislation: There
     was â€œenough sunshine in this country . . . to supply twice the energy
     needed to heat and cool all our buildings.â€ Technically, solar heating
     was simple. Solar cooling was more complicated, but within the grasp
     of a determined engineering effort. The probem was psycho-economic
     rather than technical. Industry did not want to produce hardware because
     they were not sure people would buy it. A bill [H.R. 118641 passed in
     the House by a 25340-2 vote [see 13 Feb.] would make $50 million
     available for a national demonstration of solar heating in 4000 homes
     in various parts of the country. The Senate would begin hearings on a
     similar measure [S. 26581, and companion measures would encourage
     solar heating and cooling with tax incentives and mortgage rule changes.
                                                                            ..
     We need â€œa wide-open,long-range determined public energy policy .
     and we need it in all areas that promise to help free UD,of our dependence
     on shrinking oil resources. The new solar-heating legislation is a welcome
     step in this direction.â€ ( W Post, 23 Feb 74, A16)
∞Dr. George A. Van Biesbroeck, Univ. of Arizona astronomer noted for his
     work with twin stars, asteroids, and comets, died in Arizona at the age
     of 94. Dr. Van Biesbroeck had charted the orbit of Neptuneâ€™s second
     satellite, published catalogs of double stars, and discovered 11 asteroids
     and 2 comets. In the 1930s he had been instrumental in establishing
     the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Tex. Dr. Van Biesbroeck
     had won the Franklin L. Burr Award from the National Geographic
     Society in 1952 for finding new proof of the bending of light from stars
     in support of the Einstein theory of relativity. (AP, NYT, 26 Feb 74,36)

     tions, Dr. Frank D. Drake, Cornell Univ. astronomer, told the annual
     meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science in San
     Francisco. The problem was finding ways to detect them. Analysis of
     data from a 1973 search of 500 stars by Univ. of Maryland and Univ.

25 February: NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications Leonard
      Jaffe-U.S. Representative to the United States Committee on the Peace-
     ful Uses of Outer Space Working Group and Task Force on Remote
     Sensing-told a session of the Working Group and Task Force the U.S.
     believed its policy of openness and benefit-sharing in earth resources and
     environmental remote-sensing programs was consistent with the Outer
     Space Act of 1967, which called for use of outer space for the benefit of
     all countries. The U.S. could see no justification in the suggestion that
     sovereignty over natural resources included control over all information
     about these resources. The U.S. would regret any setback to the principle
     of open and unimpeded international exchange of information and
     would continue its open distribution policy. A restrictive policy would
     slow the development of remote-sensing systems and cut off developing
     countries from beneficial data. Limiting data to conform to national
     boundaries would require costly techniques and would destroy the most
     useful functions of remote sensing; most ecological systems had to be
     studied globally. (Text)
∞Hearings on S. 2658 and H.R. 11864, to enact the Solar Heating and Cool-

     ing Demonstration Act of 1974, were held by the Senate Committee on
     Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Rep. Mike McCormack (D-Wash.)
     said the legislation--which called for NASA,       with other agencies, to
     develop and demonstrate solar technology-would set up a program that
     the National Science Foundation was not authorized to do and therefore
     would create no conflict with NSFâ€™S ongoing research and development
     program in solar energy.
        Dr. H. Guyford Stever, NSF Director, said that the bill should be
     considered in the context of the â€œintensive and coordinated R&D effortâ€
     already under way in the Executive Branch. The NSF Act had authorized
     NSF as lead agency in basic and applied solar research and, with inter-
     agency cooperation, NSF could bring â€œpractical solar energy systems into
     widespread use.â€ Dr. Stever expressed the Nixon Administration view
     that the Energy Research and Development Administration ( ERDA) ,
     proposed in other legislation, would be the preferred agency to accelerate
     applied solar technology when programs reached the stage of large dem-
     onstration and development. However, if that legislation were not ap-
     proved, the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development would be pref-
     erable over NASA as lead agency, because of HUDâ€™s experience with the
    local groups that would carry out the projects.
        Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, also expressed the Ad-
    ministrationâ€™s support of ERDA and of continuing NSF as the lead agency
    until ERDA was established. Dr. Fletcher suggested as an alternative plan,
     if ERD.4 were not established, that NASA serve as lead agency in phase one,
    the development of the technology and construction of solar units.
     Phase two, building the houses and installing the units, could be best
     handled by HUD. There would be â€œno big problemâ€ in transferring the
    responsibility to ERDA should it be established. (Transcript)

      Myers testified during the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space
      Sciences hearings on the FY 1975 NASA authorization that space shuttle
      subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers had been selected in 32 states. Of
      the major subcontractors, 30 had already begun work. By June 1974
      the total major subcontractor team would be at almost 100% of the
      required level. Shuttle employment was 16 000 and would reach 27 000
     by June 1974 and 37 000 by June 1975. The first major subsystem test
     of the shuttle main engine would be made before the end of June 1974.
      Fabrication of Orbiter 1would begin by the end of 1974, with the first
     horizontal flight test scheduled for the second quarter of 1977, the first

     NASAâ€™s
     tems in development, before the House Committee on Science and
     Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight during FY 1975
      authorization hearings. Dr. Culbertson said 986 paylozds were projected
      for the 12-yr period beginning in 1980, with one third each for applica-
     tions, science, and the Dept. of Defense. Duplication of the accomplish-
     ments expected from the space shuttle sortie (Spacelab) program would
     require automated spacecraft, sounding rockets, a manned space station,
      and a system for manned transport. The shuttle, with effective intega-
     tion of payloads and the ability to service in-orbit spacecraft, offered a
     potential savings of $14 billion over expendable systems from 1980 to
      1991. Studies had shown that 725 flights were required to fly the pro-
     jected 986 payloads, an average of 60 flights a year. At a 10% rate of
     discount and a 10% rate of return, the space transportation system
     would break even if the shuttle were flown only 25 times a year.

    sion had been reestablished, to which the OAST Research Council would
     report its evaluation of NASAâ€™s  basic research. New research included an
     acoustic composite nacelle program to reduce noise and fuel con-
    sumption and a program to develop new higher performance materials
    for advanced turbine engines. New starts in long-haul technology, in-
    cluding the active control aircraft program and a remotely piloted
     research vehicle, would help increase productivity and efficiency, envi-
    ronmental acceptability, and reduced fuel consumption.
       A new Officeof General Aviation Technology had been organized in

    In 30 manned flights the US. had moved from the first 15-min sub-
     odbital flight to 12 Americans walking on the moon and then finally to
    the near-routine Skylab endurance missions. It would be a long while
    before someone set out for the planets, a trip which would require far
    more advanced propulsion systems than now available. But â€œwe will go
     to the planets. . . . We wili go beyond Jupiter. We will go beyond
    this solar system and eventually build starcraft to go so far that manâ€™s
    only limit will be his imagination and ingenuity. But the mission clearly
     for the next decade is this Earth: it is the only home man has at the

  4 March: Dr. James B. SchIesinger, Secretary of Defense, said in his annual
        Defense Posture Statement submitted to Congress that the U.S. would
        not insist on strict numerical missile equality with the U.S.S.R. in a
        future arms agreement. Rather, he wanted an â€œessential equivalenceâ€
       in a diversified strategic force â€œto make avaiIable to the President a
        reasonable range of strategic options as USSR and PRC capabilities
       evolve.â€ The US. might be willing to agree to a reduction of its land-

          Dr. Schlesinger also said he had directed the Navy to concentrate on
       smaller aircraft carriers rather than the large, $1-billion, nuclear-powered

∞Widespread material and component shortages-increased             by the oil em-
      bargo imposed by oil producing countries during the October 19â€™72
      Middle East war-were causing severe probIems for the aerospace in-
      dustry, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Suppliers found it
      easier and more profitable to supply material such as aluminum to non-
      aerospace industry, which placed quantity orders without specific dead-
      lines and rigid specifications. Government price controls had encouraged
      some suppliers to halt production or divert supplies to export markets,
      where profits could be two to three times above the domestic.
         A Hughes Aircraft Co. survey showed that reasons for shortages
      incIuded a diminished supply of petrochemicals, which were the basis
     of most pIastics and synthetic rubbers, and the curtailed production of
     materials requiring Iarge amounts of energy for fabrication. ( A v Wk,

     age of 73. Prof. Tikhonravov had worked on the development of the
     first man-made satellites, pilot-operated spacecraft, and automatic space
     stations. With Sergey P. Korolev, he had worked on development of
     early liquidrfuel rockets in the 1930s. He had been an early expert in
     glider and aircraft engineering. Tikhonravov had been awarded the

     Flight Center by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr.
     Rocco A. Petrone, MSFC Director.
        Dr. Fletcher said the Headquarters reorganization and key personnel
     appointments would consolidate planning and direction of research and
     development programs under the Associate Administrator and overall
     planning and direction of the field center operations under the newly
     created position of Associate Administrator for Center Operations. Dr.
     Petrone was named Associate Administrator. He would remain as MSFC
     Director until early summer when he would be replaced by Dr. William
     R. Lncas, MSFC Deputy Director. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Ad-
     ministrator for Space Science, was appointed Deputy Associate Adminis-
     trator. He would also continue as Acting Associate Administrator for
     Space Science until a successor was named. Dr. George M. Low, in
     addition to his duties as Deputy Administrator, would serve as Acting
     Associate Administrator for Center Operations until the new position
     was filled. He would be assisted by Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate
     Administrator for Management in the Office of Aeronautics and Space
     Technology. Gen. Bruce K. Holloway (USAF, Ret.) , who would also
     continue as the Assistant Administrator for Dept. of Defense and Inter-
     agency Affairs, was named Acting Associate Administrator for Aero-
     nautics and Space Technology. Bernard Moritz was appointed Associate
     Administrator for Organization and Management.
        The reorganization, effective 15 March, followed completion of the
     Apollo and Skylab programs and would provide mychanisms for the
     phaseover from conventional launch vehicles to the space shuttle and
     new programs, Dr. Fletcher said.
        At MSFC, Dr. Petrone said that the reorganization, effective 30 May,
     would enable the Center to fulfill requirements of its varied assigned
     programs and improve its competitive position to obtain new assign-
     ments. The major changes were in the Science and Engineering Direc-
     torate. A Deputy for Operations and a Deputy for Bystems had been
     established. Business operations and control of all resources had been
     consolidated into a centralized office at the directorate level. Elements
     under the S&E Directorate included two associate directors, an Associate
      Director of Engineering and an Associate Director of Management; two
     offices,Reliability and Quality Assurance and Research and Technology;
     and eight laboratories. The laboratories were being restructured to
     emphasize system engineering and integration, analysis, design, and
     testing. The in-house capability to manufacture, inspect, and check out
     major hardware projects had been eliminated, with the associated sup-
     ply, warehousing, and procurement capability.

5-6 March: NASA Spacelab Program Director Douglas R. Lord testified
    5 March during-FY 1975 NASAauthorization heaFings before the House
    Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Manned
    Space Flight that, with the European commitment to develop Spacelab,
    the program had become international. Two parallel structures, the NASA
    SpacelabProgram Office headed by Lord and a European Space Research
    Organization Spacelab Program Office under Jean-Pierre Causse, di-
    rected the program on either side of the Atlantic. Activities were coor-
    dinated by the Joint Spacelab Working Group, which met monthly,
    cochaired by Lord and Causse.
        Causse testified that the ESRO Spacelab employment level was at 60
    and would reach 100 by December 1974. ESRO member countries, except
    Sweden, had committed $369.6 million to the Spacelab effort, in the
    following proportions: West Germany, 54.1% ; Italy, 18%; France,
    10%; United Kingdom, 6.3%; Belgium, 4.2%; Spain, 2.8%; The
    Netherlands, 2.1%; Denmark, 1.5%; and Switzerland, 1%. ESRO would
    attempt to spend in each country an amount proportional to that coun-
    tryâ€™s contribution. Phase B studies-to provide a data base for program
    commitment and the find go-ahead-had been completed and one of
    the two competing firms, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm and ERNO
    Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, would be seIected as prime contractor in June.
        M/G Robert H. Curtin (USAF, Ret.), Director of the Office of Facilities,
    testified 6 March that shuttle construction projects totaled $86 020 000
    and included $71 950 000 for launch and landing facilities, $7 480 000
    for ground-test facilities, and $6 590 000 for solid-fueled rocket booster

    Ertf 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972)
    had demonstrated savings in land use planning and regulation of 10 to
    100 times conventional costs in both dollars and personnel. Every
    cloud-free photo taken by the satellite had been sold to the general public
    at least once. One photo of an Alaskan naval petroleum reserve showed
    a striking alignment of lakes indicating that the deposits might extend
    the known petroleum area.
        Dr. Warren A. Hovis, GSFC scientist, testified that the Heat Capacity
    Mapping Mission (HCMM) satellite to be launched in 1977 would use a
    thermal mapper, with a resolution of 0.5 km in optimum orbit, to deter-
    mine maximum daily temperature variations and thermal inertia of
    surface material, identify mineral resources, map natural and man-made
    thermal effluent, and investigate geothermal source location by remote
    sensing.
        Data from the SEASAT-A satellite t i be launched in 1978L-or from one
    of its follow-on systems-would provide optimum, minimum-time ship
    routing around storms and away from adverse wind, waves, currents,
    and ice conditions, Dr. John R. Apel, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration meteorologist, testified 6 March. The savings from a one-
    day decrease in transatlantic crossing time could amount to millions
    of dollars each year for shipping interests. (Transcript)
6 March: Explorer 51 Atmosphere Explorer, launched into orbit 1 5 Dec.
     1973, was moved in a series of maneuvers down to 139.8 km above the
    earth, its lowest perigee to date and its first successful excursion into
    the lower thermosphere. Thirteen of the fourteen experiments aboard
    the spacecraft performed as expected and worthwhile data were acquired,
    but both filaments of the closed-source neutral mass spectrometer had
    failed and that instrument could no longer provide data. Evidence indi-
    cated that oxidation, compounded by thermal stress, had weakened the
    filaments in the oxygen-rich environment. A failure review committee
    would study the anomaly and also evidence of further filament degrada-
    tion in two other spectrometers. (NASA MOR, 19 March 74)
∞The Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive
    ordering all DC-10 jumbo jet aircraft operators to make certain that
    cargo holds were locked and pressurized before the aircraft left the
    ground. Evidence had increased speculation that the 3 March crash
     of a DC-10 Turkish airliner had been caused by a faulty rear cargo
     door. In addition, operators were required to observe normal pressuriza-
     tion of aircraft during the initial flight period. If pressurization problems
     did occur, the aircraft was to be depressurized and brought down at the
     nearest suitable airport. (AP, B Sun, 7 March 74, A2)
  ∞Wind-tunnel tests of almost all supersonic portions of a typical NASA space
     shuttle flight were completed at Arnold Engineering Development Center.
     The simulated flight profile included separation of the orbiter and its
     fuel tank from the two large solid-fueled rocket motors, orbiter flight
     with and without fuel tank, and orbiter reentry into the earthâ€™s atmos-
    phere. The tests, begun September 1973, showed orbiter flight char-
     acteristics and the heat levels segments of the system could be expected
     to experience while traveling 41h to 20 times the speed of sound. (AFSC

   mittee on Science and Astroaauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and
   Space Technology. Kilgore testified 6 March that in FY 1975 OAST would
   modify its â€œprogram again to meet the changing needs of the Nation.â€
   Energy conservation â€œis an inherent part of our aeronautics and space
    research and I believe we have the capability also to provide significant
    support to civil needs for energy technology. At the same time, we must
   continue our effective response to the Nationâ€™s need for a quiet, clean,
   economical air transportation system, for support to military aviation, and
   for a viable program to exploit and explore space.â€ Much of the aero-
   nautics program [see 26 Feb.] already was â€œcontributing to aircraft
   fuel conservation.â€ Advanced avionics systems to relieve terminal con-
    gestion, more highly maneuverable aircraft and operational procedures,
    more efficient engines, composite materials for weight reduction, and
   aerodynamic drag reduction techniques-â€œall            contribute to fuel
    economy.â€ And the program was being examined to increase emphasis
    in areas related to the national energy problem, both in conservation and
   in long-term technology.
       For space exploration, propellants with more powerful liquified-gas
    oxidizers-storable in cold space conditions-offered up to 30% increase
   in payloads over those permitted by earth-storable propellants. Nuclear
   energy studies included investigation of low-temperature thermionic oon-
   verters, gaseous uranium reactor concepts, and use of heat from high-
   temperature reactor sources for industry use. In stationary power, NASA
   was working with the Dept. of Interiorâ€™s Office of Coal Research to in-
   crease power produced from coal 40%. [See also During March.]
       George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs,
    OAST, said 12 March that research and development on shuttle systems
   had contributed to substantial improvements in both high- and low-
   temperature reusable insulations, coatings, bearings, seals, and hydraulic
   fluids, all applicable on the earth. The requirement that a reusable space
   tug return to the shuttle for return to the earth had doubled the
   velocity requirement of the vehicle, speeding the development of a high-
   performance propulsion system. (Transcript)
7 March: A proposal to tap energy from tiny black holes, superdense
    dbjects in space, was presented by Dr. Lowell Wood, member of a three-
   man team from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, at a conference of
   international physicists organized by the New York Academy of Sciences.
    Some black holes within the orbit of the moon might be so tiny that
   their effects would not be evident beyond a few hundred meters. A tiny
   power plant could be placed in orbit to accompany the moving hole but
    remain at a discreet distance. Fusion fuel would then be fired from
   the power plant to the hole, and the holeâ€™s extremely powerful gravity
   would squeeze the fuel toward the vanishing point. The fuel would fuse,
   releasing vast amounts of energy, which could be collected and beamed
   to the earth by microwave frequencies. (Sullivan, NYT, 9 March 74,12)
∞ The House of Representatives passed the Federal Energy Administration
   bill, H.R. 11793, which would reorganize and consolidate certain func-
   tions of the Federal Government in a new Federal Energy Adminis-

7, 12-14 March: Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space
     Science, testified on NASAâ€™s     space science program before the House
     Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Space Sci-
     ence and Applications during FY 1975 authorization hearings: A Solar
     Maximum Mission (SMM) satellite was proposed for FY 1975 design
     study and launch in the next period of maximum solar activity, 1978-
     1979. SMM would investigate solar flares and related phenomena and
     their effects on the solar-terrestrial system, making, for the first time,
     simultaneous measurements of flares across the electromagnetic
     spectrum-within a national program of satellite, sounding rocket, and
     ground-based observations of the sun during maximum activity. The
     spacecraft would be shuttle-retrievable for refurbishment and reflight
     with advanced solar physics experimentsin the 1980s.
        Requested funding for the Large Space Telescope (LsY) for FY 1975
     was $6.2 million, to proceed with design of telescope optics, detectors,
     and support systems. NASA had originally planned to spend about $10
     million in FY 1975 on the LST-to be launched on the space shuttle
     in 1980-but reduced the request to reflect the four- to six-month delay
     in shuttle development.
        N A S A - ~ ~ cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory, Sandia
     Laboratories, and West Germany-was developing an Aries sounding
     rocket to support the physics and astronomy program. Aries, which
     used the 2nd stage of surplus Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
     missiles, would provide a greater lift and longer flight time than pos-
     sible at the price of rockets now in use.
        Cost overruns on the 1975 two-spacecraft Viking mission to Mars
     could total 10% of the original $838-million estimate for the program
     because of hardware development problems. Major problems with the
     biology instrument included packing the sophisticated instruments into
     a small volume, development of very small valves to inject SUfFiciently
     small amounts of nutrients into Martian samples, and thermal control.
     The instrument was running $21.2 million over the budgeted cost. Dif-
     ficulties also had been encountered in producing enough 0.005-cm
     plated magnetic wire of uniform characteristics for the onboard com-
     puter. Dr. Naugle said that, although the overall corripexity of the
      spacecraft had been underestimated, â€œwe expect these problems to
     be solved and to launch both Viking spacecraft on schedule in 1975.â€

    and earth albedo sensors, and measure degradation of silicone solar
    cells in orbit.
               objective of placing the satellite in an earth orbit that would

    permit achievement of the scientific objectives was met, and the mission
    was adjudged a success 19 March. Under a December 1972 Memo-
    randum of Understanding between NASA and the U.K.â€™s Dept. of Trade
    and Industry, NASA would be reimbursed for launch vehicle and services.
       Developed for the U.K. by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd., the 83.5-

8 March: Preliminary reports for Skylab principal investigators indicated
    that large-scale zero-g production facilities in space could manufacture
    alloys, composites, and crystals of a homogeneity and perfection far
    greater than that obtainable on the earth, Marshall Space Flight Center
    announced. A sample from a Skylab brazing experiment demonstrated
    an almost perfect brazed joint, suggesting that it would be possible
    to assemble large facilities in space using welding and brazing tech-
    niques. Two ends of 2.5-cm tubes of nickel or steel joined with a sleeve
    by brazing with a silver-copper alloy showed a metallic structure that
    could not form under gravity conditions.
       Crystals of germanium selenide, typically 2 to 3 mm on the earth,
    were grown in zero g to a length of 25 mm with straight edges and no
    surface structure defects. A mixture of metals that would not form
    alloys under gravity conditions showed at least some alloying under
    zero g. A strengthening fiber of silicon carbide whiskers introduced
    into composite materials was uniformly distributed, suggesting a poten-
    tial for space production of materials of greater strength and lighter
    weight. (MSFC Release 74-33)

∞Analyses of light flashes seen by crew members of the last Apollo missions,
    tentatively attributed to cosmic ray nuclei penetrating the head and eyes,
    were reported by Univ. of Houston and Johnson Space Center scientists
    in Science magazine. Three kinds of flashes-the spot or star-like flash,
    the streak, and the cloud-had occurred randomly, with no apparent
    preference for one eye over the other. Astronauts saw many more flashes
    during translunar coast experiment sessions than in transearth coast,
    although the cosmic ray flux appeared to be the same inside the space-
    craft during both coasts. No physiological explanation was found for this
    difference in frequency of flashes. (Pinsky, et d.,  Science, 8 March 74,

9-12 March: Soviet space probes Mars 6 and 7 launched 5 and 9 Aug. 1973,
    flew past the planet Mars but failed to achieve their objectives. Mars 7
    approached the planet 9 March. A descent module was separated from
    the spacecraft but, because of a malfunction in an onboard system, it
    passed by the planet a distance of 1300 km. Mars 6 neared Mars on
    12 March. Its descent module was separated at 48 000 km and Mars 6
    continued past Mars within 16 000 km of the surface and into heliocentric
    orbit. The descent module transmitted data to Mars 6 for 148 sec as it
    descended, but radio contact was lost just before landing. The Western
    press later reported that high winds might have destroyed the spacecraft.
    Data received reportedly indicated several times more water vapor in the
    Martian atmosphere over some areas than had been thought, traces of
    ozone, broad oscillations in atmospheric pressure, identification of a hy-
    drogen corona reaching to 19 300-km altitude, confirmation of erosion
    and formation of what appeared to be river beds, and a magnetic field
    7 to 10 times greater in the planetâ€™s immediate environment than in
    planetary space.

        Mars 6 and 7-continuing to transmit data on solar wind and radia-
     tion from heliocentric orbit-were part of a series of four automatic
     stations launched to explore the Martian atmosphere and surface. Mars
     4 and 5, launched 22 and 25 July 1973, had approached the planet 10
     and 12 Feb. Mars 4 flew by Mars when its braking engine failed to fire.
     Mars 5 went into a successful orbit and continued to transmit data to
     the earth. Earlier, Mars 3 had softlanded a capsule on Mars 2 Dec. 1971
     during a windstorm; the capsule had transmitted 20 sec before falling
     silent. (Tass, FBISSOV, March 74, U1; 21 March 74, U1; Pravda,

9 March: The small tactical aerial mobility platform (STAMP) -a wheelless
     â€œflying jeepâ€-was undergoing tests at the Marine Corps Air Station in
     El Toro, Calif. The two-man 300-kg vehicle, produced under a $500 000
     Marine contract to the Garrett C o p , could hover as well as fly 120 km
     per hr at any altitude between 2.5 cm and 1500 m for 30 min at a time.

11 March: Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technology Satellite, launched 13 Aug.
     1972, was officially adjudged a success. The primary objective of measur-
     ing meteoroid penetration rates on a bumper-protected target in the
     near-earth environment was achieved despite the failure of half of the
     bumper panels to deploy fully. Because of the anomaly, the spacecraft
     batteries had overheated and data collection from the main telemetry
     system had been discontinued; since 22 Aug. 1972, data from the primary
     experiment had been transmitted through the backup system, which op-
     erated on solar cells only. Flight data showed that the bumper concept
     was six times more effective than a single-wall structure, twice the antici-
    pated effectiveness.
        Because the secondary experiments had been powered only by the
    spacecraft batteries, no data were received from these experiments after
    22 Aug. 1972. One secondary experiment-to measure impact flux of
                                      recorded 1850 penetrations, however,
    small mass meteoroids-had
    enough to show conclusively that the micrbphone meteoroid sensors
    flown on early Explorer and Discoverer satellites had greatly over-
    estimated the population of small meteoroids. (NASA MOR, 11 March 74)
 ∞ A General Accounting Office report disclosed by Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton
     (D-Mo.) had questioned Pentagon plans to begin production of 34
    radar-carrying aircraft, part of the Airborne Warning and Control Sys-
    tem, the Washington Post reported. The GAO report said the radar planesâ€™
    mission, defense against bomber attack, had changed and the project
    should be delayed until it was certain the system would work in its new
    role. There had been no demonstration that the aircraft could work
    effectively in a massive air battle. In addition, GAO questioned whether
    the aircraftâ€™s large radar would be susceptible to enemy jamming from
     distances as great as 320 km and whether the planes would become high-
    priority targets. Sen. Eagleton therefore had requested the Senate Armed
    Services Committee to deny AWACS production in 1974. (Getler, W Post,

    C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said NASA supported the broad ob-
    jectives of the bill, which would amend the National Aeronautics and
    Space Act of 1958 to establish within NASA an Office of Technology
    Applications to support the proposed National Resources Council. How-
    ever, NASA already had an effective technology utilization program and
    did not require additional authority to ensure that its technological capa-
    bilities were effectivelyused. Dr. Fletcher said he could give more support
    to the bill if the responsibility for a proposed survey of technological
    resources were given to the existing Domestic Council.
       Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National Science Foundation Director, said
    technology coordination and planning analysis could be more effectively
    done by an augmented Federal Council for Science and Technology than
    by the proposed Council. In addition, although NASA had great techno-
    logical resources, it was essential that mission agencies should be held
    to their originally defined responsibility.
        Dr. Philip Handler, President of the National Academy of Sciences,
    said the- bill unduly emphasized technological resources of NASA and
    the aerospace industry, when the real issue was how to use the entire
    Federal science and technology effort in combination with private indus-
    try resources within coherent national programs and plans. Instead of
    direct authorization to NASA, a similar amount should be made available
    to the President or a council, such as the Council of Economic Advisors
     or the Council on Environmental Quality, to allocate and coordinate.
        Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., President of the National Academy of
    Engineering and former NASA Deputy Administrator, favored a compact
    organizational structure with leadership appointed by the President and
    a research staff independent of all agencies and industry. NASA-developed
    technology could be used with that in other agencies and private indus-
    try. NASA laboratories should be used whenever appropriate. Employees
     and facilities of Lewis Research Center, which was preeminent in the
    fields of air-breathing and space-propulsion systems, could be applied
    effectivelyto energy research and development. (Transcript)
13 March: The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences re-

    House 13 Feb., to delineate agency responsibility more specifically. NASA
    would have responsibility for the necessary system research, develop-
     ment, hardware procurement, and delivery. The Dept. of Housing and
     Urban Development would develop dwelling and system performance
     criteria, construct the dwellings, and install the solar heating and cooling

    profiles, and sea ice mapping. NASA had begun microwave sounding
    experiments to overcome the cloud problem. Still needed were improved
    sounding accuracy and coverage, refined moisture profies, and simpler
    and less expensive random-access data-collection systems.
       For one- to two-week prediction, space capabilities were contributing
    to progress but lacked complete coverage of critical wind and temperature
    areas around the globe. New measurement approaches and improved

∞Johnson Space Center and the Mexican National Commission for Outer

    Space had begun a remote-sensing test project to assist in eradicating the

    under way and was expected to continue for a year. Sensor data provided
    by Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972)
    and orbiting meteorological satellites including N o m 2 and 3 (launched
     15 Oct. 1972 and 6 Nov. 1973) would be combined with data from a
    Mexican remote-sensing aircraft on soil temperature, moisture, and
    vegetation-all of which affected breeding patterns of the screwworm
    fly. Sterile flies could then be distributed to potential breeding grounds
    of the fly, which frequently caused $200 million annual losses to cattle,

    Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) in FY 1975 authorization hearings before
    the House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Aeronautics and Space Technology: TDRSS essentially would be two
    tracking network stations in synchronous orbit to support all low-earth-
    orbit satellites, giving real-time control and data with a significant in-
    crease in reliability. The system would provide close to six times the
    coverage given by ground networks because supported satellites would be
    visible to the orbital stations during 85% of the orbits rather than the
    15% from ground stations. Close to continuous visibility would also pro-
    vide greater flexibility in programming satellite use and would simplify
    operations. Number of ground tracking stations could %e reduced from
    the 1974 total of 18, plus one ship and two aircraft, to 8 by 1981.

     toward Venus and Mercury 3 Nov. 1973, was successfully changed by
     17.8 m per see along the sunline of the spacecraft by the third trajectory

     am EDT changed the trajectory from a sun-side flyby of 12 359 km to a
     dark-side flyby of 860 km on 29 March. Mariner 10 had continued to per-
     form satisfactorily since its 5 Feb. encounter with Venus despite anoma-
     lies [see 8-31 Jan.]. A down-link transmitted power problem apparently
     corrected itself and the received power levels at DeeD Space Network

     analysis of an Apollo 17 lunar rock sample indicated that the sample
     was 4.6 billion yrs old and an example of a very early differentiate.
     The study suggested that the lunar crust formed very early in the
     evolution of the moon by extensive melting associated with differential,
     gravitational separation of various other rock types.

∞Soviet scientists had offered a theory explaining why Comet Kohoutek
     had not been as bright as expected, an East Berlin newspaper was quoted
     as saying. Leningrad physicists had found in a laboratory test that
     Kohoutek was surrounded by a high-density fluid of cosmic particles;
     this â€œarmorâ€ had not burst and released light, as expected, when the
     sun had heated and expanded the cometâ€™s nucleus. (AP, LA Her-Exam,

19-20 March: NASA launched a record series of 79 sounding rockets from
     eight sites as part of a program to determine daily temperature and
     wind variations in the upper atmosphere during the vernal equinox.
     The launches were made over a 24-hr period from North, Central,
     and South America, the Caribbean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. Single-
     stage Loki and Super Loki rockets carried meteorological instruments
      to about 70 km, where the payloads were ejected and returned to the
      earth on parachutes, telemetering data to ground receiving stations.

20 March: Pioneer 11, launched 5 April 1973 toward Jupiter, completed
      the second passage of a spacecraft through the Asteroid Belt. The
      spacecraft had completed 70%, or 700 million km, of its 1-billion-km
      flight path to Jupiter and was traveling at 50 000 km per hr toward a
      December encounter. Pioneer 11 and its predecessor Pioneer 10, which
      had successfully completed its crossing of the Asteroid Belt 15 Feb. 1973
      and had gone on to a 3 Dec. 1973 encounter with Jupiter, found no dan-
      ger from small high-speed particles in the belt. Particles in the center
      of the belt were found to orbit the sun at 61200 km per hr-fast
     enough for a meteoroid with a mass of 0.001 g to penetrate 1 cm of
      aluminum. However, most particles detected by the two spacecraft
      were smaller and far fewer than predicted. Traveling out from the
      earthâ€˜s orbit the smallest particles-0.001 mm-appeared to decline
      in number while larger particles-O.01 to 0.1 mm-were evenly dis-
      tributed throughout the belt. The number of particles 0.1 to 1.0 mm was
      three times greater in the center of the belt than near the earth.
      Particles larger than 1.0 mm appeared to be very thinly spread. (ARC

    ∞NASA officials testified on the proposal to lease a Tracking and Data Relay


      Satellite System and on the closing of Plum Brook Station, during FY
      1975 authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science
       and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommitteeon Aeronautics and Space Technology.
          Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley said NASA rec-
      ommended lease instead of Government ownership and operation for
      four reasons. First, contracting for services would be as cost-effective
      as a conventional network of ground stations. Second, expenditures
      would be deferred to years when resulting savings could be realized.
      Funding required to procure a NASA-owned TDRSS would reduce the
      resources that could be applied to important mainline programs. Third,
      industrial technology was ready to provide the needed services. Fourth,
      the proposed arrangement was consistent with long-standing policies
      and practice of the Government to rely on industry for communications
      services.
          Acting Associate Administrator Edwin C. Kilgore of NASAâ€™s          Office
       of Aeronautics and Space Technology testified that Lewis Research
       Centerâ€™s Plum Brook Station, which was to bedosed by June 1974 be-
      cause of N 1974 Civil Service work force cuts, would keep its Space
      Power Facility on standby. The Air Force, Navy, National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, and other
      agencies were considering using the facility-the worldâ€™s largest space
      environment facility, which included a unique solar simulation sys-
      tem. Also, NASAâ€™s       cooperative program with the National Science
      Foundation to study wind-driven energy devices was based at Plum
      Brook. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin reported that reduction-in-force
      notices had been sent to 177 Civil Service employees 11 March, follow-
      ing 180 in the past year, out of IRRCâ€™S 400 separations. Dr. Kilgore said
      50 engineers and technicians would be retained for the Space Power
       Facility at Plum Brook, which once employed 600 workers. (Transcript)
    ∞Dr. Malcolm R. Currie, Dept. of Defense Director of Defense Research and


      Engineering, testified on DOD space programs before the Senate Committee
      on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1975 NASA authorization
      hearings: DOD would provide an interim, upper, orbit-to-orbit stage
        (00s) for initial use with NASAâ€™s   space shuttle until NASA could develop
       a permanent space tug. The OOS, which would provide the high orbits
       necessary for about 60% of military payloads, would be a low-cost
       modification o an existing upper stage and would be phased to coincide
                       f
       with the first operation of the shuttle orbiter in 1980. About $3.0 mil-
       lion would be spent in F 1975 to select stage configuration and initiate
                                  Y

    to provide initial shuttle capability at Vandenberg Air Force Base in
    December 1982. Shuttle hardware, software, operating procedures, and
     ground equipment would be common and interchangeable to the maxi-
    mum extent possible between KSC and Vandenberg.
       During N 1974 DOD had initiated the development and validation
    plan for the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, using satellites to pro-
    vide worldwide precise positioning and navigation, accurate to tens of
    meters. The system, usable for civilian purposes as well as military,
    would halt the proliferation of specialized systems.
       The Navyâ€™s Fleet Satellite Communications System (FLTSATCOM) , to
    provide reliable beyond-the-horizoncommunications for command and
    control of mobile DOD forces, was â€œwell into development.â€ Terminal
    equipment for the fleet would be installed in FY 1975 and FY 1976 and
    would be operated through minimal leased transponders in Communica-
    tion Satellite Corp.â€™s Maritime Communications Satellite System pend-
    ing full operation of FLTSATCOM in 1976.
       Three operational early warning satellites were in geostationary orbit.
    DOD would seek to improve coverage and mission duration and continue
    development of a simplified processing station. Two Lincoln Experi-
    mental Satellites, comsats LES 8 and 9 scheduled for 1975 launch, would
    use radioisotope thermoelectric generators instead of solar cell arrays.
       The Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS), which could
    cover up to 5600 km, would be expanded. DOD was working on detectors,
    target discrimination, data processing, and other critical optical and
    radar components, to reach a near-real-time ground-based capability by
    FY 1978 to detect, track, and identify all objects up to 36000-km alti-
    tude. (Transcript; Aw Wk, April 74,20)

    Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United
                      successfully launched 7 satellites and 180 sounding

    $101.4 million for 1964-1966 to $405.6 million for 1972-1974. Employ-
    ment had risen from 450 in 1964 to 1200 in 1974. The anniversary
    would be the last for ESRO, which was to be incorporated within the new
    European Space Organization.
       Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, wrote Dr. Alexander
    Hocker, ESRO Director General: â€œWe on the â€˜working levelâ€™ of NASA who

21 March: The success of Skylabâ€™s Apollo Telescope Mount solar experi-
    ment was more than a milestone in space exploration, Dr. John Eddy,
    solar physicist of the Boulder, Colo., High Altitude Observatory, said in
    a New Scientist article. This battery of the worldâ€™s most advanced tele-
    scopes lofted to the ideal observation site had clarified previous theoret-
    ical sketches of the vertical extent of the sunâ€™s chromospheric structures.
    Spicules, which outlined the giant circulation cells of the chromosphere
    and extended through the transition region, disappeared at temperatures
     of 1million K in the low corona, suggesting that the magnetic field lines
    diverged in the corona.

       First results from the ATM x-ray observations destroyed the common
    concept of a homogeneous background corona, which had served as a
    basis of modern coronal physics, and revealed that d e corona was com-
    posed almost entirely of closed loop structures fitting magnetic field lines
    calculated from observed photosphericfields.
       Reasons for the ATM success included the large-scale and highly so-
    phisticated instruments, large data-storage capaâ€™bility, efficiency of instru-
    ment operation, operation of the six instruments in concert, extensive
    ground support, and astronaut interest and training. Program results
    would be shared by scientists in many countries and the program ap-
    peared a good investment, in scientific yield per dollar spent. (New

23 March-5 April: NASAâ€™s Mariner 10,launched 3 Nov. 1973, became the first
    spacecraft to explore Mercury, during a 12-day flyby of the planet-
    returning some 1700 TV photos and much new information on its at-
    mosphere, surface, mass, and shape.
       The incoming encounter sequence began 23 March at 5 600 000 km
    from Mercury, transmitting d e clearest photos yet taken of the tiny
    planet. Although most of the photos were recorded on tape before trans-
    mission, real-time photos with reduced resolution were sent to analyze
    the reflective properties of Mercury at different lighting angles. By 28
    March photos were showing the,planet to be heavily cratered like the
    moon.
       During the incoming near-encounter, from 17 to 31/2 hrs before en-
    counter, 18 frames were transmitted. Mosaics were made for locating
    smaller areas photographed later at higher resolutions. Spacecraft in-
    struments identified an extremely thin atmosphere surrounding the
    planet, containing helium at concentrations above lunar levels and small
    amounts of neon, argon, and possibly zenon.
       Mariner 10 passed within 704 km of Mercury at 4:47 pm EDT 29
    March, within 56 km of the aim point. Data were transmitted without
    interruption over the 150 000 000-km distance until earth occultation
    began at 4:50 pm EDT. Radio signals were recovered following the 12-
    min occultation. Photos of the planet-described by scientists at Jet Pro-
    pulsion Laboratory as â€œsuperbâ€˜-showed details less than 1.6 km in size

     and covered almost half the planetâ€™s surface, which was pocked with
     craters as deep as 32 km and between 8 and 160 km wide. Giant cracks
     in the surface suggested high heat beneath. Some ancient volcanic activ-
     ity was seen in a few rille-like ravines that crossed the craters and dome-
     like hills. Absence of halo craters indicated young craters probably had
     been covered by the dust storms that constantly swept the planet. At a
     JPL press briefing following the encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher said
     onboard instruments showed that Mercury had an unexpected magnetic
     field, estimated to be 1% that of the earth. The magnetic field was meas-
     ured at 90 to 100 gammas at the ~pacecraft~s      closest approach, with an
     extrapolated value at the surface of 100to 200 gammas.
        As Mariner 10 raced by Mercury on 30 March, photos of the morning
     side of the planet showed a much smoother region than the rugged area
     seen under the afternoon sun. The north pole region appeared much less
     pitted and flatter than the south pole. Instruments found that Mercury
     was two-thirds iron, making its density greater than previously believed
     and probably responsible for the unexpected magnetic field. Concentra-
     tions of uranium and thorium were comparable to those on the earth.
        Preliminary results, presented at a 31 March press conference at JPL,
     included a Mercury mass measurement 100 times better than previous
     ones, a detached well-defined bow shock wave, a temperature varying
     from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side ( - 300Â°F to SOOOF)
     with no thermal anomalies detected, opaque surface soil with the top
     few centimeters 1.0 to 1.5 times as dense as water and 50% as porous,
     and high-energy electrons in the mev range observed from 700 to 5000
     km above the surface. An ultraviolet scanner had detected what appeared
     to be an egg-shaped moon moving in orbit around Mercury, but the Mari-
     ner navigational team later identified the object as a dim but very hot
     star, known as 31 Crater in the constellation Corvus.
        Despite a power anomaly, Mariner 10 continued to transmit TV pic-
     tures in real-time at 117.6 kilobits per sec and tape-recorded frames at
   â€˜ 22.05 kbps. TV imagery was discontinued 5 April when tlie resolution

     became equal to that of earth-based telescopes.
        All mission events were accomplished as planned and the mission was
      adjudged successful 22 April. The spacecraft was expected to swing back
     by Mercury in September. (NASA MOR, 24 April 74; JPL Press Kit,

    all that. The US.planned to operate five shuttles, each one carrying more
    than 27 000 kg of satellites and space machinery into orbit 12 times a
    year, to â€œimprove the quality of life on earth and to find out if life exists
    elsewhere in the solar system.â€ By the end of the 1980s the U.S. would
    have visited eight of the solar systemâ€™s nine planets; the only exception
    was Pluto.
         While one part of the space agency looked at the other planets, another
    would be looking down to learn more about the earthâ€™s health. The next
    20 yrs would see an unprecedented use of earth orbit to observe and
    communicatewith the earth. Oâ€™Toole quoted Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA
    Administrator, as saying that the earth orbit might become overcrowded.
    Not that things would bump into each other but â€œthere will not be
    enough radio frequencies to communicate back to earth.â€ (W Post,

  ∞New US. proposals might help lead to a new agreement at the stalemated

    Post. Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of State, arriving in MOSCOW,
    would submit to the U.S.S.R. two formulas to establish equivalence be-
    tween nuclear forces. Formula one would bring overall equality in total
    numbers of land-based missiles, sea-launched missiles, and long-range
    bombers. Within the total, each side would determine its own mix of
    forces. Formula two would deveIop equality in land-based missile throw
    weight, a better way to guard against a Soviet first strike on US. missiles
    than to seek control of multiple independently targetable vehicles. No
    MIRY controls were proposed. Working principles contained no numbers,
    leaving open the question of whether US. missiles were to be increased,
    Soviet missiles decreased, or both lowered. ( W Post, 24 March 74, 3;

    phere was made up of an inert gas, probably argon, Tass quoted Prof.
    Vasily I. Moroz as reporting in Zzvestiya. The data would substantiate
    Soviet scientistsâ€™ belief that several million or even several hundred
    thousand years ago Mars had an atmosphere with a density close to that
    of the earth. In addition, data from Mariner 9 (launched 30 May 1971)
    and Mars 5 had shown that the planet had had surface water and might
    L L acquire it again, for such changes take place during the planetâ€™s geo-

     sary for the emergence of life. The reappearance of such periods in the
    future is not ruled out.â€
         The Western press later quoted US. scientists as saying that the pres-
    ence of large amounts of argon would have LLdramatic          implicationsâ€
     and would tend to support the theory that the Martian climate had been
     going through a series of cycles during which ice ages alternated with
     warmer and wetter conditions. But Dr. Carl E. Sagan of Cornel1 Univ.
     said during a telephone interview that the 90% content of carbon dioxide
     in the Martian atmosphere had been well established, so that â€œat most
     10% of argon was barely possible.â€ (FBISSOV, March 74, U1;

∞The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciencesâ€™ Subcommittee

    on Aviation held hearings to determine whether the Federal Aviation
    Administration and McDonnell Douglas Corp. had dealt adequately with
    cargo door problems on the DC-IO aircraft. Experts believed that the
    door had caused a 12 June 1972 near crash in Canada and the 3 March
    1974 crash outside Paris that killed all 346 persons aboard.
       Documents had revealed that, following the Canadian incident, the
         had drafted an airworthiness directive requiring three improvements
    FAA
    in the suspect rear cargo door. McDonnell Douglas appealed to the FAA,
    which then agreed to let the company issue voluntary service bulletins.
    An inspection of all 134 in-service DC-10s after the Paris crash had
    showed that two aircraft, including the Turkish airliner, had not been
    modified despite McDonnell Douglas records to the contrary.
        Seven months after the Canadian incident the FAA,at the suggestion
    of the National Transportation Safety Board, had asked the company
    to consider a redesign of the vital systems, reinforcement of thepassenger
    cabin floor, and more pressure vents. In a 25 Feb. 1974 letter to the FA
                                                                          A ,

During March: Apollo 17: Preliminary Science Report (NASA SP-330), dated
    1973, was issued. The Taurus-Littrow landing site for the 7-19 Dec.
    1972 final mission of the lunar landing program had been the most di-
    verse in both geologic features and samples brought back. Seismic trav-

    km. The traverse gravimeter experiment had provided limits to the den-
    sity of underlying material and permitted development of models to help
    interpret mascons. Analysis of mare basalts from the ApoEo 11,12,15,
    and 17 missions and from the U.S.S.R.â€™s Luna 16 indicated that the fill-
    ing of the mare basins took place mostly between 3.2 billion and 3.8

    14,16, 17 missions showed a widespread occurrence of breccias with
         and
    an apparent age of 3.8 billion to 4.1 billion yrs, with strong evidence
    that rocks as old as 4.5 billion to 4.6 billion yrs existed on the moon.
    Dark mare regions were thought to be underlain by lava, but craters had
    been mostly caused by impacting projectiles. The moon was once active
    volcanically but was now quiet, with any activity since 3 billion yrs ago
    highly restricted or nonexistent. It had a crust more than 60 km thick
    and a negligibIe overall magnetic field.
       Two theories of lunar evolution had come from mission data. The
    first was that the planet was chemically layered during its formation,
    with a low interior temperature gradualIy increasing, perhaps reaching
    the melting point in the last billion years, while the initial heat of the
    exterior gradually decreased. The second theory assumed that the moon,
    chemically homogeneous and molten during formation, underwent
    extensive chemical differentiation resulting in surface concentration of
    radioactivity very shortly after formation. None of the three theories
    of origin of the moon-separation from the earth, capture from a solar
    orbit, or formation from a dust cloud--could be absolutely eliminated
    by data collected to date, but chemical differences made it unlikely that
    the moon was torn from the earth. (Text)
∞Experiments carried out during the U.S.S.R.'s eight-day Soyuz 13 mission
    launched 18 Dec. 1973 were further evidence that the U.S.S.R. was con-
    tinuing manned space station efforts, a Spaceflight article said. The
    flight had included the Oasis 2 experiment, part of a plan to demonstrate
    that biological closed-cycle life support systems could be used for large
    space stations and other long-duration manned missions. Observation
    of stars in the ultraviolet range with the Orion 2 telescope was also a
    continuing program related to space station activity. Cosmonaut Kon-
    stantin P. Feoktistov had said in a statement to the British Interplane-
    tary Society that, in the years between the Soyuz 11 tragedy in June
     1971 and the Soyuz 12 mission in September 1973, design engineers
    had been analyzing the performance of all spacecraft systems and mak-
    ing modification and improvements. He stressed that work on manned
    space stations was continuing because of the importance of these stations
     in the exploration of natural resources. Soyuz 12 and Soyuz 13 crews had
    made multispectral photos of the earth's surface. (SF, March 74, 110)

1 April: Construction of the $22-million runway for the space shuttle was
    begun at Kennedy Space Center after a brief ground-breaking ceremoqy
    at the construction site northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building.
    Dr. Debus, KSC Director, said the shuttle would lead to a â€œnew era of

    a 75 000-kg spacecraft returning from space at a 15â€ to 20Â° angle and
    at a speed of nearly 295 km per hr. More than 8000 km of grooves in
    the surface would permit drainage and prevent hydroplaning while
    landing in the rain. To reduce the speed of the returning shuttle, astro-
    nauts would have the help of brakes, parachutes, and a net at the end
    of the runway. The runway was scheduled for July 1976 completion.

2 April: Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science,
    testified in FY 1975 authorization hearings before the Senate Commit-
    tee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that Orbiting Solar Observa-
    tory OSO-I, scheduled for 1975 launch into orbit, was expected to acquire
    ultraviolet solar spectra of the most detailed resolution ever obtained.
    Spacecraft and experiment assembly was to be complete by mid-1974.
    A cooperative program with the European Space Research Organization,
    called International Sun-Earth Explorers (ISEE) , planned three satel-
    lites to make simultaneous measurements. Two spacecraft, â€œMotherâ€
    built by the US. and â€œDaughterâ€ built by ESRO, would travel close to-
    gether in the same highly elliptical orbit, measuring magnetic and elec-
    tric fields, energetic particles, and plasma properties. The third space-
    craft, called â€œHeliocentricâ€ and built by the US., would be placed near
    one of the unique points in space where the earthâ€™s and sunâ€™s gravity
    balance each other. The spacecraft would travel around the sun and
    close to the earth to learn what radiation was impinging on the earthâ€™s
    magnetosphere. Data from the three satellites would help to untangle
    spatial from temporal changes in radiation fields around the earth. A
    cooperative effort with ESRO and the United Kingdom would be the
    hternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) scheduled for launch into
    geosynchronous orbit in 1976 to observe high-resolution spectra in the

      mittee on Aviation that he had directed FAA offices to issue airworthiness
      directives to correct all safety-related aircraft design changes. Such
      directives carried the force of law and required FAA inspection. In addi-
      tion, all safety-related functions of the FAA were being centralized under
      one official. The FAA was also studying ways to prevent rapid decom-
      pressurization on jumbo jets after accidents. The actions followed in-
      vestigations of the 3 March Turkish Airlines, Inc., DG-10 crash outside
      Paris that had killed all 346 persons aboard. By 14 May, 43 airworthiness
      directives and 7 telegrams had been issued, nearly double the usual rate.

∞Pan American World Airways, Inc., and Trans World Airlines, Inc., each
    petitioned the Civil Aeronautics Board for subsidies. Pan Am sought
    a $195-million-a-yearmail subsidy because of a pending financial crisis
    following six years of losses, including an expected net loss of $65
    million in 1974. In addition to a huge debt, Pan Am had been hit by
    foreign competition, sharp drops in traffic, overcapacity (half-empty
    Boeing 747 transports), and soaring costs, including a $200-million
    annual increase in fuel costs. TWA asked a temporary subsidy to offset
    fuel costs, estimating 1974 international losses would be $47 miIIion-

8-12 April: Mariner 10 closeup photos of Mercury taken 23 March-5 April
     showed that many large basinlike features on the planet appeared to be
     flooded by lava, Dr. Bruce C. Murray-California rnstitute of Technology
     scientist and head of the Mariner 10 photo inierpretation team-reported
     to the American Geophysical Unionâ€™s annual meeting in Washington,
     D.C. The apparent volcanic outpourings indicated that Mercury like
     the earth had a massive iron-rich core, hidden beneath a battered, heavily
     cratered, moonlike crust, making Mercury â€œa unique planet in the solar
     systemâ€ and serving as important evidence in deciphering the primordial
     history of the solar system. The latest results from Mariner 10â€™s encoun-
     ter with the planet showed the outer portions of Mercury to be made of
     silicate-rich rocks, suggesting the planet had undergone considerable
     melting in its history, with heavier materials sinking to the center of the
     planet and lighter silicates rising to the surface. Analysis also showed that
     craters might have existed from the time the planet was formed by a
      great influx of cosmic debris 4 billion to 4.5 billion years ago, with no
     great internal surface-shaping processes since then. (UPI, NYT, 13 April

    Jupiter science press briefing in Washington, D.C. The heat sources
    caused the atmospheric gases to rise locally to lower pressures. As the
    altitude increased the gases condensed, forming the aerosols that colored
    the clouds. The aerosols then sank and were again evaporated by the
    higher pressures and temperatures, creating an up-and-down circular
    motion within the red spot. Dr. Gehrels said that the spot â€œis not a unique
    feature.â€ Pioneer 10 photos showed other areas of rising clouds. â€œWe see
    quite a few of these that occur in equatorial regions.â€
        Dr. James A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa scientist, said that Jupiter had
    been identified for the first time as a source of energetic particle emis-
    sions. The earth had been known to be a feeble emitter but Jupiter emit-
    ted particles at a strength detectable from fractions of an astronomical
    unit up to four or five AU from Jupiter. The discovery had dramatically
    changed interplanetary science from its traditional hypothesis that
    energetic particles observed in spztce had come only from the sun or from
    local acceleration. (Transcript)
∞NASA announced the Delta 100 Failure Review Committee had concluded
    that the failure of the mor-Delta launch vehicle 2nd stage during the 18

     entific studies with immediate application to life on earth but build
     permanent space stations and launch planetary vehicles and eventually

         Cosmonautics is one of the most important testing ranges of science
     in which many directions of science and technology are being syn-
     thesized into a single constantly perfecting system,â€ Soviet Academician
     VaIentin Glushko wrote in Pravda. The successes of cosmonautics in the
     preceding 15 to 20 yrs had given a powerful impetus to various
     branches of knowledge. The initial accumulation of facts by spacecraft
     had been completed. On the agenda now was the detailed study of
     dynamic processes, the interconnection of phenomena, and the verifica-
     tion of hypotheses and models.
        Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, acknowl-
     edged in an interview with Sovietskaya Rossiya the importance of
     orbital stations for future space experiments. He also acknowledged
     that Soviet designers had not yet been able to develop a satisfactory
     space shuttle. He said the U.S.S.R. had no plans for a manned landing
     on the moon. His impassioned defense of the Soviet space program
     suggested that it, like the U.3. program, was under fire by domestic
     critics; â€œmany millions of rublesâ€ had been saved because of the use of
     meteorological satellites.
        In Trud, Academician Boris N. Petrov, head of the Council of Inter-
     national Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use under the Soviet
     Academy of Sciences, said that manned flights â€œmust become more
     frequent and more extendedâ€ to produce â€œreally creative work for
     specialists of many branches of science.â€ (Tass, FBIS-SOV, April16

 23-23 April: NASA launched Westar 1 (Westar-A), the first US.commercial
     domestic communications satellite, for Western Union Telegraph Co.
      from Eastern Test Range at 7:33 pm EDT on a Thor-Delta launch vehi-
     cle, the first with the TR-201 2nd-stage propulsion unit. One of the
     nine Castor motors strapped onto the booster failed to jettison until
     main engine cutoff, decreasing vehicle velocity. Propellant reserves in
     the 2nd stage provided sdlicient additional velocity, however, to put the
     satellite in the planned transfer orbit with a 36 238-km apogee, 230-km
     perigee, and 24.7â€ inclination. Nonmission-related 2nd-stage mveuver-
     ing experiments, which were to use the propellant reserves, were not
     performed. NASAâ€™s    mission objectiveto place the satellite in a trans-
     fer orbit that would allow onboard propulsion to pIace it in a stationary

    adjudged successful 23 April.
       Westar 1 was acquired by a mobile ground station at 9:38 pm EDT
    and control was turned over to Western Union. The satellite apogee
    motor was successfully fired at 5:21 pm EDT 16 April and Westar 1 was
    placed in geosynchronous orbit with a 35 592-km apogee, 35 166-km
    perigee, 23-hr 35-min period, and 0.6' inclination. An onboard hydra-
    zine reaction control system was moving the satellite toward its final
    position above the equator at 99' W longitude.
       Each of 12 pawponders aboard Westar 1 could relay 1200 voice
    circuits, 1color TV channel with program audio, or data at 50 megabits
                   
    per sec. The Westar system-including one satellite to be launched in
    June, one satellite to be held in reserve, and five earth stations-would
    greatly increase Western Union's capacity for commercial and personal
    communications. Expected to be operational in August, the system would
    be the first to interconnect, under one company, satellites and an exist-
    ing continent-wide, computer-switched,multipurpose terrestrial network.

14 April: Stratospheric contamination from supersonic aircraft engines such
    as those fitted to the Anglo-French Concorde and the Soviet Tu-144
    might lower the earth's mean temperatures, with a catastrophic effect
    on agriculture, and increase the incidence of skin cancer from over-
    exposure to ultraviolet radiation, according to a Dept. of Transportation
    study cited by the Washington Post. In a telephone interview with the
    Post Dr. Alan Grobecker, manager of DOT'S climatic impact assessment
    program, confirmed the existence of the study, which was based on data
    collected by satellites, balloons, and instrumented aircraft. He empha-
    sized that the pollution by the emission of nitrogen oxide and sulfur
    dioxide would have a worldwide impact because of the capacity of the
    stratosphere to retain the pollutants for nearly a year. A separate Agri-
    cultural Research Service study showed that stratospheric contamination
    could cut temperate climate crops by 60%. The DOT paper would be
    considered by committees of the National Academy of Sciences and the
    National Academy of Engineering at a special meeting in July. (Wilson,

∞Skylab was an achievement that will ultimately benefit every inhabitant
    of this planet,â€ Robert Hotz wrote in an Aviation Week & Space Tech-
    nology editorial. Further, â€œin addition to their constant work as space
    mechanics, the Skylab crews demonstrated that man is a valuable addi-
    tion to the loop of scientific experiments and activities that can be per-

    an integral part of any future space reconnaissancesystem.
        â€œBut perhaps the real essence of Skylabâ€˜s performance and its signifi-
    cance for future space operations were in its tremendous flexibility.â€
    Besides design, planning, and extra equipment, â€œit was a spirit developed
    between the ground crews with their considerable array of resources and
    the flight crews who were able to focus these resources on solving their
    problems aloft.â€ One astronaut had said, â€œSkylab worked better broken
    than anybody had hoped for if it was perfect.â€ ( A v Wk, 15 April 74,9)

16 April: â€œI am sure life will move out from the Earth, probably first to the
    Moon and then to Mars,â€ Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Deputy Associate
    Administrator, said in a speech reviewing NASAâ€™s       planetary program
    before the National Space Club. Just what form of life would be trans-
    planted, whether man or some simple organism, would be the subject of
     debate. Four planets- Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Mercury-had already
    been visited. The next major event would be the Viking landings on
    Mars in 1976. Historically, two significant events in 1965 had determined
    the direction of the planetary program. The first was c study at Woods
     Hole, Mass., which had recommended that the space program, following
     Apollo, should search for life on the planets and give first priority to
    the study of Mars-while also maintaining a wide-ranging program of
     general planetary exploration-because Mars most closely resembled the
     earth and was the most likely to support life. The second event, the
     14 July 1965 flight of Mariner 4 past Mars, supported the recommenda-
     tions when it found evidence of water in the Martian atmosphere.
                                            ..
        â€œIn retrospect, I think the decision . has been sound.â€ But a major
     decision that faced NASA this summer, one year before the launch of
     Viking, was whether there should be follow-on Viking missions. â€œShould
                                                                          ...

  ∞Aerospace companies that had succeeded in using the system approach to

     article said. Boeing Co. Aerospace Div. faced losses of up to $6 million
     on an automated â€œpeople moverâ€ shuttle system in Morgantown, W. Va.
     Cost of the project, chosen four years ago as a pilot application of aero-
     space management techniques, had jumped from the original estimate
     of $13.4 million to $115 million. Rohr Industries, Inc., had lost more
     than $10 million on a project to build 450 commuter cars for the San
     Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System, which had threatened to
     sue Rohr over late deliveries and alleged unreliability of same cars.
     Observers had noted that aerospace technologists tended to â€œoverengi-
     neerâ€ transit systems, increasing costs, aggravating maintenar.ce, and
     marring reliability. In addition there were problems in converting pro-
     totypes to hardware that could withstand the rigors of carrying throngs

21-25 April: Observations of Comet Kohoutek in December and January and
    sudden changes in brightness of the more recent Comet Bradfield had led
    to the theory that comets were layered like onions, Dr. Edward P. Ney,
    Univ. of Minnesota scientist, reported at a joint meeting of the American
    Physical Society and the Optical Society of America. When some layers
    were exposed, they shone brilliantly; when a layer wore off, the comet
    might abruptly become dim. The onion model would explain why predic-
    tions of Kohoutekâ€™s brilliance were so inaccurate and why Bradfield had
     suddenly dimmed to 100th its previous brilliance.
       Dr. Alastair G. W. Cameron, Harvard College Observatory scientist,
    said that an enormous spherical cloud of comets with a combined mass
     20 times that of Jupiter might lie beyond the planets and form a far more
    massive part of the universe than the planets. This cloud, the Oort cloud,
     might be a repository for heavy elements formed since the infancy of the
    Milky Way.
       Dr. R. W. Klebesadel of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory said
     that satellites, placed in a 100000-km orbit as part of the Air Force
    Vela series developed to monitor the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has
    monitored 27 high-intensity explosions in space over four years. The
    explosions, which had produced unusually large amounts of gamma
     and x-ray energy, might be in the Orion arm of the galaxy, where the
    earth was. Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
    nology said nine current theories of the origin of the explosions included
    exploding stars, or supernovae; objects falling into neutron stars; and
    unusually large solar flares or sunstorms on distant stars. (Sullivan,

    previous Skylab crews in their ability to walk and run upon return to
    earth had been solved by a very crude treadmill device used to simulate
    walking and running. "We worked at it every day, and the condition we
    came back in was good testimony to the utility of that device."

    nutrient fluids, the National Science Foundation announced. If the es-
    timate of the age proved correct, the bacteria would be the oldest ex-
     amples of life ever found on the earth. Results of the project, spdnsored
    by NSF and NASAâ€™s extraterrestrial life detection program, would add
    weight to the theory that some forms of life might be frozen into the
    permafrost of planets such as Mars. The bacteria had been found at a
    depth of about 130 m near the main US.base on Ross Island. Later sam-
     ples also had been found in Taylor Valley 95 km away. A senior scientist
    in the project, Dr. Roy E. Cameron of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said
    in a telephone interview with the New York Times that rod-shaped,

     ment (LACATE) balloon was launched at 12:00 midnight EDT by a joint
     Government-industry team from White Sands Missile Range in a Langley
     Research Center project. An onboard 10-band infrared radiometer,
     being tested for use on the planned Nimbus-G satellite, measured ver-
     tical profiles of radiance emitted by the earthâ€™s atmospheric limb. The
     profiles would provide basic data on temperature, ozone, nitrogen di-
      oxide, water vapor, nitric acid, nitrous oxide, methane, and particles in
     the upper atmosphere and lower stratosphere, where high-flying jet air-
     craft operated. The 183-m-long, 137-m-wideY         helium-filled balloon-the
     largest ever launched from wSMR-reached its maximum stable altitude
      of 50 km three hours after launch. Measurements were made before,
      during, and after sunrise so that both day and night atmospheric effects
      could be studied. At flight termination the gondola and its parachute
      were released from the balloon and returned to the earth. (Langley Re-

6 May: NASA FY 1975 authorization bill H.R. 13998 was reported to the Sen-
      ate by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. The
      Committee authorization of $3.267 billion was $8.145 million higher
      than that passed by the House 25 April. It was equal to 1%of the total
      FY 1975 Federal budget and was $0.5 billion below the constant-level
      NASA budget endorsed by Congress two years earlier. The Committee
      had added $16 million to NASAâ€™s Feb. budget request, to fund procure-

 6-10 May: The possibility of self-sufficient colonies of men in space was dis-
      cussed at a conference of physicists, astronauts, and space flight tech-
      nologists at Princeton Univ. Dr. Gerald K. Oâ€™Neill, Princeton professor
      of physics, suggested that a colony for.2000 persons could be con-
      structed on a space station at the point in the moonâ€™s orbit where the
      gravitational fields of the earth and the moon balanced. The cylindrical
      station could be built within 15 to 20 yrs using the space shuttle to
      transport the 9000 metric tons of necessary building materials from the
      earth. The abundant materials available on the moon could be trans-
      ferred by a cargo-launching system. Dr. Oâ€™Neill pointed out that â€œvir-
      tually unlimitedâ€ resources existed in space, including a continuous
      source of energy from the sun and great chunks of almost pure uickel-
      iron from the Asteroid Belt. Increasingly large and cor,:plex stations
      could ensure that most â€œdirtyâ€ industry could be operating off the earth
      by the middle of the 21st century. Space colonies could also ensure the
      continuity of the human race. (Sullivan, NYT, 13 May 74, 1; OMSF,

    responsibility to build a technology base for aeronautics through inno-
    vative independent research in addition to undertaking directed research
     in response to specific problems. Also vitally important was NASAâ€™s    re-
    sponsiveness to the needs of other agencies. Airlines recommended a
    $24.5-million increase in funding for NASAâ€™s     aeronautical programs-
    for propulsion environment-impact minimization, aircraft operzltions,

      were â€œpenny wise and pound foolish.â€ Additional but â€œrelatively modestâ€
      funding would prevent the High Energy Astronomical Observatory
       (HEAO) program-which was to investigate the scientifically exciting
      black holes in space-from â€œlimping along.â€ Scientists had been skepti-
      cal of the usefulness of the space shuttle to science, but the SkyIab
      Apollo Telescope Mount discoveries had so far exceeded expectations
      that astronomers â€˜â€˜could hardly waitâ€ for the Large Space Telescope,
      planned for launch on the shuttle. â€œThat project unified the space science
      communityâ€ as â€œnothing ever did in the past.â€
         Other â€œlogical follow-onsâ€ to the approved program were urged:
      Mariner Jupiter-Uranus 1979 mission, Jupiter orbiter, Venus atmos-
      pheric probe, and a follow-on to the Viking Mars 1975 with a rover
      capability.
         Hartford also suggested that NASA and other Government agencies
      were not doing enough work in space applications. Cuts in NASAâ€™s     com-
      munications satellite research and development program had been based
      on the incorrect assumption that private industry could take on full
      comsat R&D with no further Government stimulus. Early commercial
      expIoitation of communications RC?D had been rapid only because Gov-
      ernment research had reduced risks to an acceptable level. Competition
      was now coming from Canadian, Japanese, and European organizations
      with â€œa lot of government backingâ€ who had developed a technical
      capability approaching that of the US. and were willing to take high
      risks. (Transcript)

      cents for a half kilogram to 31.5 cents in the preceding six months.
      One aerospace company was quoted as telling the Pentagon and NASA
      that the rising aluminum prices would increase its program costs 16%.
      Grumman Aircraft Corp. had said it was paying 25% more for titanium
      and aluminum than one year ago. Grumman manufactured six models
      of aircraft, including the Navyâ€™s F-14, which used more titanium than
      any other aircraft. Rockwell International Corp. had raised the esti-
      mated delivery cost of each of its B-1 bombers from $45 million to
      $61.5 million, at least partly because of soaring aluminum and titanium
      prices. Each B-1 required 12 000 kg of titanium and 24 000 kg of
      aluminum. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 8 May 74)

    stage Thor-Delta'launch vehicle was less than normal. The 2nd stage
    burned to near propellant completion, compensating for the deficiency
    but leaving insufficient propellant to complete the planned second burn.
    The spacecraft entered a lower-than-pjannedtransfer orbit with a 32 895-
    km apogee, 180-km perigee, 9-hr 37-min period, and 24.5' inclination.

    and 2.0" inclination, with an eastward drift of approximately 56"
    per day.
       The auxiliary propulsion system was fired at 3:OO am EDT 19 May to
    place the spacecraft in operationaI attitude. A planned series of APS
    firings between 19 and 24 May increased the orbit to geosynchronous
    altitude, eliminated orbital drift, and stopped the satellite at 45" west
    longitude. An early post-launch review of flight data revealed no space-
    craft anomalies, and the first photos were transmitted 24 May.
        NASA objectives-to    launch the spacecraft into a geosynchronous
    orbit of sufficient accuracy to accomplish operational mission require

  ∞Science and technology might be stepping into a more important role in
    the conduct of foreign policy, a Science article said. During an April
    speech before the United Nations Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of
    State, had urged that we â€œnow apply science to the problems which science
    has helped to create.â€ He proposed international action in four areas:
     agricultural technology, birth control, energy, and weather. The Science
    article noted that access to US. technology had been a major induce-
    ment toward d6tente for the U.S.S.R. and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.
    Although the speech had made no specific commitments, the proposals,
    announced by the Secretary of State, became U S . Government policy.
    By calling on science to help solve the worldâ€™s problems, â€œKissinger

     fessor of metallurgy at IIarvard Univ., as saying the new process-
     developed by a university-industry team funded by NASA and the Na-
     tional Science Foundation--could cut solar cell production costs by
     95%. With the new cells, a system that could produce 1kw of electricity
    would cost $350; a system using conventional silicon-crystal cells cost
     between $20 000 and $100 000. In the new process, molten silicon ma-
     terial was pulled into long thin ribbons and cut into various lengths.

  ∞A New York Times editorial commented on the Atomic Energy Commis-
     sion report The Nationâ€™s Energy Future, submitted December 1973 to
     President Nixon: The report, which was the basis â‚¬or Administration
     policy, would allocate more than half the proposed energy research and
     development budget to nuclear projects. More than 25% of nuclear
     funds would be spent on the fast-breeder reactor. Three critical questions
     were in need of answers: risk of accident, security against theft, and the
     relative merit of alternative forms of energy. An AEC environmental im-
     pact statement issued in response to a court order in a 1971 suit by a
     group of scientists failed, the Times said, to weigh objectively the
     possible alternatives that might be environmentally less damaging, par-
     ticularly solar energy. â€œBut in making the choice between nuclear fission
     and solar energy, Congress and the public have to weigh the alternatives
     carefully. The A.E.C. can contribute to that decision by offering the nation
      a more careful and disinterested impact statement.â€ (NYT, 23 May 74,

    apogee and 25-km perigee 9 June to take detaiIed TV photos of the
    lunar surface and to study surface relief using an onboard altimeter.
    Chemical composition of rocks was obtained by determining the gamma
    radiation. After completion of the photography program the spacecraft
    was moved to an orbit with a 299-km apogee and 181-km perigee. By 19

    to the program plan. At 3:29 pm EDT, Ats 6 was injected into geosyn-
    chronous orbit with a 35 %5.6-km apogee, 35 774.1-km perigee, 23-hr
    57-min period, and 1.8" inclination. The near-perfect orbit eliminated
    need for corrections, leaving nine kilograms of fuel for operational con-
    tingencies. The spacecraft separated from the transtage at 3 3 3 pm EDT.
       An orbital correction 7 June changed the 0.27"-per-day westward
    drift to a 0.05" eastward drift. Checkout of spacecraft systems and on-
    board experiments was completed 28 June with no significant anomalies.
    The mission was adjudged a success 26 Sept.
       Primary objectives of the mission were to inject the spacecraft into
    near-geostationary orbit, erect and evaluate a nine-meter antenna to
    provide a good-quality signal to small inexpensive ground receivers,
    stabilize the spacecraft using a three-axis control system, and support
    user-oriented applications experiments. Secondary objectives were to
    demonstrate new technology in aircraft and maritime traffic control and
    infrared earth observations; acquire system data for communications
    applications in space, including spacecraft-to-spacecraftrelay ; test space-
    craft control; and measure particles and radiation. The 20 experiments
    included a health-education telecommunications experiment to broad-
    cast programs in several languages simultaneously to citizens in remote
    areas of the country. The satellite also would aid in remote medical
    telediagnosis and teleconsultation, transmitting patients' medical rec-
    ords to faraway hospital centers for emergency assistance.
       One year after launch Ats 6 would be moved over Lake Victoria in
    Central Africa. India would then use the satellite to broadcast programs
    teaching agricultural techniques, family planning and hygiene, school
    courses and teacher education, and occupational skills to 5000 villages.
    The $600 ground receiving terminals each consisted of a receiver, con-
    verter, and three-meter chicken-wire antenna.
       Ats 6 was the sixth in a series of ATS satellites developed to advance
    technology in design, propulsion, and stabilization systems; meteorolog-
    ical concepts; applications ; space environmental studies and measure-
    ment systems; and communications. Ats I (launched 6 Dec. 19661, Ats 3

     considered establishment of a worldwide forum for presentation of data
     requirements by users, creation of a mechanism for filing launch plans
     and distributing advance information on capabilities to potential users
     of planned satellites, and prospects for training users to interpret and
     apply data from advanced satellites. Talks were held concurrently on
     technical standardization of systems, including preliminary standards
     for ground stations, coordination of transmission times and frequencies,
     and standardization of automatic-picture-transmission installations.

4-18 June: A team of 15 scientists led by Dr. Thomas A. Mutch of Brown
    Univ. tested the Viking lander camera in an area of Colorado with geo-
    logic conditions similar to those expected on Mars. With photo-diodes
    in the focal plane instead of film, the camera used a nodding mirror to
    reflect the image through the lenses onto the diode one line at a time.
    The entire camera was then rotated to scan the next line. Because the
    image was sequentially acquired, at five lines per second, several minutes
    were needed to obtain a complete photograph. The landerâ€™s two-camera
    system would provide color, black-and-white, infrared, and stereoscopic
    views of the Martian surface and photometric information to help deter-
    mine sizes and composition of Martian soil samples, monitor the opacity
    of the Martian atmosphere, and record the position of the sun and
    brighter planets for precise location of the lander on Mars. (NASA Re-

5 June: The space shuttle would introduce a new mode of, space research in
    the 1980s, Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator,
    said at a space transportation system press briefing in Washington, D.C.
    Sounding rockets gave the scientist an immediate return of data but only
    for a very short-duration flight. Satellites provided longer mission times
    but itâ€™might be five to seven years from the initiation of the project until

    data were received. Experiments flown on the shuttle could remain in
    orbit from 7 to 30 days and then be returned immediately for evaluation.
    This capability would be a powerful tool in the development of new
    technology.
       Dr. Myron S. Malkin, Space Shuttle Program Director, said NASAâ€™s
    commitment to Congress called for a total development cost of $5.15
    billion in 1971 dollars for two operational shuttle vehicles plus $10.5
    million for each of 725 missions projected for 1980-1990. Mission costs
    would be shared by participating experimenters, and estimates were now
    running at $9.05 million per flight because of reduced estimates for ex-
    ternal tank development. Cost for a shuttle flight, which could take
    29 500 kg into orbit, contrasted with $18 million for a 4500-kg payload
    launched on an expendable Atlas booster and up to $58 million to orbit
    14 000-18 000 kg on a Saturn IB.
       Shuttle development was on schedule; the first approach and landing
    tests were to be in the second quarter of 1977 and the first manned orbi-
    tal flight in 1979. Orbiter manufacture was under way. The main engine
    oxygen burner had been tested 14 April and the first big engine firing
    was scheduled for the end of 1975. NASA would need a fleet of seven orbi-
    ters at $250 million each if the projected missions were flown. Elwood W.
    Land, Jr., of the Space Shuttle Systems Officesaid a 25-astronaut flight
    corps probably would be maintained to fly missions averaging more
    than one a week.
       LeRoy E. Day, Space Shuttle Program Deputy Director, reported the
    main engine was being designed to make 55 starts before refurbish-
    ment was necessary. Engine lifetime would be much longer. The solid
    boosters were being designed for 20 flights. Phillip E. Culbertson, Di-
    rector of Mission and Payload Integration, said that all but the small-
    est expendable launch vehicles would be phased out about three years
    after the shuttle became operational. (Transcript)
∞The European Space Research Organization decided to award a 8226-mil-

    as prime contractor heading a European team to design and develop
    Spacelab, the reusable, manned laboratory to be carried into orbit on
             space shuttle in the 1980s. The unanimous decision, made at a
    NASAâ€™s
    Paris meeting of ESROâ€™S Administrttive and Finance Committee, fol-
    lowed six weeksâ€™ evaluation of two industrial proposals. The second
    proposal had been submitted by Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm. The

    fied and ready for installation of experiments, by April 1979. Two engi-
    neering models and three sets of ground support equipment and initial
    spares would also be delivered.

  ∞Satellite observations had been used by National Oceanic and Atmospheric
     Administration scientists to map the fading-or "recovery phase"-of
     the mammoth, layered ring of hot charged particles that encircled the
     earth during magnetic storms and temporarily canceled the earth's mag-
     netic field, NOAA announced. Explorer 45, launched 15 Nov. 1971 into an
     elliptical orbit w t a good view of the ring current, had measured the
                       ih
     distribution of protons before, during, and after a major magnetic storm
     17 Dec. 1971. The NOM study found that interactions of hot and cold
     plasmas in the ring changed the pitch angle of the protons in relation to
     the magnetic lines of force, permitting some to escape. By mapping dis-
     tributions of proton pitch angles, researchers could predict what would
     happen during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm. (NOAA Release

5-6 June: Results of five years of aerodynamic loads research were presented
      at a YF-12 Flight Loads Symposium at Flight Research Center. Wind-
     tunnel tests and flight measurements of loads and deflections for the
      3200-km-per-hr research aircraft were shown to be in excellent agree-
      ment, and deflection due to loads and thermal effects could be predicted
      by ground calibrations. Recommendations included development of more
      accurate aerodynamic theories in the transonic range and thermal stress
      analysis and prediction methods for supersonic cruise aircraft with much
      larger transient temperature gradients from the skin to the primary
      structure than those experienced on the YF-12. (NASA Gen Mgt Rev Rpt,

    nauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Energy as part of a continuing series of
    hearings on solar energy. John V. Goldsmith, Jet Propulsion Labora-
    tory scientist, said the total annual U.S. production of photovoltaic solar
    cells was 50 to 75 kw, mostly for spacecraft systems. In space, solar-
    cell systems were without parallel but large-scale applications on the
    earth could not be achieved until systems could be produced in adequate
    volume at commercially competitive prices. Goldsmith recommended a
    large-scale photovoltaic technology development program and said that
    a terrestrial photovoltaic system, with advantages of an inexhaustible
    energy source and minimal environmenal impact, could be reduced in
    cost from its current $30 per watt to an economically feasible $0.50 per
    watt by 1985 but would require Federal funding of more than $250
    million.
        Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, NASA Assistant Administrator for Energy
    Programs, said NASA was continuing investigations of orbiting satellite
    power stations. A microwave energy project was studying problems of
    processing large amounts of power. However, an orbiting power station
    would weigh 11 million kg and require a second-generation shuttle in
    addition to a nuclear-powered shuttle to put it into synchronous orbit.

∞Evidence revealed during US.-U.S.S.R. planning for the joint 1975
    Apollo-Soyuz Test Project had indicated the Soviet Union was never
    in the race to the moon, the Associated Press reported. US. officials had
    learned the Soyuz capsule was designed for relatively brief earth
    orbital flights and for ferrying cosmonauts to and from a space station,
    but it could not make a journey to the moon. AP quoted Astronaut
    Eugene A. Cernan, a member of the ASTP planning team, as saying,
    <C
       Our Apollo spacecraft is far, far more sophisticated and has got
    a greater capability than their Soyuz. That doesnâ€™t say the Soyuz is no
    good. It was just built for a different job.â€ In addition, Soyuz was
    designed to be controlled from the ground or by preautomated devices.
    â€œTheir spacecraft . . . is designed around a philosophy that it doesnâ€™t
    need a man to fly.â€ Cernan said that the U.S.S.R. â€œhad no major over-all
    goal like landing on the moon. Their goals were all to be first. Get the
                                                       .                   ..

∞Development of a new generation of communications satellites-such as
      Westar I (launched 13 April), Ats 6 (Applications Technology Satellite
      launched 30 May), and three others scheduled for launch in 1974 and
      1975-would bring the fifth revolution in human communications, Dr.
      Robert Jastrow, Director of NASAâ€™s Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
      said in a New Yurk Times article. The satellites would provide a â€œquan-
      tum jump in the capacity of Americans to talk to and see one another.â€
      The most immediate effect would be to reduce cost of long-distance com-
      munications and increase number of words and pictures sxchanged. Over-
      seas calls originating in the US. had jumped from about 10 million a
      year in 1965 to 60 million in 1973. Dr. Jastrow predicted that by 1982
      the US. would originate 1 billion overseas calls and a call halfway
      around the world would cost the same as a call next door.

        Other consequences might be a world language and the ability of
    people to live where they pleased. With an inexpensive satellite-trans-
    mitted dial-up conversation by color TV,people would not have to live
    in cities; â€œevery house can be transformed into an office, a theater, or a
    classroom by pressing a few buttons.â€ Long-term effects might knit man-
    kind into a global society, enriched by freer exchange of ideas and re-
    duced fear between nations. A unified global society, however, would be
     an organism of great collective power in which the individual would be

11, 12, 13,18 June: Hearings on H.R. 10392, a bill authorizing NASA to con-
     duct research on ground propulsion systems, were held by the House
     Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Space Science
     and Applications. Rep. Charles A. Vanik (D-Ohio) said that he was
     becoming impatient waiting â€œfor an energy efficientâ€American automo-
     bile which can meet our pollution standards.â€ It was â€œtime we truly in-
     volved N S - n a massive scale-in solving our earth-bound problems.â€

     Carl E. Nash of the Public Interest Research Group suggested that seri-
     ous consideration be given the Dept. of Transportation or the Environ-
     mental Protection Agency, rather than NASA, when giving authority for
     ground propulsion research and development, because these agencies had
     had more experience in the field.
         Sydney L. Terry, Vice President for PuTlic Responsibility and Con-
     sumer Affairs at Chrysler Corp., said many had questioned whether the
     Federal Government had a legitimate role in automotive propulsion tech-
     noloky, but Chrysler would â€œwelcome NASAâ€™s       interest in the automobile
     w i t h enthusiasm and hope.â€ NASAâ€™s   skill and experience in long-range
     basic research and in the fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid
     mechanics, and aerodynamics could contribute substantially to tlie devel-
      opment of efficient transportation. The way to proceed was by a â€œthought-
      ful division of research and development work between Government and
     industry.â€ (Transcript)

12 June: Effects of the shapes of trucks on air drag and fuel consumption were
    being studied by NASA and the Department of Transportation, NASA an-
    nounced. Trucks traveling 80 km per hr used more than half their engine
    horsepower to overcome drag. Preliminary tests had shown that a rec-
    tangular vehicle with rounded corners had 30% less air drag at 90 to
    95 km per hr and used 15% less fuel. Other configurations would be
    tested at Flight Research Center and DOTâ€™S Transportation Systems Cen-

∞No one was arguing against using the sun as an unlimited energy source
    but few saw it as an energy panacea, a Christian Science Monitor article
    said. With a firm commitment from the Government the sun could pro-
    vide as much as one fifth of U.S. energy needs before the end of the cen-
    tury. But solar energy faced high capital costs for development; inef-
    ficient solar-collecting devices; unsolved corrosion and freezing prob-
    lems for collectors; interfering building codes; lack of trained main-
    tenance personnel; scarcity of solar technology designers, architects, and
    engineers; and insufficient mortgage money available. Solar energy also
    competed for funding with a Government â€œbiasâ€ toward nuclear energy.
    Government research dollars ran â€œ25 to 1 in favor of nuclear energy.â€

    nounced. Three Brevard County, Fla., sites had been surveyed by a
    C 4 6 Curtis Commando aircraft equipped with a two-wavelength, multi-
    plex, synthetic aperture, sidelooking radar. Results indicated that radar
    was promising for rural and urban land use applications and water
    resources management, but water detection experimeptswere less encour-
    aging. The study was being conducted because photographic and TV
    sensors on spacecraft were limited to the visual or near-infrared wave-

25 June-19 July: The Salyut 3 research station and-nine days later-the
     Soyuz 14 spacecraft carrying a two-man crew were launched into near-
     earth orbit to establish a U.S.S.R. manned orbital workshop.
        Salyut 3 was launched at 4:55 am local time 25 June (7:55 pm EDT
     24 June) from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam into orbit with
     252-km apogee, 213-km perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination.
     Tass announced the purpose of the mission was to improve the stationâ€™s
     design, onboard systems, and equipment and to perform scientific re-
     search during space flight. By 30 June Salyut 3, which consisted of two
     cylinders more than 21 m in length and weighing some 18 500 kg, had
     been raised to a near-circular orbit with a 268-km apogee and 265-km
     perigee.
        Soyuz I4 was launched 3 July at 11:51 pm local time (2:51 pm EDT)
     from Baykonur Cosmodrome carrying Cosmonauts Pave1 R. Popovich,
     commander and veteran of the 12 Aug. 1962 Vostok 4 mission, and Yuri
     P. Artyukhin, flight engineer, to rendezvous with Salyut 3. The launch
     was seen by Soviet citizens by delayed broadcast on Moscow TV. The
     spacecraft entered orbit with a 338-km apogee, 201-km perigee, 89.9-
     min period, and 51.5â€ inclination. Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief
     of cosmonaut training, said during a 4 July Tass interview that the main
     objectives of the mission were â€œtesting methods and systems of control-
    ling the craft, improvement in the life-sustaining complex, [and]
     exploration of new possibilities of using both separate craft and groups
    of space objects to zccompIish scientific and applied tasks in a near-
     earth orbit.â€ Tass also reported that a 4 July trajectory correction placed
    the spacecraft in an orbit with a 277-km apogee, 255-km perigee, 89.7-
    min period, and 51.6â€ inclination. All spacecraft systems were success-
    fully checked out and the crew was reported to be in good health.
        The Soyuz 14 cosmonauts rendezvoused and docked with S d y u t 3 on
    5 July during their 17th orbit, successfully demonstrating techniques the
    Soviets would use during the July 1975 U.S.4.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz
    Test Project maneuvers. After docking, Popovich and Artyukhin checked
    the stationâ€™s onboard systems and microclimate and entered the 99-cu-m
    three-room laboratory.
        During their 15-day mission the cosmonauts studied geological-
    morphological objects on the earthâ€˜s surface, atmospheric formations
    and phenomena, physical characteristics of outer space, and manufactur-
    ing techniques, as well as testing the Salyut space stationâ€™s improved de-
    sign and solar-panel energy system. The crew aIso studied the influences
    of space on the human organism and exercised to prevent loss of muscle

                                                                    .
    tone, using an onboard comprehensive trainer to siwulate running,
    jumping, and weight lifting.
       Tass reported 15 July that some Soviet scientists considered ter-
    minating the mission because unexpected, intense solar flares 4-8 Jdy
    dramatically increased the radiation exposure. However, because the

    flares subsided and the space stationâ€™s orbit prevented excessive ex-
    posure, the crewâ€™s work was not disrupted.
        While the cosmonauts worked in space, two Soviet researchers lived
    in a duplicate station on the ground, simultaneously performing the same
    work. All commands relayed to the orbiting Sulyut 3 were first checked
    on the ground and alternate versions of decisions for unforeseen situa-
    tions were calculated. On 8 July the U.S. Apollo-SoyuzTest Project crew,
    in training at Star City for the joint US.-U.S.S.R. mission in 1975,
    telegraphed congratulations to the Salyut 3 cosmonauts on their â€œgreat
    success.â€ They said they looked forward to meeting the two after their
    <I
       happy return.â€
        By 18 July the crew completed most experiments and began trans-
    ferring ec&ipment to Soyuz 14. After checking out spacecraft systems,
    the cosmonauts undocked 19 July. Retrorockets were fired, parachutes
    deployed, and Soyuz 14 softlanded at 5:21 pm Baykonur time (8:21
    am EDT) 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan 2000 m from the planned
    target after 15 days 17 hours 30 min in space. The crew left the space-
    craft unaided, and on-the-spot medical checks showed the cosmonautsâ€™
    health was             All mission tests were reported completed. For the
    first time, a U.S.S.R. orbital mission had been in touch with mission
    control continuously because of maritime tracking.
        Sulyut 3 was the third space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Sulyut 1
    had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew on Soyuz 10 docked
    with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. A sec-
    ond crew, launched 6 June 1971 aboard Soyuz 11, entered the orbiting
    station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days. The three died
    during reentry when an open valve evacuated air from the spacecraft.
    Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973 but apparently an explosion
    or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the
    solar panels and making the station uninhabitable. (GSFC Wkly SSR,

    limiting antiballistic missile systems and underground nuclear weapon
    testing. Under the treaties, both countries agreed to one antiballistic mis-
    sile site each rather than the two originally agreed on in the US-U.S.S.R.
    treaty signed 26 May 1972, to prohibition of underground nuclear ex-
    plosions above 150 kt, and to discussions on the dangers of environmen-

        During a 2 July televised address to the Soviet people President Nixon
     said the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission, scheduled for July
     1975, was â€œsymbolic of the new relationship we are building between our
    two nationsâ€ for several reasons. First, the rocket technology built for
     war was being used for peace. Second, during the mission the astro-
     nauts and cosmonauts would â€œjoin with one another-just as we are
     doing and must continue to do.â€ Third, the newly standardized docking
    technology, making international space rescues possible, would make
     space travel safer â€œjust as our new relationship can make life on earth
     safer for the people of both our countries.â€ And, finally, because the

     1975 appropriations bill. The bill--passed as recommended to the House
     by its Committee on Appropriations 21 June-appropriated $3.203
     billion to NASA, $U.l million below the FY 1975 budget request and
      $63.9 million below the FY 1975 authorization.
        Research and development funds totaled $2.327 billion, construction
     of facilities $135.67 million, and research and program management
     $740 million. An additional $4.435 million had been provided in the
     Special Energy Bill.
        The House cut $6.2 million authorized as planning funds for the Large
      Space Telescope, noting that the LST was not among the top four priority
     telescope projects selected by the National Academy of Sciences. Also
     the House deferred the $8.0 million requested to initiate SEASAT and
     recommended that the satellite be configured to fly on an early mission
      of the space shuttle. The Committee urged NASA to reprogram funds to
     begin work on ERTS-c as soon as possible but directed the agency not
      to reprogram any funds for cost overruns on the Viking project without
      requesting additional funds from Congress. C?ther cuts from the author-

28 June-4 July: NASA and the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory, in
     participation with more than 100 U.S. and foreign experimenters,
     launched 54 sounding rockets from Wallops Flight Center as part of the
     Atmospheric Layering and Density Distribution of Ions and Neutrals
      (Project ALADDIN, â€™74) program. In addition to the 54 rockets launched
     during a 24-hr period beginning at 1:oo pm EDT 29 June, a pie-ALADDIN
     chemical experiment was launched aboard a Nike-Iroquois 28 June and
     four post-ALADDIN meteorological rockets were launched 1 July. Chemi-
     cal releases made yellow to yellowish green fluorescent aurora-like vapor
     trails visible over the East Coast.
        The program was studying dynamic and structural conditions of the
     atmosphere 48-137 km above the earth. Using small meteorological
     probes, chemical releases, falling spheres, and more sophisticated spec-
     trometer payloads, the rockets tracked and measured winds, wind shears,
     temperature and diffusion parameters, upper-atmosphere patterns and
     dynamics, and structure and composition. Data received from the rockets
     would be compared with data obtained by Explorer 51 (launched 15 Dec.
      1973). The data would be used for predicting communications problems
     and satellite orbits as well as for weather forecasting and pollution
     studies. (WFC Releases 7 4 4 , 74-5; AFSC Release OIP 065.74; AP, W

30 June: Permanent NASA employment had decreased 4.2% during FY 1974,
     dropping from 25 955 to 24 854 employees, NASAâ€™S Office of Personnel
     reported. Despite a numerical decrease of 470, employment in profes-
     sional occupations had risen to 61.4% of the NASA total. The minority
     component increased to 676. The increase in average age slowed to 0.2
     year, reaching 42.7 years, while the average GS grade remained the
     same at 11.0. The 2358 separations were almost twice as many as the 1246
     accessions, with most of the reduction-in-force separations occurring in
     technical support, wage grade, and clerical occupations. (NASA, â€œThe

During June: NASA began â€œâ€˜Outlook for Space,â€ a comprehensive planning
     study to identify potential roles for space exploration and expIoitation
      1980-2000. The year-long study, headed by Deputy Director Donald P.
      Hearth of Goddard Space Flight Center, would seek to relate goals of
     potential civilian space activities to national interests, to develop a list
     of desirable and practical US. civilian space activities, to group activi-
     ties with specific sets of goals, to define research and development tasks
      required for potential commercial and operational uses of space, and to
      identify social and economic challenges that could benefit from the use
     of space. NASA would consult representatives from universities, other
      Government agencies, and industry. The study would supplement â€œThe
      1973 NASA Payload Modelâ€ planning effort, which had evaluated poten-
      tial uses of the space shuttle, space tug, and Spacelab and which had
      been completed in â€˜October 1973. The new study would continue through

      sored by the NAS Space Science Board. The conference, attended by 61

   portance. But many potential advantages dephded on innovative man-
   agement and clear-cut, efficient, and flexible procedures for flying multi-
   purpose missions. Small experiments could be flown cost-effectively on
   small standardized pallets with integrated experiments, put on standby
   and flown when space was available. The projected 28-day sortie mission
   would be valuable for most disciplines but major programs requiring
   longer observation times should be carried o! on free-flying automated
                                                  u
   spacecraft launched from a pallet in the shuttleâ€™s payload bay.
     Cost-effectiveness of recovering and refurbishing payloads in orbit
   required additional study. A sophisticated Large Space Telescope-pro-
   posed for launch on the shuttle-might be worth the cost to revisit and
   service or return to earth. But visits to less expensive spacecraft in in-
   convenient orbits might prove too costly. Limits on recoverable payload
   weight might also restrict recovery.
      Scientists expressed concern that weight requirements for men in
   addition to a crew might limit scientific payloads. A manned Spacelab
   module was considered essential for biomedical research but other disci-
   plines could often use a smaller module housing a payload specialist
   and his console. Because of weight penalties, real-time control and
   evaluation might be best supplied by a ground-based control using a
   shuttle-to-ground communications system, such as the proposed Track-
   ing and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),giving continuous global
   coverage with a high rate of data interchange. (Text)

  ∞A Washington Post editorial urged the importance of scientific advice to
    the White House: Although drought, famine, continuing energy crisis,
    overpopulation, and meteorological change had been byproducts of the
    sudden advancement of science and technology in the past century, it
    had become increasingly clear that only more progress could provide the
    knowledge needed to keep this planet reasonably habitable. â€œWe also
    need a great deal more political wisdom to apply this knowledge effec-
    tively and cooperatively. . . . The President needs to be informed and
                              .
    forewarned to help avert . . potential disasters by the wise and hu-
    mane use of technology.â€ To this end, a committee sponsored by the
    National Academy of Sciences had recommended establishment of a
    Council for Science and Technology as a staff agency in the White House
     [see 26 June]. Although President Nixon might remain hostile to the
    idea and a given President might choose some other method, â€œsome
    orderly way of assuring scienceâ€™s service to government cannot be long
    delayed. We cannot arrest rapidly advancing scientific and technological
    developments. The question is whether these developments carry with
                       ..

    signature of methylamine in the dense interstellar cloud Sagittarius B,
    which was 30 000 light years from the earth near the center of the Milky
    Way, the Washington Post reported. Methylamine was an organic chemi-
    cal that mixed freely with formic acid to create glycine, the simplest of
    the amino acid building blocks of life. Identification of methylamine
    brought to 29 the number of chemical footprints identified in interstellar

    one of the first 25 Americans to earn â€œwingsâ€ as the Armyâ€™s First Aero
    Squadron in 1916. In 1929 Gen. Spaatz, with Gen. Ira S. Eaker, set a
    refueling endurance flight record by staying aloft 151 hrs over Los
    Angeles. For this feat he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. Dur-
    ing World War I1 Gen. Spaatz commanded the largest armada of air-
    craft and airmen ever assembled under the control of a single com-
    mander. President Truman appointed him Chief of Staff when the Air
    Force became a separate branch of the military service in 1947. After
    his retirement in 1948 he served as chairman of the Civil Air Patrol.

15 July: Evidence of a possible second black hole, from observations by x-ray
     astronomy satellite Uhuru (Explorer 42, launched 12 Dec. 1970) be-
    tween January 1971 and February 1973, was reported by Center for
    Astrophysics astronomers in the Astrophysical Journal. Black holes were
     believed to be superdense collapsed stars with gravity so great that even
     light could not escape. Uhuru had detected radiation from the x-ray
     source Circinus X-1 with characteristics similar to those detected in
      1972 by Uhuru and in 1973 by Oao 3 for the suspected black hole
     Cygnus X-1. Varying periods of x-ray intensity had indicated that
     Circinus X-1 was possibly binary; the x-ray energy spectrum had
     showed changes from 2 to 20 kev. No optical counterpart for the x-ray
     source had been found.
         Black holes might be an answer to two basic problems in cosmology,
     Walter S. Sullivan had written in the New York: Times Magazine 14 July.
     All visible material accounted for only 2% of the matter necessary to
     prevent the universe from flying apart in a continuing expansion; some
      scientists thought black holes might well make up the deficit. Also, black
     holes might provide the â€œglue,â€ the necessary gravity, to keep clusters
      of galaxies from flying apart. Not all scientists were convinced of the
     existence of black holes, but the holesâ€™ strange effects-such as the slow-
      ing of time, the tight curvature of space, and the influence of gravity on
      light-had been anticipated by Einstein7stheory of relativity.
         One major dilemma was what happened within a black hole. Some
      scientists had proposed that a star drawn into a black hole by its gravity
      might emerge in some other time and place as a quasar and that quasars-
      exceptionally bright objects of relatively small volume and high den-
      sity-might be â€œwhite holesâ€ into which energy was pouring from some-
      where else, perhaps even another universe. (Jones et al., Astro Journ,

  ∞The Air Force was developing a new series of global meteorological satel-
0

    lites for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP),Aviation
    Week & Space Technology reported. The new Block 5D spacecraft would
    be twice the weight of its predecessors, have a payload capacity about
    four times greater, and carry a broader mix of meteorological sensors to
    provide uniformly high-resolution photos. Block 5D satellites would
    employ â€œselective redundancyâ€-redundancy in certain critical, rather
    than all, spacecraft systems. This redundancy would increase probable
    mission lifetime to two years, more than twice the 9- or 10-mo lifetime
    of most earlier USAF weather satellites. Rather than choosing a single
    contractor, the USAF had awarded a series of fked-price contracts: to
    RCA Corp. for the spacecraft, Westinghouse Electric Corp. for the primary
    sensor, Barnes Engineering Co. for the supplementary sensors, and
    Radiation, Inc., for ground terminals. ( A v Wk, 15 July 74, 4 1 4 7 )

    stabilizers, were developed by McDonnell Douglas for thermal control of
    Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched 15 May 1973) and unmanned
    satellites. They would prevent thawing of permafrost around the pipe
     supports of elevated portions of the 1285-kmpipeline by removing heat
    from the ground and transmitting it to an above-groundradiator, where
     it would be dispersed into the atmosphere. (Seattle Journ Commerce &

∞Federal support to universities and colleges had declined 7%, to $3823
     million, during FY 1973 in the first decline since 1970, the National
     Science Foundation reported. The drop had been largely the result of a
     g267-million decrease in funds from the Dept. of Health, Education, and
    Welfare but other significant decreases were posted by NSF, down $40
    million; Dept. of Defense, down $11million; and NASA, down $8million.
     Federal funds for academic science activities totaled $2463 million, 5%
     below 1972. Two science fields had shown an increase in Federal R&D
    support between 1972 and 1973. Life sciencesâ€™ $934 million was a 4%

    successful achievement of the scientific objectives-was met and the mis-
    sion was adjudged successful 26 July. The scientific objective was to
    measure the main aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and the
    solar ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength band of the main absorp-
    tion. The long-range objective of the satellite, which carried one Goddard
    Space Flight Center and four West German experiments, was to provide
    a model of the ionosphere from which upper atmospheric conditions
    could be predicted. By 29 July the vehicle and experiments were per-
    forming satisfactorily and the West Germans were initiating spacecraft
    operations.
       A July 1965 agreement between the US. and West Germany had pro-
    vided for a series of cooperative satellite projects. The Aeros program,
    the second in the series, was authorized by a 10 June 1969 agreement
    and Aeros 1 was launched 16 Dec. 1972. The 1974 contract between
    NASA and the West Germany Federal Ministry for Research and Tech-
    nology (BMFT) for the Aeros 2 launch provided for reimbursement of
    NASA for launch vehicle and services. NASA would also provide one ex-
    periment, tracking, and backup for data acquisition. BMFT was re-
    sponsible for development of spacecraft and instrumentation operation
    and control of the satellite after launch, and data reduction and analysis
    except for the GSFC experiment. The spacecraft reentered 25 Sept. 1975.

                   .
    achievements, . . we cannot relax our pursuit of knowledge, for we
    must face the coming crises of our time. Every effort must be made to
    see that the opportunity which our technology presents is not lost. We
    may be sure that the opportunity will not occur saan again, if ever.
    To fail now would mean a ravaged environment and depleted resources-
    a plunge into a new and terrible Dark Age from which there would be no
    return.â€ Unless â€œwe continuously restore the fund of basic knowledge,
                                      .
    we shall ultimately exhaust it. . .

    we fly through those windows? I think we will.â€
       In 19 July ceremonies at the San Clemente, Calif., Western White
    House, Armstrong presented President Nixon a plaque bearing the names
    of each astronaut who had represented â€œthis country in a flight above

        The Smithsonian Ihstitution hosted 20 July activities marking the day
    of the landing. Speaking on the Mall in Washington, D.C., Smithsonian
    Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks said Apollo 11 had been a â€œdramatic
    demonstration . . . that progress in human affairs does not spring full
    blown from the efforts of one man or group of men. What we saw was
    the culmination of the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers
    from Leonard0 da Vinci . . . to the Apollo 1 astronauts. Each built
                                                     1
    on what his predecessors had accomplished until the accumulation of
    knowledge made possible the kind of quantum leap forward represented
    by the Apollo Program.â€
        Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, called the day of the
    landing â€œthe day man ended an era of one-planet civilization and began
    a new age as traveler and colonizer of the universe.â€ Despite difficulties,
    men would â€œmake more of these steps into the vast but exciting reaches
    of the solar system.â€
        A 21 July service at the Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C.,
    dedicated the Space Window donated by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA
    Administrator at the time of the landing. The window, designed by Rod-
    ney Winfield, depicted whirling orange, red, and white stars and orbiting
    planets on a deep blue and green field. A thin white trajectory, represent-
    ing a manned spacecraft, emphasized manâ€™s minuteness in Godâ€™s universe.
    During the ceremony, Armstrong presented a 7.18-g, 3.6-billion-yr-old
    lunar rock, brought from the moon by ApoZZo 11, to the Cathedral.
    The rock would be inserted into a hydrogen-filled plexiglass container
    embedded as the centerpiece of the window. (PD, 22 July 74,815; NASA

    French demand that the program be expanded to 19 aircraft. Since many
    parts had already been manufactured, the decision meant that many
    of the 30 000 employees of manufacturers Agrospatiale France and
    British Aircraft Corp. Ltd. might lose their jobs. There were firm orders
    for only nine of the $400-million aircraft, with options on several others.

  ∞Columbia Broadcasting System newsman Walter Cronkite recalled the two
    most exalting moments in his years of TV space coverage, during an
    interview with the Christian Science Monitor. The first was â€œAlan
    Shepardâ€™s little 15-minute plop-down into the Atlantic. Rocketry itself
    was so uncertain . . . I just didnâ€™t know whether or not I was going
    to be. able to watch.â€ The second was the first lunar :anding. â€œThat was
    a highly emotional moment for me. The actual touchdown, not so much
    Neil Armstrongâ€™s walk.â€ Cronkite, preparing for the TV documentary
    â€œSpace: A Report to the Stockholders,â€ said he still believed the major
    achievement of the moon landing was that â€œit proves that we truly have
    the capability at this stage of manâ€™s civilization to do any darn thing we
    want-the most outlandish or the most practical things.â€
       Of course there were important spinoff values. â€œProbably one of the
    most important industrial spinoffs . . . is the command that US. in-
    dustry had gotten in the computer business. . . . I attribute that almost
    solely to the space program.â€ Cronkite said that recent cutbacks in the
    manned program were proper. â€œIt is just about where it ought to b e -

20 July: A New York Times editorial commented on the fifth anniversary of
    the Apollo 11 lunar landing: â€œOn 20 July 1969, millions of people all
                                .
    over the globe watched . , as [Apollo 11 Astronaut] Neil Armstrongâ€™s
    great left boot groped for the lunar surface and he made his â€˜one small
    step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.â€™â€ Today, just five years
    later, many Americans would be hard put to name all three participants

    of the original mission. â€œThe attention of the world . . has turned to
    problems closer to home. Yet when those future centuries look back on
    this one, the first time that men landed on another celestial body will
    loom large and they will be rememhered long after those in todayâ€™s
    headlines have passed beyond recall.â€ (NYT, 20 July 74, 30)
21 July: The leadership of â€œNASAâ€™s hero,â€ former Administrator James
                                     other
    E. Webb, was recalled by Julian Scheer, former NASA Assistant Ad-
    ministrator for Public Affairs, in the Washington Post: The fifth an-
    niversary of the 20 July 1969 A p d o 11 lunar landing would bring toasts
    to former astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and
    Michael Collins and others. But it had been Webbâ€™s â€œincredible leader-
    shipâ€ which had m a G h e event posdble. Webb had â€œfought the Bureau
    of the Budget for every nickelâ€ and usuaIIy got his way. In Congress,
    few â€˜believedhe was not a scientist or engineer. He dazzled them with
    his knowledge of the technical as well as his management of the vast
    NASA program structure. â€œBut it was in the internal workings of NASA
    where his strength lay.â€ He had an uncanny knack for â€œstanding back
    and looking at the big picture.â€ He never took on a problem without
    coming up with as many as four options and, for Webb, every option
    was an opportunity. Abruptly in 1968, Webb resigned. Most of the major
    Apollo decisions had been made. â€œAlmost shockingly, it was less than

∞A multibillion dollar competition between the U.S. and France was being
    waged over which country would produce the new generation of fighter
    aircraft for the Western European allies, the New Yo& Times reported.
    To the victor would go one of the largest aircraft export sales in history,
    the possibility of producing 2000 or more aircraft worth between $10
     billion and $15 billion. To replace their 10-yr-old,U.S.-built F-104 Star-
    fighter, the Europeans would like a low-cost, high-performance fighter
     that could meet military requirements through the 1990s. The U.S. was
     offering versions of the lightweight fighter-the General Dynamics Corp.
     YF-16 and the Northrop Corp. YF-17, now in competition for an Air
     Force production contract [see 9 June]-while the French were offering
     an improved version of the F-1 Mirage. Pentagon officials claimed both
     the YF-16 and YF-17 were superior to the Mirage in acceleration and
     maneuverability despite the more powerful engine in the French aircraft.
        The competition would probably be decided as much on economic and
     political grounds as by military considerations. The French argued that
    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies shouId â€œbuy Europeanâ€
     and maintain European solidarity. The US. emphasized standardization
     of weapons within NATO and the future willingness of the U.S. to main-
    tain forces in Western Europe. Although the immediate potential CUS-
     tomers-Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark-would
     need about 300 aircraft, American officials were envisaging even larger

∞The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences held hearings

     on s. 3542, a bill introduced 29 May to authorize $41700 000 for NASA
    to launch a seventh Applications Technology Satellite. Sen. Frank E.
    Moss (D-Utah) said experimenters using Ats 6, launched 30 May, had
     urged another launch because more than the planned one year of opera-
    tion over the US. was needed to complete experiments. Two satellites in
     orbit at the same time would â€œgreatly improve the experimental informa-
    tion necessary for further decisions on the use of advanced communica-
    tions satellites.â€ Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said that ATS satellites
    held â€œthe promise of improved health care at reduced costsyy peoplefor
    in remote regions of the US.
        Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified that Ats 6 was
     in excellent condition and had a life expectancy of three additional years
    over the US. following its return from the planned year of operation
     over India. In addition, use of the U.S.-Canada Communications Tech-
    nology Satellite scheduled for a mid-December launch could provide
    experimenters additional experiment time and continuity. Dr. Fletcher
    expressed NASA opposition to the bill, saying it would cost $4 million
    more than the bill provided, to cover the cost of the Titan IIIC launch
    vehicle. To avoid further costs, a decision to launch another spacecraft
    would have to be made by September, when the NASA and industry ATS
     team were to be disbanded. A seventh ATS satellite could be considered a
    potential operational vehicle and the user community might consider
    bearing the costs. (Transcript)

25 July: The 3-19 July Soyuz 14 mission had prompted concern among US.
     specialists that the U.S.S.R. might be developing a manned spacecraft
     for military reconnaissance, the Washington Post reported. Soyuz 14
     cosmonauts, who had linked up with the Salyut 3 orbiting space labora-
     tory, had used a special coded channel .of communications with Soviet
     ground stations, surprising US. stations that usually monitored Soviet
     flights. In addition, the Soyuz 14 flight carried the first all-military crew
     since the U.S.S.R. began flying multiple-man crews in 1969. All previous
     flights had at least one civilian aboard. Also, sources reported that at
     the time of the flight a series of optical sighting targets was la% out on
     the ground not far from the launch site. The targets were believed to be
     much larger than the targets usually laid out to check spaceborne optics,

     the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, at Langley Aero-
     nautical Laboratory in 1921, becoming Chief of the Aeronautics Div. in
      1940 and Head of the Research Dept. in 1943. He came to NACA Hq. in
     1945 as Acting Director of Aeronautical Research and was appointed
     Associate Director for Research in 1947. Crowley received NASAâ€™s      first

26 July: Marshall Space Flight Center announced the award of six contracts,
      totaling $1.8 million, for development studies of the interim upper stage
       (IUS) and space tug. The Ius-a predecessor to the space tug, to be used
      with the space shuttle by both the Dept. of Defense and NASA until the
      more sophisticated and capable tug was ready for use in 1983-was being
      developed as the orbit-to-orbit stage (00s) by the Air Force.
         General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div. was awarded a $290 000 con-
      tract to study space shuttle and tug compatibility and develop detailed
      interface requirements. A second contract to General Dynamics, totaling
      $268 000, was awarded for a definition study of space tug avionics sys-
      tems with emphasis on areas where transition from the IUS to the tug
      would require significant hardware or operational changes. United Air-
      craft Corp. Pratt & Whitney Div. received a $375 371 contract to evaluate
      and verify the RL-10 high-area-ratio nozzle engine performance for
      space tug application. Under a $246 000 contract, Martin Marietta Corp.
      would develop concepts, techniques, and tools for tug fleet and ground
       operations, mission assignments, payload and orbiter integration, tug
       scheduling, and physical status. MSFC awarded McDonnell Douglas Corp.

28 July: The economy of Floridaâ€™s Brevard County was recovering from the
     impact of Kennedy Space Center layoffs that had followed the end of
     NASAâ€™s Apollo and Skylab programs, the Washington Post reported.
     Employment at the launch facilities bad formed the basis for Brevard
     Countyâ€™s economy and when manpower at KSC was cut in half â€œthe
     bottom dropped out.â€ Construction came to a near halt, small businesses
     closed, and personal bankruptcies soared. By March 1971 the Federal
     Housing Administration held title to 986 repossessed Brevard County
     homes and the total tripled in the next three years. However, an ad-
     vertising campaign, begun in 1971 to attract retired persons to the area
     and its vacant bargain real estate, started an upswing in the economy.
     Also contributing to the upswing were a pledge that NASA would not let
     its KSC manpower fall below the current 9500-employee (Civil Service
     and contractor) level, assurances that the Air Force would maintain its
     13300-man work force at Eastern Test Range for the next five years,

5 August: NASA and the Office of Naval Research launched the worldâ€™s
     largest unmanned balloon from Fort Churchill, Canada, carrying a 363-kg
     payload to 47 000-m altitude. The experiment, designed by Goddard
     Space Flight Center scientist Dr. Robert C. Hartman, measured position
     and electron spectra between 20 and 800 mev at the 1.2-millibar level.
     The helium-filled balloon, constructed of half-mil polyethylene, weighed
      1360 kg and had a volume of 1 4cu m and a 0.25-km dia. Launched and
                                      .
     tracked with facilities of the Navyâ€™s Skyhook program, the balloon rose
      over Hudson Bay and moved westward 805 km. After 18 hrs, it
     descended to 30 km, where the payload was separated by radio com-
     mand and parachuted to the ground. (Naval Research l?eviews, Nov 74,

6,8, 9 August: The Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee con-
    ducted hearings on s. 2350 and S. 3484, bills to establish an Office of
    Earth Resources Survey Systems within NASA and an Earth Resources
     Observation Administration within the Dept. of the Interior. Both pro-
    posals were designed to move the Earth Resources Technology Satel-
     lite system from an experimental to an operational phase. Dr. James C.
     Fletcher, NASA Administrator, opposed the organizational changes pro-
     posed by the bills. He argued that s. 2350 would erect barriers in NASA
     between the ERTS system and related programs in NASAâ€™s             Office of
    Applications; keeping these programs together would facilitate hard-
     ware development and data reduction and handling. S. 3484 would limit
              research and development in earth resources to activities sup-
     NASAâ€™s
     ported and funded by the Dept. of the Interior.
         Citing the need for more spectral channels, more rapid handling of
     data, and more frequent repetitive coverage with ERTS-class        satellites,
     Dr. Fletcher stated that there was no clear-cut distinction between ex-
     perimental and operational phases in the earth resources program. What
     was needed was â€œa continuous evolutionary approach, in which opera-
     tionally useful data from space are provided to users for research, for
     experimental demonstrations, and for routine operations when they are
     ready, while at the same time and with the same satellites necessary im-
     provements to the system can be developed and used.â€ Proponents of
     the bills argued that ERTS data would be exploited fully only when
     users could be guaranteed the continuously available data offered by an
     operational system. Hearings would be continued 18 Sept. (Transcript)
7 August: The Air Force Systems Command announced that it would launch
      an S3-1 satellite late in 1974 as part of a three-launch series to measure
     atmospheric effects on satellites. The first satellite would be placed in
      polar orbit with a 4000-km apogee and a 140-km perigee. It would be
     equipped with ionization gauges and accelerometers to measure air
      density and to provide data on space vehicle trajectory, slowdown, and
      decay, Other devices would measure atmospheric heating sources, solar
      radiation, and atmospheric parameters. With a mass spectrometer in addi-
      tion, to gather neutral and ion composition data, the experiments would
     help researchers understand physical and chemical processes in interac-
      tions of the sunâ€™s radiation with the upper atmosphere, as well as neutral
      atmospheric effects on the ionosphere. The low-altitude measurements
      would be used to predict the occurrence and duration of radio blackouts

      items, including $6.2 million for the Large Space Telescope and $8.0
      million for SEASAT, both of which had been cut from the House appro-
      priation 26 June. A reduction of $15 million from R&D funds was not
      directed to any specific program because the Committee suggested that
      NASA was better able to apply this reduction with a minimum disruption

19 August: The prototype Mini-Sniffer, a small 55-kg radio-controlled air-
     craft equipped to test pollution in the upper atmosphere, made the first of
     a series of eight flights from Flight Research Center. The vehicle, powered
     by a 9-kw gasoline engine, maintained an altitude of 15-30 m and per-
     formed well at 55-87 km per hr. The purpose of the flight was to test
     airworthiness at lower altitudes and speeds. Another series of flights
     would check out the auto-pilot system at low altitude and then the air-
     craft would be taken to 6100 m, using radar and a long-range radio-

      U.S.S.R. during training for the 1975 ApolloSoyuz Test Project mis-
      sion, as saying : â€œStar City (where most of the cosmonauts live and
      train) looks like a boom town. Thereâ€™s no doubt the Soviets have a
      vigorous ongoing manned space effort planned for the next five or six
      years.â€ He said that the number of buildings in Star City had tripled
      in the previous two years, with more under construction. The total of
      75 to 80 cosmonauts was a sharp increase over the estimated 55 of five
      years ago. I n contrast the US. astronaut corps had fallen to 34 from a
      peak of 60 during the Apollo program, with only three trainidg for a
      flight. Stafford said he did not believe the U.S.S.R. had any new space-
      craft under development but rather planned for the continued use of the
       Soyuz as a workhorse. (MHer, 21 Aug 74)

∞Photographs and visual observations made by astronauts aboard the Sky-

    lab Orbital Workshop had revealed eddies embedded in warm-water cur-
     rents flowing poleward from equatorial oceans, Robert E. Stevenson of
     the Office of Naval Research reported in a Nature article. Observations
     from Skylab 4 (16 Nov. 1973-8 Feb. 1974) over four ocean areas had
    confirmed initial evidence from Caribbean photographs taken on Sky-
     lab 2 and 3 (25 May-22 June, 28 July-25 Sept. 1973) that eddies with
     vortices of 5500- to 37 000-m dia were present wherever other conditions
     were suitable, regardless of water temperature. Findings were also con-
     firmed by the Navyâ€™s Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Four with
     bathythermographs.
         Formerly, turbulence had been difficult to document because of limited
     oceanographic techniques, insufficient information about such features,
     and the lack of photos from orbital platforms which enhanced the ocean
      and atmosphere manifestations of the eddies. (Nature, 23 Aug 74,

 ∞ A Science editorial commented O the Nixon Administration and science:
                                      n
      During his terms in office President Nixon, who had resigned 9 Aug.,
      had been preoccupied by foreign policy and Watergate reaction. Science
      was â€œat most an afterthought.â€ Because he thought that science should
      advance the cause of national security and prestige, â€œgrand technology
      seemed to have had a special fascination for Nixon,â€ most evident in
      his enthusiasm for the Apollo program and the supersonic transport.
      He had made a dramatic declaration of war on cancer and set the Nation
      toward Project Independence, under which the U.S. was to â€œachieve
      energy self-sufficiency by 1980.â€ There was â€œlittle evidence that Nixon
      was hostile to science but rather that, except for the technological
      extravaganzas, he was simply not interested.â€ He lacked rapport with
      scientists, allying himself instead with proponents and practitioners of
      the quasi-science of modern management.
         The Presidential tapes (tape recordings made secretly of conversations
      in the Oval Office) showed a President â€œbadly informed, even indif-
      ferent,,, helping to explain why the White House science advisory
      machinery was deemed expendable. â€œBut in the present situation it takes
      no special wisdom to see how RL+D decisions will affect how the govern-
      ment deals with serious energy and food problems and how important
      these actions will be in future economic developments. The Nixon tapes
      illustrate why good presidential advisers and good mechanisms to trans-

24 August: A probe into the next 50 yrs was the subject of a series of articles
    in Saturday Review/World. Soviet atomic scientist Andrei D. Sakharov
    envisioned flying cities---artificial earth satellites with important indus-
    trial functions. The satellites would hold nuclear and thermonuclear
    installations with radiant cooling of heat exchangers, to avoid heating
    the earth, and would also serve as cosmic research laboratories and way
    stations for long-distance flights. Sakharov also foresaw greater attempts
    to establish communication with other civilizations by searching for and
    transmitting interplanetary signals on all known wavelengths and search-
    ing outer space for space stations of extraterrestrial civilizations. Power-
    ful telescopes set up on the moon would permit scientists to see planets
    orbiting the nearest stars.
        Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong said that in 50 yrs every
    interesting crater and cranny of the moon would have been visited and
    revisited and lunar exploration would be replaced by lunar exploitation.
     Underground lunar colonies, protected from extreme temperatures,
    would consist of pressurized compartments connected by tunnels. One
     day man might want to build an atmosphere on the moon to avoid the
     inconveniences of living in a near vacuum, but in the nearer future the
    use of the moonâ€™s vacuum for activities such as materials processing
     was a major reason for being there. Craters on the dark side of the moon,
     always facing away from the earth, could hold radio and x-ray telescopes
     for transmissions, unadulterated by earth noise, to and from outer space.
     Deep craters, which received no sunlight and had temperatures nearing
     absolute zero, would be ideal for low-temperature laboratories where
     scientists could investigate the point where moleoular motion nearly
     stops. Lunar agriculture would be underground under lights in modi-
     fied lunar soil fed with a nutrient solution. Although by 2024 the only
     extraterrestrial colonies would be on the moon, men probably would
     have visited Mars and a few selected celestial bodies. Men exploring space
     might well use a miniaturized heart-lung machine, circumventing the
     need for breathing and spacesuits.
         Dr. Wernher von Braun, former Marshall Space Flight Center Direc-
     tor, predicted a worldwide satellite search would be started for addi-
     tional deposits of metal ore, coal, oil, shale, and natural gas. Satellite
     data would also provide key data for a badly needed worldwide food
     supply management system. Von Braun predicted nuclear lasers in geo-
      synchronous orbit would handle millions of TIr channels simultaneously
     and billions of telephone conversations and would lead to worldwide
     video-telephone service. Advanced meteorological satellites would pro-
     vide accurate two-week weather forecasts and disaster warnings, saving
     millionâ€™s of dollars in property damage. (Saturday Review/World, 24

     showed the cosmonauts to be in â€œgood health.â€
         Early press reports quoted Western experts as saying the flight prob-
     ably ended early because of a failure in the docking mechanism of the
     spacecraft, damage to or failure of the spacecraft durlng the attempted
     linkup, or a serious deterioration of the Salyut orbital station. In response
     to questions about the impact of the Soyuz 15 mission on the planned
     July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission, Dr. James C. Fletcher,
     NASA Administrator, said in a 29 Aug. statement, â€œNASA personnel en-

     ments awarded the flyer their highest decorations for valor. He received
     the first US. Distinguished Flying Cross and the Medal of Honor and
     was promoted from lieutenant to colonel in the Army Air Corps Reserve.
         Following goodwill flights throughout the US. and Latin America,
     sponsored by the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics,
     Lindbergh served as adviser to Pan American World Airways and to the
      predecessor of Trans World Airlines, helping to lay out transatlantic,
      transcontinental, and Caribbean air routes for commercial aviation. He
      served as a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
      1931-1939, heading the special committee that recommended to Con-
      gress expansion of U.S. aircraft research facilities and establishment of
      what became the Ames and Lewis Research Centers.
         After the kidnaping and murder of his first son and the subsequent
      publicity, Lindbergh moved to Europe in 1935, where he studied the
      military forces of the European countries. His conclusion that the Ger-
      man Luftwaffe would be superior to the combined forces of the Allies,
      his acceptance of the Service Cross of the German Eagle from the German
      government, and his opposition to U.S. participation in World War I1
      provoked the U.S. public to question his patriotism and he resigned
      his commission in the Army Air Corps. During the y a r he was a con-
      sultant to bomber aircraft manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and United
      Aircraft Corp. He traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the
      Navyâ€™s Corsair F 4 U under flying conditions and there, as a civilian, flew
       50 missions against the Japanese.

        Following the war, his commission restored and promoted to the rank
      of brigadier general, Lindbergh was a technical consultant for Govern-
      ment and private industry in missile and space flight programs. As a con-
      sultant for Pan Am he worked on design specifications for the Boeing
      747. Lindbergh devoted the later years of his life to writing and speaking
      on world conservation policies. ( N Y T , 27 Aug 74, 1; 18; Crawford, W

    year in space. Dr. G. D. Whedon of the National Institutes of Health
    stated that weightlessness could threaten capable musculo-skeletal func-
    tions during space flights lasting up to three years unless measures could
    be developed to prevent significant losses of calcium, phosphorus, and
    nitrogen. Continued loss of calcium could cause astronauts to break their
    backs or legs and could promote formation of kidney stones.
       Dr. William E. Thornton, life scientist in the JSC Astronaut Office,
    reported that by Mission Day 3 all Skylab crewmen had lost more than
    2000 cc (2 qts) of extravascular fluid from calf and thigh; at recovery,
    a sharp reversal was noted. The Thornton team suggested that the reason
    for the shift was the intrinsic and unopposed lower limb elasticity, which
    forced venous blood and other fluids toward the head. Other investigators
    reported that such cardiovascular changes as the heartâ€™s decreased ven-
    tricular size and the suppression of red blood cell production was the
    bodyâ€™s accommodation to weightlessness. These physiological changes
    had been the expected response to a lack of exertion; they reversed after
    the astronautsâ€™ return to earth. (JSC Roundup, 30 Aug 74, 1-2; JSC proj

28 August: Marshall Space Flight Center had negotiated a restructured con-
    tract with TRW Inc. for the first of three High Energy Astronomy Ob-
    servatory spacecraft to be launched between 1977 and 1979, NASA an-
    nounced. Modifications had increased the original contract value by
    $9 451 139, to a new total of $86 397 579. The contract covered design,
    development, manufacture, test, checkout, and delivery of the spacecraft.
    Period of performance was from 1 July 1974 through 15 April 1980.
       The original HEAO program, approved in 1971 and suspended in
    1973 because of budget cuts, had called for two large unmanned ob-
    servatories. The new contract called for a series of smaller scale missions
    using three satellites in circular orbits at an altitude of 416 km to obtain
    data on high-energy radiation from space-celestial x-rays, gamma-rays,
    and cosmic rays.
       Contracts totaling $23 332 700 had also been signed for five experi-
    ments to be carried by the second spacecraft, HEAO-B. The awards in-
    cluded $1 350 000 to American Science and Engineering, Inc., to design
    and build the x-ray telescope. (NASA Release 7 4 2 4 0 ; MSFC Release 7 4

30 August-14 September: NASA launched Ans 1 Netherlands Astronomical
     Satellite from Western Test Range on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle
                                      .
     at 7:08 a m PDT (10:OS am EDT) The satellite entered an elliptical polar
    orbit with a 1167-km apogee, 254-km perigee, 99.0-min period, and
     98.1" inclination-significantly different from the planned circular
     orbit-because of a malfunction in the 1st stage of the Scout. Changes in
     the spacecraft program and scientific instrument operations program
     were made to accommodate to the actual orbit. Although the orbit
     hindered the observation program, the primary objective-to increase
    the scientific knowledge of stellar ultraviolet and x-ray sources-could
     be achieved.
        The spacecraft was pointed at the sun, the solar panels were deployed,
     and fine pointing in a three-axis stabilized condition was established. All
    three experiments-a hard x-ray experiment provided by the US. and
     a uv telescope and soft x-ray experiment provided by The Netherlands-
     were turned on by 8 Sept. In-orbit checkout of experiments and space-
     craft was completed 13 Sept. and the operational phase of the mission
     began 14 Sept.
        Principal effect of the orbit on the scientific program was the loss of
     observing time. The higher apogee placed the spacecraft in the Van Allen
     radiation belts longer than planned, creating a more intense radiation
     backdround than anticipated. The uv telescope could operate effectively
     for 70% of each orbit and observe 10th-magnitude stars only when the
     spacecraft was below 500 km. Only 5th-magnitudeor brighter stars were
     observablemost of the time.
        The US. x-ray experiment could make effective observations about
     25% of the total possible observing time; the experiment could operate
     below 700 km but not over the poles or the South Atlantic Anomaly. The
     soft x-ray experiment consisted of a large-area detector, which was
     operating similarly to the US. experiment, and a grazing-incidence tele-
     scope, which was seriously affected by the' radiation background. AI-
     though much of the acquired data was not usable, most future data
     might be recovered through improved analysis techniques.

       Despite the problems, the orbit would provide nine months of full sun-
    light, rather than the six months expected, permitting reobservations of
    objects observed during the first three months. In addition, aerodynamic
    drag would lower the apogee over a period of time, decreasing the passage
    time through the Van Allen belts.
       Am 1 was launched under a Memorandum of Understanding signed
    5 June 1970 by NASA and the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite Program
    Authority (ANSPA). NASA provided the x-ray experiment, spacecraft tech-
    nical support, the Scout launch vehicle and services, and limited tracking
    and data acquisition. The Netherlands was responsible for the spacecraft
    design, fabrication, and testing; two experiments; and primary space-
    craft command, control, and tracking and data acquisition. Ans 1 was the
    first satellite to be controlled completely from the European Space Re-
    search organizationâ€™s operations center at Darmstadt, Germany. The ANS
    program was managed for NASA by Goddard Space Flight Center under
    the direction of the Office Space Science. Langley Research Center had
                                of
    responsibility for the Scout launch vehicle. (NASA MORS, 21 Aug, 6 NOV

31 August: A galaxy six times larger than any previously known in the
    universe had been discovered by an international team of astronomers
    using The Netherlandsâ€™ Westerbork radio telescope, the Washington Post
    reported. Named 3C 268, the galaxy was 18 million light years in length
    and 1.8 billion light years from the earth. It was composed of an optical
    galaxy-a group of stars emitting visible light-at the center, with enor-
    mous gaseous radio components spreading like giant propeller blades
    on either side. (AP, W Post, 31 Aug 74, A13)
During August: Flight Research Center began wake vortex studies with a
    Boeing 747 to test different configurations and mechanical devices for
    suppressing the formation or reducing the strength of vortices. Wind-
    tunnel and water-channel tests had indicated that engine-induced turbu-
    lence and span-load tailoring by flap modification would permit reduc-
    tion of standard separation distances between aircraft. Removing the
     outboard flap on a model of a Boeing 747 and adding a trailing spline
     reduced the wing-tip vortex so that the separation between a Boeing 747
     and a following Learjet or DC-9 could be reduced from 8 to less than
     3 km. During inflight tests, lowering the inboard flap 30â€™ dissipated
    the normal wing-tip vortex as a second vortex flowing in a counter
     direction formed. Flight testing would continue into September. (FRC

   had outpaced other major civil programs, while space programs had
   been reduced more than any other R&D function in the period. In
   FY 1975, the space budget was 13% of the planned $19.6-billion Fed-
   eral R&D funding, a decline from 23.9% in 1969. Manned space flight,
   including the space shuttle, would account for more than half the 1975

 ∞The combined calculated weight at launch of the U.S.S.R.â€™s Soyuz 4
    (launched 14 Jan. 1969) and Soyuz 5 (launched 15 Jan. 1969) had
   indicated that the spacecraft had carried propulsion systems far in excess
   of requirements for an earth orbital mission, David Woods reported in
   Spaceflight. The 1.97-km-per-sec velocity requirement of such active
   docking vehicles as Soyuz 4 had matched the total velocity requirement
   of 1.94 km per sec of Apollo 11 (launched to the moon 16 July 1969),
   indicating that these early Soyuz spacecraft had been capable of manned
   lunar missions, Woods deduced. (SF, Aug 74,300-302)

1 September: I n an effort toward accurate earthquake prediction, antennas
    at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goldstone Tracking Station-200 km
    apart and on either side of the San Andreas Fault-were receiving radio
    signals from quasars outside the galaxy. As part of JPLâ€™S Astronomical
    Radio Interferometric Earth Surveying (ARIES) project, techniques de-
    veloped for spacecraft navigation could measure the precise distance
    between the antennas by monitoring the arrival times of identical radio
    signals, accurate to one tenth of a billionth of a second. Changes in the
    times could indicate three-dimensionalshifts in the earthâ€™s crust up to an
    initial accuracy of 10 cm, with an eventual accuracy goal of 2 cm.
    Scientists hoped that ARIES techniques would help prove the theory that
    earthquakes were preceded by a swelling of the earthâ€™s surface up to
    one meter over hundreds of square kilometers and provide a major new
    tool in earthquake research and prediction. ( J P L Release 710; JPL proj

    b the paint, engineers determined where heat built up and how quickly,
     y
    around a new canopy designed for flights up to six times the speed of

       The X-24A lifting body had flown test flights from 1969 to 1971 and
    the X-24B was continuing flights from Edwards Air Force Base in a
    NASA-USAF research program into concepts for future hypersonic aircraft
    and returning spacecraft. The X-24C was similar to the B model with

∞ President Ford as a Congressman had been a â€œstaunch defender of space

     spendingâ€ whenever critics suggested cuts in NASAâ€™s budget, the San
     Diego Union reported. As minority leader, Ford had declared that the
     space program could be justified by its spinoffs. In April 1972, Ford
     had defended a $200-million space shuttle appropriation because he had
     believed that its loss would end the space program. (Macomber, SD

10 September: Pioneer 10 data returned from the 3 Dec. 1973 encounter
    with the planet Jupiter appeared to support the theory that Jupiter was
     a spinning ball of liquid hydrogen without a detectable solid surface,
     NASA reported. At most, the planet probably had only a small rocky core
     deep below the heavily clouded atmosphere. Jupiterâ€™s great red spot
     probably was the vortex of a gigantic storm that had raged along a
     40 000-km front for 700 yrs.
        Analyses by NASA experimenters and other scientists had shown that
     the Pioneer 10 information, the first measurements made from closer
     than the earth, contradicted some previous theories and verified others.
     As early Pioneer 10 reports had indicated [see 25 Jan., 2 and 9 April],
     Jupiterâ€™s turbulent interior was much hotter than expected, its magnetic
     field much larger than some predictions, and its radiation belts far more
     intense. The planet was a source of high-energy particle radiation, the
     only one in the solar system besides the sun. In its atmospheric circu-
     lation patterns, cyclones and anticyclones (ascending and descending)
     were stretched around the planet, rather than being circular as on the
     earth. This â€œweather-stretching,â€ probably caused by heat radiation
     from the planetâ€™s interior and its 35 200-km-per-hr rotation speed, ac-
     counted for Jupiterâ€™s planet-girdling, alternating brown-red and gray-
     white cloud bands.
        Density of the four largest moons decreased from the density of rock
     for the innermost Io and Europa to the density of a water-ice and rock

    Pointing out commercial uses, an official from Marshall Space Flight
     Center, which had managed the Project Able study, told the Times that
    potential applications included reflecting microwaves from space for
    conversion to electrical power, beaming rays on Floridaâ€™s orange groves
    should frost threaten the fruit crop, and lighting Alaska during its ex-
    tended darkness. Launched on a Saturn V booster or on the space shuttle,

     Group Ltd. had proposed a spacecraft similar to the Orbiting Test
    Satellite (OTS) being developed by the European Space Research Organi-
    zation. Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm had recommended a three-axis
    stabilized spacecraft. A consortium of Hughes Aircraft Co., Nippon
    Electric Co. of Japan, and Thomson-csF of France had proposed a space-
    craft similar to Telesat Canadaâ€™s spin-stabilized 12-transponder Anik
    satellites.
        Meanwhile a number of nations also were moving toward domestic
     satellite systems. Algeria had begun installation of the first of 14 earth
    terminals for its domestic satellite system following award of a $9.6-
     million contract to GTE International, a subsidiary of General Telephone
     & Electronics Corp. The system would begin operations soon after 1Jan.
     1975, when Algeria would lease one transponder from the International
     Telecommunications Satellite Organization. Brazil would begin leasing
     an Intelsat transponder for its domestic service 1 June 1975. Indonesia
     had begun development of two satellites of its own; initial terminals in a
     25-station system would be easily convertible from operation with an
     Intelsat satellite to later operation with an Indonesian comsat. Malaysia
     was purchasing three ground terminals to use Intelsat comsats. The
     Phillippine government was considering a similar plan and, with
     Malaysia, possibility of switching from an Intelsat to Indonesiaâ€™s planned
     satellite.
        Saudi Arabia had installed two terminals with 11-m-dia antennas for
     domestic service, which, with the completion of two larger stations in
     mid-1975, would be moved to remote locations for use with an Intelsat
     or the planned Arab League satellite. (Av Wk, Sept 74, 23; Johnsen,

     by the alignment, which occurred every 179 yrs, would alter wind direc-
     tions in the upper atmosphere. The frictional effect exerted on the solid
     earth by atmospheric circulation would change with the winds. The con-

    Dr. Debus had begun his career in US. military and NASA space programs
    in 1945, when with Dr. Wernher von Braun he had joined the Armyâ€™s
    ballistic missile program. He had supervised the launch of the first Red-
    stone ballistic missile in 1953 and the flight-testing of Jupiter and
    Pershing missiles and Jupiter C and Juno launch vehicles until the Army
    team was transferred to NASA in 1960. He had directed the launch of the
     first US. satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 Jan. 1958, and NASA launch pro-
    grams from the flight of Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in 1961 to preparations for
    space shuttle operations. Dr. Debus had received the Louis W. Hill Space
    Transportation Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and
    Astronautics as well as the Armyâ€™s highest civilian decoration, the Excep-
    tional Civilian Service Medal, and NASAâ€™s     Distinguished Service Medal.

  ∞The Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee continued hearings
    on S. 2350 and S. 3484, bills to develop an operational Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite (ERTS) system and to establish an Office of Earth
    Resources Survey Systems within NASA and an Earth Resources Observa-
     tion Administration within the Dept. of the Interior [see 6, 8, 9 Aug.].
    Frank G. Zarb, Office of Management and Budget Associate Director for
    Material Resources, Energy and Science, warned against immediate de-
    velopment of an operational ERTS system, citing budgeting restraints and
    marginal value of current ERTS data. Since an advanced satellite offering
    higher spatial resolution would increase the usefulness of ERTS data, Zarb
    contended that the third satellite, ERTS-C, should be experimental. His
    view was supported by S. Benedict Levin, Executive Vice President of
    Earth Satellite Corp., and by John V. Granger, Acting Director of the

∞Soviet astronomers had detected a black hole several light years away in

    the center of the globular cluster Omega in the constellation Centaurus,
    Tass reported. Using the interaction effect between gravitation fields of
    globular clusters and stars, Soviet astronomer Kiriol Ogorodnikov and
    his assistant Yelena Naumova of the Univ. of Leningrad had determined
    the value of the mass of the cluster Omega Centauri to be one trillion
    times that of the sun. Since this value far exceeded the admissible density
    of all luminaries in the cluster, the scientists concluded that a black hole
    existed within the cluster. (Tass, FBIS-SOV, Sept. 74, U l )

20-23 September: Mariner 10 (launched 3 Nov. 1973) encountered the
     planet Mercury a second time, with its closest approach on 21 Sept. at
     48 069 km. The objective of the second flyby was to extend photographic
     coverage of the sun side of Mercury. The spacecraft obtained some 500
     TV science photos of Mercury, with 350 additional TV pictures to support
     an optical navigation experiment. Encounter TV pictures were trans-
     mitted in real time at the rate of 117.6 kilobits per second. New photo
     mosaics would correlate incoming and outgoing portions of Mercury
     photographed during the first encounter (25 March-5 April) and pro-
     vide additional views of the south polar area. In the two encounters,
     Mariner I0 had photographed 45% of Mercury's surface. Ultraviolet
     airglow scans were also made to obtain more information about Mer-
     cury's atmosphere.
        The spacecraft did not pass through either sun or earth occultation,
     and communications with the Deep Space Network stations were unin-
     terrupted. The second flyby was adjudged successful 3 Oct. A third flyby
     was planned for March 1975.
        Preliminary results, presented at a 23 Sept. press briefing at Jet Pro-
     pulsion Laboratory, indicated that scarps and evidence of volcanism ob-
     served on the first flyby were pervasive and not localized. The scabby
     hills detected on the first encounter in an area opposite the Caloris Basin
      did not reappear, suggesting that such terrain was peculiar to that site.

    was the second in regular airline service to use a steeper glide path,
    inclined 5.5" to the ground instead of 3". When the aircraft intersected
    the normal flight path, the glide path angle was decreased, with the
    landing made as usual. Both higher altitudes of the glide path and

30 September-5 October: A seminar to predict the probable state of the
     world in the year 2000 was held by the Smithsonian Institution for NASA
     as part of NASAâ€™s â€œOutlook for Spaceâ€ study begun during June. Experts
     from various fields discussed a new age-oriented global culture, the prob-
     ability of widespread famine, the prolonged disruption of technological
     economies by high oil prices, and the spread of nuclear power beyond
     control of the great powers. Seminar participants concluded that the
     intensification of nationalism would continue, particularly in response
     to economic stresses. Speakers from the high-technology sector, how-
     ever, stressed that the US. would not have to suffer from scarcity of
     resources, although resource extraction would be more expensive and
     would require new technology.

        Satellite reconnaissance to find mineral resources and to monitor
    threats to the global environment would still be necessary. The group
    also proposed surveillance to track all asteroids crossing the earthâ€™s
    orbit so that the impact of an asteroid might not be mistaken for a
    nuclear attack. Communications satellites were considered both useful
     for uniting countries and dangerous in their potential to increase threats
    of demagoguery. Many participants agreed that the time for uncontrolled
     free enterprise was passing and that we would require independent agen-
    cies for both planning and technology assessment, exempt from the
    special interests of particular government departments. Specialists also
    proposed that NASAâ€™s     planning and analytical abilities be applied to
    nationaI concerns in their full complexity, taking into account world
    economic, political, and social problems. (Sullivan, NYT, 8 o c t 74,

  ∞The International Aeronautical Federation held its 25th Congress in
    Amsterdam with the theme â€œSpace Stations, Present and Future.â€ Among
    speakers, Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford and Cosmonaut Aleksey A.
    Leonov, US. and Soviet commanders in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project,
    stressed how well joint work and understanding had advanced. A paper
    by Daniel J. Shramo of Lewis Research Center, with B. R. Foushee and
    P. J. Oâ€™Leary of General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., described the
    Centaur primary upper stage for solar system exploration and its poten-
    tial adaptation as an upper stage for the space shuttle.
       A Ukranian Academy of Sciences research team reported on experi-
    ments in the formation of melts in weightlessness with radiant heating
    and on prospects of using solar energy for space engineering. Compara-
    tive studies of metal solidification had suggested that a more uniform
    distribution of short-grained structures under weightlessness might be-
    come the basis of space technology, with the added attraction of using
    the sun as an energy source. The team had built a prototype solar plant
    that could be mounted on a spacecraft or used in a vacuum chamber on
    the earth.
       Soviet medical investigations during the flights of Soyuz 12 (launched
    27 Sept. 1973), Soyuz 13 (18 Dee. 1973), and Soyuz 14 (3 July) were
    reported by Dr. Oleg G. Gazenko and others. Findings indicated that
    prolonged exercises, full and partial spacesuits, and gravity-simulating
    fittings had reduced effects of weightlessness during the space flight and
    after the crewâ€™s return. Although reports of initial adaptation symptoms
    were similar to American findings, the Soviet paper also noted that cos-
    monauts had reduced vestibular symptoms by deliberately slowing down
    movements, especially head movements.

∞Interstellar space flight appeared possible, British Interplanetary Society
     engineers and scientists concluded after the first 15 mos of a study to es-
     tablish the feasibility of flight outside the solar system. Costs would be
     high, but so far none of the engineering difficulties seemed insoluble.
     The chief limitation that might delay such a project was the low natural
     abundance of helium 3 for the nuclear microbombs proposed for propul-
     sion.
        The Project Daedalus study had taken the star Barnard, six light
      years away, as a theoretical target. The journey was to be limited to 30-
     40 yrs, a working lifetime. To achieve the necessary 51 000-km-per-sec
     velocity, BIS scientists proposed a starship driven by a series of con-
     trolled nuclear explosions-each equivalent to 90 tons of TNT-occurring
      at the rate of 250 per sec. Microbombs, small pellets of nuclear fuel,
     would be compressed and heated to detonation point by electron beams.
     The rocket-powered boost phase would last 5 yrs, followed by a 35-yr
     coast. During flyby of Barnard, 10-20 probes would be released to
      search for inner planets and moons, sending back information to the
      mother ship for transmission to the earth.
        NASA had studied the nuclear-pulse propulsion concept for interplane-
     tary exploration through a General Dynamics Corp. contract in 1963,
      but had suspended the study because of costs and the Nuclear Test Ban
     Treaty. (Gatland, SF, Sept 74, 356-358; A&A 1963,1964,1965)

2 October: Roy E. Anderson, General Electric Co. Research and Development
    Center engineer, demonstrated the potential of geostationary satellites
    for search-and-rescuemissions. Standing on the NASA Hq. steps in Wash-
    ington, D.C., and using an ordinary walkie-talkie aided by an antenna
    built on the frame of a golferâ€™s umbrella, Anderson beamed a message to
    GEâ€™s Radio-Optical Observatory in Schenectady, N.Y., via NASAâ€™s 3     Ats
    Applications Technology Satellite. The inexpensive, 1.4-kg antenna in-
    creased the normal eight-kilometer range of the walkie-talkie more than
    10 000 times. Anderson suggested that a global search-and-rescue sys-
    tem, covering all but the polar regions, would require only six geostation-
    ary satellites. The necessary transponder could be attached to any com-
    munications satellite and would draw only a small portion of the satelliteâ€™s
    power. (GE Release, 2 Oct 74; AP, B Sun,3 Oct 74, A3)

∞Robert Hotz, in an Aviation Week editorial, praised the â€œstabilizing and

     Scoring the â€œofficial government hypocrisy about our non-military space

     separate civilian and military roles in space had â€œpersisted to this day

      of the biggest forces in deterring major aggression and keeping as
     much peace as there is left in the world.â€ In contrast, claimed Hotz, the

    traditional R&D areas were becoming less well defined for the various
    agencies, the Subcommittee found the greater portion of the funds for the
    programs should go to AEC rather than to NASA.
       The Subcommittee recommended: (1) NASA should continue, and
    expand as its budget permitted, its advanced nuclear research in
    potential energy applications. (2) NASA should continue complementary
    arrangements with other Federal agencies, especially AEC. (3) The
    Joint Committee on Atomic Energy should evaluate the Subcommittee

9-10 October: The fourth flight of the balloon-borneultraviolet stellar spec-

    scope experiment for the space shuttle. The National Scientific Balloon
    Facility of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) at
     Palestine, Tex., launched the 91-m tall, 440 000-cum, heliumfilled
    balloon, which carried a telescope, Ebert-Fastie spectrometer, detector,
    star-pointing-and-control system, and telemetry and command system to
    40 000-m altitude. During five hours at that altitude the instruments ob-
    served seven stars in uv wavelengths. The stars included one giant
     star and three super giants. Dr. Yoji Kondo of Johnson Space Center's
    Astrophysics Section, principal investigator for the experiment, said
    the flight was free of environment and hardware problems and its
    success marked a new stage in balloon-borne astronomical observation
    after past high failure rates. Data would be combined with other ob-
    servations for better information on the structure, atmosphere, and
    evolution of a variety of stars. The mission also evaluated state-of-

    The apogee kick motor, fired 13 Oct., circularized the orbit with 35 766-
    km apogee, 35 24d&m perigee, 23-hr 42-min period, and 0.5â€ inclina-
    tion. By 25 Nov. the comsat was operating normally at its station at about
    90â€ W longitude above the equator.
       The launch had been twice delayed, once for investigation of the
    entire Delta program and once for a last minute check of a connector
    pin. When launched, the vehicle performed as planned with two minor
    exceptions (both due to human error) : the 2ndstage cold-gas re-
    dundant altitude-control system switched from primary to backup nozzles
    because the guidance system had been programmed with too low a
    moment threshold and the umbilical end fitting was damaged becanse
    a tether had been improperly installed. Neither problem compromised the
    NASA mission objective: to place the satellite in an orbit of su5cient
    accuracy for transfer into a stationary synchronous orbit while retain-
    ing sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission lifetime
    requirements. The objective was met, and the mission was adjudged
    successful 30 Oct.
       Westar 2 joined Westar 1, launched 13 April 1974 and later placed in
    geosynchronous orbit at 99â€ W longitude. The Westar Satellite Com-
    munications System-consisting of Westar 1 and 2, a third satellite for
    later launch, and five ground stations-had the potential for general-
    purpose telecommunications throughout the continental US., Alaska,
    Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Western Union planned to make the system
    available to all users, largely through leasing the voice, TV, and data
    transmitting services. NASA would be reimbursed for the launch. (NASA

10 October: An electric rocket engine that short-circuited aboard Sert ZZ
    Space Electric Rocket Test satellite in 1970 had been restarted in space
    and successfully operated for six weeks, scientists at Lewis Research
    Center reported. Launched 3 Feb. 1970 to demonstrate that electric
    propulsion could be used for future space missions, Sert ZZ was to have
    operated an ion engine for six months in space. Engine thruster 2
    shut down after less than three months of operation; thruster 1performed
    for five months. Both failures were attributed to a small chip apparently
    eroded from a molybdenum grid and lodged between two grids at the
    back of the engine. William R. Kerslake, Sert U experiment manager,
    believed the chip was jarred loose in summer 1974 when the spacecraft
    was spun up by its cold-gas thruster system to obtain a better sun angle
    for solar arrays. Since then, the thruster had been operated successfully
    on 17 occasions for short periods, obtaining up to 80% of its maximum
    thrust. Electrical Propulsion Branch Chief Robert C. Finke said operation
    after 41/2 years proved â€œthe long term storability of this thruster designâ€
    and indicated that the system could be â€œconfidently incorporated into
    future missions requiring several years of thruster operation.â€ (LeRC

    Uhuru (Explorer 4 2 ) , launched 12 Dec. 1970, and Oao 3, launched
    21 Aug. 1971. Uhuru had extended the number of known celestial x-ray
    sources from about 30 to 200 and found evidence of a black hole com-
    panion to Cygnus X-1, later supported by Oao 3, sounding rocket, and
    ground-based observations. Four Ariel 5 pointing experiments focused
    on specific x-ray sources, and two scanning experiments swept the entire
    galaxy with every revolution. The GSFC scanning experiment-first of
    its kind to fly on an orbiting scientific satellite-consisted of two x-ray
    pinhole cameras, each with a 90â€™ field of view, providing together a
    sweep of the entire sky. After evaluation, Ariel 5 results would be avail-
    able to the world scientific community.
       Though all experiments obtained data during initial tests, two were
    drawing excessive current. The problem was resolved by outgassing. A
    slight delay in shutter closing on Experiment A, a star sensor, had little
    or no effect on the mission.
        The U.K.-U.S. cooperative satellite series had begun with Ariel I
    in 1962 and continued through Ariel 4, launched 11 Dec. 1971. Ariel 5
    was launched under a 2 Nov. 1970 SRC-NASA Memorandum of Under-
    standing, with a 27 Dec. 1973 Ietter modification shifting the launch
     site from Wallops Flight Center to San Marco to enhance scientific data
    return. The Memorandum tasked SRC with spacecraft design, fabrication,
     and testing, five experiments, primary command and control, and data
     reduction and analysis. NASA was responsible for one experiment, space-
     craft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle, and tracking, com-
    mand, and data acquisition. SRC financed all aspects of the Ariel pro-
     gram. The launch by members of the Univ. of Romeâ€™s Aerospace

    was â€œprepared to support a stronger aeronautics research and technology
    effortâ€ and had organized a long-range study group to evaluate the â€œOut-
    look for Aeronauticsâ€ in the 1980-2000 period. A report was due in the
    summer of 1975.
        Among possible technology goals, Dr. Fletcher was convinced that
    aircraft fuel savings of 50% within the next 20 yrs could be reached,
    through weight reductions by composite structures and fly-by-wire and
    active controls and through supercritical aerodynamics, advanced en-
    gine techniques, and operational methods. NASA would also give special
    attention to technology for alternative fuels, such as hydrogen. (Text)

∞The first prototype B-1 intercontinental strategic bomber was unveiled at
     Palmdale, Calif., by the Air Force and Rockwell International Corp.
     Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger told on-lookers that the new
     aircraft was needed to complement the US. arsenal of land-based
     and submarine-based missiles. Although smaller and lighter than the
     B-52 it was meant to replace, the B-1 could fly farther and faster, carry
     almost twice the payload, and use a shorter runway. Powered by four
     133.4-kilonewton-thrust (30 000-lb) turbofan engines and lifted by
     variable geometry, or â€œswingâ€ wings, the bomber could fly efficiently at
     speeds in excess of mach 2. The projected cost of production models-
     $76.4 million each-made the future of the aircraft controversial and

     experiments would be passive specimen modules, completely autonomous
     from spacecraft power, life support, and data-recording systems, and
     would require no operational commands from the ground during flight.
     NASA would prepare descriptions of the proposed experiments in Decem-
     ber and deliver flight hardware by 15 Aug. 1975. US. investigators would
     also participate in pre- and postflight studies of blood and tissue samples
     from animals flown aboard the next Soviet biological satellite.

  ∞The European Space Research Organization qejected a plan to install a
    launch pad for the McDonnell Douglas Thor-Delta launch vehicle at the
    Kourou Space Center in French Guiana. The ESRO decision, which fol-
    lowed a four-month feasibility study, cited the high cost of installing the
    pad-set at approximately $50 million-as the reason for the rejection.
    The press speculated that, although p-oponents of the proposal con-
    tended the Thor-Delta launch capability would complement the European
    Ariane launcher under development, the plan might have run into op-
    position from Ariane supporters who feared competition.
       NASA, when queried by ESRO officials, had voiced no objections to the
    plan even though the equatorial launch site would have increased the ve-
    hicleâ€™s orbital weight capacity by about 20% over launches from the

                                            Pioneer I 1 interplanetary probe,
2 November-3 January 1975: NASAâ€™s
   launched 5 April 1973, flew past Jupiter three times closer than Pioneer
   10 had a year earlier and sent back the first polar images of the planet.
   The spacecraft then headed on toward a September 1979 encounter with
    Saturn.
       Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, had been the first spacecraft to
    reach Jupiter-3 Nov. 1973-9 Jan. 1974. The success of that mission
    permitted NASA scientists to attempt a somewhat riskier approach with
   the backup Pioneer 11, a clockwise trajectory by the south polar region
    and then straight up through the intense inner radiation belt by the
    equator and back out over the north pole. Although the spacecraft went
   within 42 000 km of the planet at 12:22 am EST 3 Dec., its peak speed
   of 171 000 km per hr and the trajectoryâ€™s high latitude prevented serious
   radiation damage.
       The Jupiter mission of Pioneer 11 was to map the magnetic field; meas-
   ure distributions of high-energy electrons and protons in the radiation
   belts and look for auroras; find a basis for interpreting radio emissions
   from Jupiter; detect and measure the bow shock and magnetospheric
   boundary and their interactions with the solar wind; verify the thermal
   balance and determine temperature distribution of the outer atmos-
   phere; measure the hydrogen-helium ratio in the atmosphere; measure
   the structure of the ionosphere and atmosphere; measure the brightness,
   color, and polarization of Jupiterâ€™s reflected light; perform two-color
   visible-light imaging ; and increase the accuracy of orbit predictions and
   masses of Jupiter and its moons.
      The interplanetary mission was to map the interplanetary magnetic
   field; study the radial gradient of the solar wind and its fluctuations and
   structure; study the radial and transverse gradients and arrival direc-
   tions of high-energy charged particles (solar and galactic cosmic rays) :
   investigate relationships between the solar wind, magnetic field, and

    cosmic rays; search for the boundary and extent of the heliosphere (solar
    atmosphere) ; determine the density of neutral hydrogen; and determine
    the properties of interplanetary dust.
        Hurtling toward and then away from Jupiter, Pioneer 11 sent data back
    to the earth at 2048 bits per sec throughout most of the month before
    and after encounter. Picture-taking of Jupiter began 18 Nov., at
    14 800 000 km out from the planet. From 25 Nov. through 8 Dec., imag-
    ing and polarimetry observations were made 23 hrs a day.
        On 26 Nov. Pioneer 11 crossed the detached bow shock wave
     (7 772 OOO km out) at the juncture of the solar wind and Jupiterâ€™s mag-
    netic field and entered the magnetosphere (6 923 000 km out). In five
    hours the spacecraft passed undamaged through this first field of intense
    radiation. On 1 Dec. it crossed the orbit of Callisto-outermost of the
    five inner moons-and began returning its best pictures of Jupiter. On
    2 Dec. Pioneer 11 crossed the orbits of Jupiterâ€™s four closest moons and
    entered the inner radiation belt. During this last leg of the approach to
    the south polar region, the spacecraft continued the imaging and sensing
    of the planet and moons and made a closeup, two-hour scan that in-
    cluded the red spot portion of the surface.
        Less than 12 hrs before the spacecraft passed behind Jupiter, an in-
    tense peak of electron radiation built up a 4000-v electric charge within
    the spacecraft. The charge created an electric arc that signaled heater
    lines to turn on-drawing spacecraft power and weakening the signal to
    earth. In about three hours the problem was identified and override com-
    mands from earth switched the heaters back off.
        At midnight on 3 Dec. Pioneer I1 entered Jupiter radio occultation-
     a blackout that lasted 42 min while the spacecraft swung behind the
     142 744-km-diaplanet-moving from the south pole straight up over the
    north pole. Since Pioneer 11 radio signals required 4 min to cross the
                                                             6
     737 million km separating the earth and Jupiter at the time of encounter,
     the spacecraft had already circumscribed the planet before the earth lost
     contact with its signal. During occultation the spacecraft passed through
     the most intense radiation (up to 40 000 times as much in the earthâ€™s radi-
     ation belts) , reached its greatest speed (171 000 km per hr) and came
     closest to the planet (within 42 O00 km of the cloudtops). At 1:24 am
     EST--62 min after periapsis-the signal reached earth, indicating that the
     spacecraft had emerged from behind the planet and that all systems had
     survived the most critical phase of the mission. Temporary failures had
     lost some data, but no permanent damage was sustained.
        Following the Jupiter encounter, Dr. James C.Fletcher, NASA Admin-
     istrator, renamed the spacecraft Pioneer-Saturn as it headed toward the
     planet Saturn. The exact target point had not been selected but scientists
     considered an interesting possibility was to target the spacecraft to pass
     between Saturn and its rings and then close by Titan, one of Saturnâ€™s
     moons and a possible location of life. The five-year, 2.4-billion-km trip
     to Saturn would carry PioneerSaturn about 160 000 000 km above the
     orbit planes of most planets.
        Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to use the gravity of an outer planet
     to throw it to another planet farther out, came the closest to Jupiter, was
     the fastest spacecraft yet launched, and was the first spacecraft to photo-

       Pioneer 11 confirmed, but somewhat modified, the findings of Pioneer
     10.The model of a relatively flat, disclike magnetosphere was challenged
    by new evidence suggesting a large, blunt magnetosphere of irregular and
    fluctuating shape. Temperature measurements of about 125 K at cloud-
    tops supported Pioneer 10 readings, which were lower than those indi-
    cated by earth-based observations. Imaging revealed a decrease in the
    banding structure of the planet with increased latitude and a more
    mottled structure across the poles. (NASA Releases 76292,74-300; Hall,

     to produce the fuel by removing humans from the step endangering
     health, but adequate supplies could not be produced before the end of
     the year. Stopgap measures taken by the Air Force, including strict
     control and allocation of existing supplies, was preventing the shortage

15 November: NASA launched three satellites-Noaa 4 (ITOS-G) meteorologi-
    cal satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
    Intasat ionospheric satellite for Spain, and Amsat Oscar 7 amateur
    radio communications satellite-from Western Test Range at 9 : 1 am  1
    PST on one Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The three spacecraft entered
    dmost identical, near-to-planned, polar orbits. It was the first triple
    launch for a Thor-Delta.
       Noaa 4 entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1444-km perigee, 115-
    min period, and 101.7â€™ inclination, as the fourth operational Improved
    Tiros Operational Satellite in the joint NASA and Dept. of Commerce
    program to provide global cloud-cover observations. Delayed 29 Oct.
    by faulty electrical connectors on the Thor-Delta and again 13 Nov.
    when a 2nd-stage hydraulic pump posed a problem, the launch went
    smoothly on 15 Nov. N o m 4 joined Noaa 2, launched 15 Oct. 1972, and
    Noaa 3, launched 6 Nov. 1973.
        The 345-kg, three-axis-stabilized, earth-oriented satellite moved in a
    circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Day and night coverage of
    the earthâ€™s cloud cover was provided by two very-high-resolution radiom-
    eter instruments and by two scanning radiometer sensors. Two vertical-
    temperature-profile radiometers made continuous radiance measurements

     every part of the earthâ€™s surface at least twice daily. One secondary
     sensor, the solar proton monitor, studied solar activity and its effects
     on the earthâ€™s environment. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible
     for design, development, launch, and in-orbit checkout of the space-
     craft. NOAAâ€™S National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS) would
     take over operation of the satellite after checkout. NASA mission objec-
     tives-to launch the spacecraft into sun-synchronous orbit of sufficient
     accuracy for operational mission requirements and to conduct an in-orbit
     evaluation and checkout of the spacecraft-were accomplished and the
     mission was adjudged successful % Jan. 1976.
        Zntasat, the first Spanish satellite, separated from the Delta 2nd
     stage 24 min after launch and entered orbit with a 1468-kmapogee and
     perigee, 115-min period, and 101.7O inclination. The 20-kg, 12-sided,
     magnetically oriented, spin-stabilized spacecraft would measure iono-
     spheric electron content, irregularities, and scintillations in a joint
     space research program of NASA and the Instituto Nacional de T6cnica

    Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico toward Messier 13, a globular
    cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way, 25 000 light years from
    the earth. The transmission-devised by the staff of the National
    Astronomy and Atmosphere Center, which included the Observatory
    and was operated by Cornel1 Univ. for the National Science Founda-
    tion-was a coded message representing life on the earth. The Observa-
    toryâ€™s new 450-kw radar transmitter, sponsored by NASA and completed
    in October, had increased the planetary ranging and surface mapping

    Eastern Test Range at 6:U pm EST on an Atlas-Centaur vehicle into a
    transfer orbit with a 35 899.2-km apogee, 536.5-km perigee, 10-hr
    39.8-min period, and 26.0â€™ inclination.
        NASAâ€™s primary objectives were to conduct design, performance, and
    flight readiness reviews for the Federal Communications Commission,
    to ensure compittibility of Intelsat spacecraft with NASA launch ve-
    hicles and launch environmental conditions, and to launch Intelsat-IV
    F-8 into a transfer orbit that would permit the spacecraft apogee motor
     to inject the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit for communications
     service.
        The apogee kick motor was fired by ComSatCorp at 6:48 pm EST
     on 23 Nov., placing IntelsatdV F-8 in a near-circular prbit with a
    35 780-km apogee, 35 630-km perigee, 23-hr 51.9-min period, and 1.8â€

     and Science and Applications. Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, NASA Associate
    Administrator, testified that the preliminary cost estimate of $364 mil-
     lion, presented to the Committee in 1969, had been nearly trebled by
     delay in the mission from 1973 to 195, inflation, and technical prob-
     lems in â€œdeveloping the most advanced automated space equipment this
     country has ever attempted.â€ The new total included a $930-million
     cost target, a $20-million contingency fund, and the cost of the Titan-
     Centaur launch vehicles. One orbiter and one lander spacecraft had
     been deleted from the program [see 10 Oct.], manpower had been re-
     duced, and a number of tests had been eliminated. Dr. Petrone expressed
     L6
        confidencein our present technical approach and our ability to meet cost
      goals.â€ Dr. Edgar M. Coriright, Langley Research Center Director, at-
     tributed the â€œ$120 million in unanticipated problemsâ€ experienced by
     mid-1973 to an underestimation of the complexity of the project at the
     outset: â€œWe have been p1ayir.g catch up ever since because of the low
     estimate to start with.â€
         Questioned about a newspaper article saying the Viking lander might
    sink deep into Martian surface dust, Dr. Petrone said that tests men-
    tioned in the article had been made some years earlier, not â€œtwo weeks
    agoâ€ as reported. Dr. Noel W. Hinners, Associate Administrator for
    Space Science, testified that the landerâ€™s footpad area had been increased
    since the earlier tests and that radar observations had indicated the
    proposed landing sites for the first mission appeared â€œwell within the
     capabilityâ€ of the lander. Sites for the second mission were still being

                            December 1974

2-8 December: The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 16, carrying cosmonauts
    Col. Anatoly V. Filipchenko and Nikolay N. Rukavishnikov, from Bay-
    konur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam at 2:40 pm local time (4:40 am EST)
    in preparation for the July 1975 US.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
    mission. The spacecraft, identical to the one that would fly during the
    ASTP mission, entered orbit with a 280-km apogee, 194-km perigee, 89.3-
    min period, and 51.8â€ inclination. Tass reported the purpose of the
    mission was to test the spacecraftâ€™s onboard systems, which had been
    â€œmodernized to meet the demands of the joint flightâ€; make scientific
    and technical investigations; and observe and photograph sections of
    the earthâ€™s surface for the solution of economic problems.
       In a prelaunch Tass interview, Filipchenko said that the mission was
    to last several days. â€œThis would be enough for us to test carefully all the
    shipâ€™s systems, above all its docking gear.â€ Using a passive simulator
    docking ring, Soyuz 16 would make docking and separation maneuvers
    in almost all the ASTP modes. In addition, U.S.S.R. ASTP Technical Direc-
    tor Konstanin D. Bushuyev said in a launch-day Tass interview, the crew
    would check out the Soyuz life support system, which had been re-
    designed for better compatibility with Apollo. Soyuz normally had a
    cabin pressure of 10 newtons per sq cm (14.7 psi) and an atmosphere
    similar in oxygen content to terrestrial atmosphere. Apollo maintained
    its pure oxygen atmosphere at 3.5 newtons per sq cm (5 psi). To reduce
    the acclimation period for the crewsâ€™ transition between the two atmos-
    pheres, the U.S.S.R. had agreed to reduce the pressure and increase the
    percentage of oxygen in the Soyuz atmosphere. The systemâ€™s capacity
    also had been increased to accommodate four persons.
       On 3 Dec. NASA, which had been tracking Soyuz 16 since shortly
    after launch, began a 15-day joint tracking rehearsal with the U.S.S.R.
    After the mission, information gathered by nine US. tracking stations
    would be compared with data from Soviet tracking stations. Meanwhile
    the crew reduced the spacecraftâ€™s cabin pressure to 7.2 newtons per
    sq cm (10.4 psi) and doubled the oxygen content, from 20% to LEO%,
    with no adverse effect. Color TV broadcasts from the spacecraft showed
    all was well. A trajectory correction 4 Dec. placed Soyuz 16 in a circular
    orbit with a 225-km altitude, 88.9-min period, and 51.8â€ inclination,
    an orbit similar to ASTP requirements. Simulated docking and separa-
    tion maneuvers â€œpassed off without a hitchâ€ 5-7 Dec., Tass reported.
     Medical, biological, earth resources, and astronomy experiments
    also were carried out during the six-day mission. At 1:a Baykonur
                                                                 pm
    time (3:04am ZST) 8 Dec., Soyuz 16 softlanded in the U.S.S.R. 300 km
    north of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakstan. Tass reported the cosmonauts
    were in good health.
       Following the successful landing, US.ASTP Technical Director Glynn
     S. Lunney conveyed his congratulations â€œfor the brilliant rehearsal
     before the Soviet-US. flight.â€ In a Tass interview Bushuyev said,

     Johnson Space Center news conference. US. ASTP Technical Director
      Glynn S. Lunney said the arrangement would satisfy U.S. technical
     needs.
         In a 12 Dec. press conference at Star City, Maj. Gen. Vladimir A.
     Shatalov, U.S.S.R. chief of cosmonaut training, said American crews
     would be permitted to view only facilities directly connected with
     the flight itself. â€œEverything that American astronauts need to be
     acquainted with on the Soyuz that will fly will be shown them before-
     hand.â€ In the meantime astronauts would train with mockups and
     simulators. (JSC PIO, interview, 15 Sept 75; Keefer, Today, 5 Dec 74;

2 December: The surface of Jupiterâ€™s moon Io might be composed of evapo-
     rite salt deposits, rich in sodium and sulfur, NASA reported. A year-long
     Jet Propulsion Laboratory study had indicated that deposits had resulted
     from migration of salt-saturated aqueous solutions to Ioâ€™s surface from
     a warm or hot interior followed by loss of the water to space. Salt-rich
     materials could have been produced by the leaching of carbonaceous
     meteorites. According to Dr. Fraser P. Fanale, JPL team leader, the de-
    posits could account for Ioâ€™s high reflective power, the absence of ice
    bands, and the dark reddish poles.
        Sodium vapor emissions from Io had been first reported in February
     1973 by Dr. Robert Brown of Harvard Univ. Subsequently, the cloud
    of sodium was observed to extend more than 320 000 km from Io.
        In August Dr. Fanale with two other astronomers had proposed
    explanations for the sodium emissions. Proton bombardment experi-
    ments had indicated that sodium and other atoms had been blasted from
    Ioâ€™s surface by the impact of Jupiterâ€™s magnetospheric protons, electrons,
    and ions and had formed a cloud around Io. Ioâ€™s glow, according to
    intensive spectral studies, resulted from scattering of sunlight by the
    sodium cloud. (NASA Release 74-315; Fanale et al., Science, 6 Dec 74,

∞ The first Apollo lunar surface experiment package (ALSEP) , placed on
    the moon by Apollo 12 astronauts in November 1969, had far exceeded
    its one-year life expectancy and was still functioning, along with instru-
    ments in ALSEP packages from Apollo 14 through 17, NASA announced.
    From ALSEP magnetometers, Dr. Palmer Dyal, Ames Research Center
    lunar investigator, had calculated that the moon had a magnetic field
    1000 times weaker than the earthâ€™s, with an iron content about 9% by
    weight, in contrast to the earthâ€™s 30%. The heat flow measured by ALSEP
    instruments was half the earthâ€˜s, indicating differentiation and upward

      concentrations of radioactivity early in the moonâ€™s history, Seismom-
      eters had uncovered a new class of moonquakes originating at depths
      of 100 km or less below the lunar surface. Dr. M. Nafi Toksoz of Massa-
      chusetts Institute of Technology earlier had reported that preliminary
      information indicated the moon had a small core less than 800 km
      across, lying inside a molten shell 600-1000 km down from the surface,
      where deep moonquakes had been detected. Seismic, magnetic, and heat-
      flow data had also suggested that the moon was further along than the
      earth in its evolutionary history. (NASA Release 74c313; NASA prog off,

∞The Dept. of Defense had officially approved development of the NAVSTAR
     Glohal Positioning System (GPS) , the Air Force announced. The first
     phase of the three-phase joint armed services program called for five
     Rockwell International Corp. spacecraft to join a Navy Navigational
      Technology Satellite (NTS) in two-plane orbital constallations in 1977
     to test the system. The five-meter, 635-kg spacecraft would be launched
     on Atlas F boosters by the Air Force Systems Commandâ€™s Space Missile
     Test Center. Phase two would bring the number of satellites to nine in
                                                                   24 satellites

     orbiting at an 18 520-km altitude, providing three-dimensional location
     to air, sea, and surface vehicles in all kinds of weather-would be com-
     plete in the mid-1980s. (AFSC Release OIP274.74)
 ∞ Inflation would force even more extensive cuts in NASA operations if fund-
     ing did not increase in the next few fiscal years, Aviation Week & Space
     Technology reported in a survey of NASA belt-tightening. The magazine
     quoted ,VASA Comptroller William E. Lilly as saying cost contracts for
     major spacecraft programs had a %12% inflation rate. The overall
     effective impact of inflation was 7-7.576 at NASA, but these averages
     were much lower than for many specific areas. Although materials
     increases were averaging 15-20%, particular increases ranged from
     &loo%. The 7% inflation rate in Center supplies was being absorbed
     by using inventories and by decreasing the use of supplies. Utility cost
     increases of 20-30% at NASA Centers had been countered by lower use-
     a 30% cut-but Centers were still paying l0-15% more. Overall wage
     rates could increase 20-30% over the next three years, Lilly had said,
     because of a trend-setting agreement between the Boeing Co. and the
     International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Support serv-
     ice contracts were showing a 7-976 yearly inflationary increase.
        NASA Centers were seeking new solutions. At Goddard Space Flight
     Center, more fixed-price contracts were being issued, but predicting
    economic changes was problematic, according to William R. Mecca,
     GSFC Deputy Director for Administration and Management. GSFC had
    begun limiting data acquisition from spacecraft and drawing up con-
    tingency plans for many unmanned programs-like the International
                                     209

    spending limits.
        Marshall Space Flight Center had reduced its work force by 8 5 0 -
    about 15%-since June 1973 and had closed 47 structures. Lewis Re-
    search Center had cut its power needs 776, using a transient data-record-
    ing system to reduce operating hours. Johnson Space Center, along with
    others, had been hiring young persons rather than high-salaried experi-
    enced persons. JSC electric costs were still increasing even though the
     Center had reduced its exterior lighting by 75% and its interior lighting
    by 33%. Kennedy Space Center was phasing construction for shuttle
     and other programs, outfitting facilities to meet minimum initial opera-
     tional requirements rather than for long-range mission models. Con-
    sideration was being given to advance procurement for lower costs and
    for preventing slowdowns from shortages. (Covault, Aw Wk,2 Dec 74,

4 December: The NASA Space Shuttle Cost and aeview Committee recom-

    reduce rising costs. It also reported design changes made necessary by
    thermal weight constraints. The committee, headed by NASA Associate
    Administrator for Manned Space Flight John F. Yardley, recommended
    delaying the second shuttle orbiter flight, refurbishing the first test
    orbiter earlier than planned instead. Deferrals of three months to two
    years were recommended for components of the second shuttle launch
    complex at Kennedy Space Center, which had originally been scheduled
    for completion about the time of the first shuttle flights. Also recom-
    mended was a delay in the development of improved spacesuits and port-
    able life support systems for extravehicular activities from the space
    shuttle. Instead, EVAS would use Apollo-style hardware. Emergency bar-

    Some tests were recommended for cancellation.
        Design changes to accommodate thermal and weight constraints in-
    cluded payload doors of a graphite epoxy composite that expanded less
    when heated and weighed 400 kg less than the aluminum composite
    originally planned for use. Solid-fueled-rocket separation motors that
    would provide a higher thrust level for a shorter time when separating
    the large solid-propellant boosters from the orbiter after launch were
    found to cause no orbiter darnage-solving a possible problem antici-
    pated with the original separation motors. The committee also recom-
    mended switching to a new thermal coating material for the external
    liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen tank to prevent tank overheating
    during launch. (NASA prog off, interview, 22 Sept 75; Av Wk, Sept 74,

    the needle-nosed fast version would maintain relatively economical fuel
    consumption-13 000 to 17 000 km per cu m per passenger-about twice
    the fuel economy of supersonic transports like the Concorde or the
    Russian Tu-144. For slower flight, the wing would be fixed at right angles
    to the fuselage, for landings and takeoffs with minimum power and noise.

10 December-I6 January 1975: NASA launched West German-built Helios I
     solar probe at 2:11 am EST from Eastern Test Range on a Titan I I I E
    Centaur vehicle, putting it on a path that would take it closer to the sun
    than any spacecraft had yet traveled. The spacecraft first entered a
    parking orbit and then an elliptical orbit of the sun with a 0.985-~~
    aphelion, 0.3095-~u perihelion, 190.15-day period, and 0.02" inclina-
    tion to the ecliptic. All vehicle systems performed normally during
    launch.
       The Titan-Centaur carried a Delta solid-fueled rocket-motor kick
    stage as a 4th stage and required seven interdependent ignition systems.
       Following separation from the 1st stage, the Centaur, with 2300 kg
    of propellants remaining, began maneuvers to provide data for the
    1977 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, future synchronous orbit missions,
    and continued development of the launch vehicle. Maneuvers included
    a one-hour coast and restart, three-hour coast with thermal maneuvers,
    boost-pump operation experiment with igniter on, and zero-g boost-
    pump dead-head operation.
       Helios 1 was to investigate the fundamental solar processes and solar-
    terredrial relations by studying the solar wind, magnetic and electric
    fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust from launch to the first perihelion,
    0.31 AU from the sun. The 370-kg spool-shaped spacecraft carried 10
    instruments-7 West German and 3 U.S.-to measure the solar wind,
    magnetic field, and related shock waves; study radio waves and oscilla-
    tions in the electron plasma; measure the spatial gradient of solar and
    galactic cosmic rays; observe composition and dynamics of inter-
    planetary dust; and monitor x-ray activity of the solar disc.
       By 16 Jan. orientation and spin-rate maneuvers had been conducted
    and the high-gain antenna despun and pointed toward the earth. Control
    of the spacecraft had been passed to Germany. Fnstruments had been
    turned on and were operating normally with two exceptions: One of
    two antennas in the U.S. plasma-wave experiment had jammed during
    extension and unrolled inside the drive enclosure, producing an electrical
    ground and degrading all low-frequency data. Rewinding the antenna
    had not eliminated the ground. In addition, operation of the high-gain
    antenna for the West German plasma experiment produced a space
    charge near the spacecraft, preventing detection of electrons with energies
 ID

    less than 100 ev. The medium-gain antenna would be used during selected
    periods.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1974                   10 December-16 January

       To prepare for its demanding mission, Helios 1, designed to withstand
    the highest temperatures ever demanded of a spacecraft, had been
    successfully subjected to six days at 644 K (700"F), the highest heat
    load expected at 0.3 AU, during spring 1974 tests at Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory. The spacecraft had also withstood radiation 11 times the
    solar intensity at the outer edge of the earth's atmosphere. Independent
    payload components, louver systems, optical surface reflectors and
    mirrors, and several layers of insulation dissipated spacecraft heat. In
    addition the spacecraft spun at one revolution per second to distribute

∞The universe was 16 billion yrs old, 6 billion yrs older than earlier esti-
     mates, according to California Institute of Technology astronomer Dr.
     Allen R Sandage, the Washington Post reported after an interview.
     After 10 yrs of observing 50 galaxies, Dr. Sandage had dated the
     galaxies from 14 billion yrs ago, meaning that 2 billion yrs were required
     for the primordial gas cloud to cool enough for stars to begin forming.
     Working with Swiss astronomer Gustav Tamman, Dr. Sandage had ar-
      rived at his new date when his observations had led him to recalculate
     the Hubble Constant, the rate of speed for the expansion of the uni-
     verse. He had checked his figures by dating stars in globular clusters
     in the Milky Way and by measuring the amounts of metal still burning
     in their atmospheres. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 1 Dec 74, A l )

13 December: A golden age of planetary exploration was a realistic pos-
     sibility, Science quoted Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, as
     saying in an interview. Dr. Fletcher believed space science was likely
    to be a major thrust of the space program in the 198Os, although NASAâ€™s
    budget was vulnerable to cuts in the present political climate. He ruled
     out manned programs otlier than the space shuttle, but NASA would
    not become an all-purpose technology development agency for energy,
    ground transportation, and similar nonspace systems. Applications and
    materials processing would be important. Dr. Fletcher believed NASAâ€™s
    program was acceptable to Congress and to the White House and that its
    future problem would not be wholesale cancellation of the space program
     but surviving annual budget cuts.
        Increased competition for money and staff attention in congressional
    space-related committees could aggravate NASAâ€™s       budgetary problems,
    according to Science. Observers had predicted that Congress would be
    faced with a choice between the shuttle and continuation of the space
     science and applications program. The decision could rest on the support
    of the shuttle program by organized labor, as it had in a 1972 Senate
    attempt to kill the shuttle. Some scientists had suggested that a $1-billion
    NASA budget cut would be better for science than a $lOO-million cut
    because the former would entail canceling the shuttle, in theory freeing
    money for space science. Dr. Fletcher had maintained, however, that a
    balance between programs would be kept. (Hammond, Science, 13 Dec

  ∞Three Kitt Peak National Observatory astronomers announced they had
    photographed large-scale structures, hot and cold regions, that were
    probably convection currents in the atmosphere of Alpha Orionis (the
    star Betelguese in the Constellation Orion), 500 light years from the
    earth. The announcement,made in Florida at the American Astronomical
    Societyâ€™s annual meeting, was based on photos made 28 March using
    the four-meter Mayall Telescope. A new technique of interferometry
    analysis had permitted reconstruction of the starâ€™s image. In resolving
    the disc of Betelguese, the Kitt Peak astronomers became the first ob-
    servers to distinguish actual forms on a star other than the sun. (NSF

16 December: The first map of gravity forces on the moonâ€™s far side indicated
    that the strong gravitational tug of mascons (mass concentrations) on
    the lunar face was caused by lava flooding rather than by buried meteor-
    ites as previously thought, California Institute of Technology planetary
    scientist Dr. Alfred J. Ferrari reported in a press release based on a
    paper to be published in Science. The map was developed from measure-
    ments of the orbits of two small subsatellites left orbiting the moon by
    Apollo 15 and 16 in July 1971 and April 1972 and of Lunar Orbiter 5
     (launched 1 Aug. 1967). Basins on the moonâ€™s far side, not lava-filled,
    exerted only weak gravitational forces on orbiting spacecraft, while lava-
    flooded basins on the front side exerted a strong pull. (Miles, LA Times,

18 December-6 January 1975: NASA launched Symphonie I, French and West
    German experimental communications satellite, at 9 :39 pm EST from
    Eastern Test Range on a three-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch
    vehicle. The 402-kg satellite entered a transfer orbit with a 38 071-km
    apogee, 402-km perigee, 688.2-min period, and 13.2â€™ inclination.
        Nine seconds after the Thor-Deltaâ€™s 3rd stage separated from the 2nd
    stage, the inertial measurement unit (the altitude-sensing portion in the
    2nd-stage guidance system) stopped functioning, but the failure did not
    affect the path of the already separated 3rd stage. In addition, the main
    engine cutoff was achieved by fuel depletion with 430 kg liquid oxygen
    remaining instead of with the planned depletion. The anomalies, which
    did not affect the mission, were under investigation.
        Ground controllers in West Germany activated the apogee kick motor,
    the first using liquid propellant, at 6:OO pm EST 21 Dec., putting the
    spacecraft in circular geosynchronous orbit with 35 810-km apogee,
    35 767-km perigee, 23-hr 56-min period, and 0 . 3 O inclination. The space-
    craft was despun and three-axis-stabilized and its large solar panels were

     provide the launch vehicle and services on a cost-reimbursable basis and
    in June 1974 signed a launch services contract with CNES-GfW. Goddard
    Space Flight Center in cooperation with French and West German ground
    stations was responsible for tracking the spacecraft during launch and

    storage 27 Nov., had been rod-peened (pounded with a small bundle of
    rods to place compressive stresses in the surface of the material) to
    avoid the stress-corrosion problems that had delayed the Skylab 4
    launch in November 1973. Bolt holes for the fins had been rounded

∞Ames Research Center scientist Dr. Theodore Wydeven, Jr., had developed
    a new technique for coating salt lenses, NASA announced. Lenses made
    from large salt crystals had long been used in scientific applications
    because they were transparent to infrared light, but they were suscep-
    tible to fogging from even slight moisture. Using a method from his
    water purification experiments, Dr. Wydeven had prepared a Teflon-like
    membrane in an electric discharge to coat a salt lens, at a few cents
    a coating. The coating increased resistance to moisture and enhanced
    optical quality of the lens because of the filmâ€™s antireflection properties.

25 December: Tass announced that the flight of the U.S.S.R.â€™s Salyut 3
    orbiting space station, launched 25 June, would soon end, after com-
    pletion of a six-month program that doubled the flight duration origi-
    nally planned. During its six months operation the spacecraft had per-
    formed more than 400 scientific and technical experiments, received
    more than 8000 control commands from the earth, conducted more
    than 200 â€œdynamic operaiions,â€ conducted 70 TV transmission and 2500
    telemetric sessions, fired its thrusters more than 500 000 times, and
    generated 5000 kw of electricity with its solar panels. A two-man crew,
    launched 3 July on Soyuz 14, boarded the space station and spent 1 5
    days living and working in space. A second crew, launched 26 Aug. on
    SOYUZ15, failed in several attempts to dock with the station and returned
    to the earth after 48 hrs in space. Since that time Salyut 3 had operated
    in an unmanned automatic mode. The Western press later speculated
    that the mission was being ended to prevent any interference with the

26 December-9 February 1975: The U.S.S.R. launched Salyut 4 space station
    into earth orbit and 16 days later launched Soyw 1 7 with a two-man
    crew to join the Salyut and establish a manned orbital laboratory.
       Salyut 4 was launched 26 Dec. from Baykonur Cosmodrome near
    Tyuratam into orbit with a 252-km apogee, 214km perigee, 89.2-min
    period, and 51.6â€ inclination. Tass announced the purpose of the mission
    was to test the design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct
    scientific studies and experiments in space. The news agency also re-
    ported that onboard systems and equipment were operating normally.
       The Western press reported that major maneuvers 29 and 30 Dee.

    Aleksey A. Gubarev and Georgy M. Grechko into orbit with a 249-km
    apogee, 186-km perigee, 88.9-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination. Tass
    announced the mission would carry out joint experiments with Salyut 4,
    including a comprehensive checkup of the spacecraftâ€™s onboard systems
    in various flight conditions. In a launch-day interview with Tass, Maj.
    Gen. Georgy T. Beregovoy, head of the Soviet cosmonaut training cen-
    ter, said that Soyuz 17.wa.s in â€œno way connected with additional
    checkups of â€˜Soyuzâ€™ systems before its rendezvous with â€˜Apollo.â€™ â€
       An orbital correction raised the spacecraft to an orbit with a 354-
    km apogee, 293-km perigee, 90.7-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination,
    permitting Soyuz 17 to dock with Salyut 4 on 12 Jan. The spacecraft
    was moved automatically to a distance of 10 m from the station and
    then the cosmonauts completed docking by manual control. The crew
    entered the space stztion, switched on the power and radio transmitters,
    and inspected the scientific equipment.
       In a 14 Jan. interview with Tass, Dr. Konstantin P. Feoktistov, cos-
    monaut who had helped design the space station, said that Salyut 4
    improvements included three panels of solar batteries that were posi-
    tioned like the tail of an aircraft and could be individually oriented
    toward the sun. The panels permitted the energy supply in the station to
    be replenished without using fuel for spacecraft orientation. Other im-
    provements had been introduced in the flight control systems.
       During a broadcast from the spacecraft over Moscow Radio 15 Jan.,
    Gubarev and Grechko said they had set up the first Soviet space-based
    teletype communications station. The teletype could receive and copy
    communications from the earth while the cosmonauts were busy at
    other tasks. Tass reported 17 Jan. that the cosmonauts, neither of whom
    had been in space before, had become accustomed to weightlessness
    about the fifth or sixth day of flight.
       During nearly 30 days aboard Salyut 4, Gubarev and Grechko used a
    newly developed high-resolution solar telescope to study solar phenom-
    ena, x-ray telescopes and sensors to study the flux of x-radiation from
    celestial bodies, and an infrared spectrometer to examine the earthâ€™s
    radiation. The cosmonauts also studied effects of weightlessness on the
    human vestibular function, cardiovascular system, and blood ; made
    earth resources observations; and studied the earthâ€™s upp$r atmosphere.
    They resprayed two telescope mirrors dulled by exposure to space;

     23-day 18-hr 22-min Soviet record for time in space set by the Soyuz 11
    crew on Salyut 1 (6-30 June 1971) before they were killed during re-
    entry. On-the-spot and later medical checks showed that the Soyuz 17
     cosmonauts had â€œwithstood well the long space flight.â€
        Salyut 4 was the fourth space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1

                           1974 in Summary

Launches
   The US. orbited 28 payloads in 22 launches during the year. The U.S.S.R.
 orbited 95 payloads in 81 launches; Italy launched 2 payloads, using NASA
 launch vehicles; and Japan launched 1. US. launches included 16 payloads
 in 14 NASA launches and 12 spacecraft in 8 Dept. of Defense launches.
   For the first year since 1967 the US. launched no men into space, although
Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William
R. Pogue completed the longest mission yet accomplished by man when
they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 8 Feb. after 84 days in space. The
U.S.S.R. orbited three two-man crews during the year, including two crews
to dock with the Salyut 3 space station. The Soyuz 14 crew docked and worked
aboard the laboratory for nearly 16 days, but Soyuz 15 failed to dock and it
returned to earth after 48 hrs in space. Soyuz 16 tested the Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project configuration in December. The U.S.S.R. also launched the Salyut 4
orbiting space station, to be joined by a two-man crew in January 1975.
    The 16 NASA-launchedpayloads-11 paid for by domestic and foreign cor-
porations or foreign governments-included 7 communications, 1 applica-
tions technology, 2 meteorological, and 6 scientific satellites. These were in
addition to 2 Italian-launched cooperative scientific satellites. Comsats in-
cluded two spacecraft launched for United Kingdom military communications
-Skynet ZZA into too low an orbit, followed later by the successful Skynet ZZB,
Westar 1 and 2, launched for Western Union Telegraph Co., were the firljt
US. commercial domestic communications satellites. The most complex and
versatile of the Applications Technology Satellites, Ats 6, went into orbit in
May. The spacecraft was transmitting medical and educational telecommunica-
tions to small inexpensive ground stations in remote areas of the US. and
would, in 1975, be positioned to broadcast educational programs to 5000
villages in India. Symphonie 1 was launched for France and West Germany
as the first of two experimental communications satellites. Inâ€˜ntelsat-ZVF-8
was launched for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the Interna-
tional Telecommunications Satellite Organization, and Amsat Oscar 7 for
Radio Amateur Satellite Corp. as a secondary payload on the Noua 4 launch.
   The two meteorological satellites included Synchronous Meteorological
Satellite Sms I, launched for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration to provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over
the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Sms 1 was the first meteoro-
logical satellite in synchronous orbit. Noaa 4 was launched as part of NOMâ€™S
global weather watch program.
   All but one of NASAâ€™s scientific payloads were cooperative efforts with
                           six
foreign countries. Miranda (UK-X4) was launched for U.K. to measure the
density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft as well as test space-
craft systems. Spainâ€™s first satellite-Intasat, put into polar orbit as a second-
ary payload with N o m &began studies of the ionosphere. Two spacecraft
were launched in cooperation with West Germany: Aeros 2 to measure aero-

nomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and solar ultraviolet radiation,
Helios I into solar orbit to investigate interstellar space closer to the sun than
any previous spacecraft had and to gather extensive new data on the sun.
NASA and The Netherlands joined to orbit The Netherlands Astronomical
Satellite Am 1 to study stellar w and x-ray sources. NASAâ€™s           only all-U.S.
scientific payload, Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52), was launched into polar orbit to
study plasma properties of the magnetosphere over the north polar cap.
   A Titan-Centaw proof-flight vehicle carrying a Viking spacecraft model
and a SPHINX satellite failed to achieve orbit and was destroyed during launch
operations. The new NASA launch vehicle later successfully launched Helios 1.
   Italian launch crews, using NASA launch vehicles, launched two satellites into
earth orbit from the San Marco launch platform in the Indian Ocean off the
East African coast. Sun Marc0 4 in February carried two U.S. and one Italian
experiment into orbit to measure diurnal variations in the equatorial neutral
atmosphere. Ariel 5 was launched in October for U.K., to study galactic and
extragalactic x-ray sources, in the first Italian launch for a country other than
the US. or Italy.
   Japan launched its fifth satellite, Tansei 2-Japanâ€™s        first on a guided
booster.
   In addition to the three manned Soyuz missions, the U.S.S.R. launched 2
Salyut space stations; 3 unmanned Soyuz spacecraft identified as Cosmos 638,
656,and 672; 7 Molniya comsats; 5 Meteor meteorological satellites; 2 co-
operative Intercosmos; 2 Luna lunar probes; and 71 spacecraft under the
Cosmos designation.

Space Science and Exploration
   Besides the new scientific satellites, NASA continued systematic exploration
of the solar system as Pioneer 11, launched in April 1973, sped to within
42 000 km of Jupiter 3 Dec. The spacecraft photographed the giant planet and
its moons, transmitting new information on the planetâ€™s weather patterns,
atmosphere, and radiation belts. Data from Pioneer 1 and its predecessor
                                                          1
Piorzeer 10, which had encountered Jupiter in December 1973 revealed that
Jupiter was hotter than previously estimated and composed largely of liquid
hydrogen. Cyclones and anticyclones stretched completely around the planet
with rising grey-white cloud ridges extending 20 km above Jupiterâ€™s distinctive
 orange-brownbelts. Jupiterâ€™s great red spot was probably the vortex of a great
storm that had-raged along a 400 000-km front for centuries. At yearâ€™s end
Pioneer 1 was speeding toward rendezvous with Saturn to give man his
           1
closest look at that planet while Pioneer 10 raced to CTOSS the orbits of Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and become the first spacecraft to leave the solar
system.
   Meanwhile Mariner 10-after passing within 5800 km of Venus and send-
ing back new information on particle environment, mass, and density of that
planet-made two successful flybys of Mercury in March and September.
The spacecraft transmitted data that gave scientists mass measurements 100
times better than previous ones, described a detached, well-defined bow
shock wave, and showed temperatures varying from 90 K on the night side
to 700 K on the day side (-300OF to 800OF). During the two encounters
the spacecraft photographed 4576 of the planetâ€™s surface. By the end of the
year Mariner 10 was headed for a third Mercury encounter in March 1975.
   Preparations for the two 1975 Viking missions to Mars continued with
the qualification-testing of Viking science instruments, engineering subsys-
                                       222
                                                                   During 1974

tems, and entire orbiter and lander spacecraft. During the last quarter of
the year the lander successfully completed critical surface simulation tests
 that included subjecting the spacecraft to temperatures approximatkg Mar-
 tian conditions and dropping it from 0.6 m to determine the effects of landing
shocks on the integrated Viking equipment.
   A detailed spacecraft design for the 1977 Mariner mission to Jupiter and
Saturn was completed while a major effort to find a satisfactory way to protect
the spacecraft from Jupiterâ€™s strong radiation continued.
                                                          FY
   A major new space science start, approved in NASAâ€™s 1975 budget, was
the 1978 dual Pioneer-Venusmission to obtain detailed measurements of the
Venus atmosphere with an orbiter and four atmospheric entry probes. Hughes
Aircraft Co. was chosen in February for spacecraft design, with an option
for spacecraft development, and experimenters and scientific instrumentation
were selected in June.
   NASA continued preparations to place the Large Space Telescope in earth
orbit to make detailed astronomical observations 10 times deeper into space
than possible before. During 1974, preliminary system definitions and
advanced technological development were carried out on selected elements
of the LST.
   Besides preparing for future missions, scientists continued analysis of
data accumulated from previous missions. A Lunar Data Analysis and Syn-
thesis program began to correlate existing data and data still being collected
by the five Apollo lunar surface-experiment packages (ALSEP) left on the
moon during the lunar landing program. With the conclusion of the Skylab
flight program, large volumes of new data on the sun and the earth and the
most comprehensive inflight data yet on manâ€™s adaptation to space flight be-
came available.
    During the year sounding rockets, balloons, telescopes, and instrumented
aircraft continued to increase knowledge of the universe. NASA launched
nearly 80 sounding rockets from sites around the world. A significant ac-
complishment was the launch of 54 sounding rockets within 24 hrs to support
the Joint NASA-& Force Atmospheric Layering and Density Distribution of
Ions and Neutrals (ALADDIN) program.
    During 1974 scientists in programs outside NASA as well as in, using data
from both orbital and suborbital programs, discovered a 13th moon of
 Jupiter, observed a pulsar that was a member of a double star system, obtained
 new data on the size and shape of the Crab Nebula, discovered a galaxy six
times larger than any previously known in the universe, and made the
greatest advance yet in cometary research with the study of the Comet
Kohoutek, including first-time identification of water molecules in a comet.
    The U.S.S.R. continued a program of space exploration with the launch
of lunar probes Luna 22 in May and Luna 23 in October. Luna 22 studied
 the lunar surface and atmosphere from lunar orbit. Luna 23 was damaged
while landing on the moonâ€™s surface and its work was discontinued after three
days of equipment testing.

Space Transportation and Technology
   The space shuttle program accelerated, with funding increasing from
$475 million in FY 1974 to $800 million in M 1975. But this total
reflected an $89-million cut by the Office of Management and Budget from
planned space shuttle funding, delaying the program four to six months.
The final major contract was awarded and design work neared completion;

by yearâ€™s end the program moved into hardware test and fabrication stages.
Construction of the shuttle runway at Kennedy Space Center began in April
and throughout the year contracts were awarded for additional space shuttle
facilities. The European Space Research Organization selected VFW-Fokker/
ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH as prime contractor to design and build
Spacelab for missions on the shuttle. Primary efforts were directed toward
planning early shuttle missions and making analyses for a NASA mission
model.
   In solid propulsion technology, the final motor-the first with a restart
capability-in a series of high-efficiencysolid-fueled motors was successfully
static-fired. The October firing marked the first time a spacecraft solid-
fueled motor had been fired, quenched, reignited, and requenched. Another
significant step was the static-firing of a thermally sterilized solid-fueled
motor. Electric propulsion-attractive as auxiliary propulsion for long-life
station-keeping and attitude control-took a stride forward with the tests of
a 4.5-millinewton (0.001-lb-thrust) ion engine aboard Ats 6. In spacecraft
energy system technology, solar cells were made from a silicon ribbon grown
directly from the liquid state, a critical first step in low-cost manufacture of
solar cells. Other advances were made in laser, nuclear, atmosphere-entry,
material-and-structures, guidance, and control-and-information technology.

Aeronautics
   The X-24B lifting body completed 15 flights in the NASA and Air Force
program to develop a safe piloted vehicle for reentry from space flight and to
develop hypersonic technology. Following the first supersonic flight in
March, the vehicleâ€™s performance and handling qualities were evaluated in
the speed range between mach 1.6 and landing.
           aeronautics research and development program to reduce fuel
   NASAâ€™s
consumption, reduce undesirable environmental effects, improve safety, and
advance technology continued during the year. Flight tests of an F-111
equipped with the NASA-developed supercritical wing demonstrated a 15%
reduction in fuel consumption. Other tests using flexible aircraft skin con-
cepts, composite materials, active-control technology, and alternative fuels
also demonstrated reduced drag and potential fuel savings.
              refan program-an effort to reduce noise of the JT8D engine
   In NASAâ€™s
that powered most of the Nationâ€™s narrow-body commercial fleet-three
refanned engines demonstrated in ground tests that the ground area affected
by objectionable noise from commercial aircraft could be reduced by 75%.
In another technique, a DC-8 using a NASA-developed two-segment landing
approach reduced the ground area affected by excessive noise 53%.
   Efforts to measure and reduce aircraft engine exhaust in the atmosphere
continued with the Global Air Sampling Program. A United Air Lines, Inc.,
Boeing 747 equipped with an atmospheric sampling instrument began measur-
ing aircraft pollution on commercial air routes, while the clean combuster
technology program was expanded to reduce engine emissions.
   Programs to improve aircraft safety continued to make progress. Tech-
niques to reduce hazardous trailing vortices were flight-tested. A NASA-
developed prototype system to track aircraft wakes near airports, allowing
traffic controllers to adjust aircraft spacing more closely, was being opera-
tionally evaluated at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City.
   The Dept. .of Defense A-10 close-air-support program moved into produc-

tion stage, with the first of six aircraft in final assembly and checkout. Pro-
duction of an initial increment of 22 aircraft was approved in December,
with a full production decision expected late in 1975.
   DODâ€™S B-1 advanced strategic bomber moved through engine preliminary
flight-readiness tests in April, rollout in October, and first flight in December.
Following flight testing, a production decision would be made in 1976. The
first operational F-15 advanced tactical fighter was delivered in November.
At yearâ€™s end 20 test aircraft had accumulated more than 300 flight hrs.

International Cooperation
   Aerospace activities continued to become more international. Of the 16
NASA-launched payloads, 10 were cooperative efforts with foreign organiza-
tions. In addition, the 2 Italian-launched payloads carried US. experiments.
During the year negotiations were completed on an agreement for NASA to
furnish reimbursable launches for three future synchronous-orbit Japanese
satellites. NASA-ESRO Spacelab working groups met throughout the year on
experimental objectives and user requirements. Investigators from 42 coun-
tries and 5 international organizations were selected for Earth Resources
Technology Satellite follow-on investigations, and Italy and Iran signed
agreements with NASA to build earth stations to receive ERTS data directly.
   The 1975 US-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project neared flight readiness.
Joint compatibility tests of communications and docking systems were car-
ried out and intensive joint flight-crew and flight-controller training was
begun. Apollo hardware was completed. The U S S R launched two unmanned
and one manned Soyuz spacecraft (Cosmos 638 and 672 and Soyuz 16) to
check out new systems and equipment for the joint mission. NASA and the
Soviet Academy of Sciences approved public information plans and plans
for prelaunch testing at the US. and U.S.S.R. launch sites.
   US. and Soviet specialists exchanged information about the moon, planets,
environmental problems, and biomedical results from US. and U.S.S.R.
space flights. US. and Soviet scientists preparing a joint experiment using
Ats 6 data met in the US.in October for technical coordination. And plans
were formulated in October for a US. life science experiment to fly on the
next available Soviet biological satellite.
   For 101 days, June-September, the US. and 69 other countries participat-
ing in the Global Atmospheric Research Programâ€™s Atlantic Tropical Experi-
ment monitored nearly every known meteorological factor along a 52-million-
sq-km tropical area of land and sea from the eastern Pacific Ocean across
Latin America, the Atlantic Ocean, and Africa to the western Indian Ocean.
More than 4000 persons using 41 ships, 40 instrumented buoys, 12 aircraft,
and 6 satellites probed from 1.6 km below the sea surface to the top of the
atmosphere to improve weather predictions, assess pollution, determine the
feasibility of large-scale weather modification, and establish new bonds of
international cooperation.

Applications and Energy
  During 1974 space technology continued to make significant contributions
to the quality of life. In addition to 1974-launched Ats 6, Sms 1 , Westar 1
and 2, Intelstat-IV F-8, and Noaa 4 to improve weather predictions and com-
munications on the earth-Erts 1, launched in July 1972, completed 29 mos
in operation. Erts 1 had transmitted more than 100000 photos covering
                                       225

three fourths of the worldâ€™s land masses and coastal areas. ERTS data-used
to monitor urban and agricultural development, locate air and water pollu-
tion, update maps, and find new water and mineral resources-had been pro-
vided to more than 300 U.S. and foreign investigators in government,
universities, and industry. ERTS-E development continued on schedule.
           pollution monitoring program-to develop and demonstrate tech-
    NASAâ€™s
nology to monitor atmospheric and water pollution-completed its second
year. Procurement for design and construction of the Nimbus-G Oceano-
graphic and Air Pollution Observing Satellite, planned for 1978 launch,
was under way. The Lower Atmospheric Composition and Temperature Ex-
periment (LACATE) was demonstrated in May and a test in the advanced appli-
cations flight experiment program-using balloons, sounding rockets, and
aircraft as well as ground-based experiments-successfully gathered atmos-
pheric data over a five-hourperiod.
    DOD expanded and improved its Defense Satellite Communications System
 and let contracts for Phase 1 NAVSTAR global positioning satellites. The
 Defense Meteorological Satellite program continued to furnish weather
 data for military and civilian use.
    Space technology continued to be applied to medicine. A digital computing
 cardiotachometer to monitor heart rates, an automated blood pressure moni-
 toring system, and a new method of attaching artificial limbs were among the
 NASA-developed contributions demonstrated in 1974.
    An Office of Energy Programs was established in NASA to focus the appli-
 cation of its aerospace technology to energy needs. In addition to programs to
 reduce aircraft air pollution and energy consumption and develop new fuels,
 NASA, under the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974
 and in cooperation with the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development and
 other Federal agencies, was investigating the use of solar energy for heating
 and cooling buildings. An experimental solar house at Marshall Space Flight
 Center would ultimately derive up to 85% of its heating and cooling energy
 from the sun. Solar heating and cooling were being demonstrated in school.
     NASA continued research on wind energy systems, with the construction
  of a 100-kw  wind-powered generator at Lewis Research Center ;low-pollution,
  low-fuel-consumption automotive engines; aerodynamically designed vehicles
  to increase fuel economy ; energy conversion systems.
     NASA distributed some 300 new Tech Briefs and 30 special compilations
  oi new technology items to 15 000 subscribers in business and industry. Use of
  Regional Dissemination Centers for space technology applicable to other uses
  increased 3476, to 4000 clients.

 Tracking and Data Acquisition
    The Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) supported some 40
 flight projects during 1974, including all NASAâ€™s earth-orbital missions as
 well as space projects of foreign governments and private industry. Congress
 authorized funds for procurement activities for a Tracking and Data Relay
 satellite System (TDRSS)-two earth-orbiting satellites leased by NASA to
 relay data between low-altitude spacecraft and a single ground station. The
 authority to proceed further was subject to additional congressional review
 of a NASA-owned versus a leased.system. (Pres Rpt 74; NASA Release 74-330:

releases of NASA,  Department of Defense, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and other agencies, as well as Communications Satellite
Corporation. Soviet data are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite
Situation Rqort, translations from the Tass News Agency, statements in the
 Soviet press, and international news service reports. New sources of informa-
tion for 1974 were speeches and press briefings given by Soviet officials in
the United States to prepare for the US.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Projectâ€™s
1975 mission. Data on satellites of other foreign nations are from the U.N.
Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, governmental announcements,
and international news service reports.
   World space activity in 1974 decreased slightly. Total launches, 106, were
down from the 109 launches in 1973, as were total payloads orbited-126 in
 1974, down from 133 in 1973. The 5 multiple-payload launches-2, 8-satel-
lite launches for the U.S.S.R.; 2, 3-satellite launches for DOD, and a 3-satel-
lite launch for NASA-account for the difference between launches and pay-
loads.
   Of the 1974 world total, the United States launched 22 boosters carrying
28 payloads, a slight decline from 1973, when 23 US. boosters carried 26
payloads into space. Of these 1974 totals, DOD was responsible for 8 launches
and 12 payloads. Of the 16 NASA-launched payloads, 1 were launched for
                                                          1
domestic and foreign corporations or foreign governments: Skynet ZZA and
ZZI? and M i r a d u (UK-X4) for the United Kingdom, Zntasat for Spain,
Symphonie 1 for France and West Germany, Aeros 2 for West Germany,
Zntelsat-ZV F-8 for ComSatCorp on behalf of the Tnternational Telecom-
munications Satellite Organization, Westar 1 and 2 for Western Union Tele-
graph Company, Noaa 4 for NOAA, and Amsut Oscar 7 for the Radio Amateur
Satellite Corporation. Two satellites were cooperative programs with foreign
governments: Ans 1 with The Netherlands and Helios I with West Germany.
Three IvA.S-4-sponsored payloads-Ats 6, Sms 1, and Hawkeye 1 (Explorer
52)-were launched for applications and scientific missions.

   The Soviet Union once again far exceeded U.S. space totals, launching 95
payloads in 81 launches, with activity decreasing slightly from 1973â€™s 107
payloads in 86 launches.
   For the United States the year was the first since 1967 marked by an
absence of manned launches. The last of three Skylab crews, already orbiting
as the year began, reentered 8 Feb. on Skylab 4 after 84 days in space. NASA
launches included 8 communications, 2 meteorological, and 6 scientific satel-
lites. Highlights of the year came with the launches of Ats 6, the most complex
and powerful of the Applications Technology Satellites, to transmit medical
and educational telecommunications to small inexpensive ground stations
in remote areas of the United States and of Helios 1 to investigate interstellar
space closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft. The 12 DOD payloads
included Nts 1 Navigation Technology Satellite to perfect technology for use
 in the NAVSTAR program and S3-1 to measure air density and upper atmos-
pheric composition and to provide data on atmospheric efforts on spacecraft
orbits.
   The Soviet Union launched 2 space stations and 3 two-man crews during
1974, besides unmanned scientific, lunar, and applications spacecraft. Fol-
lowing the launch of the Salyut 3 space station, a crew in Soyuz 14 docked
with the station and worked on board for 16 days before returning to the
earth. A second crew, in Soyuz 15, failed to dock after several attempts and
returned to earth after two days in space. A second station, Salyut 4, was
launched in December to be joined in January 1975 by a crew aboard
Soyuz 17. Soyuz 16, carrying two cosmonauts, was launched to check out
docking and life support systems in preparation for the 1975 ASTP mission.
In addition, the U.S.S.R. launched 3 unmanned Soyuz spacecraft, 7 Molniya
comsats, 5 Meteor meteorological satellites, 2 cooperative Intercosmos, 2
Luna lunar probes, and 71 Cosmos spacecraft.
   Italian crews launched 2 satellites on NASA launch vehicles: Sun Marco 4
carried one Italian and two US. experiments into orbit to collect atmospheric
data. The U.K.-built Ariel 5 carried one NASA and five U.K experiments to
study x-ray sources.
   Japan launched its fifth satellite, Tansei 2, to test spacecraft control devices.
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
appendixes is never complete, because of printing time and the inescapable
lag between each flight and the analysis and interpretation of results. Also,
some missions are still continuing. The information in this table was compiled
in February 1976.

                MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1974

   The chronological table of major NASA launches in 1974 is intended to
provide an accurate historical record, compiling information gathered from
open sources and scattered elsewhere in t i volume. Itincludes payloads car-
                                           h  s
ried by all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched by NASA
or under NASA direction.
   In 1974 NASA successfully launched 3 payloads for NASA programs out
of a total of 16 payloads launched: Sms 1 operational prototype meteorologi-
cal satellite, Ats 6 experimental communications satellite, and Hawkeye 1
 (Explorer 52) scientific sateIIite. Of the rest, 11-Shynet ZZA and IIB, Mi-
randa (UK-X4), Intasat, Symphonie l, Aeros 2, Intelsat-IV F-8, Westar l
and 2, Noaa 4, and Amsat Oscar 7-were launched for other organizations or
governments. Ans 1 and Helios 1 were launched as cooperative scientific pro-
grams with foreign governments. A Titan IIIE-Centaur proof flight was
aborted by NASA range safety officers when the second-stage engine failed
to ignite.
   In addition to the 16 NASA-launched payloads, Italian crews launched
two payloads on NASA launch vehicles: San Marco 4, carrying US. and
Italian experiments, and Ariel 5, a cooperative United States-United King-
dom scientific satellite.
   An attempt has been made to classify vehicle and payload performance,
using three categories for evaluation: successful (S), partially successful
                             .
(P) and unsuccessful (U) A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been
     ,
added for payloads when vehicle failures did not give the payload a chance
to operate. These classifications are unofficial and necessarily arbitrary; many
of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Some ignore the fact that much
may be learned from missions that have been classified as unsuccessful.
Others do not account for payloads with a design lifetime of long duration
which might later fail to meet that design requirement end be officially ad-
judged unsuccessful after this publication goes to press.
   Launch dates are referenced to local time at the launch site. Open sources
were used, verified when in doubt with program offices in NASA Headquar-
ters and with NASA Centers. For further information on each item, see Ap-
pendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as referenced
in the index. Information in the table is as of February 1976.

               MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS, 1974

   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
begun during 1974 and-taken with Appendix C to the 1965-1973 volumes
of this publication-provides a summary record of manned exploration of
                                                        -s
the space environment through 1974.
    For the first year since 1967 the United States launched no men into space,
although the three-man Skylab 4 crew ended its 84-day mission during the
year, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean 8 Feb. The United States has no
manned flights scheduled until the July 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project with
the U S S R :
            ~.

    The Soviet Union launched three two-man missions into space in 1974.
Soyuz 14 was launched in July to rendezvous with the Salyut 3 space station,
orbiting since 25 June. The crew rendezvoused and docked and then per-
formed scientific experiments aboard the station for nearly 16 days before
 softlanding in the U.S.S.R. 19 July. The August Soyuz 15 mission failed to
 dock with Salyut 3 after several attempts. It landed at night after 48 hours
 in space. The S o p z 16 mission, in December, orbited for five days, success-
 fully testing spacecraft and life support systems redesigned for ASTP.
    By the end of 1974 the United States had conducted a total of 30 manned
 space flights-2 suborbital, 19 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and 6 lunai
 landing-with a total of 41 different crewmen. Of the 41 American astronauts,
 10 had participated in two flights each, 4 had flown three times, and 3 had
 flown four times. The Soviet Union had made 23 manned flights, all in earth
 orbit, with 32 cosmonauts. Six had participated in two flights each and two
 had flown three times. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft hours in flight
 were 7643 hours 42 minutes for the United States and 2901 hours 33 minutes
 for the Soviet Union. Cumulative total man-hours in space were 21 851 hours
 15 minutes for the United States and 6011 hours 4 minutes for the U.S.S.R.
                                                      6
    This chronology was compiled in February 1976 using the latest data
 available within NASA at that date. The information may be subject to modi-
 fication as data are refined.

      NASA SOUNDING ROCKET LAUNCHES, 1974

   Following is a chronological table of the 77 sounding rockets of the Arcas
class and above launched by NASA in 1974. Rockets were launched from
sites in six foreign countries as well as the United States and carried payloads
for 3 government agencies including NASA, 18 U S . universities, 3 U S . com-
panies, and 4 European organizations. Onboard experiments probed near
space, providing scientists with new data in aeronomy; galactic, radio, and
x-ray astronomy ; and solar, magnetospheric, and ionospheric physics. Five
flight tests continued development of new sounding rocket capability.
   Principal sources of information for the table were the â€œQuick Look Sound-
ing Rocket Dataâ€ reports issued after launches and the twice yearly â€œNASA .
Sounding Rocket Compendium,â€ both compiled by the Sounding Rocket Divi-
sionâ€™s Office of Operations at Goddard Space Flight Center, and the NASA
â€œReport of Sounding Rocket Launchingâ€ series.
   Missions listed were successful unless otherwise noted in the Remarks.
 The date of the launch is referenced to local time at the launch site, with an
asterisk following dates that are one day later by Greenwich Mean Time.

           X-24B LIFTINGBODY FLIGHTS, 1974

    Lifting bodies--wingless vehicles that receive aerodynamic lift from their
body shape alone-were being flown to develop concepts for a maneuverable
manned vehicle that could reenter the atmosphere from space, as well as to
provide technology for possible future hypersonic cmise aircraft. The pro-
gram began in the early 1950s when NASA scientists and engineers at the
Ames and Langley Research Centers studied the concept of the lifting body.
Since 1963, Flight Research Center has flight-tested three versions of the
ARC-designed M2 configuration, LaRCâ€™s HL-10, and, in joint programs with
the Air Force, the X-24A and X-24B lifting bodies.
    Following a joint program flight-testing the Air Force X-24A, NASA and
the Air Force in 1971 signed a memorandum of understanding to incorporate
test programs of the new double-delta-shaped X-24B, with its improved lift-
to-drag ratio, and NASAâ€™s H G l O and M2-F3. The HL-10, which had com-
 pleted its first flight series in 1970, was held in storage. The M2-F3 made
 its final flight in December 1972. Beginning with a captive flight 19 July 1973,
NASA and Air Force pilots tested X-24B performance at low supersonic,
transonic, and subsonic speeds, with emphasis on landing. NASA was re-
 sponsible for vehicle maintemnce, instrumentation, and ground support. The
Air Force supplied the X-24B vehicle, base services, fuel, B-52 operations,
and XLR-11 engine and maintenance. NASA and the Air Force shared pilot,
mission planning, and data analysis responsibilities.
    The X-24B was launched from a B-52 aircraft, usually at 13 700-m alti-
tude. In captive flights, the vehicle remained attached to the B-52. Unpowered
 free flights glided through maneuvers to landings on a dry lake bed. Powered
 flights ignited the rocket engine, to reach higher altitudes and speeds before
landing.
    The following table includes all X-24B missions leaving the ground in
 1974, even those eventually aborted because of weather or mechanical prob-
lems. The flight numbering system included vehicle designation (â€œBâ€ for
X-24B vehicles)-free-flight number-B-52           carry number. For example,
 â€œB-9-16â€ was the 9th free flight of the X-24B and the 16th time the vehicle
 was carried by the B-52. A â€œCâ€ or an â€œAâ€ replacing the free-flight number
indicated a captive or an aborted flight.
     Information for the tables was compiled from â€œPost Launch Flight Re-
portsâ€ issued at FRC, â€œFlash Reportsâ€ issued by the NASA Headquarters
 Office.Of Aeronautics and Spacr: Technology, and the â€œManned Lifting Body
 Flight Log,â€ a NASA Facts issuance released in March 1976 by Dryden Flight
 Research Center (named Flight Research Center until January 1976).
