   Users of this series will notice that the current volume, the 15th, is more
condensed than earlier volumes in the series, a trend started with the 1974
volume. This is attributable more to staff limitations than to any reduction
in the historical significance of the subject matter. Fewer non-NASA activ-
ities have been included this year. The annual summary has been elimi-
nated, riot without regret. More material has been presefited in tabular
form for economy in both preparation and use. The staff of the History
Office expects to produce one volume per year of Astronautics and Aero-
nautics with approximately the coverage and detail of the present volume-
and with greater regularity than in the past few years.
   Note that the errata section, introduced in the 1974 volume, has been
continued. We want this series to be a reliable reference work, and the
reader can help us in this. Let the History Office staff know of any errors
that you detect in this or previous volumes, so that corrections can be
published.
   Text for the first ten months of the presbht volumeâ€™s coverage was
written by Nancy L. Brun, who has since transferred to the NatioQal
Institutes of Health. The volume was completed by her successor, Eleanor
H. Ritchie, formerly of the Goddard Space Flight Center.

4 January: Funding in the FY 1976 budget for a third Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite (ERTS) was in doubt, Walter Sullivan said in a
    New York Times article. Despite worldwide enthusiasm for continuing
    the program, which was developing remote-sensing techniques for
    monitoring and managing earthâ€˜s resources, doubts about funding
    approval were appearing within the Office of Management and
    Budget. Factors that would influence OMBâ€™S decision included the
    reported existence of far more detailed information from secretly
    launched intelligence satellites. Although scientists would probably
    prefer a system free from intelligence links, some argued that the
    information needed by agencies such as the Bureau of Census and
    Dept. of Agriculture could be extracted from imagery from these
    satellites. Another reason to delay immediate funding was that a more
    effective system would eventually become feasible. Scientists argued
    against this reasoning, saying that the lack of fine detail in ERTS
    images was not a serious impediment but that lack of continuity would
    be. (Sullivan, NYT, 4 Jan 75, 17)
8 January: Twenty-five spacecraft on twenty-four vehicles were sched-
    uled for launch by NASA during 1975, NASA announced. The 25 space-
    craft included 14 for NASA programs, 10 for other organizations, and 1
    as a cooperative program with a foreign government. Highlighting the
    year would be the 15 July launch of an Apollo spacecraft carrying
    Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton as the
    U.S. contribution to the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.
    Apollo would rendezvous and dock with Soyuz 19-launched 7 hr
    earlier than Apollo and carrying Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N.
    Kubasov-allowing both crews to exchange visits and perform joint
    scientific experiments.
      The two sets of Viking spacecraft, scheduled for 11 and 21
    August launches, would journey through space for a year before
    arriving in the vicinity of Mars. There each set of spacecraft would
    separate into an orbiter and a lander to make orbital and surface
    investigations of the Martian environment.
       Other â€˜NASA spacecraft would include ERTS-B Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite and SMS-B Synchronous Meteorological
     Satellite, in January; GOES-C Geodynamic Experimental Ocean
    Satellite, in March; OSO-1 Orbiting Solar Observatory, Nimbus-F
    experimental meteorological satellite, and Explorer 53 (SAS-C Small
    Astronomy Satellite), in May; GOES-A Geostationary Operational
    Environmental Satellite, in June; Explorers 56 and 57 Dual Air
    Density Explorers, on a single booster in July or August; Explorer 54
    (m-D Atmospheric Explorer), in September; and Explorer 55 (A&-E),
    in December.
       The 10 spacecraft to be launched by NASA for other organizations
    included 5 comsats for Communications Satellite Gorp. : Intelsat-

January                        ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1975
    IV F-1 in February, Intelsat-IVA F-1 and F-2 in July and October,
    and Marisat A and B in April and July. Other reimbursable launches
    would include Telesat-C (An& 3) for Canada in March, COS-B
    Celestial Observation Satellite in July for the European Space
    Agency, Symphonie-B experimental comsat in September for France
    and West Germany, RCA-A (RCA-satcom 1, in orbit) comsat in
    December for RCA Corp., and ITOS E-2 Improved TIROS Operational
    Satellite in late 1975 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration.
       Helios-B would be launched late in 1975 as a cooperative effort
    with West Germany. The schedule called for 18 of the 24 launches to
    be made from Kennedy Space Center, 5 from Western Test Range,
    and 1from San Marco. For the launches NASA would use a Saturn IB, 3
    Titan-Centaurs, 5 Atlas-Centaurs, and 15 Thor-Delta launch vehi-
    cles. (NASA Release 75-5; KSC Release 180-74)
∞The Department of Defense announced the award of a $1 500 000 cost-
    plus-incentive-fee contract to General Dynamics Corp. for launch
    services for the Atlas E and F vehicles at Vandenberg Air Force Base.
    (DOD Release 8- 75)
9 January: Sea Satellite (S AS T-a
                              E A)        new program, approved in the
    FY 1975 NASA authorization, to monitor the oceans and provide
    continuous weather and sea condition reports-was announced by
    NASA. SEASAT-A, a proof-of-concept mission scheduled for 1978
    launch, would carry sensors to measure wave heights, current
    directions, surface wind directions, and surface temperatures.
    Objectives of the initial mission were to disseminate these data to
    users concerned about weather predictions; to route shipping to avoid
    storms, adverse currents, and ice fields; and to provide coastal
    disaster warnings.
       SEASAT-A would also accumulate scientific data on the curvature
    of the oceans; ocean circulation; transport of mass, heat, and
    nutrients by surface currents; and the interaction between air and
    sea.
       SEASAT would be managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory with
    Langley Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Wallops
    Flight Center, and JPLeach having responsibility for one of the four
    sensors-off-the-shelf NASA or Air Force spacecraft to which a sensor
    module would be attached. Existing tracking facilities and support
    hardware would also be used. Cost of the SEASAT-A mission, as cur-
    rently planned, was $58.2 million. (NASA    Release 75-1)
∞McDonnell Douglas Corp., working under contract to NASA, began
    flight and static tests of the refanned engine to demonstrate NASA-
    developed noise-reduction techniques. More than 2 yr of work at
    Lewis Research Center; Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Div. of United
    Aircraft Corp.; Boeing Co.; United Air Lines, Inc.; and American
    Airlines, Inc., had been spent in modifying a JT8D engine to reduce
    irritating high-frequency noise. When installed on the McDonnell
     DC -9, the new engine was expected to reduce by 60% the ground area
     exposed to excessive noise levels. Similar results were expected with
     the engine installed on Boeingâ€™s 727 and 737 aircraft. During the initial
     test phase, McDonnell Douglas would fly fm 90 hr a DC -9 outfitted
    with the modified engine, to evaluate noise characteristics and flight
    performance. The second phase of testing would begin in mid-January
    when Boeing would flight-test it in a 727. (NASA Release 75-4; LeRC
    Release 75-2)

11 January: The 38 000-kg second stage from the Saturn V booster that
    placed the Skylab 1 orbital workshop in orbit 14 May 1973 reentered
    the atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean just before 3 am EST. NASA re-
      ported that radar tracked one large chunk that survived the fiery
      plunge through the atmosphere and fell into the ocean at 34â€™ north
      latitude, 19â€west longitude, about 1600 km west of Gibraltar. Smaller
      pieces might have scattered over an area several kilometers to the
    . northwest and southeast of that point and some charred debris might
      have fallen on the Sahara Desert, but NASA received no report that any
      fragments had caused damage or injury. (NASA PAO, interview, 30
      June 1976; Reuter, W Post, 12 Jan 75, A14; AP, W Star-News, 12 Jan
      75, Al; UPI, NYT, 12 Jan 75, 55)
11 January-9 February: The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 17, carrying cos-
      monauts Lt. Col. Aleksey A. Gubarev and Georgy M. Grechko,
      from Baykonur cosmodrome at 2:43 am local time (4:43 pm EST 10
      Jan.) to rendezvous and dock with the Salyut 4 space station launched
      26 Dec. 1974. Soyuz 17 entered orbit with a 249-km apogee, 186-km
      perigee, 88.9-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination. Tass announced that
      the mission would carry joint experiments with Salyut 4, including a
      comprehensive checkout of the spacecraftâ€™s onboard systems in
      various flight conditions.
         After an orbital correction that raised the spacecraftâ€™s orbit to 354-
      km apogee, 90.7-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination, Soyuz 17 docked
      with Salyut 4 on 12 Jan. Gubarev and Grechko entered the station,
      switched on the power and radio transmitters, and inspected the
      scientific equipment.
         During their nearly 30 days aboard Salyut 4, the cosmonauts
      studied solar phenomena, x-radiation from celestial bodies, and
      earthâ€˜s radiation. They also studied the effects of weightlessness on
      the human body, made earth-resources observations, and studied the
      earthâ€˜s upper atmosphere. They resprayed two telescope mirrors
      dulled by exposure to space; carried out biological â€œOasisâ€ experi-
      ments using insects, microorganisms, tissue cultures, and plants; and
      recycled water, condensed from the cabinâ€™s atmosphere, for drinking
      and food preparation.
         The crew began preparations to return to earth on 9 Feb., re-
      boardingsoyuz 17 and undocking from the space station at 11:08 am
      Baykonur time (1:08 am EST). Soyuz 17 softlanded in-the U.S.S.R. 110
      km northeast of Tselinograd, Kazakhstan, â€œin complex meteorologi-
      cal conditionsâ€ after 29 da 13 hr 20 min in space.
         On-the-spot and subsequent medical checks showed the cosmo-
      nauts to be in good health. The Soyuz 17 cosmonauts broke the
      previous 23-day 18-hr 22-min Soviet record for time in space, set by
      the Soyuz 11 crew (6-30 June 1971) before they were killed during
      reentry. (GSFC SSR, 28 Feb 75; Tass, FBIS- SOV, Jan- 13Feb 75;SF,

12 January: The communications satellite business was becoming one of
      the fastest growing businesses on earth, Thomas Oâ€™Toole said in a
      Washington Post article. The huge dish-shaped antennas used as
      telephone and television links between earth and the dozen or so
      orbiting comsats had sprouted up in the suburbs of Moscow and
      Peking, in Brazilian jungles, in the mountains of Iran, and in the
      deserts of Algeria. In addition, Algeria was building 14 antennas;

    Indonesia, 60; and Brazil, 2000. More than 90 countries were cur-
    rently communicating by satellite, most using the seven Intelsat satel-
    lites orbited by the 89-country consortium, the International Tele-
    communications Satellite Organization. Worldwide Intelsat traffic
    was growing by 20% a year. In addition to the Intelsat comsats, the
    Soviet Union, Canada, France, and West Germany, and Western
    Union already owned their own comsats. Japan would have one by
    1977, and Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia were each planning to
    orbit their own.
       Besides making it easier to communicate around the world,
    satellites were responsible for cutting the cost of overseas conversa-
    tions. In 1947, a 3-min phone call from New York to London cost $12.
    The same call in 1975 cost $5.40. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 12 Jan 75, 1)
13 January: Dr. John L. McLucas, Secretary of the Air Force, announced
    the selection of the General Dynamics Corp. YF-16 prototype for full-
    scale engineering development as the Air Forceâ€™s F- 16 air combat
    fighter. Aâ€˜ $417 904 758 fixed-price-incentive contract to fabricate 15
    engineering development F- 16 aircraft was awarded to General
    Dynamics, which had been in competition with Northrop Corp. and its
    YF-17 lightweight fighter prototype during flight-test evaluations at
    the Air Force Flight Test Center. Dr. McLucas said the decision in
    favor of General Dynamics had been based on cost and technical
    engineering proposals submitted by the companies. The Air Force
    planned to introduce a minimum of 650 F- 16 aircraft into the active
    inventory by the early 1980s.
       The Air Force also awarded a $55 500 000 fixed-price-incentive
    contract to United Aircraft Corpâ€™s Pratt 8.1 Whitney Div. to produce
    the FlOO engine used in the F- 16. (DOD Release 16-75)
∞Marshall Space Flight Center plans for the FY 1975 reduction-in-
    force had been revised, MSFC announced. The target date for issuance
    of RIF notices to MSFC employees had been delayed from mid-January
    to 29 Jan. with an effective date of 14 Mar. The 2-wk delay resulted
    from the need for an additional decrease in the end-of-FY 1975
    personnel ceiling, from 4145 to 4113. This further reduction was
    MSFCâ€™S share of the government-wide reduction of 40 000 employees
    called for by President Ford in 1974. (MSFC Release 75-6)
∞Marshall Space Flight Center announced the award of a $59950
    contract to Abbott Laboratories for living human kidney cells to be
    used by u.S. astronauts in the German electrophoresis experiment
    during the July U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Abbott
    Laboratories would provide the cells as part of an experiment to find a
    way to isolate effectively the one kidney cell in 20 that produced the
    enzyme urokinase, an enzyme capable of dissolving blood clots.
    Because gravity made such separations difficult on earth, scientists
    hoped to develop new technology in the zero-g environment of space.
    The experiment was being developed, built, and tested by West
    Germanyâ€™s Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbtt. (MSFC Releases

13-21 January: Preparations for U.S. participation in the joint u.s.-
    U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission in July continued at
    Kennedy Space Center. After removal from environmentally pro-
    tected shrouds, poststorage inspection, and installation of eight
    stabilizing fins, the Saturn IB booster, SA-210, was stacked on the

     mobile launcher inside the Vehicle Assembly Building on 13 Jan.
     Engineers began electrical and mechanical systems tests on the first
     stage and installed flame curtains and panels to shroud the outboard
     engines. The Saturn IVB second stage was mated to the booster 14
     Jan. and the instrument unit added to the stack 16 Jan. A boilerplate
     unit simulating the Apollo command module was added 17 Jan. The
     boilerplate would be removed and replaced with the actual space-
     craft, and the rollout of the entire vehicle to the launch pad was
      scheduled for March.
        The docking system and docking module were mated 17 Jan. after
     combined systems tests. The complete unit would be placed into the
     spacecraft adapter in February. Swing-arm launch-control center
     integration was completed 21 Jan. (KSC Release 165-74; MSFC
     Release 75- 19; Spaceport News, 23 Jan 75, 3; 6 Feb 75, 3; Marshall
     Star, 2 Jan 75, 2)
14 January: NASA's   Earth Resources Technology Satellite, ERTS, had been
     renamed Landsat, NASA Associate Administrator for Applications
     Charles W. Mathews announced at a Landsat-B prelaunch press
     briefing in Washington, D.C. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, would be
     called Landsat 1; ERTS-B, scheduled for launch 19 Jan., would be
     designated Landsat 2 once in orbit. Mathews said that, since NASA
     planned a SEASAT to study the oceans (see 9 Jan.), Landsat seemed a
     more appropriate name for a satellite that studied the land.
        Landsat Program Manager Harry Mannheimer said that Land-
     sat- B would be launched into the same orbital plane as Landsat 1 but
     180" out of phase. Between them the two satellites would retrace the
     identical ground track every 9 days rather than the 18-day interval of
     one satellite. The additional coverage would enable scientists to study
     dynamic phenomena more effectively. Mannheimer said that a
     significant improvement over Landsat 1 was Landsat- B's increase in
     command storage, adding flexibility in commanding the various
     instruments while the spacecraft was out of view of a ground station.
        James R. Morrison, Landsat Resources Survey Program Manager,
     said that, whereas the emphasis of the Landsat 1 mission was on
     experimentation, the emphasis for Landsat-B would be on fewer but
     larger scale applications of remote-sensing information to real
     resource problems. Of the 120 investigators-compared with 320
     investigators during the Landsat 1 mission-57 were US.-sponsored
     and 52 were from foreign countries. During the rigorous selection,
     preference had been given to investigations that included direct
     participation and cost-sharing by bona fide users in both the public
     and private sectors.
        New with Landsat- B were the Applications Systems Verification
     Tests (ASVT), based on results of Landsat 1 , to further develop,
     demonstrate, and document Landsat results. The ASVTs were larger
     in design and scope than earlier investigations, essentially beyond the
     capability of any one investigator to manage. ASVTs for Landsat-B
     included a large-area crop inventory experiment (LACE), ice-warn
     program, snow-cover and snow-melt prediction program, natural
     resources information system, and environmental information sys-
     tem. (Text)

    Kennedy Space Center to test the Apollo spacecraft's internal sys-
    tems, earth-landing systems, and instrument packages. The astro-
    nauts climbed into the Apollo, which was inside a huge altitude
    chamber, to test the systems at simulated altitudes of up to 61 000 m
    while cabin pressure was maintained at 34 474 newtons per sq m.
    Pressure inside the cabin was also lowered to zero to test the integrity

∞Flight Research Center was investigating the use of TV to provide visual
    information to pilots of future aircraft and spacecraft, NASA an-
    nounced. TV might enhance target visibility for pilots of high-per-
    formance aircraft that might have to approach and land at high angles
    of attack with reduced window area, and for unmanned remotely
    piloted research vehicles that would augment flight instrumentation
    with visual. For testing, FRC had installed a TV camera on top of a
    Piper PA-30 aircraft with a 12.5- by 17.5-mTV screen installed on the
    instrument panel. A curtain would restrict the test pilot's view
    through cockpit windows with a safety pilot riding in the right seat of
    the aircraft. Besides demonstrating use of TV for approach and
    landings, the first phase of the program would evaluate the pilot's
    ability to judge altitude using TV. The second phase would aim at
    optimizing the TV system for landing maneuvers. (NASA Release

14-17 January: NASA and Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory
    launched 10 rocket-borne experiments to study the upper atmosphere
    as a follow-on to the June 1974 Atmospheric Layering and Density
    Distribution of Ions and Neutrals program (Project ALADDIN "74).Two
    experiments on the Ute-Tomahawk rockets released chemical clouds
    into the atmosphere to measure winds and temperature and diffusion
    coefficients. The first, launched 15 Jan., released aluminum vapor at
    160-km altitude, creating a blue-green glowing cloud visible along
    much of the eastern seaboard. A second, launched 17 Jan. after a 1-day
    postponement, released trimethylaluminum in puffs 10 sec apart from
    180 km down to 90 km. Five single-stage Super-Lokis carried
    instruments to measure density, temperature, and wind, and instru-
    mentation aboard two Paiute-Tomahawks measured the atomic
    oxygen density profile. A prelaunch performance test of a Ute-
    Tomahawk was made 14 Ja'n. (WFC Releases 75-1, 75-2; NYT, 16

22-25 January: NASA launched Landsat 2 (Landsat- B), formerly called
     Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-B), from Western Test
     Range ,at 9:56 am PST on a two-stage Thor-Delta booster supple-
     mented by nine strap-on rockets. The satellite entered a near-polar
     orbit with a 918.23-km apogee, 912.89-km perigee, 103.32-min
     period, and 99.09â€œ inclination. Primary objective of the mission was to
     acquire multispectral imagery over the U.S. and foreign countries in
    quantity sufficient to improve remote-sensing interpretative tech-
    niques and to further demonstrate the practical application of Landsat


                                     a

   data. Secondary objectives were to acquire sufficient multispectral
   coverage over the U.S. to supply data requirements for the
   Applications System Verification Tests for at least 1 yr, to acquire
   multispectral coverage for at least 2 yr over the major agricultural
   areas of the world to illustrate further applications of Landsat imagery
   for crop inventory, and to demonstrate successful operation of the
   Data Collection System.
      A 3-day delay in the launch changed the initial orbital phasing of
   Landsat 2 relative to Landsat 1 (launched as Erts 1 on 23 July 1972)
   into a 12- to 6-day repeat cycle instead of the planned 9-day cycle.
   However, an orbital correction maneuver beginning 27 Jan. and end-
   ing 6 Feb. altered phasing to a 9-day repeat cycle. The payload
   separated from the launch vehicle 50 min 3 sec after launch, followed
   by solar-panel deployment and earth acquisition using the attitude-
   control system. The command system was turned on automatically,
   permitting activation of the payload by ground stations. During the
   night of 22-23 Jan. the mechanical integrity of the wideband video
   tape recorder was verified, Data-Collection System (DCS) activated,
   and data-collection platform experiment data transmitted. By 12:OO
   pm EST 23 Jan. all spacecraft systems were operating and by 25 Jan.
   the wideband transmitter, wideband video tape recorder, multi-
   spectral scanner (MSS), and return-beam vidicon ( B V ) were turned
   on, and operating normally.
      Teaming up with Landsat 1 , the 953-kg Landsat 2 would provide
   repetitive coverage of almost the entire earth to demonstrate the
   practical benefits of resources management from space for NASA in
   cooperation with the Dept. of Agriculture, National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, Dept. of the Interior, Environmental
   Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various state,
   local, and foreign organizations. Experiments included the coopera-
   tive NASA-DOA-NOAA Large Area crop Inventory (LACIE), which
   combined crop-acreage measurements derived from Landsat data
   with meteorological information from ground stations and NOAA
   satellites to assess crop yields and make production forecasts. During
   the first yr of operation, LACE would concentrate on US.-grown
   wheat, but the experiment would later be expanded to other crops and
   other regions.
      Other experiments included land-use survey and mapping; mineral
   resources, geological, structural, and land-form surveys; water
   resources studies; marine and ocean surveys; meteorological and
   environmental studies; and interpretative techniques development.
      Data were being transmitted to three NASA tracking and data-
   acquisition facilities at Fairbanks, Al.; Goldstone, Calif.; and
   Greenbelt, Md. In addition, Canada and Brazil operated Landsat
   ground data-acquisition stations and Italy and Iran were constructing
   similar facilities. Data received from the satellite were sent to the
   NASA Data Processing Facility at Goddard Space Flight Center where
   1300 images, covering 45 million sq km, could be processed each
   week. The data would then be forwarded to the Federal Data Center
   and made available to the public.
      The Landsat mission was part of a U.S. program to develop remote-
   sensing methods for improved management of earth's resources. In
   addition to Landsat 1 and 2, the program included remote-sensor

     earth orbit. Launched 22 Jan. 1969 to study the sun and its influence
     on earth's atmosphere, Os0 5 had completed more than 34 000 orbits.
     It was the fifth of eight spacecraft launched in the OS0 program to
     observe the sun during most of its 11-yr solar cycle. Os0 5 had been
     shut down 3 yr after launch but was reactivated in July 1974 after
     decay of the orbit ofOso 7 (launched 29 Sept. 1971). Os0 5, which had a
     planned lifetime of 6 mo, was obtaining data on the frequency and
     extent of eruptions on the sun's surface. (NASA Release 75-46)
23 January: The Air Force's prototype B- 1strategic bomber successfully
     completed its second flight test at Air Force Flight Test Center.
     Primary objectives of the 3-hr 21-min flight included evaluation of the
     aircraft's wing sweep control system, flying qualities in the initial
     climb, and power approach configuration. The auxiliary power unit
     was also evaluated and air-start tests were made.
        Following takeoff, the B-1 climbed to 3050 m, where its landing
     gear, flaps, and slats were retracted. After flying at low speeds with
     the wings in the full forward 15" position, the wings were swept 25",
     and the aircraft climbed to 4900 m and conducted air-start tests at
     mach 0.7. The prototype then slowed to 463 km per hr and its speed
     brake was checked in a descent to traffic-pattern altitude. The B- 1
     then landed safely at AFFTC. (AFSC Newsreview, March 75)
   ∞The Federal Communications Commission approved a plan for
     International Business Machines Corp. and Communications Satel-
     lite Corp.'s Comsat General subsidiary to form a domestic satellite
     company with a third company as long as no partner owned less than
     10% or more than 49% of the stock. However, a plan in which IBM
     would replace Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and MCI Communications
     Corp. as Cornsat's partner and own 55% was rejected. The FCC stated
     that this plan would give IBM too much power over the specialized
     communications business.
        Other alternatives suggested by the FCC included a plan whereby
     IBM and Comsat could independently enter the communications
     satellite business or Comsat could join another consortium without
     IBM. Another alternative was that Comsat, which was not permitted to
     deal directly with the public, could lease space communications
     circuits to IBM under an arrangement similar to the one Comsat had
     with American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
        Whatever the arrangement, FCC ruled, IBM must establish a
     separate corporation for its satellite operations. (FCC Memorandum

24 January: Studies of the heavy particle cosmic-ray exposure received by
     the astronauts during the nine Apollo lunar orbital missions revealed a
      significant variation in exposure as a function of the amount of
      shielding and the phase of the solar cycle, Science magazine reported.
     The command module pilot, who remained in the spacecraft while the
     two other crew members landed on the moon, had received the least
     exposure. The ankle, the least shielded part of the body, received a
     higher exposure than the chest, which had greater shielding. A sharp
     rise in exposure had been evident beginning with Apollo 14 when
     mission times increased. Observed variations in flux from mission to
     mission-the flux during Apollo 16 and 17 was 2.4 times higher than
     Apollo 8 through 1 2 w a s attributed to solar modulation of the
     primary cosmic ray beam.
        Data obtained during the Apollo missions would be used for
     planning long-range missions and for estimating expected biological
     damage. (Benton et al., Science, Vol. 187, 263-5)

     Industries which would furnish collector panels from off-the-shelf
     hardware at essentially no cost. (MSFC Release 75-22)
29 January: NASAâ€™s     basic goal in the U.S. stratospheric research program
     was to determine the normal makeup of the upper atmosphere with
     emphasis on understanding the dynamic processes occurring and the
     perturbations caused by natural and man-made events, Dr. James C.
     Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said at a hearing before the Senate
     Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. NASAâ€™s current high-
     altitude program was being carried out by conventional and special
     purpose aircraft such as the U-2, instrumented packages placed on
     commercial aircraft, instrumented balloons, sounding rockets, and
     computer modeling techniques. Satellites still provided the best
     potential for continuing repetitive global observations of the upper
     atmosphere. The Nimbus satellites had measured properties
     affecting the ozone and had made vertical profiles of the upper
     atmosphere. Atmospheric Explorer (m)         satellites had made coordi-
     nated investigations of photochemical processes in the upper
     atmosphere caused by solar ultraviolet radiation.
        Dr. Fletcher said that NASA would continue these efforts and had
     plans for new atmospheric studies. In addition to payloads planned for
     launch on the Space Shuttle, NASA would use instrumented aircraft,
     balloons, and sounding rockets to study the effects of chlorofluorometh-
      anes, or Freon, on atmospheric ozone. (Transcript)
  Reduction-in-force and reduction-in-grade notices were sent to 213 Civil
     Service employees at Marshall Space Flight Center as a result of the
     reduction in the end-of-N 1975 personnel ceiling. In addition to the 93
     persons separated and the 120 persons reduced in grade, 191 MSFC
     employees received reassignments as part of a reclassification survey
     conducted during the summer of 1974. (MSFC Release 75-24)
30 January: NASAâ€™s      Office of Space Science announced assignment to
     Marshall Space Flight Center of overall responsibility for a definition
     study of the Airnospheric, Magnetospheric and Plasmas-in-Space
     (AMPS)  Spacelab payload, to fly on the Space Shuttle. AMPs would be a
     manned laboratory equipped to study the dynamic process of ;he
     atmosphere and magnetosphere, using active and passive probmg
     techniques. (NASA Release 75-28)
31 January: An unexpected and sudden drop in the total number of
     ionospheric electrons within 1000 km of the burning Saturn V second-
     stage engines had been noted during the 15May 19731auhchofskylab
     1, Science magazine reported.The probable cause of the electron loss
     was the large number of hydrogen (HA and water vapor molecules
     added by the engines to the ionospheric F-region of the atmosphere.
     This initiated a recombination process between ionospheric positive
     ions and ambient electrons, causing the removal of ion-electron pairs.
     The Saturnâ€™s first-stage engines, which burned kerosene in an oxygen
     environment, cut off at 88 km and, therefore, had little effect on the
     ionosphere F-region.
        Similar changes in ionospheric chemistry had not been noted in
     association with Saturn V vehicles launched before Skylab 1 because
     alI their final parking orbits (and therefore their second-stage burns)

∞Marshall Space Flight Center announced the award of two contracts to
    Martin Marietta Corp. for further studies on the Earth Orbiting
    Teleoperator System (EOTS). Under a $246 570 contract Martin would
    design EOTS, an unmanned remotely controlled spacecraft, to operate
    in earth orbit near the Space Shuttle Orbiter. The spacecraft would
    carry a TV camera for close-up inspection, have docking capability,
    and be propelled by cold-gas expulsion. Under a $64 000 contract
    Martin would develop a complete set of requirements for the control
    and display station, a unit in the Orbiter that would contain control
    equipment common to all experiments requiring a teleoperator
    system. (MSFC Release 75-29)
∞NASA had awarded a $152 565 000 cost-plus-award-fee contract to
    Martin Marietta Corp. for the design, development, and test of the
    Space Shuttle external tank, Marshall Space Flight Center an-
    nounced. The contract, which covered the first increment of the
    external tank project for 1 Sept. 1973 to 30 June 1980, called for a
    maximum production rate of 24 tanks per year and delivery of major
    ground-test articles and 6 flight-model tanks. The work would be done
    at Michoud Assembly Facility under the direction of MSFC. (MSFC

During January: Opportunities and Choices in Space Science, 1974, a
    report published by the Space Science Board of the National
    Research Council, recommended that NASA undertake the Large
    Space Telescope as the only new space research start in FY 1976. The
    telescope should be followed by a series of permanent national and
    international observatories in orbit. The report also recommended
    that, budget permitting, NASA undertake in 1977 a lunar- polar
    mission, a Pioneer- Jupiter orbiter, a Mariner- Jupiter- Uranus
    mission, and a solar maximum mission. However, NASA should
    compare the importance of the Pioneer- Jupiter orbiter with the
    Mariner- Jupiter- Uranus mission if current FY 1977 budget esti-
    mates would not support both missions. Other recommendations
    included an immediate reevaluation of strategy for missions to explore
    the outer solar system during the next decade and for returning a
    Martian surface sample to earth instead of landing an unmanned
    laboratory to perform analyses as current plans propose.
       The report strongly endorsed the High Energy Astronomical
    Observatories (HEAO), Pioneer-Venus mission, and Mariner-
    Jupiter- Saturn mission as vital to the nation's space science efforts.

2 February: High-speed computer techniques were producing profiles of
    giant red stars, in a NASA-sponsored research project conducted by
    California Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Juliana Christy-
     Sackmann at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
       Analyzing high-resolution infrared data on successive star
    flashes representing from a fraction of a year to a million years in the
    evolution of a red giant, Dr. Christy-Sackmann found that the violent
    combustion of helium in the heart of the stars, releasing heat up to 260
    million'c, produced a predominance of carbon. She stressed the
    convective role of helium and hydrogen in fueling the stellar fires: A
    convective tongue of helium was driven through layers of burning
     shells toward the outer envelope of hydrogen. Hydrogen might also
     drop down to overlap, giving extra energy to an old star. The release of
    energy from the interior of the stars varied, apparently because of
    convective zones that seemed to come and go. Although each flash
    produced extreme interior disruption, surface changes in most cases
    were minor.
       The length of time required for computation had prevented
    previous investigators from following and analyzing more than a few of
    the hundreds of successive flashes occurring in a star; using the new
    computer technique, Dr. Christy-Sackmann planned to analyze
    hundreds. (JPL Release, 2 Feb 75)
3 February: President Ford sent a $349.4 billion FY 1976 budget request to
    Congress, an increase of $45.0 billion over the FY 1975 request. The
    recommended deficit of $51.9 billion was a peacetime record high
    designed to help revive the Nation's sagging economy. In his budget
    message to Congress, the President said that his recommendations
    provided for fiscal policy actions to increase purchasing power and
    stimulate economic revival; a major new energy program to hold down
    energy use, accelerate development of domestic energy resources,
    and promote energy research and development; an increase in outlays
    for defense to maintain preparedness and preserve force levels in the
    face of rising costs; a 1-yr moratorium on new Federal spending
    programs other than energy; and a temporary 5% ceiling on increases
    in pay for Federal employees and on individual benefits tied to
    changes in consumer prices. Proposals included a one-time 816-billion
    tax cut- $12 billion for individual taxpayers and $4 billion for
    business-to stimulate economic recovery.
       Energy: The President specifically requested that no new Federal
    spending programs be initiated in FY 1976except in the field of energy,
    which had a total recommended budget authority set at $2.491 billion.
    Federal energy functions were divided into three broad categories:
    general operating programs (analysis and development of energy
    policy), regulatory programs, and research and development pro-
    grams. General operating programs, with a recommended budget
    authority of $548 million, would be administered by the Federal
                                     17

    Energy Administration (FEA), Dept. of the Interior, and the new
    Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). Federal
    energy regulation, with a recommended budget authority of $178
    million, was managed by EEA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),
    and Federal Power Commission. Although the new budget called for
    support from NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for
    energy R&D, ERDA would have the major responsibility.
      The proposed energy program called for an increased fee on
    imported oil and an excise tax on domestically produced petroleum
    and natural gas. The proposal also called for decontrol of oil
                                                       deregulation of
    prices-coupled with a windfall profits tax-and
    prices on new natural gas.

      The Federal government had further expanded its research and
    development program to provide new and improved technologies
    necessary to increase domestic energy resources. Outlays for energy
    R&D would be $1.7 billion in FY 1976, an increase of 36% over FY 1975
    and 102% over 1974. Budget recommendations continued a vigorous
    nuclear R&D program and accelerated non-nuclear energy R&D,
    particularly in coal and solar energy.

            billion for gene               space, and technology-not
   including energy or Dept. of Defense programs-was highlighted by
   the buildup in the development and production of the Space Shuttle;
   continued development of spacecraft to explore the sun, planets, and
   universe; continued research, development, and experimentation in
   the application of space technology for surveying natural resources
   and improving weather forecasting; and increased support for basic
   science.
      Agencies receiving the major portions of the general science,
   space, and technology funds were NASA, NSF, ERDA, National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration, and Geological Survey.
      Air Transportation and Nonmilitary Aeronautical Research: In the
   field of transportation, for which the recommended FY 1976 budget
   authority was $5.568 billion, air transportation accounted for $2.660
   billion. The Administration would propose major legislation in avia-
   tion development, and revenues providing for continued long-term
   Federal development of the airway system, substantial restructuring
   of the airport grant program, and more equitable structuring of air-
   transportation user fees.
      NASA would spend $316 million in FY 1976 on its broad program of
   research and technology to support civilian and military aeronautical
   objectives. Major aims of the program: to reduce aircraft noise and
   exhaust pollution, reduce fuel Lconsumption, and improve aircraft ,
   performance, reliability, and safety.

     Defense Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation: Total
   obligational authority of $103 billion for military defense included a
   $10.236-billion estimate for RDT&E to permit continued engineering
   development of the B- 1strategic bomber, of the Trident submarine
   missile system, of long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles,
   and of the command, control, and communications of strategic forces.
   Also funded under the RDT&E function were military astronautics
   programs to improve space technology for military applications and to
   develop space vehicles for specific military missions. Efforts would be
   increased on development of a missile early warning system,
   communications satellite system, NAVSTAR global positioning system,
   and uses of NASAâ€™s     Space Shuttle for launching military space
   payloads.      â€™

   amounts of $958.9 million in authorizations and $905.6 in net outlays
   for the 3-mo transition period beginning 1 July 1976.
      Dr. Fletcher said the new budget was â€œlean but manageable.â€ For
   the first time since 1961 the budget provided no new program starts.
   In accordance with President Fordâ€™s request t o hold FY 1975 and FY
   1976 expenditures to a minimum, NASA, in FY 19â€™75, had deferred
   obligations of $72 million and optlays of $70 million, reduced civil
   service employment by 300, and made program adjustments to stay
   within the total m1975 and 1976 budgets. Further adjustments might
   be necessary if the inflation rate continued to grow,
      Although NASAâ€™s FY 1976 budget was up $300 million from the
   previous year, $200 million of this increase was specifically
   anticipated in last yearâ€™s budget to carry forward commitments built
   into programs approved in FY 1975. Therefore, NASA had received an
   effective increase of only $100 million, or about 3%. This, along with
   the nationâ€™s current 9% inflation rate, was a â€œgood indicator of the
   leanness of NASAâ€™s 1976 budget.â€
                        FY
      The budget would permit NASA to proceed with current major
   programs as planned: The Space Shuttle, scheduled â‚¬or a first
   manned orbital flight in mid-1979, and Landsat- C, scheduled for a
   fall 1977 launch, would continue on schedule. Reduction of fuel use in
   aircraft remained a principal focus in NASAâ€™s aeronautics research
   and technology. NASA was also continuing stratospheric studies,
   including the effects of pollutants on the environment, with significant
   contributions coming from NASA meteorological and atmospheric
   satellites, sounding rockets, and balloons and high-flying aircraft.
      Although there would be no new starts, NASA would continue its
   study and advanced technical development for science, applications,
   and aeronautics projects to be started in future years, including
   preliminary work for payloads to fly on the Space Shuttle and
   Spacelab.
      The 1975 calendar year launch schedule was one of the most
   ambitious in U.S. history with 28 launches scheduled, including the
   joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July and the two
   Viking missions to Mars scheduled for August.
      Although NASAâ€™s legal responsibilities for energy research and
   development-designated under the Solar Heating and Cooling Act of
   1974-had been transferred to the Energy Research and Development
   Administration, NASA would work closely with ERDA in various
   aspects of solar research and development.
      Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said at the press
   briefing that the largest budget increase was for manned spaceflight,
   where the increase for the Shuttle was partially offset by reduced
   spending for the rest of manned spaceflight. The small increase for
   space science did not tell the whole story: If funds for the Viking
   program were subtracted, the budget for the rest of science had
   increased $170 million from FY 1974 to FY 1976. Although
   applications, aeronautics, and space technology programs each
   showed small increases, funds for tracking and data acquisition
   decreased slightly despite increased maintenance costs for tracking
   stations, because NASA was beginning to close down tracking stations,
   preparing for the time when tracking and data relay satellites would be
   available.

        Total budget plan




      William E. Ldy, NASA Comptroller, said that, of the $84.6 million
    budgeted for construction of facilities, $47.2 million was to continue
    the buildup of Space Shuttle facilities, mostly for launch and landing
    facilities at Kennedy Space Center. The remaining funds were for
    normal rehabilitation and modification of existing facilities, with
    smaller amounts for minor construction and for faciIities planning and
    design.
      Civil service manpower was expected to continue at the same level
    for FY 1976 with 24 316 employees. However, the number of support
    service contractors-excluding mission or stage contractors-would
    decrease from 18 637 in N 1975 to 17 811 in fl1976. The estimated
    125 000 persons working on NASA programs during N 1975 was
    expected to increase by 6000 to 7000 by the end of FY 1976.
      Distribution of funds to the Centers would change: An increase of
    $224.3 million would go to Johnson Space Center for the Shuttle
    program. A decrease of $37.3 million for KSC reflected a decrease in
    funding for the construction program. Goddard Space Flight Center

    ∞The Federal Council for Science and Technology, a committee of
0
      officials representing major research and development agencies,
      released â€œReport on the Federal R&D Program-FY 1976,â€ a summary
      of 17 R&D agenciesâ€™ efforts in applying science and technology to
      national issues. The report stated that the FY 1976 budget included
      $21 billion for R&D programs, a 15% increase over the FY 1975 R&D
      budget of $18.8 billion. Of this, approximately $7.4 billion was
      planned for civilian programs including energy, health, education,
      agriculture, environment, urban problems, and transportation. Ap-
      proximately one-fourth the civilian R&D budget was planned for
      energy, with the largest share of that-$1.55 million-going to the
      Energy Research and Development Administration. Nine other
      government agencies would receive increases in R&D budgets, with
      NASAâ€™s 1976 budget estimate increasing to $3.539 billion, up from
               FY
      $3.231 billion in Fâ€ 1975, an increase of more than $300 million.
      Space R&D would continue with projects to explore Mars, Venus,
      and outer planets, as well as the sun. Satellites would continue to be
      used for earth resources assessment, weather prediction, and surveys
      of potential geothermal energy sources.
         The Federal Aviation Administration would receive increases for
      air traffic safety, and Dept. of Defense increases would support
      development of the B- 1 manned strategic aircraft, Trident missile
      systems, and Navy and Air Force air combat fighters. (Text; OMB,

    ∞NASA management had permitted inflight use of â€œundesirable compo-
      nentsâ€ in the electrical system of the Thor-Delta launch vehicle to
      preserve the programâ€™s schedule, Aviation Week & Space Technelogy
      reported. At least two Thor-Deltas had been launched with the same
      electrical-system contamination failure potential that â€œprobably
      caused the lossâ€ of the U.K.â€™s Skynet ZZ A military communications
      satellite 18 Jan. 1974. Av Wk reported that, although NASA officials
      considered the policy undesirable, they had used the components
      until they could be recycled or replaced, in the belief that the risk had
      been acceptable. On 18 Dec. 1974 the French-West German
      Symphonie 1 was almost lost when an apparent electrical contamina-
      tion problem occurred in the Thor-Delta s second stage. Av Wk said
      that Symphonie program management had not been aware of the
      vehicleâ€™s electrical-system failure potential. (Av Wk, 3 Feb 75, 44)

    follow-on of a 1973 contract to study the feasibility of using remote-
    sensing devices for temperature measurement and evaluation, the
    zfniv. of Flodda would receive satellite and aircraft data from K s c and
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that would
    provide actual measurements of leaf and ground temperatures at
    specific times and places. Following calibration, the data would be
    combined irlto a temperature-prediction model. Then, using known
    variables such as current temperature, humidity, time, cloudcover,
    add wind velocity, the user could accurately forecast where freezing
    tenipdratures would occur. (KSC Release 21- 75)
3-11 February: A delegation representing the U.S.S.R. Communications
    Administrdtipn met in Washington with representatives of the

    to discuss preliminary arrangements for the U.S.S.R. to use INTELSAT
    satellites for communications between the Soviet Union and the U.S.,
    Canada, and Mexico. According to preliminary agreements, INTELSAT
    would provide the U.S.S.R. with â€œoccasional useâ€ of space segment
    capacity in the INTELSAT system for preassigned voice-grade
    services,, television relays, and digital transmission. The U.S.S.R.

4 February: Air Force Systems Commandâ€™s Aeronautical Systems Div.
    announckd plans to begin flight evaluation of â‚¬an blades constructed
    of itdvdnced composite materials. The new blades, made of an
    aluminum alloy matrix enforced by silicon carbide-coated boron
    filaments, would be flown on an F- 111aircraft over a 2- to 3-yr period
    at the Air Force Flight Test Center in California. The composite
    blades, 44% lighter than convehtional titanium blades, were expected
    to increase operating efficiency by reducing rotating mass, increasing
    tip*speeds, and eliminating part-span shrouds. (AFSC Release OIP

∞Edward N. Cole, retired president of General Motors Corp., was
    designing a freight carrier, called the Huskie, twice the size of the
    Boeing 747, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Cole, whose plan
    was still cin the drawing board, efivisioned a fleet of 300 Huskies
    carding height around the world, ,each aircraft flying 15 hr a day.
    Because fast loading and ufiloading was critical to the planeâ€™s
    economic success, an automated modular loading and unloading
    system was also being designed to permit the craft to take off again
    within 30 min of landing. With the price tag for the fleet estimated at
    $913billiofi, Cole was counting on government interest to bolster his
    plans. CSM repotted that Dept. of Defense officials were interested in
    a fleet of privately built cargo planes-with government-insured
    mortgage-that       could be commandeered by the military in an
    emkrgency. (AP, CSM, 4 Feb 75, 5B)

  ∞Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov, one of the Soviet Unionâ€™s lead-
0
    ing space scientists, died in Moscow at the age of 80. Blagonravov,
    chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Commission for Space
    Research and head of the State Research Institute of Engineering
    Studies, was one of the key scientists responsible for launching
    the worldâ€™s first satellite, Sputnik 1 , 4 Oct. 1957. Blagonravov had
    begun his career in the military and much of his early work was on
    the development of automatic infantry weapons. He later turned
    to the development of spacecraft, making major design contributions
    to the Soviet Unionâ€™s Lunik I , launched 2 June 1959, as the first
    man-made object to fly by the moon. Blagonravov also represented
    the U.S.S.R. in many international organizations: He had been vice-
    president of the International Space Research Committee, perma-
    nent U.S.S.R. representative on the United Nations Scientific
    and Technical Subcommittee for the Peaceful Use of Space,
    and permanent deputy Soviet representative on the U.N. Space
    Committee.
       In 1962 Blagonravov held discussions with Dr. Hugh L. Dryden,
    Deputy Administrator of NASA, during which details for exchange of

∞NASAâ€™s new Low Cost Modular Spacecraft (LCMS), a recoverable
    compartmented spacecraft being considered for use aboard the Space
    Shuttle, was. demonstrated at a news conference at Rockwell
    International Corp.â€™s Space Division. The LCMS consisted of an
    instrument and spacecraft assembly joined by a transition ring.
    Scientific instruments or earth-resources sensors could be attached to
    the LCMS for specific missions. Designed by Goddard Space Flight
    Center engineers, the LCMS would fit into the 5- by 18-m payload bay
    of the Orbiter and also could serve as a platform for as many as 14
    satellites. The system could be placed in orbit by the Shuttle and later
    serviced or recovered and returned to earth for needed repairs. Dr.
    Robert 6. Wilson, Director of Advanced Payload Analysis at NASA
    Headquarters, said that a recoverable modular satellite system such
    as LCMS could save as much as $100 million anhually over the cost of
    nonrecoverable satellites. (JSCRoundup, 14 Feb 75,3; GoddurdNews,

     Jan., the launch had been delayed to replace the Inertial Measure-
     ment Unit of the launch vehicle's flight-control system with a newer
     more reliable unit. The spacecraft performed normally during the
     transfer orbit, and attitude and reorientation maneuvers were
     performed as planned. The apogee boost motor was fired on second
     apogee at 9:43 am EST 7 Feb. placing Sms 2 in a synchronous orbit;
     orbital parameters were 36 685-km apogee,. 35 680-km perigee,
     1456.4-min period, and 1.1"inclination. By 10 Feb. the spacecraft was
     drifting westward at 6" per day toward the final operational station of
     115"west longitude. Over several days beginning 10Feb., the onboard
     auxiliary propulsion system was fired to place the spacecraft into
     proper attitude for operational use. First photos were transmitted 11
     Feb.
        NASA objectives-to launch the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit
     of sufficient accuracy to enable the spacecraft to accomplish its
     operational mission requirements, conduct an in-orbit evaluation and
     checkout of the spacecraft, and turn operational control over to
     NOM-were met, and the mission was adjudged successful 22 April.
     NASA turned over control of Srns 2 to NOAA 10 March.
        The 628-kg cylindrical spacecraft carried five instruments to
     provide high-quality day and night cloudcover data; take radiance
     temperatures of the earth's atmosphere; measure proton, electron,
     and solar x-ray fluxes, and magnetic fields; transmit processed data
     from central facilities to regional stations; and transmit environmental
     information to N O M from the thousands of manned and unmanned
     data-collection platforms on land, rivers, lakes, and the sea.
        Sms 2, together with its sister craft Srns 1 (launched 17 May 1974),
     provided continuous coverage of the Western Hemisphere, trans-
     mitting weather photos every 30 min. SMS photos would be made into
     film loops of clouds moving over oceans and land masses to help
     meteorologists determine what types of cloud formations and weather
     conditions might cause the destructive tornadoes and hurricanes that
     frequently occur over the eastern U.S.
         Sms 2 was the second in a series of two operational prototypes and
      one operational spacecraft (SMS-C, to be called Goes 1 in orbit)
      developed and funded by NASA to meet the requirements of the Dept.
      of Commerce's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
      (GOES) system. Under aNASA-DOC agreement, NASA was conducting a

      technology developed in its Tiros, Nimbus, and Applications
      Technology Satellite programs-for          DOC'S operational program.
      Follow-on GOES spacecraft were being planned. Goddard Space Flight

       The NASA study, which used high-altitude U-2 aircraft, confirmed
    that atmospheric ozone increased from the equator to the poles and
    was also influenced by regional and seasonal variations. Ozone mole-
    cules above the latitude of Houston were only three fifths as plentiful
    as above the latitude of Minneapolis. Correspondingly, the Cancer
    Institute survey showed an annual incidence of nearly 400 skin-cancer
    cases per 100 000 whites in Dallas, Tex., and less than half that figure
    in the Minneapolis area.
       These data, when combined with the DOT study, indicated that the
    number of skin-cancer cases in the U.S. would increase by 6000, or
    I%, a year if 120 supersonic transports operated in the stratosphere
    for 4 hr daily, thus depleting the zone by 0.5%. (Lowenstein et al.,

7 February-1 March: The eight prime and backup Soviet cosmonauts
    training for the July Apollo-Soyuz Test Project joined with U.S. prime
    and backup astronauts in the U.S. to continue training for the joint
    mission. The cosmonauts-Aleksey A. Leonov, Valery N. Kubasov,
    Anatoly V. Filipchenko, Nikolay N. Rukavishnikov, Vladimir A.
    Dzhanebekov, Boris D. Andreyev, Yury V. Romanenko, and
    Aleksandr S. Ivanchenkov-arrived in Washington, D.C., 7 Feb. and
    traveled to Kennedy Space Center the following morning.
       The group toured KSC 8 Feb. giving the cosmonauts their first
    glimpse of the U.S. launch complex. Col. Leonovcommented that the
    pad from which Alan B. Shepard was launched in 1961 â€œis a very
    simple launch stand compared to the ones we use now.â€
       Following a tour of Disney World in Florida 9 Feb., the cosmonauts
    spent 10 Feb. inspecting the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the
    Apollo would be stacked on the Saturn IB launch vehicle; the Launch
    Control Center firing room, from which the rocket would be
    controlled; and Launch Complex 39 Pad B, from which the Apollo
    spacecraft would be launched. Press coverage of the first Soviet visit
    to KSC noted that previous invitations for Soviet officials to visit KSC
    had been turned down,apparently because of Soviet unwillingness to
    reciprocate with invitations to Baykonur Cosmodrome. But in May
     U.S. astronauts would return the visit by going to the Soviet launch
     site.
       The astronauts and cosmonauts flew to Johnson Space Center to
    begin a 2-wk training period that included exercises in command and
    docking module simulators and mockups; joint language-training
    sessions; briefings on experiments, contingencies, and mission rules;
    and practice run-throughs of the planned joint activity days. Following
     a press conference at which U.S. and Soviet ASTP crew members were
    introduced to JSC employees, the Soviet cosmonauts returned to the

∞Communications Satellite Corp. released its 1974 annual report: earn-
    ings during 1974 had increased to a record $44 918 000, or $4.49 per
    share, up from $36 299 000 or $3.63 per share in 1973.
       In his â€œMessage for the Shareholders,â€ ComSatCorp President
    Joseph V. Charyk attributed the growth to the continued increase in
    communications traffic over ComSatCorpâ€™s global network. Ex-
    cluding the u.S. mainland-Hawaii service, the number of half-circuits
    leased by ComSat to U.S. international carriers increased during the
    year by about 20%, from 2933 at the end of 1973 to 3510 at the end of
    1974.
       Responding to the increased demand for service, ComSatCorp and
    its partners in the International Telecommunications Satellite
    Organization had continued to improve and expand the system during
    1974. A sixth Intelsat IV satellite, Zntelsat Z F8, had been launched

    launch during 1975, and three additional Intelsat IV-As were
    scheduled for launches beginning in 1977. Even higher capacity
    Intelsat V satellites were being planned for use in the 1980s.
       The ground network had been expanded to a year-end total of 104
    antennas at 84 earth station sites in 60 countries. Construction of
    additional antennas was begun at ComSatCorp-operated stations in
    Maine and West Virginia. (ComSat Release 75-7; ComSatCorp 1974

14 February: High-temperature core reactors, fueled by fissioning ura-

    wastes produced in the fission process, NASA announced. In a NASA-
    sponsored program to develop advanced nuclear-powered rocket
    propulsion, scientists had found that long-lived radioactive wastes
    could be transformed into harmless materials by bombarding them
    with neutrons. The uranium-compound fuel could be circulated and
    returned to the reactor to burn up the materials produced in the fuel.
    Computer analyses showed that a gaseous fuel reactor could establish
    a balance in rates of production and elimination of the waste produced
    after 3 yr of operation; once this equilibrium was established, no
    additional long-lived radioactive wastes would be produced. The
    gaseous fuel reactor also could be designed to burn wastes from
    conventional nuclear-fission reactors. (NASA Release 75- 44; Schnei-

    down fittings on the fins of the Saturn IB launch vehicle scheduled
    to launch the Apollo spacecraft in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in
    July. After an earlier routine inspection at Michoud Assembly Facility
    had turned up one crack, a more detailed inspection at Kennedy
    Space Center 19 Feb. revealed 25-cm cracks on the fittings of two of
    the eight fins. A decision was made to replace the two fins. The
    cracks would not affect flight, but were in an area carrying the weight
    of the vehicle as it sat atop the mobile launcher. During a later inspec-
    tion, cracks also were found in the remaining six fins, making it
    necessary to replace all eight.
       Replacement work began 11 March. Engineers strengthened the
    cracked areas by placing compressive stresses in the surface of the
    material, by pneumatically pounding it with a small bundle of rods. Six
    of the fins were replaced by 15 March.
       The spacecraft was placed atop the Saturn IB on 17 March and
    replacement of the remaining two fins was completed by 19March. (KSC

∞The Air Force System Commandâ€™s Materials Laboratory had successfully
    static-tested a full-scale F- 15 aircraft wing constructed of advanced
    composite materials, AFSC announced. The wing had withstood a
    maximum load 45% greater than expected during actual flight, before
    giving way at the point where the titanium rear spur flange and upper
    skin were bolted together. The composite wing, 18% lighter than an all-
    metal wing, was made of a brown epoxy thin honeycomb sandwich
    material reinforced with graphite-epoxy stiffeners. The ribs were
    graphite-epoxy and the spurs were metal. The wing, the largest
    aircraft wing ever built of advanced composite materials, was 4.9 m
    wide at the root chord and 1.5 m wide at the tip chord, and had a 4.3-m
    span.
       The program had begun in May 1971 with an $8.2-million contract
    award to McDonnell Douglas Corp. for development of the wing,
    which was expected to reduce fuel requirements by increasing range,
    speed, and maneuverability. (AFSC Release OIP 021.75)
  ∞Despite the immediate need for aircraft noise-abatement regulations,
    little or nothing had been done, Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.) said
    in a speech on the floor of the Senate. The Federal Aviation Adminis-
    tration was considering proposals to curb jet-fleet noise by retrofitting
    engine nacelles of JT-3D and JT-8D aircraft with sound-absorbing
    material. Delay had come in part from industry, which favored an
    alternate NASA refan program costing five times that of retrofit and not
    technologically feasible for several years. In addition, the NASA
    program could not quiet the JT-3D aircraft-the Boeing 707s and
    McDonnell Douglas DC- 8s-which made up the noisiest fourth of the

    nationâ€™s jet fleet. Sen. Tunney said that the potential benefits of the
    NASA program did not justify waiting until the technology was ready at
    a cost five times greater than retrofitting. If FAA was to prove
    responsible in the area of aircraft noise abatement, it could not
    Cbsuccumb industry pressure against retrofit.â€ A retrofit regulation
                to
    should be put into final form at the first available opportunity. (CR, 19

20 February: Some â€œvery heavyâ€ influential politicians had been rallying
    around NASAâ€™s â€œlittle known and unglamorousâ€ Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite [renamed Landsat 14 Jan.] program, inducing
     President Ford to overrule his budget advisers and provide money for
    a third spacecraft in 1977, Arlen J. Large said in the Wall Street
    Journal. It wasnâ€™t only NASA but â€œthe ERTS community-geographers,
    foresters, pollution fighters and land-use plannersâ€ that lobbied for a
    third satellite to continue the work of Landsat 1 and 2 (launched 23
    July 1972 and 22 Jan. 1975). The Office of Management and Budget
    had wanted to delay funding until NASA developed cameras with
    better resolution, but the â€œlobbying blitzâ€ convinced President Ford
    to overrule OMB; money for the satellite was included in the FY 1976
    budget. (Large, WSJ, 20 Feb 75, 44)
  ∞Zntelsat I V F 4 communications satellite was destroyed by a NASA range
     safety officer 415 sec after launch from Eastern Test Range when the
     Atlas-Centaur test vehicle tumbled out of control. Lifting off at 6:35
     pm EST, the mission had been normal to Atlas booster-engine cutoff at
     138 sec. Then telemetry data indicated several malfunctions, in-
     cluding electrical problems and loss of altitude. After destruction, the
     vehicle impacted in the Atlantic Ocean 800 km downrange from the
    launch site. An investigation of the failure was begun under the
     direction of Lewis Research Center and the mission was officially
    judged unsuccessful 6 March. The failure was the first for an Atlas-
     Centaur since May 1971, when a circuit problem in the Centaur ended
     the launch of the Mariner 8 Mars probe.
        The 1400-kg Intelsat Z F-6, launched by NASA on a cost-reim-
                                V
    bursable basis for the Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the
     89-member-nation International Telecommunications Satellite Con-
     sortium, was intended to be the primary spacecraft over the Indian
     Ocean region, withzntelsat IV F A , launched 13 June 1972, becoming
    the backup. The failure of Intelsat IV F-6 would have no immediate
     effect on Intelsat global communications; Intelsat N F-5 could pro-
     vide the primary function and Zntelsat IZI F - 3 , launched 6 Feb. 1969,
     was still capable of providing limited backup.
        The Zntelsat Z F-6 mission had been scheduled originally for
                       V
    launch in February 1973 but experienced a series of delays from prob-
    lems in both the satellite and the launch vehicle. (NASA MORS, 26 Feb

21 February: The unexplained loss of calcium by astronauts during pro-
    longed manned missions â€œseems to be a slow persistent loss,â€ Dr.
    David L. Winter, NASA Director for Life Sciences, said during a press
    briefing. Data indicated calcium had been lost in space at the rate of
     0.5% a month, a rate that showed â€œno evidence of leveling off.â€ Bones
     tended to lose calcium at varying rates, weakening selective bones.

    Scientists were studying various ways, including diet management, to
    compensate for the calcium loss.
       Dr. Winter said that the observed decrease in red blood cells during
    the Skylab missions was not because of red-cell destruction but rather
    a slowdown of the red-cell production. â€œWe seem to have stumbled on
    a way in which red blood cell production is suppressed.â€ This
    mechanism, unknown before, would be a very interesting and
    important process to study.
       Physical criteria for the selection of astronauts for the Space
    Shuttle would vary according to function, Dr. Winter said. Pilots
    would be selected using very rigid criteria; these would not be im-
    posed upon astronauts, i.e. mission specialists, whose function would
    be primarily scienti-fic. Because the objective for Shuttle missions
    would be to get the best qualified scientists, it would be impossible to
    predict what size, shape, age, or sex these scientists would be. The
    purpose of the Shuttle was to permit anyone with a legitimate need to
    go into space; therefore, NASAâ€™s   approach would be to broaden the
    selection criteria as much as possible. (Transcript)
∞Dr. Philip Handler, 18th president of the National Academy of Sciences,
    had been elected for a second 6-yr term, NAS announced. Dr. Handler
    had served as NAS president since 1July 1969. Before that he had been
    chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at Duke Univ. Medical
    Center.
       NAS, established in 1863 by an act of Congress, was a private
    organization of over 1000 scientists and engineers frequently called
    upon to advise the Federal government on policy questions related to
    science and technology. (NAS Release, 21 Feb 75)

24 February: Design and fabrication of the first Space Shuttle Orbiter was
    progressing well, with all major structural elements-forward
    fuselage, tail, wings, mid fuselage-scheduled for final assembly in
    mid-1975, NASA Deputy Director of the Space Shuttle LeRoy E. Day
    told the Canadian Science Writers Association in Toronto, Canada.
    The main rocket engine, the most difficult development item, was
    being built on a 10-yr technology base in which government and
    industry had invested nearly $100 million. During 1974, initial com-
    ponent engine firings had been made, and firings of the first integrated
    subsystems test bed engine were scheduled for July.
       The emphasis for the expendable external tank had been on sim-
    plified low-cost production. An inexpensive spray-on insulation had
    been developed to protect the aluminum skin from excessive tempera-
    tures during ascent.
       In summary, NASA and its contractors were making steady
    progress, holding within cost and schedule commitments. The first
    Orbiter would be rolled out in 1976, with its first captive flight on the
    back of the Boeing 747 aircraft scheduled for the second quarter of
    1977. The first approach and landing tests, in 1977, would be made by
    separating the Orbiter from the 747 at about 8500 m, permitting the
    Orbiter to glide down and land on the runway at Edwards Air Force
    Base. The second Orbiter would be used for the first orbital flight in
    1979, with six developmental flights scheduled before the Space
    Shuttle became operational in 1980. (Transcript)

     Univ. of Arizona scientists aboard NASAâ€™s 141 Airborne Infrared
     Observatory [see 12 Feb.] could stimulate additional support for a
     probe mission to obtain more detailed information, Aviation Week and
    Space Technology reported. Scientists had already known that the
     proportions of helium and hydrogen on Jupiter were approximately
     the same as on the sun. The additional information that oxygen existed
     on Jupiter would strengthen the belief that the planetâ€™s composition
     was similar to that of the sun, and that the sun and the planet had been
     formed from the same raw material. The conclusion was important to
     many scientists who believed that earthâ€˜s atmospheric composition
     had evolved from one similar to Jupiterâ€™s. If this were true and if
     Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere had changed little from its primitive state, then
     the Jovian atmosphere could serve as a laboratory for studying the
     evolution of life on earth. This new information could influence NASA
     scientists charged with making recommendations for new starts. (Av

     D.C. â€œFrontier Technology and Shuttle Countryâ€ was the theme of
     the session chaired by Grant L. Hansen of General Dynamics Corp.
     An Aerospace Day was observed 27 Feb.
        Sessions were held in four areas: transportation efficiency, national
     defense, space applications, and frontier technologies. The more than
     500 attendees of the technical sessions listened to papers on com-
     puters in aerospace, short-haul aircraft systems, advanced communi-
     cations, and satellite technology.
        Harris M. Schurmeir, Jet Propulsion Laboratoryâ€™s manager of the
    Mariner Jupiter- Saturn 1977 project, delivered the von Karman
     Lecture 24 Feb., â€œPlanetary Exploration: Earthâ€™s New Horizon.â€
     Schurmeir said that, despite American virtuosity in the unfolding
     drama of solar-system exploration, the never-abating high launch rate
     of the Soviet Union would make them competitors if the U.S. failed to
     exercise its mission options in the late 1970s and 1980s.
        On 25 Feb. Hans E. W. Hoffman, managing director of West
     Germanyâ€™s ERN0 Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, said that the develop-
     ment of Spacelab was exactly on schedule, with a complete engineer-
    ing model to be delivered to NASA in April 1978. The first flight unit
    would be delivered 1 yr later.
        The first mission of the Spacelab would be a joint U.S. -European
     venture. A call for ideas for experiments had netted 243 proposals,
    from which a selection would be made; the selection process for
    European payload specialists would begin in 1975.

       Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, addressed the gather-
    ing 26 Feb. He noted that, although aerospace technology had been
    one of the â€œkey driversâ€ in retaining the U.S. lead in world technology,
    a feeling of the importance of technology was â€œnot universally
    shared.â€ A decline in the national emphasis on technology â€œhas much
    to do with the decline in productivity in this country.â€ The increasing
    cost and complexity of applying new technology had become a vexing
    national problem. Finding new ways to reduce costs was a key man-
    agement task that the aerospace business must face.
       Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
    fare, said in an address 26 Feb. that satellite-delivered services in
    Alaska had been so successful that the Alaskan Federation of Natives
    -a highly representative broad-based grassroots organization-had
    made them the organizationâ€™s top priority. The goal was to achieve an
    operational satellite service for health, education, and other com-
    munications needs.
       The formation of the Public Service Satellite Users Consortium,
    consisting of health and educational organizations, represented the
    first effort to organize a market of small independent users sufficient
    to attract private investment capital for large-scale technology to meet
    their collective needs. HEW was investigating the possibility of a
    â€œsocial service satelliteâ€ to meet the needs of various public and social
    service communities by means of an inexpensive ground receiver.
    The satellite could dramatically reduce the cost of such servioes while
    greatly increasing the quality.

26 February: Press briefings on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project were held at
     Johnson Space Center. ASTP participants would be conducting
     experiments in space sciences, life sciences, and applications, ASTP
     Project Scientist Dr. Thomas Giuli said at an experiments briefing.
     The five space-science experiments included a soft x-ray experiment
     to study radiation by scanning across the celestial mode, pointing at
     known discrete sources in the soft part of the spectrum from 2 kev to
     0.1 kev, and investigating 10specific x-ray sources known to emit only
     in regions below 2 kev. A helium-glow experiment would investigate
     temperature and density of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of
     our solar system by observing two special frequencies of extreme
     ultraviolet light emitted from the sun after they traveled into
     interstellar space, hit the interstellar medium, and were reflected
     back again. Other space-science experiments included a study of the
     sunâ€™s outer atmosphere during an artificial eclipse created by
     maneuvering the Apollo spacecraft. During the â€œeclipse,â€ the Soyuz
     crew would photograph the sunâ€™s corona.
        Among the earth environmental and applications studies was an
     experiment to measure neutral atomic oxygen and neutral atomic
     nitrogen of the earthâ€˜s upper atmosphe-re. Another experiment would
    try to devise a simple means of monitoring the aerosol content of the
    earthâ€˜s atmosphere. A water-resources management experiment,
    planned and coordinated with the government of India, would photo-
    graph the Himalayan area to map drainage patterns and water-
    reservoir locations.
       Life-science experiments included a study to observe optical sensa-
    tions from cosmic rays experienced by the crew, an investigation of
    mutation in cells grown in space, and studies of the effect of space
    flight on the ability of microbes to infect humans and of changes in the
    human immunity system to resist infections under space flight con-
    ditions.
       At a mission profile briefing, Kenneth A. Young of JSCâ€™S Mission
    Planning and Analysis Div. said that plans called for a 9-day Apollo

    mission beginning 7.5 hrs after the launch of Soyuz by the U.S.S.R.
    The planned rendezvous period would be 2 days, with docking
    scheduled for the 30th inertial orbit, or third day in flight, of the Apollo
    spacecraft. Following much negotiation, u.S. and Soviet mission
    planners determined that the two spacecraft would dock over Soviet
    territory, providing real-time telemetry coverage for the Soviet Union,
    but at a location where NASAâ€™s 6 communications satellite could
                                      Ats
    provide communications coverage to the U.S. The first handshake
    would take place over Spain.
       The spacecraft would undock on the 5th day and perform several
    joint experiments while separated. Soyuz was scheduled to land the
    following day. Apollo would continue unilateral experiments in orbit
    before landing at the end of the 9th day in space.
       Astronaut Richard H. Truly said, during a joint crew activities
    briefing, that while the Apollo and Soyuz were docked, all communi-
    cations would be conducted in the language of the listener regardless
    of the nationality of the speaker. (Transcript)
   Both the Soviet and u.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project crews had reached a
    level of language proficiency where â€œwe can speak to each other,â€
    commander of the Soviet crew Aleksey A. Leonov said in anzzvestiya
    interview. Leonov said that the crewsâ€™ first meeting had been â€œmerely
    a glanceâ€ and â€œwe wondered whether we would come to like each
    other.â€ In preparing for the mission, the Soviets and the Americans
    had not only come to treat each other â€œas crew member to crew mem-
    berâ€ but had also developed a degree of comradeship. It would be
    impossible to work without this. In the event of some emergency, if â€˜â€˜I
    have to carry him on my shoulders or he has to carry me, how could I
    do this unless I respect him and value him as a comrade? For we are
    virtually candidates of the whole world. Despite the difference of our
    social formations, despite the contradictions which have existed and
    continue to exist to this day, we have found points of contact.â€

  ∞NASA announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with


    Zaire to build the first African ground station designed to receive
    earth-resources data from Landsat 1 (launched as Erts 1 23 July 1972)
    and Landsat 2 (launched 22 Jan.). Zaireâ€™s new station would produce
    both computer tapes and photographic imagery that would include
    data on the African continent from Chad to South Africa and from
    Kenya to the Ivory Coast. Currently, data from that area had been
     stored by onboard tape recorders for transmission to U.S. ground

  ∞Soviet and French scientists had completed the â€œAraksâ€ study of the
0
    earthâ€™s magnetically interlinked points, Zzvestiyu reported, by ob-
    serving what happened when a bundle of electrons was artificially
    injected into the magnetosphere. French Eridan sounding rockets-
    equipped with electron accelerators, plasma generators, and instru-
    ments for measuring and recording wave radiation and particle
    streams-were launched on 26 Jan. and 15Feb. 1975 from Kerguelen
    Island. During the ascent the accelerator emitted electron impluses at
    various angles to the line of magnetic force while the plasma generator
    emitted a stream of cesium plasma to compensate for the positive
    charge of the rocket.
       At the same time Soviet and French specialists in Arkhangelsk
    Oblast made optical observations using supersensitive TV installa-
    tions, photometers, and electron optical-image intensifiers. Radar
    and radio spectrographs in Kostroma and Vologda Oblasts observed
    the dispersal of radio waves and radio emission in the area where the
    electrons penetrated the dense strata of the atmosphere.
       From the Araks data, Scientists hoped to determine the true
    position of the magnetically interlinked spot and to learn more of the
    interaction between the electron bundle and its medium. (Zzvestiyu,

  ∞Aerodynamically designed wind-flow aids could reduce wind resistance
    to tractor-trailer trucks by up to 24%, NASA announced. In a series of
    tests conducted in 1974 at Flight Research Center, NASA and the
    Department of Transportation evaluated performance gains of a 15-m
    trailer outfitted with five different commercially available drag-
    reduction devices and two different trailer-cab spacings. The tests
    had been conducted without and then with the devices, at speeds from
    45 to 30 km per hour, to evaluate changes in fuel economy resulting
    from reductions in air drag. (NASA Release 75-39)
During February: NASA biochemist B. C. Walverton began planting large
    quantities of water hyacinths as part of a study to determine the
    plantâ€™s ability to absorb and concentrate toxic metals and to metabo-
    lize various other chemical pollutants. Scientists at NASAâ€™s National
    Space Technology Laboratories had been experimenting since 1971
    with vascular aquatic plants, which are equipped with a system of
    vessels to carry nourishment from the roots to the leaves. Results of
    the experiments were so promising that NASA, in cooperation with
    Mississippi state officials and the city of Bay St. Louis, had installed a
    special system using water hyacinths as a final filtration to remove
    nitrates, phosphates, and other chemical pollutants from the 245-sq-
    kmBay St. Louis, Miss. sewage lagoon. The water hyacinths would be
    harvested and analyzed to determine the amounts and kinds of
    impurities assimilated; saturated plants would then be recycled, using
    one of two methods being developed by NASA, into a mixed
    hydrocarbon fuel similar to natural gas. (NASA Release 74-332)

1 March: A Baltimore Sun editorial discussed â€œDistorted Priorities in the
    R&D Budget.â€ The Presidentâ€™s R&D budget for N 1976 had little
    chance of passage in its existing form because of the hostility of much
    of the 98th Congress to some of its proposals. Defense-related R&D
    would be reduced, the energy proposals would be juggled to give more
    to solar and geothermal energy, and the proposed large cuts in
    biomedical research would be restored.
       Congress might be more sympathetic to NASA. Once seen by
    congressional critics as a quasi-military organization or at least â€˜2
    space circus that siphoned dollars away from more pressing needs,
    NASA was â€œbeginning to prove itself a valuable scientific toolâ€ in such
    valuable areas as environmental monitoring. That the Office of
    Management and Budget had not, as once threatened, scrapped funds
    for the Landsat- C satellite â€œmay reflect an effort to make NASA more
    attractive by further pushing the agency into the areas that have
    gained humanist and environmentalist approval.â€ (BSun, 1March 75,
    A18)
2-7 March: A meeting at Goddard Space Flight Center of US. and
    U.S.S.R. officials to discuss a cooperative meteorology program
    recommended that in May- July 1976 each country, within a single 27-
    day solar rotation, launch two series of sounding rockets-one under
    quiet magnetic conditions, the other under disturbed magnetic
    conditions. In 1977 the two countries should hold a rocket-data
    comparison test in the vicinity of Wallops Island, Va. Both countries
    should launch more meteorological rockets during atmospheric
    warming periods. In 1976- 1978 both countries should research
    radiation transfer as a factor in temperature sensing from satellites.
    From 1975- 1978joint remote-sensing experiments using microwave
    were proposed, along with exchange of information on frequencies
    and data format to be used with direct-broadcast equipment. (NASA

3 March: NASAâ€™s   Remotely Piloted Research Vehicle (RPRV) was being
    equipped with landing gear to enable it to land under control of a pilot
    on the ground, Flight Research Center announced. Previously
    helicopters and parachutes had been used in midair recovery of the
    vehicles.
       Developed by.FRC, the RPRV-a scale-model airplane up to 9 m
    long-was an economical and safe way to test advanced aircraft. After
    air launch of the W R V , a test pilot in a ground-based cockpit used
    flight controls and instruments to â€œflyâ€ the RPRV through maneuvers,
    while a camera provided visual information. First application of the
    landing gear would be for a spin test of a 318-scale model of the Air
    Force F- 15 fighter. ( n c Release 3- 75)

    dioxide, ozone, water vapor, and particles larger than 0.3 microns
    would help determine whether the amount of ozone was being altered,
    whether vapor trails from jets contributed to cloud cover, and the
    amount of pollution caused by aircraft.
       The first GASP-instrumented 747 began flights in December 1974.
    Four aircraft-one each from United Airlines, Pan American, Qantas
    Airways, and Scandinavian Airlines-would          be instrumented for

∞For coating solar collectors that heat and cool homes and buildings,
    black chrome had been demonstrated by a Lewis Research Center
    scientist to be some 20% more efficient than current coatings. Being
    â€œsolar selective,â€ black chrome allowed absorption of sunlight but
    prevented the ensuing heat from radiating out of the collector. Be-
    cause of this, black chrome would raise the temperature of water in
    the system as much as 5Â°C (40Â°F) over the 95Â°C (200Â°F)provided by
    current coatings. A system with hotter water would require fewer
    collectors to heat or cool an area. (NASA Release 75-55)
∞Sen. William Proxmire (D- Wis.) had said that NASAâ€™s       Space Shuttle
    program â€œmight be on the verge of a financial breakdown,â€ the

6 March: NASA announced early findings of the 3 Dec. 1974PioneerZZ flyby
    of Jupiter. Data returned-by Pioneer ZZ (launched 5 April 1973, and
    renamed PioneerSaturn following the flyby) suggested that Jupiterâ€™s
    magnetic field might be created by a large ring current and many
    eddies deep within the planet. Earlier measurements from Pioneer 10,
    launched toward Jupiter on 2 March 1972, had indicated only a simple
    magnetic envelope with a single â€œring currentâ€ much like earthâ€˜s. The
    more complex magnetic field could explain the Jovian fieldâ€™s high-
    energy particle pattern as well as the bursts of intense radio energy
    observed emanating from the planet. Jupiterâ€™s magnetic field
    stretched across 14 million km in some places and shrank in volume
    by three-fourths or more in others; inside this pulsating field were
    belts of intense radiation with trapped electrons 10 000 times more
    intense than those in earthâ€˜s Van Allen belts.
       Pioneer had experienced peak intensities of high-energy electrons
    that were moderately higher than those found by Pioneer IO,
    encountering 10 times as many electrons as predicted by earth-based
    studies. Peak intensities of very high-energy protons were 100 times
    stronger than predicted but concentrated in small shallow regions.
       Other early findings of Pioneer 11 included the observation that
    Jupiterâ€™s cloud tops were substantially lower at the poles than at the
    equator and were covered by a thicker transparent atmosphere. Also,
    the clouds at the planetâ€™s south pole were lower than those at the north
    pole. Although Pioneer 11 found much less evidence of rapid
    circulation at the poles than at the equator, the polar areas showed
    many small convective cells dwarfing similar earth disturbances such
    as thunderstorms. â€œBlue skyâ€-attributed to multiple molecule-
    scattering of light by gases of the transparent atmosphere-was
    visible at the poles.

       In addition, for the transition period 1 July to 30 Sept. 1976, the
    committee recommended decreasing NASA's         total budget request of
    $958 900 000 to $922 450 000. One specific recommended reduction
    was in the C of F request, from $14 500 000 to $8 050 000, which would
    allow construction to continue at the same rate as during FY 1976; the
    committee recommended reduction of the $730 600 000 request for
    R&D to $700 600 000. The committee allowed NASA management
    flexibilitv in apportioning the reductions. (H.R. Com of Sci & Tech

15 March: Helios 1 , the U.S.-West German solar probe launched 10 Dec.
    1974, passed within 0.309 AU (46 million km) of the sun at 5:13 am
    EDT, closer than any previous spacecraft had come to the sun. During
    the perihelion, while traveling at 238 000 km per hr, Helios 1 meas-
    ured the solar wind, magnetic fields, solar and galactic cosmic rays,
    electromagnetic waves, micrometeoroids, and zodiacal light. Al-
    though the spacecraft encountered a heat load from the sun 10.5
    times that encountered on earth, good data were obtained and the
    spacecraft continued to operate well. Helios 1 was in a solar elliptical
    orbit with a 0.985-AU aphelion, 0.3095-AU perihelion, 190.15-day
    period, and 0.02" inclination. It would reach a second perihelion 21
    Sept.
       Helios 1, built by West Germany in cooperation with the U.S., car-
    ried 10 experiments, 7 of them West German. Spacecraft operations
    were controlled from the space operations center near Munich.
    Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for U.S. participation.
    A second spacecraft, Helios-B, was scheduled for launch in early
    1976. (NASAMORs 16 Jan 76,11 April 76; Powers, GSFC Helios thermal

16 March: Mariner 10 made its last and closest flyby of Mercury at a dis-
    tance of 327 km at 6:39 pm EDT. To prepare for the flyby, the trajectory
    had been corrected on 30 Oct. 1974 and 13 Feb. 1975. An additional
    correction 7 March was to reduce the probability of Mariner 10â€™s
    impacting the surface of Mercury from 30% to 1%, targeting Mariner
    10 to approach the planet from the sunlit side, then loop around
    behind it.
       One last-minute problem was navigational difficulty in locking onto
    the star Canopus so that the spacecraft would point in the proper
    direction for data collection. Because a commanded roll search for
    Canopus would expend all remaining attitude-control gas, Mariner 10
    had to be maneuvered using solar-radiation pressure on the solar
    panels and high-gain antenna. The problem was intensified because
    of the tandem demands of Helios 1 and Mariner 10 on the antennas of
    NASAâ€™s   deep-space tracking network. However, the primary users-
    West German scientists tracking Helios 1-gave receiving time to the
    Mariner 10 flight controllers, who obtained Canopus lock in time for
    the encounter.
       Major objective of the third encounter was to determine whether
    Mercury had an intrinsic or induced magnetic field. In a press briefing
    17 March, Dr. Norman F. Ness, principal investigator of the magnetic
    fields experiment, said that Mercury did have an intrinsic magnetic
    field, encountered on the incoming trajectory at precisely the time
    predicted from the first Mercury pass. Mariner 10 had measured the
    field to be a maximum of 400 gamma. Plasma science experiment data
    supported the presence of the field; Dr. Ness observed that the
    interface between the solar wind and Mercuryâ€™s magnetic field ap-
    peared to be a scaled-down version of the interaction between the
    solar wind and the magnetic field of earth.
       The spacecraft returned about 300 TV pictures of the planetâ€™s sur-
    face between 12 and 17 March, with best resolution at 100 m obtained
    from quarter-frame near-encounter pictures. All photos were trans-
    mitted in real time and at 22 kilobits per sec, instead of the planned
    117, because of overheating of the spacecraft. (NASAMORs, 10 March

17 March: Vanguard 1 , oldest satellite still in orbit, completed its 17th year
    in space. The 1.5-kg 16.5-cm solar-powered spacecraft, which had
    revealed that the earth was slightly pear-shaped, had circled the earth
    more than 67 000 times since its launch in 1958. The satellite, fourth
    to orbit earth followingtwo Soviet sputniks andExplorer 1 , was one of
    3304 man-made objects tracked by the North American Air Defense
    Command. (A&A 1915-1960; A&A 1968; Miles, LA Times, 18 March

   NASAâ€™s   High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO)          program. The
   HEAO program was to launch between 1977 and 1979 three unmanned
   scientific satellites into low circular earth orbit to study black holes,
   neutron stars, quasars, and supernovae. (MSFC Release 75- 50)
∞European spending for space programs would rise significantly during
   1975 as major projects begun in the past reached a maximum pitch,
   Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. Most space spending
   was reflected in the European Space Research Organization (ESRO)
   budget which had jumped 50%, from $220 million in 1974 to $350
   million in 1975. Two programs-the Ariane launch vehicle and the
   Spacelab for use on the Space Shuttle-accounted for half the ESRO
   budget for 1975.
     Av Wk reported that officials of Franceâ€™s Centre National dâ€™Etudes
   Spatiales (CNES),   prime contractor for the Ariane, had estimated that
   the booster would be used to orbit between 20 and 39 geostationary
   satellites during the 10-yr period from 1980 to 1990.
      Other European space programs under way included the Orbital
   Test Satellite (OTS), a test bed to evaluate equipment and concepts
   planned for a European comsat to be launched around 1980; Aerosat,
   a Canadian-ESRO-U.S. comsat program, with the first of two
   satellites scheduled for launch in 1978; Marots, a maritime comsat
   planned for launch in 1977; and Exosat, an x-ray astronomy satellite to
   be launched in 1979.
      A l ESRO programs would be reviewed in the spring to resolve any
       l
   pending disagreements, and to obtain approval of a 3-yr financial plan
   that called for a budget of $410 million in 1976 and $415 million in
   1977. (Av Wk, 17 March 75, 65-68)
∞A significant influence on NASAâ€™s   ability to maintain viable programs in
   the face of possibly unstable funding will be the extent to which
   commercial and foreign government users participate in the develop-
   ment and financial support of future payloads,â€ Aviation Week and
   Space Technology reported. Av Wk interviewed the Director of Mis-
   sion and Payload Integration in NASAâ€™s         Office of Manned Space
   Flight, Philip E. Culbertson, who said that it would be better, in the
   long term, to move into a position where more organizations outside
   NASA were sponsoring and paying for missions and payloads. The
   agency was encouraged by the interest of industries in flying and fund-
   ing Space Shuttle missions involving a wide range of basic scientific
   and technical operations.
      Foreign reimbursable payloads, already an important part of NASA
   launch operations, were seen as an even larger factor in Shuttle pay-
   loads development. Japan, already holding discussions with N S to  AA
   lay the groundwork for a viable national space program, was con-
   sidered a serious Shuttle customer; Japan would like to develop both
   scientific and earth applications programs in the communications,
   navigation, and weather satellite fields.. Canadaâ€™s interest in position-
   ing domestic communications satellites over its territory would con-
   tinue into the Shuttle era. Even individual Soviet scientists had made
   inquiries into the possibilities of flying payloads on the U.S. Shuttle.
      Culbertson pointed out that, unlike earlier N S manned space
                                                         AA
   programs that included scientific funding in overall program budgets,
   N S in-house Shuttle payload development was the sole responsi-

    bility of the specific NASA disciplines themselves. NASAâ€™s FY 1976
    budget request contained from $50 to $100 million for various efforts
    that could evolve into Shuttle payloads, and the budget for FY1977
    would markedly increase payload funding. However, with the budget
    crunch, funding for Shuttle payloads would compete directly with
    other programs and the payload proposals â€œwill have to stand on their
    own merit.â€ Culbertson also said that major decisions would have to
    be made on how long to keep which expendable launch vehicles in the
    program.
       In another interview, N S Spacelab Program Director Douglas R.
                                AA
    Lord said that upcoming major decisions concerning Spaceiab in-
    cluded a follow-on procurement plan for Spacelab hardware and
    priorities on how often ESRO (Ehropean Space Research Organization)
    and other crews and experimental hardware would fly on Shuttle-
    Spacelab missions.
       Lord said that operations of overall Spacelab functions would
    probably be maintained separately from payload operations: Johnson
    Space Center was the logical place to handle overall operations, and
    Marshall Space Flight Center was the leading candidate for the
    Spacelab payload operations center. Goddard Space Flight Center
    had expressed interest in handling operational needs of the high-
    energy experiments on Spacelab pallets. (Covault, Av Wk,17 March

18 March: â€œThe expertise and facilities of LeRC [Lewis Research Center],
    as well as other NASA centers, are being considered by ERDA [Energy
    Research and Development Administration] as part of its overall
    definition of a total institutional structure required to carry out the
    nationâ€™s energy R&D program,â€ Dr. James C. Fletcher, N S Ad-   AA
    ministrator, and Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., ERDA Administrator said
    in a letter to Representative Charles A. Mosher (R- Ohio). The letter
    was a reply to correspondence from members of the Ohio
    congressional delegation and Cleveland businessmen and industrial-
    ists to President Ford calling for increased use of LeRC talent to meet
    the nationâ€™s energy crisis.
       Dr. Fletcher and Dr. Seamans noted that the newly established
    ERDA was the lead Federal agency for managing national energy R&D.
    ERDA intended to use the expertise and facilities of other Federal
    agencies where it was feasible and in the national interest with respect
    to cost, timeliness, and program management.
       LeRC, NASAâ€™s center for aerospace propulsion and power, was
                      lead
    already involved in ERDA-sponsored projects in solar heating and
    cooling, wind energy, and topping cycles to increase the efficiency of
    coal-fueled steam plants. But LeRC would continue its main task to
    work on propulsion technology, conducting energy research in sup-
    port of ERDA â€œwhen it was consistent with the requirements of its
    principal mission within NASA.â€ (Text, letter to Mosher from Fletcher

19-20 March: A special conference at Lewis Research Center, â€œSelected
    Technology for the Gas Industry,â€ discussed how NASA-developed
    technology could aid the u.S. gas industry in ways such as satellite
    search for fossil fuels, turbine machinery and compression tech-
    nology, heat transfer, fluid flow and fluid properties, safety,
    technology for liquefied natural gas, instrumentation, materials and
    life prediction, and reliability and quality assurance.
       Addressing a conference dinner 19 March, Dr. James C. Fletcher,
    NASA Administrator, said, â€œIn an age when space research and
    technology was measured by its immediate value in the marketplace,
    studies of the planets often are considered little more than an exercise
    in curiosity. Nothing could be farther from the truth.â€ When space-
    craft were developed to meet the specialized needs of space travel and
    planetary exploration, technology was advanced. â€œNASA cannot lay
    claim to the development of the electronic computer, but it can take a
    large credit fox spurring a revolution in the electronics industry.â€ The
    need for lightweight components in spacecraft led to electronic
    microminiaturization. The IUiac 4computer, developed at the Univ. of
    Illinois for DOD and now operated jointly by DOD and NASA, could
    perform 300 million calculations a second and store 1trillion bits of
    information at a time, more than the entire surviving output of the
    Greek and Roman civilizations. Operational since 1973, Illiacâ€™s speed
    and refinement allowed scientists to simulate and study global climate
    changes, study long-range effects of pollution on the atmosphere,
    distinguish between earth tremors from natural sources and
    underground nuclear blasts, develop seismic pictures of the earthâ€˜s

    discovered in earliest stage of development. Illiac 4 has helped solve
    problems that had eluded scientists for decades.
       Other space technology was being used effectively to preserve and
    manage the earthâ€˜s resources and enhance the quality of life for all its
    inhabitants. Communications satellites were making global com-
    munications a reality. Meteorological satellites had advanced the
    science of weather forecasting on land and sea. Sensors, smgical
    instruments, biological isolation garments, lenses, portable cardiac
    care systems, and eye switches were just a few examples of space
    technology used in the medical field. New alloys and materials
    developed to withstand the rigors of space were being used for longer-
    lasting automobile and aircraft engines; temperature-resistant
    lubricants and fireproof materials added to the safety of homes and
    buildings.
       â€œThe fast-growing list of things that are and will be as a result of our
    venture into the cosmos is almost beyond imagination. Everyone who
    lives will be affected by them. And because of them, the world a

     Laboratory sent the command for the spacecraft to stop operations at
     8 2 0 am EDT. Before shutdown, spacecraft engineering tests were
     conducted to try to open the stuck door on the plasma science
     experiment, rotate the solar panels to various positions, stow the scan
     platform at 18@,operate the stuck tape recorder, and provide data for
     future spacecraft design.
        During its more than 16 mo in heliocentric orbit, Mariner 10
     (launched 3 Nov. 1973) had traveled more than 1.6 billion km and
     made four planetary encounters, one of Venus and three of Mercury.
     It had passed within 5800 km of Venus 5 Feb. 1974, and transmitted to
     earth the first closeup photographs ever taken of the cloud-shrouded
     planet.
        Mariner 10 had confirmed the high-speed circulation of Venusâ€™
     upper atmosphere and revealed circulation patterns that swirled from
     the equator toward the poles. It had also revealed a long tail of charged
     particles trailing behind the planet and away from the sun; verified the
     presence of a bow shock wave created by the solar wind acting upon
     the dense atmosphere; detected hydrogen, helium, and argon in the
     Venusian atmosphere; and discovered temperature-inversion zones
     suggestive of deeper stratiform cloud layers.
        First spacecraft to use the technique, Mariner 10 used the gravity of
     Venus to speed it on toward Mercury. The probe flew by that planet
     three times, on 29 March and 21 Sept. 1974 and 16 March 1975. At
     Mercury, Mariner 10 photographed a highly cratered lunar-like
     surface with large scarps hundreds of kilometers long and over 1.6
     kilometers high. Mariner 10 data also revealed the existence of a
     chemically differentiated light crust, lunar-like near the surface and
     earth-like at its interior, and an unexpected magnetic field 100 times
     smaller than earthâ€™s. A slight but measurable atmosphere was found,
     in addition to streams of high-energy electrons and protons on the
     planetâ€™s dark side. On its last encounter with Mercury [see 16 March]
     Mariner IO came within 327 km of Mercury to take the closest

31 March: Boeing Co. scientists were studying a way to cut aircraft fuel
    consumption as much as 40%, according to the Baltimore Sun.The
    technique involved cutting many tiny holes in the aircraft wings and
    applying suction from within. This would control the laminar flow
    of the airstream, preventing drag-producing turbulence from being
    created by the change in pressure as the air flows over the wing
    surface. In the 1960s Northrop Corp. had built the Air Force a plane
    incorporating the concept but technical problems had discouraged
    further development. Rising fuel costs and recent improvements
    in structural materials and manufacturing techniques had sparked
    new interest in the method. (AP, B Sun, 31 March 75, A7)

      tests evaluated the effectiveness of Ats 6 functioning as a communi-
      cations relay between a ship in distress and a coordination center
      thousands of kilometers away.
         In the tests, a â€œstrickenâ€ ship dropped a buoy equipped with a
      position-indicating radio beacon into the ocean. Ats 6 picked up the
      signals and transmitted the shipâ€™s identification and position to a
      NASA ground station, which relayed .them to the Coast Guardâ€™s New
      York Rescue Coordination Center. The rescue center then sent the
      information to rescue aircraft and ships. As they neared the area,
      they could home in on the buoyâ€™s signals. Within 2 hr of the time
      the buoy was dropped, the ship and the buoy were located.
         The search and rescue communications tests were part of con-
      tinuing joint L-band experiments using Ats 6 and conducted by GSFC

9-22 April: NASA launched &os 3 Geodynamic Experimental Ocean
    Satellite from Western Test Range at 4:50 pm PDT on a two-stage
    Thor-Delta 1410 launch vehicle. The satellite entered orbit with an
    844-km apogee, 837-km perigee, 101.9-min period, and 115.0â€œ
    inclination. Forty-one investigators would participate in the mission,
    whose primary objective was to perform an in-orbit radar altimeter
    experiment demonstrating the feasibility and utility of mapping the
    sea surface with a 1-to 2-m precision. Geos 3 would also measure wave
    heights and contribute to the development of technology for future
    satellite radar altimeter systems. Other objectives included support of
    the calibration of NASA and other agenciesâ€™ ground C-band radar
    systems; demonstration of a satellite-to-satellite tracking experiment
    withAts6 (launched 30 May 1974);comparison of new and established
    geodetic and geophysical measuring systems; support investigations
    in solid-earth dynamic phenomena such as polar motion, earth
    rotation, earth tides, and continental drift; and further definition of
    orbit determination techniques using precisior, tracking systems such
    as lasers and doppler ground stations.
       All spacecraft subsystems were checked out 9- 10 April with telem-
    etry indicating normal performance. Gravity-gradient stabilization
    maneuvers were also begun with the firing of the squibs that released
    the end mass and extended the boom to 0.7 m. Additional boom
    extension and retraction maneuvers were carried out 11April with the
    maximum extension of 6 m occurring that day.

    axis stabilization; the desired pitch damping of 1â€was achieved by
    20 April.
       By 22 April ground controllers activated doppler and C-band tran-
    sponders and began tracking. Solid acquisition of return-pulse data
    was occurring on all passes, and the radar altimeter had operated in
    the high-intensity mode twice over the Atlantic Ocean. Engineering
    tests of the Ats 6-Geos 3 satellite-to-satellite tracking experiment
    were completed. Calibration of radar altimetry began on 21 April and
    would continue until 20 May.
       First of its kind, the satellite-to-satellite tracking experiment by
    Geos 3 and Ats 6 was expected to provide orbit information more pre-
    cise than that obtainable by ground observations. From its geo-
    synchronous orbit Ats 6 tracked &os 3 for more than half its orbit

       Geos 3 carried an array of quartz reflectors that permitted laser
    ranging measurements accurate to 10 cm. A laser beam sent to the
    satellite would be reflected, and then received back at the originating
    ground site, one of a network of laser ranging stations which would
    track Geos 3 during its mission lifetime.
       Powered by 16 solar cell panels, the 34&kg, 8-sided spacecraft was
    the third in a series of GEOS spacecraft designed to gain knowledge of
    the earthâ€™s shape and dynamic behavior as part of the National
    Geodetic Satellite Program (NGSP). The NASA-managed program,
    begun in 1964 with the cooperation of the Depts. of Defense and
    Commerce and several universities and international organizations,
    was initiated to generate a unified world-survey network and to de-
    velop a more precise mathematical model of the earthâ€˜s gravitational
    field.
       Geos 1 (Explorer29, launched 6 Nov. 1965) and Geos 2 (Explorer 36,
    launched 11 Jan. 1968) had demonstrated that the U.S. could make
    most observations using one satellite and that errors in any system
    could be discovered and corrected by reference to other systems.
    Other missions in the NASA geodesy program included Explorer 22
    (launched 10 Oct. 1964),Explorer27 (launched 29 April 1965),Pageos
    1 (launched 1 July 1966), and the Earth Resources Experiment
    Package @REP, launched 15 May 1973 aboard Skylab 1).
       The Geos 3 program was managed by Wallops Flight Center under
    the direction of the Office of Applications at NASA Headquarters.
    Mission operations and the Thor-Delta launch vehicle were managed
    by Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft, designed and built
    by the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins Univ., cost about
    $12.5 million. (NASA MORS, 8 April 75, 22 April 75; Wkly SSR, 3-9

10 April: The first ground-test hardware for the Space Shuttle, a hydraulic
    actuator for the main engine, had arrived at Marshall Space Flight
    Center for functional checkout, MSFC announced. Each of the Orbiterâ€™s
    three main engines would use two of the actuators to gimbal the engine
    for steering control. After checkout the actuator-one of 8 to be
    tested-would be sent to the National Space Technology Laboratories
    where the main engines would be tested. (MSFC Release 75-68)
∞Dust storms had been observed on the moon every sunrise and sunset
    by a three-axis microparticle detector left on the moon by Apollo 17
    astronauts during their December 1972 mission, a Nature magazine
    article reported. The article, based on a report by scientists at
    Goddard Space Flight Center, said the GSFC scientists suspected that
    the dust was being lifted from the lunar surface and then driven away
    from the rising or setting sun by electrostatic fields associated with
    the transition from day to night, or vice versa.
       The finding supported a theory advanced 20 yr ago by Dr. Thomas
     Gold of Cornell Univ., who had suggested that electrostatic forces
    transported dust from lunar highlands to lowlands, accounting for the
    smooth appearance of the lunar seas. Although the Apollo landings
    had shown that those seas had been formed by lava flooding rather
    than deep dust accumulations, their surface was covered with very
    fine dust. Also, because neither wind nor rain existed on the airless
    moon, some other process must have been responsible for the evident
    erosion. Electrostatic levitation was being suggested as one possible

    explanation. Because the lunar vacuum acted as an insulator, the dust
    cloud hugged the surface, reaching only between 20 and 30 cm high,
    explaining why it had been detected from a low angle by instruments
    on the lunar surface but never by orbiting astronauts or earth-based
    equipment. (Hughes, Nature, 10 April 75, 481-2)

11 April: President Ford, in a White House ceremony, presented the
    National Space Clubâ€™s Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy to
    Skylab 4 Commander Gerald P. Carr on behalf of the nine astronauts
    who inhabited the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched 14 May 1973)
    during periods in 1973 and 1974. The astronauts were cited for their

        ∞Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Director Chester M. Lee said at a
NASAâ€™s
   NASA Headquarters press briefing that a number of modifications had
   been made on the Apollo command and service modules to accommo-
   date the special requirements of the July US.-U.S.S.R.        ASTP
   mission.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1975                                     April

       Changes to the command module included a modified umbilical
    to accommodate docking-module functions, an additional TV camera
    and recorder for coverage of joint activities, modified controls and
    displays for new equipment and experiments, additional equipment
    for communications and TV coverage via Ats 6 (Applications Tech-
    nology Satellite, launched 30 May 1974), modified stowage, added
    intervehicular intercom, and additional VHF-FM communications
    capability at the U.S.S.R. frequency.
       Changes in the service module included added heaters and insula-
    tion of propellant systems for solar inertial attitude, added propellant
    storage module for increased attitude-control and backup deorbit
    capability, and deletion of the unused main propellant tank.
       The docking module would be carried in the same position in which
    the lunar module had been during lunar landing missions. It would
    be extracted in the same manner, by separating the CSM from the
    booster once in orbit, turning around, and pulling out the docking
    module with the nose of the CSM.
       In response to questioning, Lee said that the U.S. cost of the ASTP
    mission would fall within the 8245-mdion congressional authoriza-
    tion. Although the Soviets had not quoted a specific amount, Lee
    believed that the launch of the two unmanned Soyuz spacecraft to
    check out modifications made for MTP, the launch of a manned
    mission, and the preparations for two complete spacecraft and crews
    would indicate that the Soviets were investing "at least the equiva-
    lent" in resources. (Transcript)
14 April: Flight Research Center pilots began flight tests as part of a
    cooperative industry-government program to measure noise levels of
    five business-class jet aircraft during various landing approach
    maneuvers. Object of the tests was to define noise characteristics
    for this class of aircraft and the effectiveness of alternate landing-
    approach procedures in reducing community noise levels. Using a
    Rockwell Sabreliner, Grumman Gulfstream 11, Gates Learjet,
    Beech-Hawker 125 provided by the National Business Aircraft
    Association, and Lockheed Jet Star provided by NASA, FRC pilots
    flew four landing approaches over a microphone array. A normal
    3" approach provided baseline information; a 3" decelerating ap-
    proach with engines at reduced power, a 4" approach with normal
    power, and a two-segment approach starting with 6" angle and
    shallowing into a 3" approach provided additional data. (NASA Release
    75 -103)
14-30 April: U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight crews, accompanied
    by 32 members of Working Group 1, met in the U.S.S.R. with their
    Soviet counterparts for the final training session in Soviet Russia
    before the scheduled July launch. US. astronauts included prime
    crew members Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K.
    Slayton; backup crewmen Alan L. Bean, Ronald E. Evans, and
    Jack R. Lousma; and support crewmen Karol J. Bobko, Robert L.
    Crippen, and Eugene A. Cernan.
       During practice sessions similar to those held in the u.S. 7 Feb.-
    1 March, the participants practiced communications skills, transfer
    procedures, joint activities, and contingency situations, using the
    Soyuz simulator at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Center in Star City.

       On 19 April the crews visited the mission-control center at Kalinin-
    grad and, on 28 April, became the second group of Westerners to visit
    the Baykonur cosmodrome (French President Charles de Gaulle had
    been the first western visitor when he witnessed the launch ofcosmos
    122 on 25 June 1966). At Baykonur the U.S. crewmen saw the actual
    flight hardware as well as the primary launch pad 2 km away, and the
    prime and backup crews each spent an hour in the Soyuz spacecraft.
    The astronauts later reported to the press that they had found no
    significant differences between the actual spacecraft and the
    simulators used during training. (Ezell et al., The Partnership: A

15 April: The Council of the European Space Research Organization
    met and approved appointment of directors proposed by ESROâ€™S Com-
    mittee for the soon-to-be-established European Space Agency. When
    ESA became operational at the end of May, the new directorate would
    include Roy Gibson (United Kingdom) as Director General, Andre
    Lebeau (France) as Director of Planning and Future Programs, Dr.
    Ernst Trendelenburg (West Germany) as Director of Scientific and
    Meteorological Programs, and George Van Reeth (Belgium) as Direc-
    tor of Administration.
       Directors already in office who would continue after the establish-
    ment of ESA were Bernard Deloffre (France), Director of the Spacelab
    Program; Prof. Gianni Formica (Italy), Director of the European
    Space Operations Center; Ove Hammarstrom (Sweden), Director of
    the European Space Research and Technology Center; Dr. Walter
    Luksch (West Germany), Director of Communications Satellite Pro-
    grams; and Prof. Massimo Trella (Italy), Technical Inspector. (ESRO

∞Flight Research Center announced the award of a 30-mo cost-plus-
    fixed-fee contract, valued at $13 million, to Rockwell International
    Corp. to design and build two subscale model aircraft for NASAâ€™s
    Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology Program. The two-phase
    contract called for an initial 60-day effort for detailed program plan-
    ning; upon satisfactory completion of phase 1, NASA would approve
    the final design and fabrication.
       The two vehicles were scheduled for delivery to FRC late in 1977 for
    flight-testing, using the Remotely Piloted Research Vehicle test
    technique [see 3 March] developed by FRC. Air-launched from a
    carrier aircraft, the vehicles would be flown through maneuvers by a
    ground-based pilot using TV, telemetry, and radar. (FRC Release

∞The Air Force Systems Command announced the award of a $100 000
    contract to Aero Co. to study the feasibility of using parafoils half the
    size of a C-5 aircraftâ€™s wing to recover remotely piloted vehicles
    (RPVs). RPVs were currently retrieved by recovery helicopters, a relia-
    ble but expensive system affected by weather conditions. The para-
    foil, part of an AF effort to find cheaper ways to land RPVs, was a high
    glider which, when deployed like a parachute, would take on an air-
    foil shape and descend at a rate of 1m forward for each 0.3-m loss in
    altitude. Under the terms of the contract Aero would design and build
    two 12- by 24-m parafoils for testing scheduled to begin in May. (AFSC

16 April: The U.S.S.R. was planning to flight-test the SLX-14, a launch
    vehicle larger than the Saturn 5, from Tyuratam during the summer
    of 1975, Kenneth W. Gatland reported in the Christian Science Moni-
    tor. Launch preparations, observed by the Air Force's Big Bird
    reconnaissance satellites, had been under way since 1974. Gatland
    reported that the project had been delayed for more than 5 yr when a
    previous prototype caught fire and exploded during a 1969 fueling
    test. Two others had failed in flight, in 1971 and 1972. After con-
    sidering cancellation of the project, Soviet officials ordered a drastic
    design review and the program continued with increased emphasis on
    systems reliability and ground testing. (Gatland, CSM, 16 April 75, 1)
18 April: NASA announced the appointment of David R. Scott as Director
    of Flight Research Center to replace Lee R. Scherer, who had become
    Director of Kennedy Space Center. Scott had been an astronaut on
    Gemini 8 (16 March 1966), on Apollo 9 (3-13 March 1969), and on
    lunar landing mission Apollo 15 (26 July-7 Aug. 1971). After leaving
    the astronaut corps in 1972, Scott served as technical assistant to the
    Apollo Program Manager at Johnson Space Center, and as special
    assistant for mission operations and government-furnished equip-
    ment in the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. (NASA anno, 18April 75)
19 April: The U.S.S.R. launched Aryabhata, India's first scientific satel-
    lite, from Kapustin Yar in the Soviet Union. The satellite entered
    orbit with a 611-km apogee, 568-km perigee, 96.5-min period, and
    50.7" inclination. The Delhi Domestic News Service said that the
    360-kg satellite, named for a fiith-century Indian astronomer and
    mathematician, carried instruments to measure x-rays from celestial
    sources, look for neutrons and gamma radiation from the sun, and
    measure ionospheric parameters. Ground tracking stations in India
    and the Soviet Union reported the instrumentation was functioning
    normally.
       Aryabhata, designed and built by scientists at India's Space Re-
    search organization with technical assistance from Soviet scientists
    and specialists, was completed under an agreement for joint Indian-
    Soviet collaboration signed on 10 May 1972. The press reported the
    estimated cost of the project to be $6 million. (Delhi Dom News Ser,

21 April: West Germany was studying the possibility of purchasing a
    Spacelab pressurized module for use on the u.S. Space Shuttle,
    Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. The German Spacelab
    would be configured for research in space processing, a field of con-
    siderable interest to Germany. Its missions on Spacelab, launched
    by NASA aboard the Space Shuttle on a cost-reimbursable basis, would
    be separate from missions conducted by the European Space Re-
    search organization. (Av Wk, 21 April 75, 27)
∞The Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory and NASA Lewis Research
    Center had begun a joint research program to determine the feasi-
    bility of using synthetic fuels to power military and commercial jet
    aircraft, the Air Force Systems Command announced. As part of the
    10-yr $&million study, Exxon Corp. had been awarded a contract to
    study the refining processes like hydrogenation required to produce
    fuels from coal and oil-shale synthetic crudes, and to compare the
    chemical and physical properties of these fuels with those of petro-

     leum derivatives. Costs ofprocessing the synthetics would depend on
     definition of engine and fuel-system needs.
        The decision to begin research on synthetic fuels was part of an Air
     Force conservation effort. U.S. aircraft, military and commercial,
     accounted for 8% of U.S.petroleum consumption; fuel costs for mili-
     tary jets alone had more than tripled in the previous 18 mo. The cost
     of fueling a C -5 cargo aircraft had risen from $6780 in April 1973 to
     $22 400 in April 1975. ( M s C Release OIP 070.75)
   ∞A NASA-sponsored research program at Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology had demonstrated that ultraviolet liiht could convert
     water into a hydrogen fuel, NASA announced. MIT researchers placed
     a titanium dioxide crystal and a piece of platinum connected by a wire
     into a beaker of water in which inert ionic substances were dis-
     solved to allow an electric current to flow. The titanium dioxide and
     platinum acted as electrodes, establishing electrical contact with the
     water. When ultraviolet light from a laser illuminated the titanium
     dioxide, application of electrical potentials as low as 0.2 volts pro-
     duced hydrogen and oxygen gases.
        The process thus far was inefficient, only 1% of the light energy
     being converted into chemical energy. Researchers were experiment-
     ing with different electrodes and reaction temperatures to find
     methods that would decompose water using low-energy visible light
     instead of high-energy ultraviolet light, which was only a small frac-
     tion of the liiht available from the sun. (NASA Release 75-106)
21-24 April: The National Academy of Sciences held its 112th annual
     meeting and the National Academy of Engineering held its 11th
     annual meeting, in Washington, D.C. The state of the sciences and
     their potential contribution to the solution of national problems were
     discussed. During one session Dr. J. Herbert Holloman, Massachu-
     setts Institute of Technology professor and former Assistant Secre-
     tary of Commerce for Science and Technology, said that the u.S. â€œno
     longer dominated the worldâ€™s technological process. We have now be-
     come the strongest nation among many.â€ Dr. Holloman said that the
     growth of productivity in the U.S. during the last 15 yrs had been
     â€œthe lowest of any industrial nation in the world with the exception
     of the United Kingdom.â€
        Dr. Michael Boretsky, Dept. of Commerce analyst, agreed, saying
     that the productivity decline could be attributed in part to the â€œrela-
     tive decline in. the overall rate of the United States technological
     advance.â€ Since the mid-l960s, output per man-hour had been grow-
     ing at half the average rate of the previous 100 yr, while productivity
     gains had been speeding up in other countries. Funds that could
     correct this situation by supporting the development of new tech-
     nology had instead been channeled into social commitments.
        Dr. Ralph Landau, chemical engineer and president of Halcon,
     Inc., said that, because labor costs in the U.S. and leading foreign
     nations were virtually equal, it was no longer advantageous for u.S.
     companies to sell licenses to foreign enterprises to use American
     patents. Instead pressures existed to keep the technology at home,
     creating jobs in the U.S., and to sell US.-made goods abroad.

23 April: NASA marked the 60th anniversary of the first meeting of NASAâ€™s
    predecessor institution, the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
    nautics (NACA) Established by a law signed by President Woodrow
    Wilson 3 March 1915, NACA had 12 presidentially appointed mem-
    bers from the military and scientific communities â€œto supervise and
    direct the scientific study of the problems of flight, with a view to
    their practical solutionâ€ and â€œto direct and conduct research and
    experiments in aeronautics.â€
       During its nearly half-century of operation, NACA was responsible
    for the technical proficiency of U.S. aviation. Early NACA wind-tunnel
    research yielded the unique NACA cowling and wing shapes that would
    dominate aeronautics into the 1940s. NACAâ€™S fundamental research
    and its direct application to industrial, military, and civil aviation
    helped create the worldâ€˜s greatest commercial air transportation net-
    work before World War I1 and the worldâ€™s strongest air forces during
    that conflict. In 1947, it was the NACA-Air Force X-1 aircraft that
    broke the sound barrier.
       The agency had remained small in size and budget through 1939
    when 523 persons worked with $4.5 million in funds. By the mid-1940s the
    staff had grown to 6800 and its budget to an annual $40 million. In
    1958 the National Space Act dissolved NACA, transferring its 8000
    workers and â€œall functions, powers, duties and obligationsâ€ to the
    new National Aeronautics and Space Administration. (NASA Release

  ∞NASA announced the award of a $11-million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract
    to Cutler-Hammer, Inc., AIL Div., for acquisition of the Microwave
    Scanning Beam Landing System ground stations for the Space Shuttle
    Orbiter. AIL would perform the research and development necessary
    to build the ground stations for the Shuttle landing sites. Ground-
    station hardware would be able to transmit localizer and glide slope
    signals to the Orbiter and respond to distance-measurement interro-
    gations from the Orbiter. (JSC Release 75-32)
24 April: NASA announced the award of a $2 376 400 contract to Reinhold
    Construction Co. for phase 2 of the Space Shuttle landing facility,
    including the landing aids control building, Orbiter landing instru-
    mentation facilities, and related communications and utility systems.
    Phase 2 was scheduled for completion by the end of 1976.
       Phase 1, which began in April 1974 as a $21 812 737 contract with
    Morrison Knudsen Co., included construction of the 4570-m-long,
    91-m-wide runway, towway apron, and towway. Site preparation was
    nearing completion and the paving with nearly 200 000 cu m of cement
    would begin in July. Phase 1 was scheduled for completion by the
    summer of 1976. (KSC Release 62-75)
25 April: NASA announced the selection of Sperry Rand Corp. for the
    negotiation of a fixed-price $&million contract for a Space Shuttle
    mission-simulator computer complex at Johnson Space Center.
    Sperry would design, develop, fabricate, test, and deliver a com-
    puting complex and a l associated hardware for the Shuttle mission
                           l

April

28 April: NASA announced the beginning of a broad program of strato-
    spheric research to determine the effects of natural and manmade
    pollutants on the earthâ€™s ozone shield. In a cooperative effort with
    other Federal agencies, universities, and private industry to assess
    the threat posed by Freon, a trade name for gases used as refrigerants
    and in aerosol spray cans, NASA would use high-altitude U-2 aircraft,
    balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites to measure amounts of
    these compounds and their decomposition products already in the
    upper atmosphere. These data combined with data obtained in labora-
    tories would help to determine the validity of predictions of Freon-
    induced ozone depletion in the stratospheric layer. Some scientists
    feared that a serious reduction of the protective ozone and a resulting
    increase in the amount of ultraviolet light striking the earth could in-
    crease the incidence of skin cancer and could change the average tem-
    peratures of the earthâ€˜s atmosphere.
       The NASA program, managed by the Office of Space Science, em-
    phasized basic research needed to understand the physical and
    chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere; this understanding
    was necessary to the assessment of changes caused by human activity.

29 April: NASA was inviting scientists to propose experiments for a 1979
    mission that would fly by Jupiter in 1981and then travel to a mid-1985
    encounter with Uranus. Although the mission was not yet approved,
    NASA officials wanted to select flight investigations early to initiate
    necessary science planning and development. (NASA Release 75 -127)
30 April: The fiist set of wings for NASAâ€™sSpace Shuttle Orbiter began an
    18-day land and water journey from Grumman Aerospace Corp.â€™~
    facility in New York to Palmdale, Calif., for final assembly with the
    Orbiter. The two wing panels, each 9 m long from tip to fuselage and
    18 m wide at the fuselage edge, would travel aboard transporters spe-
    cially designed to be pulled by a truck-at 16 km per h r - o r loaded
    onto an ocean-going container ship. From New York the wings would
    make a 13-day trip through the Panama Canal to Long Beach, Calif.,
    and then travel overland to Palmdale.
       The double-delta aluminum wings had been designed, manufac-
    tured, and tested by Grumman under a $40 million subcontract
    awarded by the prime Space Shuttle contractor, Rockwell Interna-
    tional Corp., in March 1973. (JSC Release 75-38)

    ciate Administrator, to be Acting Associate Administrator until a
    replacement was named for Dr. Rocco A. Petrone. (NASA anno, 30

During April: Soviet spending for research and development had risen
    50% between 1968 and 1973, representing an increase of from 2.5% to
    3.8% of the Soviet gross national product, the Air Forces Journal
    International quoted a Dept. of Commerce report as saying. During
    the same period, outlays for U.S. R&D had fallen from 3% to 2.4% of
    the GNP. The number of Soviet scientists and engineers working in
    R&D functions nearly doubled in the period, from 594 000 to 1069 000;
    by contrast, the U.S. tec6nological pool had risen from 454 000 to
    531 000. The growth stemmed from a Soviet decision, announced in
    1968, to increase Soviet expenditures for science and technology by
    more than 60%. The report estimated that 90% of the Soviet technical

    seas. Researchers from NASA, the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S.
    Army, U.S. Navy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
    tion, and several Canadian agencies hoped to find methods of meas-
    uring critical changes in the Arctic environment that would help
    environmentalists find out how best to manage Arctic resources.
       A major objective of the program was an experiment-called the
    AIDEX, the Arctic Ice Dynamics Joint Experiment-to investigate the
    relationship among ice motion, weather, and ocean conditions.
    Combined data from aircraft- and ground-based investigations would
    be used to interpret satellite data obtained at the same time.
       BESMEX, the Bering Sea Marine Mammal Experiment, would study
    the migration patterns of marine mammals and the relationship be-
    tween mammal population, migration, and sea-ice conditions.
       In a third experiment, scientists would measure microwave emis-
    sion characteristics of polar ice, hoping to find a key to global monitor-
    ing of ice distribution by climate and size. This information would aid
    in predicting the survival rate of offshore drilling rigs. (ARC Release
    75-11)
  ∞Goddard Space Flight Center awarded a $20 000 research grant to the
    University of Florida to establish the feasibility of the electromagnetic
    wave energy-conversion (EWEC) concept. The EWEC converter used
    electromagnetic antennas to absorb the sunâ€™s electromagnetic radia-
    tion into an array of insulated components and then convert it directly
    to electricity. The absorber operated similarly to insect antennae and
    the retina of the eye: Insects communicated by the reception of in-
    frared and other electromagnetic radiation or energy, using their
    antennae tuned to the proper frequency by natureâ€™s design. Once
    received, the energy was converted into electrical impulses. (NASA

During April - May: NASA conducted Atmospheric Variability Experi-
    ment IV and Atmospheric Variability Severe Storms Experiments I
    and I1 in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, Army, National Weath-
    er Service, and several universities. Coordinating data collected over
    the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. by satellites, aircraft, radar, and
    weather balloons, participants hoped to develop new techniques for
    predicting where and when tornadoes might strike. The data col-
    lected, including information on thunderstorms, updrafts, and wind
    and cloud data, would be compared with ground-truth observations to
    determine the relationship between severe storms and their en-
    vironment. Participating in the experiments were 41 radiosonde sta-
    tions, 18 radar stations, 7 instrumented aircraft, and 5 meteorological
    satellites. (MSFC Release 75 -102)

                                 Oao
      (named Copernicus and launched 21 Aug. 1972) was observing three
      nearby stars---epsilon Eridani, tau Ceti, and epsilon Indi-for signs of
      other civilizations that might be trying to contact earth with laser
      beams.
         The telescope had scanned the first star in November 1974 for 14
      orbits while the spectrometer scanned the ultraviolet spectrum for
      potential laser signals to earth. The data were being analyzed and
      scientists were planning to scan tau Ceti and epsilon Indi again during
      the summer and fall of 1975. (NASA Release 75-130)

      and other analytical methods, FRC announced. The comparisons
      would be used to update prediction techniques required for the design
      of future highly maneuverable aircraft. During the 25 flight hrs, pilots
      would measure performance and stability at high angles of attack at
      both high and low altitudes, and perform maneuverability tests and

    ∞An overactive sun and excessively bright moon had caused brief shut-
0
      downs of instruments aboard Intelsat (International Telecommunica-
      tions Satellite) communications satellites, the New York Times re-
      ported. Showers of particles during solar flares on 11 March and 13
      Oct. 1974 had built up excess electrical charges on satellite surfaces
      that had not been electrically grounded. Noise from the resulting
      electrical discharges confused readings of which way onboard anten-
      nas were pointing, causing the antennas to point away from the earth
      and temporarily cut off communications.

       A similar problem occurred 27 March when a spinning comsat inter-
    preted infrared light from an exceptionally bright moon as coming
    from earth. Because of this, the satelliteâ€™s controls were receiving an
    earth indication twice as often as usual, thus commanding the
    pointing system to compensate by despinning at twice its normal rate.
    Communications were blacked out because the antennas were spin-
    ning relative to the earth rather than remaining stationary and point-
    ing toward earth.
       The NYT quoted Communications Satellite Corp. engineers as
    saying that these occurrences pointed out the need for more knowl-
    edge about the exact behavior of Intelsat satellites in space so that
    changes could be made in the design of future satellites. The solar-
    particle problem had led to more thorough electrical grounding aboard
    the newest Intelsat satellites. (McElheny, NYT, 1 May 75, 83)
2 May: Dr. John F. Clark, Director of Goddard Space Flight Center, and

    Trophy for individual accomplishment in making the Landsat-
    formerly the Earth Resources Technology Satellite-program              the
    outstanding aerospace event of 1974. The presentation was made at a
    dinner in Washington, D.C., jointly sponsored by the NAA and the
    National Aviation Club. Choice of the two officials as representative
    of the NASA-industry team â€œwhich abundantly proved during 1974 the
    value of remote sensing to spaceâ€ was the unanimous decision of the
    selection committee of 26 distinguished leaders and authorities. The
    committee also paid particular tribute to Hughes Aircraft Co.â€™s
    Aerospace Group and RCAâ€™SGovernment and Commercial Systems
    Group for their roles in the earth-resources and environmental
    surveys by Landsat. (NAA Release, 6 March 75; NASA Activities, April

∞President Ford presented the Harmon Aviation Awards, given â‚¬or out-
    standing feats of individual pilot skill, worthy of international recogni-
    tion, and contributing to the art and science of flight.
       The 1974 Astronautsâ€™ Trophy was awarded to the Skylab 2 crew
    who, during their 25 May to 23 June 1973 mission, became the first
    astronauts to successfully accomplish major repairs on a spacecraft in
    space. Skylab 2 commander Charles Conrad, Jr., accepted the award
    on behalf of himself and crewmembers Paul J. Weitz and Joseph P.
    Kerwin.
       President Ford presented the 1974 Aeronautsâ€™ Trophy to the son
    of Malcolm S. Forbes for the latterâ€™s series-of 21 flights in a hot-air
    balloon that took him 4000 km across the U.S. from Coos Bay, Ore.,
    to Gwynn Island, Va.
       The 1974 Aviatorsâ€™ Trophy went to Col. Edward J. Nash, Deputy
    Chief of Staff for Operations of the 21st Air Force, for his 21 000-km
    round-trip airlift mission in a C -5 aircraft from the U.S. to Israel, and
    for his direction of continuous C-5 and C-141 operations from the
    U.S. to the Azores and on to Israel between 14 Oct. and 14 Nov. 1973.
       The 1973 Aviatorsâ€™ Trophy was awarded to L/C Edgar L. Allison for
    piloting an HC-130H aircraft of the Air Force 57th Aerospace
    Rescue and Recovery Squadron nonstop on 20 Feb. 1972 from Taiwan
    to Scott Air Force Base, Ill., a distance of 14 053 km, without
    refueling. This established a record for the longest straight-line non-
    stop flight in a turboprop aircraft. (PD, 5 May 75, 480-481)

     development was reduced to $704 600 OOO, leaving NASA management
     to apportion the $26 million reduction. The committee reduced funds

    ∞The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was â€œone of the few tangible survivors of
0
     that champagne-bubble atmosphere of detente along with the badly
     tarnished SALT [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] agreements,â€ Avi-
     ation Week and Space Technology said in an editorial. From the Soviet
     viewpoint the goals were obvious: to tap into the mainstream of u.S.
     technology, to blur the international image of u.S. superiority with the
     appearance of parity by flying a joint manned mission, and to develop
     the technical base for international space rescue capability. U.S.
     goals remained obscure. The mission would provide the answers to
     some experimental questions: Could the U.S. and U.S.S.R. work to-
      gether in a joint space program? Could an international rescue capa-
      bility be developed? Could the ASTP experience be expanded to future
     joint space ventures?
        That ASTP had survived to the final countdown was a tribute to the
     flexibility, stamina, and in enuity of the technical working groups of
     both countries. A formifable series of technical, philosophical,
     linguistic, and operational problems had been solved and the invest-
     ment by both countries had been substantial.
                                                                          ..
         ASTP had been â€œpartially worth the effort. to have a sizable group
      of NASA and industry technicians get some practical hard-headed
      experience in working with their Soviet counterparts and acquiring a
      realistic view of their technical capabilities and philosophy. We think
      the rest of the value of the mission will come from determining just

5-22 May: Representatives from the five Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
     Working Groups, including 55 NASA employees, met in Moscow to
     conclude preparations for the scheduled 15 July launch date. P r of
                                                                       at
     the U.S. contingent left for the Soviet Union on 5 May and the final
     group, led by NASA Deputy Administrator George M. Low, departed
     16 May.
        U.S. communications equipment checkout and docking target
     alignment tests were completed at the Baykonur cosmodrome by mid-
     May, in time for Dr. Low and a group of NASA officials to take an
     inspection and orientation tour of the cosmodrome. The group visited
     the launch pad from which the ASTP Soyuz spacecraft would be
     launched and the Soviet equivalent of Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s
     Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) where the group inspected the prime
     launch vehicle and prime backup Soyuz spacecraft.
        At the 22 May flight readiness review (FRR) chaired by Dr. Low and
     Vladimir A. Kotelnikov, acting president of the Soviet Academy of
     Sciences replacing the ailing Mstislav V. Keldysh, Soviet and U.S.
     space officials signed the report indicating that the â€œApollo-Soyuz
     Test Project was proceeding in accordance with the agreed schedule
     and ready to proceed toward the launching planned for July 15,1975.â€
        Before the signing, U.S. ASTP Technical Director Glynn S. Lunney
      and his Soviet counterpart Konstantin D. Bushuyev gave a 5-hr review
     of the technical histories of their respective spacecraft. Reporting
     that no major problems remained, Lunney and Bushuyev said that 133
     documents had been negotiated and signed and only the postflight
      review remained to be prepared.
        Working Group chairmen made their final presentations indicating
     that all major tasks had been completed. (NASA Release 75 -156; Ezell

   ∞Detente, while relaxing tension between the U.S. and Soviet Union, had
      produced â€˜ba technology drain from the United States to the Soviet
      Union that has cost the United States millions of dollars, thousands of
     jobs and some valuable scientific secrets,â€ Jack Anderson and Les
      Whitten reported in a Washington Post article. Soviet technology,
      which lagged years behind the US. in fields including computers and
      space science, had little to offer and much to gain from the techno-
      logical exchange. With official government encouragement U.S. firms
      had exported or were planning to export millions of dollars worth of
      technical information and products including aircraft and advanced
      computers.
        Anderson and Whitten reported that the Soviets often put finished
      products to military use. They were using detente and some advanced
     U.S. computers to catch up in their 10-yr lag behind the U.S. in
     computer science, a key to the USâ€™S overall technological superi-

    ority. One u.S. firm, Control Data Corp., had signed preliminary
    agreements to help the Soviet Union build plants to manufacture
    computers and peripheral equipment.
       The Soviets were also eager to catch up with the U.S. in the produc-
    tion of wide-bodied jets. Holding out possible contracts, the U.S.S.R.
   had obtained detailed plans for wide-bodied jets from Boeing Co.,
   Lockheed Aircraft Corp., and McDonnell Douglas Corp. (Anderson

   press delegation visiting Nanking Observatory. The press quoted the
   Chinese as saying that the planets, observed in January, were rarely
   visible because of their position in the solar system. The Chinese had
   named the planets Purple Mountain One and Purple Mountain Two,
   for the name of the mountain on which the Nanking Observatory was
   located. (Reuter, W Post, 7 May 75)
∞Rockwell International Corp., holder of the prime contract with NASA to
   build the Space Shuttle Orbiter, announced that more than $109 mil-
   lion in subcontracts for the Space Shuttle main engine had been
   awarded by the Rocketdyne Div. since work on the engine began 3
   yr ago. Figures to date showed that firms in 4 states were participat-

   without charge in 1979. Canada would also supply flight units for
   follow-on Orbiters. Costs for these units would not include charges
   for Canada's research and development. (NASA Release 75-135)
7 May: An Italian launch crew launched Explorer 53 @AS-C) Small
   Astronomy Satellite for NASA from San Marco launch platform,
   located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Kenya, at 6:45 pm EDT
   (1:45 am local time 8 May) on a Scout launch vehicle. The spacecraft
   entered near-equatorial orbit with a 523.35-km apogee, 502.18-km
    perigee, 94.88-min period, and 2.995" inclination.
       Primary objectives of the Explorer 53 mission were to measure the
   x-ray emission of discrete extragalactic sources, to monitor the
   intensity and spectra of galactic x-ray sources from 1.0 kev to 50 kev,
   and to monitor the x-ray intensity of the star Sco X- 1.
       During a preliminary in-orbit checkout, controllers noticed that a
   stuck nutation damper was causing the spacecraft nutation, or
   coning, angle to be 4" rather than the planned 0.2". Energizing the z-
   axis coil reduced the coning angle to 0.5". Although the damper could
   not be freed despite repeated attempts, the nutation could be kept
   within reasonable limits so that scientific objectives could be
   achieved. A committee would evaluate the problem.
       Other spacecraft anomalies included intermittent operation of the
   spinning digital solar-aspect detector, and irregular and noisy opera-
   tion of the spacecraft star sensor. Neither problem was expected to
   seriously degrade the mission.

        The 195-kg satellite was designed to extend and complement the
      capabilities of Explorer 42 (Uhum, launched 12 Dec. 1970 as the first
      satellite dedicated entirely to the study of x-ray sources in space) and
     Explorer 48 (launched 16 Nov. 1970 to study galactic and extragalactic
      gamma radiation). Explorer 53, with its broad spectral range, provided
     higher energy resolution than previous satellites and permitted a study
     of physical conditions near an x-ray source. The spacecraftâ€™s quasi-
     three-axis stabilization system allowed much longer continuous
     observation of sources. Data from Explorer 53 would provide the basis
     for the more detailed x-ray studies to be made by High Energy Astron-
     omy Observatories A and B scheduled for launch in 1977 and 1978.
        The experiment aboard Explorer 53 was designed and built by the
     Center for Space Research of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
     nology. The spacecraft control section was designed by the Applied
      Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins Univ. Goddard Space Flight
      Center managed the program for the Office of Space Science. Langley
     Research Center was responsible for the Scout launch vehicle. Italy
     was responsible for the assembly, checkout, and launch of the Scout
     on a cost-reimbursable basis. (NASAMORS 6 May 75â€™15 May 75; NASA

    ∞Canadaâ€™s Anik 3 (Telesat- 3) domestic communications satellite was

     launched by NASA at 7:35 pm EDT from Eastern Test Range on a three-
     stage thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. Originally sched-
     uled for March, the launch had been postponed because of a strike by
     McDonnell Douglas Corp. workers [see 10 Feb.1. The satellite was
     placed in the planned highly elliptical transfer orbit with a 35 945-km
     apogee, 231.4-km perigee, 634.3-min period, and 24.75â€™ inclination.
     Ground control fired the spacecraftâ€™s apogee kick motor at 1:30 pm
     EDT on 10 May, circularizing the geosynchronous orbit at 38 000 km;
     the spacecraft was drifting toward its final operational location at
     approximately 104â€™ west longitude.
        Anik (Eskimo word for brother) 3 was third in a series of Canadian
     domestic comsats; Anik 1 (launched 9 Nov. 1972) andAnik2 (launched
     20 April 1973) were operating at 114â€™ and 109â€ west longitude, pro-
     viding TV and telephone service to the most remote areas of Canada.
      Built by Hughes Aircraft Co., Anik 3 was 1.8 m in diameter and 3.3 m
     high, weighing 544 kg at launch and 272 kg in orbit. With power from
     23 000 solar cells and enough battery capacity to maintain full service
     during a solar eclipse. Anik had 13 channels that could transmit up to
      10 color TV transmissions or 9400 telephone circuits or analog or
     digital data.
        The NASA- Telesat Canada contract defined the NASA mission
     objective as the placement of the satellite in a synchronous transfer
     orbit of sufficient accuracy to allow onboard propulsion systems to
     place the spacecraft into a stationary orbit with enough residual
     stationkeeping propulsion to meet mission-lifetime requirements.
     This objective was met and the mission was adjudged successful on 20
     May.
        NASA would be reimbursed for launch hardware, services, and DOD
     range support. The project was managed by Goddard Space Flight
     Center under the direction of the NASA Office of Space Science. (NASA

    ∞NASA, in cooperation with the Dept. of Transportation, was investigating
0
     aircraft wake vortices-turbulent air trailing from an aircraftâ€™s wing-
     tips and swirling at velocities up to half the flight speed of the aircraft.
     Safety required an aircraft to travel far enough behind a preceding
     airplane to permit the vortices to dissipate, adding to congestion at
     already busy airports. NASAâ€™s     objective was to develop methods to
     reduce the intensity of the vortices and render them harmless 3 km
     behind the aircraft. This would decrease the amount of fuel wasted
     and the pollution produced when aircraft were subjected to holding
     patterns and waits to taxi to a runway, and would permit aircraft to
     land and take off at a faster rate.
        Engineers and scientists at Ames and Flight Research Centers
     were investigating the vortices by flying an instrumented Learjet and
     a T-37 jet trainer through wakes created by larger aircraft. Data
     collected during these flights, checked against wind-tunnel data,
     suggested several possible ways of alleviating the wake-vortex prob-
     lem, including tailoring the lift across the aircraft wings, modifying
     engine placement, and adding wing spoilers and drag devices. (NASA

8 May: A new antireflection-coated metal oxide semiconductor (AMOS)
     solar cell developed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists might
     have potential use in the nationâ€™s solar energy program, JPL scientist
     Richard J. Stern reported at a Photovoltaic Specialists Conference in
     Phoenix. The solar cells, made from oxidized galliumâ€™arsenide with an
     extremely thin nearly transparent film of gold on the surface, had
     demonstrated an efficiency of about 15% in terrestrial sunlight, better
     than the average silicon solar cell now in standard use. The new cell
     also had superior resistance to radiation, promising a longer lifetime
     in space. Dr. Stern said that the technology was potentially adaptable
     to very low-cost polycrystalline thin fiims, with only a modest reduc-
     tion in efficiency. (NASA Release 75- 133)

                  d
    space center uring a tour of the main Soviet flight-control center 24
    km from Moscow. The WashingtonPost reported that the group led by
    the centerâ€™s technical director, Dr. Alberty V. Militsin, toured a 5-yr-
    old six-story brick and sandstone building acknowledged by Dr.
    Militsin to be one of several space facilities near Moscow. The
    operations room, which was similar to the control room at Johnson
    Space Center, contained five rows of consoles, each with telephones
    and closed-circuit TV screens. Mission Control Director Aleksey S.
    Yeliseyev told the newsmen that the consoles were staffed during
    missions by from 15 to 24 officials and technicians. An illumi-
    nated world map on the wall showed tracking stations and the orbital
    paths of spacecraft. Electronic screens flashed flight information.
    Other support consoles, communications systems, and computers
    were located elsewhere in the building.
        Dr. Militsin said that the center had contact with Soyuz spacecraft
    i n s a c h orbit for 5 to 25 min, depending on the orbit.

∞Rockwell International Corp. Space Div. announced the award of an
    estimated $1 million subcontract to the United Technologies Corp.
    Hamilton Standard Div. to build the flash evaporator subsystem, a
    part of the Space Shuttle Orbiterâ€™s environmental control and life-
    support system. The evaporator would use excess heat generated by
    Orbiter subsystems to turn water from the spacecraftâ€™s three power-
    producing fuel cells into steam vented into space, handling as much as
    60 kg of water per hr. (United Aircraft became UTC in May.)
        Rockwell held the prime contract with NASA to build the Orbiter and
    integrate the complete Space Shuttle system. The evaporator sub-
    system contract was the third of three contracts totaling more than $27
    million awarded to Hamilton. Under previously awarded subcon-
    tracts, Hamilton was also developing the Orbiterâ€™s atmospheric
    revitalization subsystem, Freon coolant loop, water boiler hydraulic
    thermal-control unit, and ground-support equipment hydraulic oart.

13 May: The Air Force Systems Command reported that researchers at
    the Air Force Avionics Laboratory were testing fiber optics-thin
    strands of glass that transmit light-to transmit avionic signals from
    one point to another in an aircraft. Fiber-optics data transfer began
    with an electronic signal that was converted into light by a transducer;
    the light traveled through glass strands and was reconverted at the
    other end into electrical signals, with minimal loss of energy. AFSC
    quoted Avionics Lab researchers as saying that, unlike the usual
    copper wire, fiber optics were unaffected by static from nearby elec-
    trical equipment and were immune to lightning, nuclear radiation,
    electrical sparking, fires, and grounding problems. Because extensive
    lab testing was nearly complete, the next step would be a low-cost
    flight-test program, perhaps on a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV).
        The Avionics Lab also had awarded contracts to develop passive
    optical couplers, a fiber-optics data bus, and a wideband fiber-optics
    system that would handle large data rates. The proposed Air Force
    Advanced Development Program could put a total fiber-optics system

13-14 May: More than 500 representatives from government, industry,
      and universities attended a 2-day conference at Lewis Research
      Center to review progress in aerospace propulsion. Aviation Week
     and Space Technology reported that high-speed performance was no
     longer the top priority among the propulsion researchers, emphasis
     having switched to quiet, clean, and fuel-conserving engines. Presen-
     tations and panel discussions included aircraft noise-reduction
     technology, fuel-conservative engine technology, upper-atmosphere
     pollution-measurement programs, and engine systems and compo-
     nent technology.
         LeRCâ€™s John B. Whitlow reported that new technology generated
     by NASAâ€™s    supersonic cruise airplane research (SCAR) would develop
     an engine far different from the afterburning supersonic turbojet that
     was to have powered the first U.S. supersonic transport. A potential
     new engine might be a duct-burning turbofan with features such as a
     variable-geometry fan that allowed the engine to move as much as
      possible between straight turbojet and straight turbofan operational
     cycles. Other objectives for future NASA-developed SST propulsion
      systems included a 7400-km range with outstanding economy at
      speeds from mach 2.2 to mach 2.7, good subsonic cruise character-
     istics, good hold endurance and economy, and low takeoff noise.
         Whitlow stressed that, because of noise limitations, future SSTs
      would not be straight turbojets, and SCAR researchers were con-
     centrating on low-bypass-ratio turbofans. As bypass ratio also affects
     engine weight, fuel consumption, drag, and cost-effective perform-
     ance, no single bypass ratio of a conventional engine could meet
      all desired goals simultaneously. Thus SCAR researchers were devel-
     oping variable-cycle engine technology that could tailor the bypass
     ratio and perhaps the fadpressure ratio for optimum performance.
      Candidate engines included a mini-bypass turbojet, a variable-bypass
      supersonic turbofan, a duct-burning turbofan, and a rear-valve
     variable-cycle engine. (LeRC Release 75- 19; Yaffee, Av Wk,14 July

    25.5 hr into the simulated mission. With both Soviet and US. crew-
    men participating in simulators in their respective countries and con-
    trol centers fully manned, the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft were
    â€œlaunchedâ€ and put through various maneuvers. Communications
    between the two control centers included voice, teletype, datafax, and
    TV. During the simulation, a technical problem prevented observers
    in Houston from hearing the two Soviet cosmonauts; NASA officials
    said later that that problem should not happen during a real flight. No
    other major problems were reported.
       A second simulation begun at 6:30 am CDT 15 May and continuing
    for 56 hr rehearsed Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, docking, crew trans-
    fers, and undocking and final separation. A third simulation, begun at
    6:30 am CDT 19 May, was cancelled when the command module
    simulator in Houston did not work properly. The simulation, a 9-hr
    rehearsal of rendezvous and docking, was successfully completed 20
    May.
       Final simulations by Houston and Moscow control centers and

14 May: The U.S.S.R.â€™s Baykonur cosmodrome, located in the city of
    Leninsk near Tyuratam, was three to four times as big as Kennedy
    Space Center, U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project commander Thomas
    P. Stafford said at an ASTP press briefing at Johnson Space Center.
    ASTP astronaut Vance D. Brand said that 50 000 persons inhabited the
    launch complex. The briefing followed the crewâ€™s return from the
    Soviet Union where they had participated in the final training session
    before the scheduled July launch [see 14- 30 April].
       The astronauts said that at the Soviet spaceport they had been
    shown â€œeverything we had a requirement to see,â€ the launch pad,
    spacecraft, test and checkout facilities, automatic checkout equip-
    ment (ACE) rooms, and crew quarters. The one â€œdrastic differenceâ€
     between the tour received by the Soviet cosmonauts in the U.S. and
    that of the American astronauts in the U.S.S.R., said Stafford, was
     â€œwe didnâ€™t go to Disneyland over there.â€
        Astronaut Donald K. Slayton described the launch pad as â€œrel-
     atively simple.â€ The spacecraft, assembled on top of a railroad car,
    was hauled to the pad about 4 days before launch. The stacked vehicle
    was jacked up and set on the pad; after checkout, the vehicle was
   rotated to the proper launch azimuth. The booster was held to the pad
    by four support arms which were popped out of the way by
    counterweights once the vehicle started to move.
        Stafford said that Leninsk was a new city built in a desert. The
    continued construction activity indicated that the Soviets â€œare not
    slowing down orie bit in their space program.â€ The Soviets had told
     their U.S. counterparts that they would continue to have several
    manned flights a year operating in low earth orbit. (Transcript)

15-16 May: u.S. and European scientists met at a Goddard Space Flight
    Center symposium to discuss the importance of a never-before-flown
    space mission out of the ecliptic plane, the pancake-like plane in
    which all planets orbit the sun. Symposium chairman Dr. Leonard
    A. Fisk said, â€œA view of the solar cavity [the region dominated by
    the sun through the flow of the solar wind] from outside the ecliptic
    plane is expected to expand greatly manâ€™s knowledge of inter-
    planetary physics, solar physics, and plasma processes in the
    universe. To place a spacecraft in such an orbit brings expecta-
    tions that we will witness new and exciting phenomena that we could
    neither observe nor predict from our present vantage point in the
    ecliptic plane.â€
       The scientists agreed that the missions under consideration could

18 May: Equipment aboard U.S. reconnaissance satellites could photo-
    graph a pack of cigarettes or monitor a radio conversation between
    foreign pilots from an orbit of 130 km, the Philadelphia Inquirer
    reported. Satellites could also instantly detect the launch of an inter-
    continental ballistic missile and determine where it was going.
       Early reconnaissance satellites were of two types: SAMOS (satel-
    lite and missile observation system) satellites carried wide-area
    cameras to determine ground targets of interest; film was processed
    on board and imagery radioed to ground. Discoverer satellites from
    lower orbits used high-resolution cameras for closeups; the satellite
    ejected its film, which parachuted down for midair recovery by Air
    Force aircraft.
       These satellites were replaced, in the 1970s, by the 1 340-kg
                                                                  1

20 May: NASAâ€™s 6 Applications Technology Satellite (launched 30 May
                 Ats
     1974 into geosynchronous orbit) began a 6-wk move from its position
     35 900 km over the Pacific Ocean west of the Galapagos Islands to a
     new location above Lake Victoria in eastern Africa. The satellite,
     which was expected to reach its new location by 1 July, would be
     checked out in time to participate in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in
     mid-July. During that mission Ats 6 would track the Apollo and Soyuz
     spacecraft and relay TV and data from the two spacecraft to earth,
     marking the first time a satellite had been used to relay TV from a
     manned spacecraft.
       The new location also would bring Ats 6 within range of India for
    the 1-yr Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)
     scheduled to begin 1 Aug. During the experiment-a cooperative
    effort by NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization-the
    Indian government would relay daily educational TV programs to 5000
     villages and cities throughout India. After the experiment, the
     satellite would be moved back to a position within range of the U.S.,
    where it would be used for further experimentation. (NASA Release

    scientists were studying changes in human body weights and sizes as
    part of a NASA-requested anthropometric study to help engineers
    design cockpits and crew stations for future use. NASA engineers who
    wanted to lay out the Space Shuttle work station were concerned that
    body sizes of the pilots might change before the station was used. The
    scientists performing the study, using both current data and data that
    went back as far as the Civil War, estimated that in 1985 a pilot would
    average nearly 2 kg heavier and 1.5 cm taller than in 1967, when he
    had weighed 78.5 kg and was 177 cm tall.
       In addition to statistics, NASA requested drawing board manikins
    for designing the Shuttleâ€™s work areas. The study had produced two 2-
    dimensional manikins like cardboard dolls with movable joints; each
    manikin was articulated in nine places to represent typical ranges of
    body movement. A 95% manikin represented a person 189.0 cm tall; a
    5% manikin, representing a 168.3-cm astronaut or pilot, was designed
    so that only 5% of the 1985 pilot-astronaut population would be
    smaller. An engineer using both manikins could design a crew station
    or cockpit that would accommodate 90% of all astronauts and pilots.

24 May-26 July: The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 18, carrying cosmonauts
    Pyotr Klimuk and Vitaly Sevastyanov, from Baykonur cosmodrome at
    7:58 pm local time (10:58 amI?DT).According to the Tass news agency,
    the spacecraft entered orbit with a 247-km apogee, 193-km perigee,
    88.6-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination. Tass announced that the
    purpose of the mission was â€œto conduct further experiments with the
    orbital research station â€˜Salyut-4,â€™ started on January 12, during the
    joint flight of the delivery spaceship â€˜Soyuz-17â€™ and the station
    â€˜Salyut-4â€™ as well as to test individual elements and systems of the
    spaceship in various modes of flight.â€
       During the first day in orbit Klimuk and Sevastyanov checked out
    essential spacecraft and life-support systems and prepared for orbital
    maneuvering. The crew switched on the main engines twice on 25 May
    to raise the spacecraftâ€™s orbit in preparation for rendezvous and dock-
    ing withsalyut 4 . On 26 May Soyuz 18 approached the station by an
    automatic control system. At a distance of 100 km the crew took over
    control and manually docked the spacecraft with the Salyut 4 station
    in pitch darkness. After docking, the crew switched on the stationâ€™s
    lights and began activation and checkout of the onboard systems. The
    crew transferred equipment and boarded the station where they found
    a â€œWelcome to our common homeâ€ sign left by the stationâ€™s previous
    tenants, Soyuz 17 cosmonauts Aleksey Gubarev and Georgy Grechko.
    The cosmonauts reported that all systems were operating normally
    and that they themselves were in good health. By 28 May the station
    and spacecraft were in an orbit with a 349-km apogee, 338-km peri-
    gee, 91.4-min period, and 51.6â€ inclination.
       During their 63 days in orbit, the cosmonauts studied the sun,
    planets, and stars in various bands of the spectrum of electromagnetic
    radiation using several x-ray telescopes, including one called â€œFilinâ€;
    investigated geological-morphologicalobjects on the earthâ€™s surface,
    photographing the U.S.S.R. in the medium and southern latitudes;
    studied physical processes in the earthâ€˜s atmosphere and in space;
    performed medical and biological research with particular emphasis

     an important role in the peaceful uses of outer space; the programs of
     ESRO-ESA offered a particularly well chosen range of satellites for
     research and applications.
        Y. Demerliac, Secretary General of Eurospace-Groupement In-
     dustriel Europken Dâ€™Etudes Spatiales-reminded the audience that
     since 1962 Europe had developed 43 satellites, including four com-
     munications satellites. In addition, European industry had built 36 of
     the 104 ground stations or antennas in the network of the International
     Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT). More than
     two-thirds of these had been sold to non-European countries.
        Director General of ESRO Roy Gibson (United Kingdom) said the
     creation of ESA was of more significance than a mere change in name:
     the convention of the new agency gave it a specific mandate to work
     toward a rationalization of Europeâ€™s space program which its pre-
     decessors ESRO and ELDO (European Launcher Development Organi-
     zation) did not have. He hoped that the 3-day presentation of ESRO-
     ESA and other European programs would give the visitors an impres-
     sion of the total competence and capability of Europeâ€™s up-to-date,
     rather dispersed space effort. (ESRO Release 28 Ma 75)

29 May: Lewis Research Center was testing a version o an ion-thruster
     engine with reduced propellant requirements that would permit pay-
     load increases of up to 20% on future spacecraft, NASA announced.
     The ion-thruster propulsion system used solar cells to convert solar
     energy into electrical power, tailored to the current and voltage neces-
     sary for the ion thruster. The propellant-mercury, cesium, or rela-
     tively stable gas-was ionized in the engine and electrically exhausted
     to produce thrust.
        During the tests the NASA version of the engine had become the
     first electric propulsion system to exceed 10 000 hr of operation. LeRC
     was continuing the testing toward an endurance goal of 15 000 hr.
     The engine was the second of its kind to be tested by NASA. The first
     had experienced internal sputtering and erosion which had degraded
     performance. Testing had been stopped at 9715 hr for modifications.

∞A team of Federal and university scientists were using three instru-
    mented aircraft and an elaborate ground network to construct a three-
    dimensional map of the atmosphereâ€™s electrical fields around Kennedy
    Space Center and to determine the conditions under which a launch
    penetrating these fields would trigger a lightning strike. By July the
    team hoped to be able to predict what the electrical conditions would
    be at the launch pad 10 to 20 min before liftoff. The project, directed
    by the Dept. of Commerceâ€™s Environmental Research Laboratories
    and furided by NASA, included scientists from NASA, National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration, Naval Research Laboratory, N.
    Mex. Inst. of Mining and Technology, and Univ. of Ariz. The experi-
    menters would conduct a month of aircraft flights under and around
    various convective clouds, measuring electrical fields and making
    penetrations of frozen cloud anvils-cirrus clouds swept off the tops of
    thunderstorms by upper level winds. In addition, data from the
    mapping ground network-24 electrical-field-measuring stations
    installed around KSC by NOAA in 1973-were fed into a computer
    whose video component displayed a map of the area and ground
    stations, total electrical activity in nearby storms, weather radar con-
    tours of precipitation, electrical-field contours, and the positions of
    lightning strikes.
       The project was a continuation of one begun for NASA by N O M after
    the Apollo 12 launch on 12 Nov. 1969 when lightning struck the
    spacecraft, shutting off the spacecraftâ€™s electrical power and setting
    off numerous alarms. The spacecraft automatically switched to back-
    up battery power while the crew restored the primary power system.

∞Scientists believed that light flashes observed by Skylab 4 crew mem-
    bers during their 16 Nov. 1973 to 8 Feb. 1974 mission as they flew
    through the South Atlantic Anomaly-a slight asym etry in the

    earthâ€™s magnetic field where the Van Allen radiation be t dipped un-
    usually low over Brazil-were         a previously unsuspected form of
    radiation, Science magazine reported. The radiation seemed to con-
    sist of atomic nuclei heavier than hydrogen which, when stripped of
    electrons, would carry multiple positive electric charges.
       The astronauts had seen the flashes when the spacecraft cabin
    was dark and they were preparing for sleep. Scientists suspected
    that the flashes were stimulated within the retina of the eye by the
    high-energy cosmic-ray particles. Normally earth was shielded from
    cosmic rays by the magnetic field, but strong penetrating cosmic rays
    could reach as far into the field as the Skylab orbit.
       Because the magnetic-field shielding of the earth weakened toward
    the geomagnetic poles, it was possible to predict variations in cosmic-
    ray exposure as Skylab moved away from the poles. During two test
    periods, light-flash observations of Astronaut William R. Pogue
    showed a close correlation with exposure variations. (Pinsky et al.,

30-31 May: The Convention of the new European Space Agency was
    formally adopted and opened for signing at a conference of plenipo-
    tentiaries held 30 May in Paris and resided over by French Minister
    of Industry and Research Michel 30rnano. Under the terms of the
    Convention, ESA came into de facto operation 31 May. The conven-

    Space Research Organization-Belgium,         Denmark, France, West
    Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
    United Kingdom-and would remain open for signature by other
    countries until 31 Dec. 1975. Ireland, which had had observer status

30 May-8 June: The 31st Annual Paris Air Show was held at Le Bourget
    Airport in France. New restrictions on flight demonstrations by high-
    performance aircraft, imposed by the French government after the
    1973 Air Show crash of the Soviet Tu-144 supersonic transport, had
    placed the showâ€™s emphasis on displays of the latest aerospace hard-
    ware and technology from throughout the world. Aviation Week and
    Space Technology reported that the general turndown in the economy
    throughout the western world had caused a decline of 20% in exhibitors
    from the 1973 show.
       France emphasized the cooperative nature of its major programs,
    displaying the French-British Concorde SST, the French-German
    Alpha Jet trainer-attack aircraft, the French-British Jaguar close-
    air support aircraft, and the multinational A-300B twin-engine wide-
    body transport.
       The U.S. pavilion reflected the changing environment at the show,
    reserving 66% of its floor space for company exhibits restricted to
    industry visitors; the remaining 33% contained exhibits open to the
    general public. In 1973 60% was exhibitor space and 40% for the
    general public.
       Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. displayed aircraft that
    were potential replacements for the Boeing 707 and McDonnell DC- 8
    on commercial airlines. The Boeing aircraft, a three-engine member
    of the 7x7 family, incorporated the NASA-developed supercritical
    wing.
       â€œBlue Planetâ€ was the theme of the public section of the U.S. pavil-
    ion which emphasized technological fallout and practical uses on
    earth of space technology. Included were full-scale models of the
    Viking spacecraft scheduled for launch to Mars later in the year, and
    of Martin Marietta Corp.â€™s large space telescope.
       The 80 participating British companies emphasized their countryâ€™s
    capability in avionics and equipment and aerospace technology.
    Among the new aircraft exhibited by the British were the BN2 Is-
    lander, a floating aircraft for service between islands; the Lock-
     spieser LDA- 1, for cargo and agricultural uses; and a new version of
     the BAC 1 1fighter aircraft.

31 May: President Fordâ€™s announcement that he intended to regtore the
    White House Office of Science and Technology was discussed in a
    Washington Post editorial: most scientists were heartened by Presi-
     dent Fordâ€™s announcement. They had unanimously deplored Presi-
    dent Nixonâ€™s decision to abolish the office, believing that it was vital
    to the nationâ€™s well-being for the President to get the most objective
    possible scientific assessment of new weaponry, as well as of medical,
    economic, and environmental policies. However, scientists also felt
    that the establishment of the office and the possible appointment of
    National Science Foundation Director Dr. H. Guyford Stever as its
    head would not solve the problem. A report drafted by a committee
    of 13 leading scientists had spelled out what was needed establish-
    ment of a Council for Science and Technology that would carry the
     same weight as the Domestic and Economic Councils and could hold
     its own with the Office of Management and Budget and DOD.
        Any serious candidate for the top science job would want to con-
     sider whether the President â€˜â€˜really intends to make constructive use
    of a science adviser. Past experience tells us that the best mechanism
    for advice from the scientific community is of no avail if the Presi-
    dent isnâ€™t listening.â€ (W Post, 31 May 75, A12)
During May: Preparations continued for late summer launches of the two
    Viking spacecraft to Mars. A Lander 1 plugs-out test was completed
    8 May, 2 days later than planned, because of a grounding problem.
    By 26 May a l flight equipment, except for the gas chromatograph
                   l
    mass spectrometer, had been installed on Lander 1. Lander 2 was
    mated with its protective aeroshell on 28 May.
        Orbiter 1 was undergoing final mechanical assembly as the flight
    subsystems became available after individual reworking. By 31 May
    all temperature-control louvers, protective covers, and thermal
    blankets had been installed. Initialorbiter 2 system testing was com-
    pleted 5 May, and Orbiter block validation tests were begun. All solar
    panels for both Orbiters had been assembled and swing-tested, and
    were awaiting buildup of the low-pressure gas system.
        On 13 May a major hardware review of both landers was held at
    Kennedy Space Center with 100 NASA and industry participants. The
    review was the final chance to discuss modifications in the spacecraft
    before closure of the bottom plates and sterilization. Following the
    review, Langley Research Centerâ€™s Viking Project Manager James S.

      Space Shuttle. One entire lab devoted to life-science experimenta-
      tion would be launched every 6 mo. Other small highly auto-
      mated life-science experiments could be performed during Spacelab
      and Space Shuttle missions dedicated to other disciplines; NASA
      estimated that as many as 200 life-science flight experiments could
      be conducted in space during the 1980s.
         The invitation stated that â€œin order to take maximum advantage of
      future research opportunities, NASA intends to involve a large cross
      section of the Life Sciences community in shaping scientific program
      objectives, in selecting spacecraft laboratory equipment, and in the
      planning and execution of Flight Experiments. â€
         NASA estimated that approximately 200 scientists could participate
      as principal investigators of future flight experiments and that 50 of
      those could perform their research in space as crew members.
         As part of the first phase of the life-science program, NASA re-
      quested that interested scientists suggest general topics for future
      research and identify equipment needed to carry out life-science
      investigations. (Winter letter, text; NASA Release 75-140; UPI, NYT,

    ∞The launch of Skylab 1 on 14 May 1973 had torn a temporary â€œholeâ€ in
0
      the ionosphere, Physics Today reported. The journal said scientists
      speculated that the hole, a depletion of the total electron count, was
      caused by molecular hydrogen and water vapor from the exhaust of the
      Saturn V engines which had continued to burn well into the lower
      region of the ionosphere. The exhaust caused the oxygen atoms in the
      ionosphere to recombine, losing one electron each; the electrons were
      removed faster than could be replenished by the sunlight, thus the
      hole. The sun did replace the electrons, patching up the hole within
      3 hr after the spacedraft passed.
         The electron loss triggered by the Skylab launch was similar to ones
      caused, on a larger scale, by magnetic storms. Because the launch
      occurred on the second day of such a storm, scientists found it diffi-
      cult to trace any radio interruptions-typical during decreases in the
      electron content of the ionosphere-to Skylab. (Physics Today, May

      often been accused of neglecting aeronautics research in favor of

         NASA was particularly well suited to investigate stalls and spins
      and weather prediction-two of the most prominent factors in general
      aviation accidents-as well as to develop simple autopilots and flight-
      control systems.
         With the aircraft industry becoming increasingly competitive,
      NASA was â€œone place to seek helpâ€ to produce a technically superior
      product. NASA was responding to the need, allocating manpower and
      dollars to relevant general aviation research programs.
         More important was the new attitude of NASA and industry toward
      communicating about capabilities and needs. In the past NASA did its
      research â€œin a vacuum, oblivious to the needs of the aviation com-
      munity and to the unique conditions that constrained the industryâ€™s
      ability to apply NASA research results.â€ But recently NASA initiated a
      series of workshops between key industry technical experts and their
      NASA counterparts, designed to coordinate industry technological
      problem areas and NASA research programs. Also, in 1974, NASA es-
      tablished the General Aviation Technology Advisory Panel and gave
      it equal stature with the committees and panels that constituted the
      influential NASA Research and Technology Advisory Council.
         The atmosphere for effective communication and relevant research
      was improving. â€œWhile the threat of bureaucratic inefficiency and
      self-serving growth seems ever-present in Government endeavors,
      we see a conscientious effort on the part of NASA to apply their
      resources to the needs of general aviation.â€ (Flying magazine,

2 June: The Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway had signed preliminary
    contracts and memorandums of understanding with the U.S. to pur-
    chase 348 General Dynamics Corp. F-16 fighter aircraft for a total
    of $2.1 billion, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported. The
    countries were part of a four-nation consortium-with Belgium-to
    evaluate the F- 16, French Dassault-Breguet Mirage FlE, and
    Swedenâ€™s Saab Viggen as possible replacements for the Lockheed
    Aircraft Corp. F-104 operated by these countries. The preliminary
    contract was contingent on a full commitment to the F-16 by all four
    countries by 15 June.
       Aviation Week reported that Belgium had requested a two-week
    delay in making its choice but then announced its selection of the
    F-16 on 7 June after the countries had received assurance that the
    consortium would be permitted to produce, in Europe, 10%of all parts
    for the F-16. In addition, the four countries would produce 15% of
    the aircraft for sales to third world countries as well as 40% of the
    components for the aircraft bought by the consortium. (Av Wk, 2 June

∞Private industry and government agencies in the US. and in Europe
    were investing money in designs and prototypes of giant dirigibles
    that could carry cargo and passengers more cheaply than conven-
    tional aircraft, Newsweek reported. In May a 9-m-wide helium-
    filled prototype dirigible named Skyship, shaped like a flying saucer,
    had been flight-tested at a Royal Air Force station in England; a flight
    model was expected to go into commercial operation within 3 yr.
    Shell Oil Co. had spent more than $1 million studying the possibility
    of developing dirigibles to transport natural gas, Newsweek said.
       The U.S. Air Force was investigating dirigibles as a means of ferry-
    ing missiles from silo to silo, and the Navy was studying their ability
    to track submarines.
       A reason for the resurgence of interest in lighter-than-air craft was
    the energy crisis. Airships require hardly any fuel to get aloft and use
    very little for propulsion, and they also produce less noise and less
    atmospheric pollution.
       New designs for dirigibles included the substitution of inert helium
    for highly flammable hydrogen as the lifting gas, and the replacement
    of the familiar cigar shape with other configurations to do away with
    the problem of instability near the ground. (Newsweek, 2 June 75)

      interference by using the moon for obcultation, focusing, or aperture
     blocking for increased resolution and discrimination-had completed
      nearly 2 yr of successful operation and was adjudged successful.
        Explorer49â€™s lunar orbit, away from the noisy environment of earth,
      had increased the effectiveness of the instrumentation. The space-
     craft had been able to detect very weak solar-noise bursts up to 13
      mhz and as low as 25 khz. Its predecessor, Explorer 38-Radio
      Astronomy Explorer A, launched 4 July 1968-had been able to ob-
     serve relatively intense solar-noise bursts only in the 200 khz to 9 mhz
      range because of its orbit within the earthâ€˜s magnetosphere. Explorer
     49 also was able to observe and follow solar bursts out of the ecliptic

         Data from Explorer 49 had verified two major magnetospheric
     noise regions, one on the morning side of the earth and the other on
      the evening side. In addition, spacecraft data showed that intense
      noise occurred in the 8 to 12 pm time zone with less intense noise in
     midmorning. The intense late-evening noise was generated within
      10 000 to 12 000 km of the earthâ€˜s surface, and the dayside emission
      seemed to come from an altitude of less than 4000 km. (NASA

3-6 June: A Kennedy Space Center team tested a parachute system de-
      signed to lower an instrumented probe through the dense atmosphere
      of Venus to its surface. The tests-made for Ames Research Center
     in preparation for a Pioneer mission to Venus in 1978-were con-
     ducted in KSCâ€™s Vehicle Assembly Building, an ideal wind-free testing
     facility. Full-scale 3.7-m parachutes with simulated pressure
     vessels weighing 204 kg were dropped 13 times from heights of up to
      137 m to the floor of the VAB with impact cushioned by a honeycomb
     cardboard impact arrester. The performance of the parachute system
     was monitored photographically during the drop to determine the
     aerodynamic trim characteristics of the parachute.

     The 1978 Pioneer-Venus mission would include the launch of two
   separate spacecraft toward Venus. The first would orbit the planet
   collecting data for about 250 days; the second would carry one large
   probe, which would use the parachute to descend to the surface, and
   three small probes decelerated by aerodynamic drag only. The para-
   chute on the largest probe would be used to separate an instrument-
   bearing pressure vessel and stabilize it for a seees of critical scientific
   measurements as it passed through the Venusian cloud layer. None of
   the probes was designed to communicate with earth after impact.

                                      Y
     authorization bill, after resolving the disagreeing votes of the two
     Houses.
        In addition, for the transition period 1July through 30 Sept. 1976,
     the conference committee recommended a total authorization of
     $925 150 000. (H.R. Comm. Rpt 94-259; CR, 4 June 75, H4874-77)
∞The Central Intelligence Agency reported to the Senate Appropriations
     Committee on its secret monitoring of the Soviet space program and
     on the safety risks that might exist during the Apollo-Soyuz Test
     Project mission, the Wushington Post reported. Details of the report,
     which was requested by Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisc.), would
     be made public by the committee within a few weeks. (AP, W Post,
     5 June 75, A3)
∞A new medical diagnostic system known as time-delay spectrometry,
     using high-frequency sound waves, had been developed by scientists
     at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The new technique passed continuous,
     varying high-frequency sound waves through the body; the waves
     were received and digplayed as pictures on a cathode-ray-tube
     screen. Existing ultrasound systems had operated less effectively,
     sending into the body a pulse of sound waves and timing the echo after
     the waves were reflected from the bodyâ€™s various internal organs.
        A picture from the JPL system looked like an x-ray and took shape
     in 2 to 4 min. Bones, muscles, organs, and differences in soft
     tissue could be clearly seen. The varying pitch of the sound waves
     and the differences in frequency response and absorption properties
     of various body tissues would aid the diagnostician in discriminating
     between, for example, a cyst and a tumor.
        JPL researchers were planning to evaluate the systemâ€™s usefulness
     in hospital applications, first by demonstrating its ability to detect
     and identify tumors in the female breast. (NASA Release 75-162)
∞Marshall Space Flight Center announced the selection of Bendix Corp.
     Guidance Systems Div. for negotiations leading to a contract for inte-
     grated electronic assemblies for the Space Shuttle solid rocket
     booster. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract would cover design,
     development, test and evaluation, and fabrication of assemblies and
     assorted test equipment for the first 6 Shuttle flights. The initial
     contract would call for 33 units, including flight articles, spares, and
     development and test versions, with delivery to begin in 1976.

       Each solid rocket booster would have two assembly units, one
    forward and one aft. Ignition commands would route from the Orbiter
    through the aft assembly to the forward assembly. During launch,
    the aft assembly would route commands from the Orbiter to the
    thrust-vector control system. The forward assembly would release
    the nose cap and frustum, jettison the solid rocket nozzle, detach
    the parachutes from the solid rocket booster, and turn on recovery
    aids. (MSFCRelease 75-106)
∞The Christian Science Monitor quoted Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National
    Science Foundation Director, on the future role of science: Dr. Stever
    said that scientists should stop looking back to days when research
    money flowed freely and science was valued for its own sake. Scien-
    tists must face the fact that â€˜â€˜ â€˜the social environment in which science
    is performed has changed.â€™ â€ Scientists were bewildered as they
    watched research support tightening and jobs dwindling, and public
    questioning of the values of basic research grants. Yet science would
    become involved, as never before, in the economic success or failure
    of this country and the world. Society wanted research effort devoted
    to solving mankindâ€™s problems of food, energy, and environment. Dr.
    Stever noted that the era was long gone when the scientific community
    could conduct its affairs as â€œ â€˜a pure search for truth apart from
    serious considerations of its human consequences.â€™ â€ From now on
    â€œ â€˜the drive to understand nature. . .must be seen to be carried on in
    the public interest and not merely to satisfy the private curiosity of an
    intellectual elite.â€™ â€ (Cowen, CSM, 4 June 75, 25)
5 June: The U.S.S.R. launched comsat Molniya I-30 and Franceâ€™s Sret 2
    on a single booster from Plesetsk. Molniya I-30 entered elliptical
    orbit with a 39 876-km apogee, 448-km perigee, 712.2-min period, and
    62.8â€ inclination. Sret 2 entered orbit with a 40 824-km apogee,
    512-km perigee, 737.8-min period, and 62.8â€ inclination.
       Tass reported that Molniya 1-30 would ensure long-range tele-
    phone, telegraph, and radio communications as well as transmit TV
    programs to Orbita network stations in extreme northern Siberia,
    the Far East, and central Asia.
       Sret 2 (Satellite de RBcherches et dâ€™Environment Technique), ac-
    cording to Tass, would study the efficiency of a radiation system of
    thermal protection in outer space. It was the second of three space-
    craft in a program of Soviet-French cooperation. Sret 1 , launched
    4 April 1972, had studied the characteristics of solar batteries for
    space operations and the degeneration of solar cells from cosmic-ray
    exposure in the Van Allen Belt. (GSFC Wkly SSR, 5-11 June 75; Tass,
    FBIS-SOV,17 June 75, U1; A&A 1972, 128)
6 June: The establishment of a science advisory office in the White House,
    when it has to be urged on the President rather than conceived by
    him or his close associates, â€œis virtually irrelevant to the workings of
    the White House,â€ Daniel S. Greenberg said in a Washington Post
    article. Greenberg pointed out that the President already had National
    Science Foundation Director Dr. H. Guyford Stever, whose office
    was assigned a pared-down version of the presidential advisory func-
    tion when President Nixon dispensed with in-house science advice in
    1973. Although Dr. Stever possessed all the right qualifications and
    was eager to serve, â€œMr. Ford has had more conversations with golf
    pros over the years than he has had with Mr. Stever.â€
       The science community had agitated for the return of a science

   adviser by appealing to Congress and appointing committees of dis-
   tinguished scientists who duly certified that the President suffered
   from the absence of a science adviser close at hand.
      Although President Ford decided in favor of the appointment, still
   unresolved was whether a science office would be more useful than
   the NSF-based operation. Past Presidents had mot often used their
   science advice. â€œThe bookshelves of the Executive Office Building
   bear innumerable aging reports of early warnings by scientiists con-
   cerning problems of energy, food, resources, pesticides,. pollution,
   drug safety, and so forth, but few [Presidents] chose to hsten.â€
      Science advice was a valuable resource for a President d o chose
   to employ it, â€œfor as grating as they often are with their contentions
   of superior wisdom, scientists do possess experience and talent that
   can be put to good political use.â€ President Fordâ€™s move had little
   significance as far as the Ford administration was concerned, and it
   would â€œadd up to nothing more than a cosmetic deviceâ€ if the new
   science office had no jurisdiction over military research and develop-
   ment, a function sliced away from the advisory role under President
   Nixonâ€™s reorganization.
      â€œBut if a science office is in place at the White House, the next
   administration can get good service from it if it chooses to do so. The
   sad history of the matter is that, with rare exceptions, Presidents
   have not made that choice.â€ (Greenberg, W Post, 6 June 75, A28)
∞During recovery operations of the U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
   astronauts, the Apollo spacecraft would not be retrieved by helicopter
   as usual on Apollo missions, Dr. Donald E. Stullken, chief of Johnson
   Space Centerâ€™s Mission Support Branch, said during a press briefing.
   Instead, the recovery ship would steam up alongside the command
   module and haul it aboard using the shipâ€™s boat and aircraft crane.
   Navy personnel would open the hatch and the crew would step out on
   the shipâ€™s deck.
      Arnold D. Aldrich, deputy manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Pro-
   gram Office at JSC, said that the most extensive modification required
   for the ASTP mission was redesigning the Soyuz spacecraft to accom-
   modate the newly added docking system. The front end of the Soyuz
   had been modified with respect to structural configuration, thermal
   design, and the requirement to fit all the new system under the launch
   shroud that covered the entire Soyuz during the boost phase.
      John E. McLeaish, JSC Public Affairs Officer, said that NASA would
   provide U.S. and Soviet air-to-ground communications, air-to-air
   communications, and U S . - and U.S.S.R.-originated commentary for
   newsmen during the mission. All Russian would be translated simul-
   taneously into English, using a â€œvoice-overâ€ technique; a few com-
   munication lines would transmit raw Russian with no translation. The
   U.S.S.R. would provide an interpreter to assist newsmen in the U.S.
   with interpretation or explanation, if necessary.
      Questioned about the political significance of the ASTP mission,
   U.S. crew member Donald K. Slayton replied, â€œI think weâ€™d be naive
   to assume that this program is going to end all conflicts between our
                                     .
   two societies, certainly. I think . . itâ€™s a step in that direction, but
   thereâ€™s little doubt in my mind that weâ€™re going to continue to have
   conacts in many different areas. However, if we can kind of break the
   ground and get at least one area where we continue to work con-

∞Marshall Space Flight Center issued a request for quotations for a pro-
     posed study contract to design, build, test, and deliver a full-scale
    solar-array wing for solar electric propulsion and Space Shuttle pay-
    load applications. The selected coQtractor would establish design
    requirements and develop techniques for low-cost fabrication and
    testing incorporating all -previoudy developed tecfmology. (MSFC

7 June: Rockwell International Corp. Rocketdyne Div. successfjlY con-
     ducted the first ignition test of the Space Shuttleâ€™s integrated Sub-
     system Test Bed engine at the National Space Technology Laborator-
     ies. The test, conducted for Marshall Space Flight Center, lasted for
    0.8 sec. It was first of a series of 8 ignition tests leading up to the firipg
     of the Space Shuttle main engine. â€™Initial evaluation of data indicated
    that all the test parameters were satisfactory and that the test
    objective was achieved. All ignition tests would be of short duration,
     none reaching full engine thrust. (Roundup, 20 June 75, 4; Marshalt

8 June: If NASA had unlimited funding, â€œI would move fairly guickly on a
     manned station because that will become an important outpost for
     anything that we do in space,â€ Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy
     Administrator, said in an interview with theSan Diego Unioh. Dr. Low
     added that he would move quicker in launching a space telescope and
     bringing back soil samples from Mars, â€œboth enormougly important
    from a scientific point of view.â€
        Dr. Low expressed concern that â€œwe really arenâ€™t being inventive
     enough. We havenâ€™t discovered a new propulsion system.â€ All NASAâ€™s
    rockets so far, including the Space Shuttle, had used conveqtional
    means of propulsion, and with it man was limited. Dr. Low said that
     the moon landing â€œwas enormously difficult because we are tied to
    chemical propulsion systems.â€ NASA was experimenting with solar
     electric propulsion but to date no one had invented a fission or anti-
     gravity system. (Sun Diego Union, 8 June 75)
8-17 June: The U.S.S.R. launched Venera 9 and 10 to continue Soviet
    exploration of the planet Venus. Venera 9 was launched on 8 June at
     7:37 am local time (10:37 pm EDT 7 June) from Baykonur
     Cosmodrome, near Tyurataq, on course for a rendezvous with Venus
     in October. Tass announced the purpose of the mission was â€œto carry
     on scientific research on the planet of Venus and the surrounding
     space, which is carried out by means of an automatic craft.â€ Tass also
     said that, on the earth- Velius flight path, the probe would study the
     physical characteristics of interplanetary space including magnetic
     fields, solar winds, and ultraviolet radiation. Tass said that Venera 9
     was the heaviest in the u.S.S.R.â€™~ Venera series and had â€œcertain
     distinguishing design features .â€
        On 14 June at 9:30 am local time (12:30 am EDT) Yenera 10 was suc-
    cessfully launched toward Venus from Baykonur Coemodrome. Tass
     reported that â€œin design and purpose it is analogous to the â€˜Veneru-9â€™
     station launched on June 8â€ and that all spacecraft systems were func-
     tioning normally. Venera 10 was also expected to reach Venus in
     October.

∞President Ford transmitted to both Houses of Congress proposed
    legislation to create, within the Executive Office of the President, an
    Office of Science and Technology Policy headed by a director who
    would also serve as presidential science and technology advisor.
       In his letters of transmittal to Speaker of the House of Representa-
    tives Carl Albert and President of the Senate Vice President Nelson
    A. Rockefeller, President Ford said that the new director would
    â€œidentify new opportunities for using science and technology to im-
    prove our understanding of national problems and to contribute to
    their solution. He will also chair the Federal Council on Science and
    Technology, and I expect him to provide advice on the scientific and
    technological considerations in Federal policies, programs, and bud-
    gets.â€
       The President said that the director and deputy director would be
    presidential appointees. The office would draw extensively on the
    nationâ€™s scientific and engineering community for advice and assist-
    ance, and the director and staff would also call upon Federal agencies
    for assistance in carrying out their responsibilities. (PD, 16 June 75,

∞President Ford transmitted to Congress the Aeronautics and Space
    Report of the President: 1974 Activities. The President said that the
    â€œNationâ€™s activities in aeronautics and space continued to produce
    significant benefits, to experiment with and develop new applications,
    to increase scientific knowledge, and to advance technology.â€ He
    cited the continued expansion of international communications
    satellites; testing of earth-observation satellites for crop surveys,
    water resource management, and pollution management; completion
    of the successful Skylab manned space-station missions; continued
    planetary exploration, with successful missions to Jupiter, Venus,
    and Mercury; continued development of new aeronautical technology
    including the reduction of energy requirements, noise, and pollution,
     and modernization of the traffic-control system; and milestones in
    military aircraft development, including the rollout of the B-1
    bomber and delivery of the F-15 fighter aircraft. (CR, 9 June 75,

∞The Paris Air Show [30 May-8 June] reflected the international trends
    in aerospace with a depth and clarity far beyond what the most inten-
    sive study by individual nations could yield, an Aviation Week and
    Space Technology editorial said. Among trends evident at the 1975
     show at LeBourget Airport was the â€œtremendous resurgence of the
    helicopter market, particularly in the commercial field where sales
    were now approaching parity with the traditional military market and


                                    106

     promise to outstrip them during the next few years.â€ Helicopters had
     been found particularly useful in the exploration, development, and
     production of oil and minerals.
        Other expanding markets included the executive jet and short
     rugged-field transports for both military and civilian duty.
        Within the military market, fighter aircraft had moved into a new
    era of technology with a new emphasis on weapons for both air-to-air
     and air-to-ground operations. â€œIt is evident that they [fighter aircraft]
     must serve as platforms for new generations of weapons and advanced
     delivery systems that can produce a degree of military efficiency com-
     mensurate with their high cost.â€
         The American presence was strong at LeBourget and the â€œU.S.,
     through the performance of its new stable of fighters-F-14,       F-15,
     and F-16. . .-and its current generation of advanced technology
    transports is demonstrating what a truly tough competitor it can be.â€
    The Europeans were going to have to streamline their management,
     better organize their resources, and cut through national bureaucracy
     if they were to have any hope of keeping pace. â€œEurope cannot con-
    tinue at the same glacial development pace of the Concorde and MRCA
    [multirole combat aircraft] and expect to produce products that are
    technically competitive in the global market.â€ However, its success
    with helicopters, tactical missiles, small transports, and the Airbus
    was indicative of what could be accomplished.
        Noteworthy atâ€™LeBourget was the evidence of the â€œslow pace of
    Soviet civil aviation caused by a series of development difficulties
     across their whole spectrum of transports and helicopters.â€ The most
     visible evidence was the Tu-144 supersonic transport, which ap-
     peared in the fifth version off the assembly line, only the third such
     aircraft produced by the Soviet Union in the previous 2 yr. Av Wk
    quoted an expert as saying there was an estimated 1-yr slippage in
    Aeroflot plans to begin regular supersonic service. (Hotz, Av W k , 9

    billion-for their own use. The proposal permitted aircraft manufac-
    turers in these countries to share in the manufacture of aircraft and
    parts for U.S.and third world sales, which could more than offset their
    initial investment [see 2 June]. The Europeans would share logistics,
    maintenance, and training facilities in Europe.

12 June: NASA launched Nimbus 6 on a thrust-augmented Thor-Delta
     booster from the Western Test Range at 1:12 am PDT after a 6-min
     delay to clear a ship from the jettison trajectory of the Deltaâ€™s solid
     rockets. The spacecraft entered sun-synchronous polar orbit with a
     1103-km apogee, 1094-km perigee, 107-min period, and 99.96â€™ incli-
     nation. Separation of the spacecraft from the launch vehicle was
     normal, at 59 min into the flight. The solar panels were deployed and
     the attitude-control system quickly acquired earth. A wheel control
     provided three-axis stabilization. Checkout of the power system, tele-
     metry? command links, and tape recorder was completed on the first
     day of operation.
        At 7 hr after launch, a cryogenic vent valve associated with the
     limb-radiance inversion radiometer was pyrotechnically actuated as
     planned. This caused unexpected high torques and excessive control-
     gas usage. Nimbus 6 was put into a safe wideband gravity-gradient
     mode to conserve gas, and an investigation was begun to find the

   cause of the problem and determine possible remedies. By % June
   the 9 experiments and all spacecraft systems had been checked out
   and all instrumentation, except for 2 tape recorders, was working
   normally.
      The primary objective of the Nimbus 6 mission was to contribute to
   the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) by refining and
   extending the capability of vertically sounding the temperature and
   moisture of the atmosphere, with particular regard to altitude resolu-
   tion and intet-ference effects of clouds. GARP, a cooperative worldwide
   weather program, was established to improve understanding of
   meteorological atmospheric processes in the tropics and to improve
   observation and computing systems for weather prediction and
   analysis. Nimbus 6 would also monitor environhiental conditions such
   as sea ice and rainfall and would measure the earth's radiation budget
   with a precision never before attained.
      Secondary objective of the mission was to demonstrate the ability
   to track and relay data from a low-altitude polar-orbiting space-
   craft using a geosynchronous satellite as a communications relay.
   Ats 6, the Applications Technology Satellite launched on 30 May 1974,
   would be the relay comsat.
       A data-collection, processing, and relay-to-earth system was also
    on board to collect data from approximately 300 balloon-borne plat-
    forms, designed to float at an altitude of 20 km, and a large number of
   earth- and sea-based data platforms. Nimbus 6, unlike previous
    spacecraft, could receive and process up to eight incoming signals at
    a time.
       The satellite carried nine new instruments to extend measurements
    of atmospheric parameters to significantly higher altitudes than had
    previously been possible: the tracking and data-relay (T&DR) experi-
    ment; a high-resolution temperature sounder (HIRS)and a scanning
    microwave spectrometer (SCAMS) to take temperature soundings in
    the atmosphere outside the tropics; a tropical wind-energy conversion
    and reference level experiment (TWERLE) to provide data on tropical
    areas; a limb-radiance inversion radiometer (LRIR)and a pressure-
    modulated radiometer (PMR) to provide high-altitude temperature
    soundings; an earth radiation budget (Em)experiment to establish the
    earth's atmospheric radiation balance; an electrically scanning micro-
    wave radiometer           to map the liquid-water content of the clouds,
    ocean rainfall, and distribution and variation of sea-ice cover; and a
    temperature/humidity infrared radiometer (THIR) to provide data on
    cloud cover, ground temperatures, and water-vapor distribution.
      Nimbus 6 was next to last in a planned series of seven experimental
    meteorological satellites. Nimbus 1 (launched 28 Aug. 1964) and
   Nimbus 2 (launched 15 May 1966) achieved all their objectives.
    Launch of the third Nimbus, on 19 May 1968, failed when the launch
    vehicle malfunctioned; an identical spacecraft launched 14 April 1969
    successfully functioned as Nimbus 3. Nimbus 4 and 5 (launched 8
    April 1970 and 10 Dec. 1972) had both completed a l mission objec-

    tem integration, and spacecraft structures and antennas. Seven US.

      one of these inspections corrosion cracks had been discovered in the
      fins, requiring them to be replaced [see 19 Feb.-19 March]. May
      reported that the vehicle was ready to fly.
         William H. Rock, manager of the Sciences and Applications Project
      Office at JSC, said that modifications, including a larger, more effec-
      tive lightning rod on the launch tower, had been made to the launch
      pad to minimize the hazards from lightning strikes. Jesse R. Gulick,
      KSC meteorologist, said that thunderstorm probability for launch day
      was 23% and that the probability of a tropical storm or hurricane
      winds was less than 3%. Based on previous yearsâ€™ data, chances were
      good that, even if bad weather postponed the primary launch date, the
      Apollo spacecraft could be launched within 4 days. (MSFC Release

∞Viking Lander 1 would undergo a critical milestone in its development,
      terminal sterilization, beginning 13 June, Robert S. Kramer, NASA
      Director of Planetary Programs, said at a Viking news conference in
      Washington, D.C. The Lander would remain in the oven for 2.5 days
      and then be removed and checked out. Past missions had failed be-
      cause â€œmaybe we knew how to sterilize a spacecraft but we didnâ€™t
      know how to make one work after it was sterilized,â€ Kramer said.
      However, â€œwe think we know a lot more now than we did 15 years
      ago. We believe we have developed the techniques to be fully reliable,
      but when we complete that test along about next Tuesday morning,
      then we are going to find out for sure.â€
         A. Thomas Young, Viking Mission Operations Manager at Langley
      Research Center, said that plans called for launch of Viking 1 on
      11 Aug. and launch of Viking 2 on 21 Aug. Mission planners had
      deliberately arranged for the first Viking to arrive at Mars on 18 June
      1976, after 10 mos of travel, and Viking 2 to arrive on 7 Aug. 1976,
      about 1 yr after it was launched. Both spacecraft would spend about
      17 days in orbit examining landing sites â€œto assure ourselves that they
      continue to be safe.â€ The sites, which had not been examined since
      1971, must be checked again because Mars was a dynamic planet.

    Lander 1 was scheduled to begin its descent 4 July and start black-and-
    white photography immediately upon landing. Color photography would
    begin 18 hr later. The first soil sample would be collected on the eighth day.
    Analysis of the sample would take 12 days to complete, and 20 days would
    be required to complete one cycle of all surface science. Young noted
    that, to avoid confusion during the mission, Martian days would be
    called â€œsolsâ€ because they were a half-hour longer than earth days.
        During surface operations, the Orbiter passing overhead once a day
    would remain synchronized with the Lander; on the pass, the Orbiter,
    acting as a communications satellite, would relay information from
    the Lander to earth. When the Lander completed its work, the
    Orbiter would perform observations of its own, studying Martian sur-
    face features, including the proposed Lander B landing site, from
    orbit. (Transcript)
∞A theory that the moon was actually a piece of the earth broken away
    early in the planetâ€™s formation 4 5 billion yrs ago was presented in a
                                          .
    paper by Dr. John A. Oâ€™Keefe, a Goddard Space Flight Center scien-
    tist, and Professor Harold C. Urey, Nobel Prize winner from the
    Univ. of California. The paper, presented by Dr. Oâ€™Keefe at a meeting
    of the Royal Society in London, stated that although the moon had
    little, if any, metallic core, data from Apollo lunar-landing missions
    and earlier unmanned lunar flights had provided chemical evidence
    that lunar rocks were once a part of a mass that had included a con-
    siderable portion of molten iron.
        The higher proportion of molten metal in the earth supported the
    theory that, before the split, the iron in the earth had sunk to the
    center, drawing with it the gold, platinum, and other rare metals found
    in molten rock originally mixed with the iron. According to the theory,
    the moon was pushed to its present distance from the earth by inter-
    action with the tides of the body of the earth.
       Other theories about the formation of the moon included the possi-
    bility that the moon had been captured by the earthâ€˜s gravitational
    field when it passed near the earth, or that it had been formed simul-
    taneously with the earth. Neither of those theories explained the
    moonâ€™s lack of a substantial metallic core. (NASA Release 75- 171)

        The deactivation did not mean that the French were abandoning
    their ambition to achieve independence from the u.S. in space opera-
     tions but that it would take longer than originally thought. The

        Since its estqblishment in April 1968, the Kourou center had
     launched more than 225 balloons, satellites, and sounding rockets.
     Its location 5" north of the equator made Kourou especially suitable
     for equatorial launches. The largest of its disappointments had been

     point reception capability of the Westar system would attract a variety
     of broadcast applications, including independent networks and links
     to cable systems.
        Savings by users of the satellite system would depend on the type of
     service and the route selected Westar offpeak video service between
     Los Angeles and New York would cost $715 for the first hour, a sav-
     ings of 61% over the $1832 charged for a landline transmission. For
     each additional hour the Westar rate drops to $620, areduction of 66%
     over landline transmissions.

∞Scientists at Itek Corp. had developed a new telescope optical system
     that would dramatically reduce atmospheric distortion, the Baltimore
     Sun reported. The new system, which could improve viewing resolu-
     tion 10- or 20-fold, used mirrors and a computer to cancel out distor-
     tions so that observers could get a clearer image of celestial objects.
        In the system, a shearing interferometer and a detector measured
     the amount of distortion in the light entering the lens; the computer
     calculated the amount of correction needed in the light to cancel out
     the distortion, and a special mirror that changed its shape when elec-
     tric charges were applied corrected the light before the viewer saw it.

     tracts to provide detailed systems-design proposals for the Tracking
     and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), NASA announced. TDRSS, to
     be developed and operated by industry to meet NASA service require-
     ments, would consist of three or more specialized satellites in syn-
     chronous orbit to continuously relay tracking information and data
     and voice commands to and from NASA satellites.
        Western Union and RCA would both provide a technical, cost, and
     business proposal for leased services to be provided in the phase-two
     operational period. The proposals would be evaluated and a single
     contract for phase two would be awarded. The selected contractor
     would provide tracking, command, and data-acquisition services for
     essentially all spacecraft orbiting below 5000 km, including the Space
     Shuttle and Spacelab, as well as automated spacecraft to be orbited
     by the Space Shuttle, for a 1- to 10-yr period beginning in 1979. TDRSS
     spacecraft and ground stations would be the property and responsibil-
     ity of the selected contractor. (NASA Release 75- 176)
∞Scientist Herbert F. Wischnia was using Oao 3 (Copernicus, Orbiting
     Astronomical Observatory launched 21 Aug. 1972) satellite and its
     onboard optical telescope to look for possible flashes of an ultraviolet
     laser from another world, the Christian Science Monitor reported.
     Although radio signals would be a better way to communicate once
     contact was established, Wischnia believed that an optical telescope
     could pick up a whole spectrum of frequencies at a glance. A radio
     telescope required years to cover a significant band of frequencies be-
     cause of the complex data processing necessary; an optical signal,
     once detected, would probably indicate which radio frequency would
     provide further information. The biggest difficulty was making the
     initial contact.
        CSM reported that Wischnia was looking at three stars likely to
     have planets, all older than the sun and about 11 light yr distant.

∞The House of Representativesâ€™ Committee on Appropriations reported
     out H.R. 8070, the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development-
     Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY 1976.
        The committee proposed the continuation of the Space Shuttle and
     Viking projects; various planetary, weather, and scientific satellites;
      and further development of a strong aeronautics program. No new
      starts were proposed. The committee also directed deferral of the
     Pioneer-Venus mission for 1 year to permit a budget-priority decision
      in 1977 between the Large Space Telescope and Pioneer-Venus.
     The committee recommended reducing the $57 600 000 requested for
      Pioneer-Venus to $9 200 000 to maintain a management capability
     during the 1-yr deferral.

       $5 000 000 request for continued studies of the LST, and reduction to
       $2 000 000 of the $3 000 000 requested for the transition period. The

          Within the Construction of Facilities category, the committee
       denied funds requested for construction of the Lunar Curatorial Facil-
       ity. No funds were to be used for modifying the 40- by 80-ft wind
       tunnel at Ames Research Center until the committee had reviewed
       a formal budget request.
          Reduction in the Research and Program Management request re-
       flected a 10% reduction in the payment of General Services Adminis-

       language in the bill to permit the replacement of five older aircraft
       with more modern aircraft for greater efficiency and safety. This
       would reduce operating costs by $1 300 000 annually.
          The committee recommended a total appropriation of $925 028 000
       for the transition period 1 July through 30 Sept. 1976. This total was
       $33 872 000 under the total budget request and $122 111 less than the

    nounced. Ganymede, at the time some 600 million km distant from
    earth, was found to have a rougher surface than the inner planets
    Mercury, Mars, or Venus. Dr. Goldstein scanned Ganymede three or
    four times on each of six nights in August 1974, using the 64-m antenna
    at JPLâ€™S Goldstone station of the Deep Space Network; the radar em-
    ployed a 400-kw microwave beam at a frequency of 12.6 cm.
       Writing in Science magazine, Dr. Goldstein and co-investigator
    George A. Morris said the most likely surface of Ganymede was rocky
    metallic material imbedded in a matrix of ice. Such a surface could be
    smooth with a top layer of ice rubble but would appear rough to the
    radar because the ice would be transparent to the microwave beam.
       The theory was particularly interesting in view of the finding by the
    Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys (3 Dec. 1973 and 3 Dec. 1974) that Jupiter
    itself seemed totally gaseous, with no solid surface to produce a radar
    echo. The JPL scientists theorized that Ganymede was probably
    meteoritic in origin. (NASA Release 75- 170; Goldstein et al., Science,

∞Flight Research Center announced the award of a $146 000 cost-plus-
     fixed-fee contract to LTV Aerospace Corp.â€™s Vought Systems Div. to
    study the possibility of flight-testing the oblique wing on an F-8 jet
    aircraft. LTV would investigate technical and mechanical problems in
    modifying the test aircraft and would estimate the cost of modifica-
    tions.
       The oblique wing, developed by Dr. Robert T. Jones of Ames Re-
    search Center, was a conventional straight wing mounted on top of an
    aircraft so that it could be swiveled around a central pivot point. The
    wing could be fixed at zero degrees-perpendicular to the fuselage-
    for takeoff and landing, and moved to various sweep positions at dif-
    ferent speeds for the best performance. Wind-tunnel tests had indi-
    cated the new design could operate with maximum efficiency over a
    wide range of flight conditions, offering either increased speed or sig-
    nificant fuel savings. (FRC Release 17-25)
20 June: Dr. Harold Brown, President of California Institute of Tech-
    nology, announced the appointment of Dr. Bruce C. Murray as Direc-
    tor of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, succeeding Dr. William H. Picker-
    ing who was retiring after 21 yr in the position.
        Dr. Murray, a Caltech professor of planetary sciences for 15 yr,
    had also been a researcher on JPL space missions for more than 10
    yr. He was completing scientific descriptions of Venus and Mercury
    from Mariner 10 data, gathered during a February 1974 encounter
    with the planet, and comparing the surface histories of Mercury,
    Venus, Mars, and the moon with the history of the earth.
       Dr. Pickering had been with JPL since 1944 and had served as its
    Director since 1954. As Director, Dr. Pickering led JPL in designing
    and building the first orbiting U.S. satellite, Explorer 1 (launched 31
    Jan. 1958). Alsoâ€™under his leadership, JPL had designed the Ranger,
    Surveyor, and Mariner spacecraft that were launched to gather infor-
    mation on the moon and nearby planets. (NASA Release 75-179)

      Executive Office of the President.
          The bill was referred jointly to the Senate Committee on Aero-

      mittee on Labor and Public Welfare. S. 1987 was similar to H.R.

    ∞Marshall Space Flight Center announced the formation of a solar heat-
0
      ing and cooling task team to support requests made by the Energy
      Research and Development Administration (ERDA). The task team,
      under the leadership of Donald R. Bowden, would direct MSFCâ€™S role
      in ERDAâ€™S program to demonstrate heating and cooling applications
      of solar energy. The team would acquire examples of existing solar
      heating and cooling systems and would direct additional development
      of these systems to increase efficiency and lower costs.
         ERDA had authorized ap roximately $50 million to MSFC for work
      which would cover 5 yr anti use 100 persons at MSFC. (MSFC Release

    ∞Indecision and lack of a national policy had prevented the U.S. from
0
      having its own domestic communications satellite system after 9 yr
       of planning, a Washington Star article quoted Communications Satel-
      lite Corp. President Joseph V. Charyk as saying. In less than 10 yr a
      global comsat system developed under U.S. leadership was carrying
      more than two-thirds of the worldâ€™s transocean communications.
      Canada had had its own since 1972. The problem, Charyk said, was
      that, after the success of the global system, â€œeverybody wanted in.â€
      Companies, including American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
      Western Union Telegraph Co., Hughes Aircraft Co., RCA Corp., and
      Fairchild Industries, Inc., expressed interest in developing a domes-
      tic system. The Federal Communications Commission, whose job it
      was to decide who would operate such a system, seemed only intent
      upon keeping ComSatCorp and AT&Tfrom dominating the field. Quot-
      ing Charyk, the Star said the net effect of this lack of a positive policy
      by the White House, Congress, and the regulatory agencies was that
      all the U.S. had to date were two or three earth stations using repro-
       ductions of the Canadian system.
          Despite the problems, Charyk said that two of ComSatCorpâ€™s
      domestic programs were nearing operational stages: Marisat, a mari-
      time comsat planned for a summer 1975 launch, and Comstar 1,
      scheduled for launch in 1976. ComSatCorp would also participate
      with several European countries and Canada in the Aerosat program
      to test the use of comsats for aircraft navigation.
          However, Charyk said that, under the â€œopen skiesâ€ policies of the
      FCC, ComSatCorp had no guarantees of permanent service. â€œIt is
      hard to get customers with these rules in effect.â€ (Snider, W Star, 20

    ∞A Science magazine article detailed some early findings from the
0
     Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) of the Global Atmospheric
     Research Program (GARP). GATE, a 72-nation research effort during
     the summer of 1974 to gather meteorological information on the
     tropics, found very few cumulus clouds. Clouds in weather disturb-
     ances tended to be grouped in patterns, usually in roughly linear
     bands. Prior to GATE the only visible indicators of these weather-
     disturbance patterns were cloud clusters seen on satellite photo-
     graphs, but the details were unknown; GATE demonstrated that these
     clusters were high cirrus clouds that formed above the weather dis-
     turbance and might persist long after the rainclouds themselves had
     dissipated. The organization of active rainclouds then came under
     intensive study as the essential feature of atmospheric convection.
        Although scientists had previously thought that cloud bases formed
     at a given level in the atmosphere, clouds in the GATE area were found
     to form at many different altitudes; many did not reach the heights
     often associated with tropical cumulus clouds until the latter part of
     the summer. The strength of weather disturbances intensified during
     the experiment, indicating that the tropical atmosphere probably
     altered over the course of the summer as its moisture content and con-
     vection increased, causing the clouds to grow taller as higher and
     higher levels of the atmosphere were warmed.
        GATE scientists also investigated the air layer between the cloud
     bases and the sea surface, finding that the subcloud layer was pro-
     foundly altered by the passage of a cloud. Warm moist air taken up
     into the cloud to fuel the convection was replaced by cooler drier air
     from higher in the atmosphere. Scientists believed that the resulting
     mix might explain cloud spacing and lifetime, and might indicate a
     continually changing subcloud layer in marked contrast to conditions
     prevailing in fair weather. GATE experiments documented the exist-
     ence of atmospheric waves in the tropics and showed that weather
     disturbances developed near the low-pressure portion of the wave.
        Scientists also discovered a peculiar rapid meandering of the
     equatorial undercurrent-an intense eastward flowing stream 100 m
     below the sea surface at the equator-that shifted north and south
     about 1" in latitude on either side of the equator with an apparent
     period of 16 days. (Hammond, Science, 20 June 75, 1195-98)

       operating normally. By 27 June all eight experiments had been acti-
       vated and were acquiring data.
           Primary objective of the Os0 8 mission was to investigate the sunâ€™s
       lower corona and its chromosphere, and their interface in the ultra-
       violet spectral region, to better understand the transport of energy
       from the photosphere into the corona. Secondary objective was to
       study solar x-rays and earth-sun relationships and to investigate the
       background component of cosmic x-rays.
          The 1064kg spacecraft had two sections: A rotating cylindrical
       bottom section-the wheel-accommodated experiments that did not
       require solar reference pointing or that scanned the celestial sphere.
       The nonspinning rectangular sail section mounted on top of the wheel
       accommodated experiments that required stable pointing at the sun.

        structure simultaneously in six lines from 1000 to 4000 originating
        from different levels in the sunâ€™s atmosphere. This experiment was
        provided by Franceâ€™s Laboratory for Stellar and Planetary Physics
        under a cooperative agreement between NASA and the French Centre
        National de la Reâ€˜cherche Scientifique.
           Other experiments-all on the wheel portion of the spacecraft and
        supplied by u.S. universities, industry, and government agencies-
        included a high-sensitivity crystal spectrometer to monitor the sunâ€™s
        emission in the 2- to 8-kev range, obtain a complete spectrum of
        the sun every 10 sec during flares, and obtain high-resolution spectra
        of many celestial x-ray sources; a mapping x-ray heliometer to meas-
        ure location, spectrum, and intensity of intermediate-energy x-rays
        from individual solar-active regions and to acquire data on extrasolar
        x-ray sources; an investigation of soft x-ray background radiation
        using proportional counters; a cosmic x-ray spectroscope to
        determine the spectra of sources and the diffuse cosmic x-ray back-
        ground in the energy range of 2 to 60 kev, and to measure intensity
        variations and identify possible emission lines of discrete x-ray
        sources; a high-energy celestial x-ray experiment to measure the
        spectrum of a l point x-ray sources observable in the energy range of

23 June: NASA and the Energy Research and Development Administration
    signed an interagency cooperative agreement to enhance the national
    energy effort. ERDA and NASA management would identify specific
    program tasks that could be undertaken by NASA centers in support
    of ERDA programs. ERDA would use NASAâ€™s basic and applied research
    capabilities in areas including solar heating and cooling systems, gas
     turbines, fuel cells, hydrogen technology, ground-propulsion tech-
    nology, bearings, seals, combustion, automatic control systems, and
    materials and structures technology.
        NASA would submit proposals and plans to ERDA for specific tech-
    nology developments including testing, evaluation, and demonstra-
    tion of projects or hardware; ERDA would also call upon NASA for
     specific short- and long-term technical and administrative expertise
    such as technical review boards, evaluation groups, and other assess-
    ment techniques.
        The agreement would establish an ERDA-NASA program committee
     to annually review NASA research and development work in support
     of ERDA. (NASA Release 75-182; ERDA Release 75-99)
∞NASA was conducting design studies and component testing for an ex-
     perimental laser-energy system using a nuclear-fission reactor fueled
     with gaseous uranium or a gaseous uranium compound such as hexa-
     fluoride, Dr. Karl Thom said in an article released by NASA. Whereas
     conventional laser power used various processes of energy con-
     version that required costly equipment and resulted in net loss of
     energy, a nuclear system could produce large amounts of high-grade
     power very cheaply and efficiently.
        Some scientists were using various nuclear-powered lasers for
     experiments, but most used systems that transferred energy from
     external reactors to the laser gas within the laser tube. NASA, with its
     interest in gaseous fuel reactors as high-performance space power
     and propulsion systems, was looking at a more efficient system in
     which the fission fragments that energize laser gas were energized
     within the laser tube itself creating, at fission, a powerful chain reac-
     tion.
        Dr. Thom said that, in combination with the research on nuclear-
     pumped lasers, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists were
     testing gaseous fuel reactors using components, reflectors, and con-
     trols salvaged from the nuclear rocket program. If the system proved
     practical â€œa new era of nuclear energy utilization will begin, in space
     and on Earth.â€ Space engineers could create a nuclear-powered laser
     station in earth orbit to beam power via lasers to various customers in
     space, to other space probes for propulsion, to lunar bases for their
     power needs, and to earth for clean and abundant energy. (NASA

     etc. However, these uses had actually accounted for only a fifth of
     transglobal comsat TV volume. A number of poor and developing
     countries had come to depend heavily on the International Telecom-
     munications Satellite Organizationâ€™s seven Intelsat comsats. Although
     major events were still the subject of much global TV traffic, the most
     extensive and consistent use of commercial comsats was for daily
     news.
        News packages were sent from one country to another. U.S. net-
     works used almost daily satellite news reports from correspondents in
     various parts of the world. Spain and Mexico were linked full time by
     satellite. Madrid also transmitted 15 min of daily news to Argentina,
     Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela. When events warranted,
     these countries transmitted news to Spanish TV. France transmitted
     daily news to Israel, Iran, Jordan, and Martinique as well as several
     North African countries. News from London was transmitted daily to
     Australia.
        The NYT quoted officials of Communications Satellite Corp., U.S.
      manager of the Intelsat system, as saying that in 1965 the comsats
     carried about six TV transmissions a month for a total of less than 6
     hours of programming; in 1975, the Intelsat system was handling 400
     transmissions a month, more than 200 hrs of programming not includ-

     to 35 000 rpm could provide 2500 w of electrical power as well as
     spacecraft attitude control.
        In the flywheel concept, electric motor generators would spin up
     specially constructed flywheels which kinetically stored energy by
     their rotation. When electrical power was needed, the rapidly spin-
     ning flywheels would drive generators. A significant application of
     the flywheel would be to store energy for electric utility companies;
     the flywheels, spun up during off-peak hours, would drive power-

     handle two manned flights, particularly if one were in trouble in
     space. Sen. Proxmire said that it would be a simple matter to deorbit
     the two Soyuz 18 cosmonauts and bring them home.
        In a telephone interview with the Post, ASTP Technical Director
     Glynn S. Lunney said that the Soviet Union had two mission-control

     window when earth and Venus would be in unusually favorable rela-
     tive positions; the next favorable window would not appear for almost
      2 yr, during 1980, and Venus would be considerably further away
     from the earth at that time than it would be during 1978. A delay in
      funding would postpone the program for at least 18 mo, would require
      design changes, and might cost $50 million more than original esti-
     mates.
         Sen. Tunney said that the case for continued funding was a strong
     one. Most scientists felt that investigation of the Venusian atmosphere
     would provide valuable meteorological information that might sub-
      stantially enhance weather-prediction capabilities.
         Another reason for continuation of the program is that, in an era of
     high unemployment, few sectors had suffered more devastating set-
     backs than the aerospace industry. The Pioneer -Venus program
      had created more than 1500jobs, which would be threatened by termi-
     nation or delay of the program.
        Curtailment of an ongoing scientific concept like Pioneer-Venus
     would severely reduce credibility of the governmentâ€™s long-term com-
     mitments, with added time, difficulty, and cost for future projects as
     private contractors would seek to protect themselves.
        Sen. Tunney pointed out that the Houseâ€™s juxtaposition of
     funding for Pioneer-Venus with funding for the Large Space
     Telescope was inappropriate; the programs were not competing, but
     complementary. Pioneer- Venus would provide information on our
     closest neighbor, whereas LST would collect deep-space data of
      unprecedented scope and detail. â€œCutting one program for the sake of
      the other would mean sacrificing a distinguishable body of scientific
      knowledge which would not be replaceable.â€ (Text, letter, Tunney to

      derives aerodynamic lift from its body shape-arrived for display at
      the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s National Air and Space Museum in
     Washington, D.C. In a flight program beginning in 1963and ending in
      1972, the three versions of the M-2 vehicle had demonstrated that a
      manned reentry vehicle could reenter from space, maneuver through
     the atmosphere, and safely make a deadstick landing.
         M2-F3 was the thjrd version of Ames Research Centerâ€™s M-2
     lifting-body design. The first, M2-F1, was a lightweight plywood
     glider towed to altitude by a C-47 and released, whereupon the pilot
     guided the craft to a landing. A heavier version, M2-F2, was
     launched from underneath the wing of a B- 52 aircraft. After nearly a
     year of testing the unpowered vehicle, an XRL- 1 rocket engine was

     flight after engine installation, the vehicle crashed, badly damaging
     the vehicle and injuring the pilot. The lifting body was rebuilt, in-
     corporating modifications, and designated M2- F3. The M2- F3
     made more than 37 glide and powered flights with a jet reaction-
     control system that successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using

JULY

 Cosmodrome at 5:20 pm local time (8:20 am EDT) 15 July. The space-
 craft entered orbit with a 221.9-km apogee, 186.3-km perigee, 88.5-
 min period, and 51.8â€˜ inclination.
    Foreign correspondents, barred from the launch site, watched the
 launch on color TV sets in a Moscow press center. The first Soviet
 launch to be televised live, it was transmitted to viewers throughout
 the Soviet Union, the u.s., and eastern and western Europe. Presi-
 dent Ford watched from a U.S. State Dept. auditorium with Soviet
 Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly P. Dobrynin and NASA Administrator
 James C. Fletcher, before Dr. Fletcher and Ambassador Dobrynin
 flew to Kennedy Space Center to watch the Apollo launch.
    On the third orbit the Soyuz 19 crew established contact with U.S.
 mission control in Houston, putting into operation the global
 Moscow -Houston-Soyuz-Apollo communications system. On the
 fifth orbit the cosmonauts made the first of two maneuvers to place
 Soyuz 19 into a circular docking orbit. New orbital parameters were
 231.7-km apogee and 192.4-km perigee. The spacecraft was spin-
 stabilized at 3â€ per sec with all systems operating normally.
    Apollo Launch: At 3:50 pm EDT 15July-7 hr 30 rnin after theSoyuz
 launch-a Saturn ZB flawlessly lifted the Apollo spacecraft from
 Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s launch complex 39, carrying Apollo com-
 mander Thomas P. Stafford, command-module pilot Vance D.
 Brand, and docking-module pilot Donald K. Slayton. The spacecraft
 entered orbit with a 173.3-km apogee, 154.7-km perigee, 87.6-min
 period, and 51.8â€˜ inclination. The spacecraftâ€™s launch-vehicle adapter
 was jettisoned at 9 hr 4 min ground elapsed time (9:04 GET, counted
 from theSoyuz 19 launch) and the crew maneuvered the Apollo 180â€œto
 dock with the adapter and extract the docking module. These events
 were videotaped and transmitted to earth later via Ats 6 (NASAâ€™s
 Applications Technology Satellite launched 30 May 1974). A
 maneuver 2 hr later at 7:35 pm circularized the orbit at 172 km. The
 Saturn S-ZVB stage was deorbited into the Pacific Ocean 1hr 30 min
 later.
    A secondSoyuz 19 circularization burn of 18.5 sec at 8:43 am EDT 16
 July placed that spacecraft in a circular orbit of 229 km, with all
 systems functioning normally.
    Rendezvous and Docking: A series of Apollo maneuvers, with the
 final braking maneuver at 8:51 am EDT 17 July, put the Apollo space-
 craft in a229.4-km circular orbit matching the orbit ofSoyuz 19.A few
 minutes later Brand reported, â€œWeâ€™ve got Soyuz in the sextant.â€
 Voice contact was made soon after. â€œHello. Soyuz, Apollo,â€ Stafford
 said in Russian. Kubasov replied in English, â€œHello everybody. Hi to
 you, Tom and Deke. Hello there, Vance.â€ A l communications among
                                             l
 the five crew members during the mission were made in the language
 of the listener, with the Americans speaking Russian to the Soviet
 crew and the Soviet crew speaking English to the Americans. Contact
 of the two spacecraft 51 hr 49 min into the mission (12:09 pm 17 July)
 was transmitted live on T to the earth, and Stafford commented, â€œWe
                          V
 have succeeded. Everything is excellent.â€ â€œSoyuz and Apollo are
 shaking hands now,â€ the cosmonauts answered. Hard docking was
 completed over the Atlantic Ocean at 12:12 p m - 6 min earlier
 than the prelaunch flight plan-watched by millions of TV viewers
 worldwide. â€œPerfect. Beautiful. Well done, Tom. It was a good show.
 Weâ€™re looking forward to shaking hands with you in board [sic]

  Soyuz,â€ Leonov said. Tass later reported that Kubasov told Moscow
  ground controllers that â€œwe felt a slight jolt at the moment of dockingâ€
  but that all went according to plan.
     Joint Activities: At 3:17 pm hatch 3 opened; Apollo commander
  Stafford and Soyuz commander Leonov shook hands 2 min later.
  â€œGlad to see you,â€ Stafford told Leonov in Russian. â€œGlad to see you.
  Very very happy to see you,â€ Leonov responded in English. â€œThis is
  Soyuz and the United States,â€ Slayton told TV viewers around the
  world. Both Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid I.
  Brezhnev and President Ford congratulated the crews and expressed
  their confidence in the success of the mission. Stafford then pre-
  sented Leonov with â€œfive flags for your government and the people of
  the Soviet Unionâ€ with the wish that â€œour joint work in space serves
  for the benefit of all countries and peoples on the earth.â€ Leonov
   presented the U.S. crew with Soviet flags and plaques. The men
   signed international certificates and exchanged other commemora-
  tive items. After nearly 4 hr of joint activities, including a meal aboard
  the Soyuz, the Americans returned to the Apollo and the hatch was
  closed at 6:51 pm.
     An integrity check of the hatches indicated an atmospheric leak
  on the Soviet side. Ground controllers later attributed the indication
  to temperature chapges in the sealed docking module that were
  detected by the sensitive Soviet instrumentation. Future integrity
  checks of the hatches would be more rigorous, however.
     Following a sleep period, the crews prepared for another day of joint
  activity. Kubasov described the mission to Soviet TV viewers while
  the rest of the crews erformed experiments in their respective space-
  craft. At 5:05 am 18 fuly Brand entered the Soviet spacecraft; Leonov
  joined Stafford and Slayton in ApoUo, greeting them with â€œHowdy
  partner.â€ Kubasov gave American TV viewers a tour of his Soyuz, and
  Stafford followed with a tour of the Apollo. Then both Kubasov and
  Brand videotaped scientific demonstrations for transmission to earth
  later. Kubasov and Brand ate lunch in the Soyuz while Leonov ate with
  Stafford and Slayton in Apollo.
     During a third transfer, Stafford and Leonov went into the Soyuz
  and Kubasov and Brand joined Slayton in Apollo. Brand gave Soviet
  viewers a Russian-language tour of the eastern U.S. as seen from
  space. Further speeches and exchanges of commemorative items
  were made for both U.S. and Soviet viewers before the final hand-
  shakes at 4:49 pm EDT 18 July, when the crews returned to their
  respective spacecraft. The hatches were closed after Brand told
  Leonov and Kubasov, â€œWe wish you the best of success. Iâ€™m sure that
  weâ€™ve opened up a new era in history. Our next meeting will be on the
  ground.â€ Total time for all transfers and joint activities was 19 hr 55
  min. Stafford had spent 7 hr 10 min aboard Soyuz; Brand, 6 hr 30
  min; Slayton, 1 hr 35 min. Leonov spent 5 hr 43 min in the Apollo,
  Kubasov 4 hr 57 min. During nearly 2 days of joint activities, the five
  men carried out five joint experiments.
     Undocking and Separation: The Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft
  undocked at 95:42 (XT (802 am EDT 19 July). While the spacecraft
  were in station-keeping mode, the crews photographed them and the
  docking apparatus, transmitting the pictures live on TV to earth. The
  Apollo spacecraft then served as an occulting disk, blocking the sun
  from the Soyuz and simulating a solar eclipse-the first man-made

                                   133

       eclipse. Leonov and Kubasov photographed the solar corona as the
       Apollo backed away from the Soyuz and toward the sun. The two
       spacecraft then redocked at 8 3 4 am EDT with the Apollo maneuvering
       and the Soyuz docking system active while good quality TV was
       transmitted to earth. The second docking was not as smooth as the
       first because a slight misalignment of the two spacecraft caused both
       to pitch excessively at contact.
          Final undocking-also with the Soyuz active-went smoothly and
       was completed at 11:26 am. As the spacecraft separated, the two
       crews performed the ultraviolet atmospheric absorption experiment,
       making unsuccessful data measurements at 150 m and then moving to
       a distance of 500 and 1000 m, where data were successfully collected.
       The Apollo maneuvered to within 50 m of Soyuz and took intensive
       still photography of the Soyuz. Separation maneuvers to put the two
       spacecraft on separate trajectories began at 2:42 pm with a reaction-
       control system burn. With the maneuvers completed, Leonov told the
                                                                    .
       Apollo crew, â€œThank you very much for your very big job. . . It was a
       very good show.â€ Brand answered, â€œThank you, also. This was a very
       good job.â€
         Soyuz Orbit and Landing: Soyuz 19 remained in orbit nearly 30 hrs
       after the undocking. The cosmonauts conducted biological experi-
       ments with microorganisms and zone-forming fungi. At 2 3 9 am EDT
       21 July the Soyuz crew closed hatch 5 between their orbital vehicle
       and descent module and began depressurizing the orbital module.
       Braking burns of the descent engines began at 6 0 6 am when the
       spacecraft was 772 km from the Apollo. The 194.9-sec burn
       slowed the spacecraft to 120 km per sec. After another burn to
       stabilize the spacecraft, the orbital and descent modules separated
       over Central Africa. While Soviet viewers watched the first landing of
       a Soviet spacecraft televised in real time, the main parachute
       deployed at 7 km and jettisoned before the soft-landing engines fired.
       Soyuz 19 landed about 11 km from the target point northeast of
       Baykonur Cosmodrome at 651 am EDT 21 July, after a 142-hr 31-min
       mission. The rescue helicopter approached the capsule immediately
       and specialists opened hatch 5. Kubasov stepped out waving to
       rescue-team members, followed by Leonov, both cosmonauts in
       apparent good health and spirits. The cosmonauts returned to
       Baykonur for medical checks and debriefings.
         Apollo Postdocking Orbital Activities: Apollo remained in orbit
       while its crew continued u.S. science experiments begun during
       predocking. Searching for extreme ultraviolet radiation, the ASTP
       crew marked the birth of a new branch of astronomy when they found,
       for the first time, extreme ultraviolet sources outside the solar system;
       some scientists had believed that such sources could never be found.
       One of the newly discovered sources turned out to be the hottest
       known white dwarf star. The Apollo detector also revealed the
       existence of the first pulsar discovered outside the Milky Way. About
       200 OOO light years from earthâ€™s galaxy, in the Small Magellanic
       Cloud, it was the most luminous pulsar known to astronomers, 10
       times brighter than any discovered so far. After repairing some
       malfunctioning equipment, the astronauts also mapped x-ray sources
       throughout the Milky Way.

     The crew completed nearly all the 110 earth-observation tasks as-
   signed. Coordinated investigations had been made simultaneously by
   six groups of scientists on the ground, on ships at sea, and in aircraft.
   The astronauts looked at ocean currents, ocean pollution, desert
   geography, shoreline erosion, volcanoes, iceberg movements, and
   vegetation patterns.
      On 23 July the command-module tunnel was vented and the crew
   put on spacesuits to jettison the docking module. The command and
   service module undocked from the DM at 3:45 pm EDT, and a 1-sec
   engine firing put the CSM into a higher orbit (232.2-km apogee, 219.0-
   km perigee) so that the DM could move ahead. A second maneuver put
   the CSM in a 223.2-km by 219.0-km orbit. Deorbit began at 4 3 8 p.m.
   The command module and service module separated, the drogue and
   main parachutes deployed normally, and the Apollo splashed down at
   22458 GET (518 p.m. EDT 24 July) in the Pacific Ocean 163â€W and
   22â€N, 500 km west of Hawaii. This was the last ocean landing planned
   for U.S. manned space flights; future flights on the Space Shuttle
   would be wheeled touchdowns at land bases.
      The CM landed in â€œstable 2â€™â€™ position (upside down) 7.4 km from the
   prime recovery ship, U.S.S. New Orleans. After swimmers from the
   rescue helicopter righted the spacecraft and attached a flotation col-
   lar, the Apollo was lifted by crane on to the deck of the recovery ship
   and Stafford, Brand, and Slayton stepped out to the cheers of the
   shipâ€™s crew. President Ford telephoned congratulations. During the
   welcome, the crew was evidently experiencing eye and lung
   discomfort; subsequent conversations and spacecraft data revealed
   that, during reentry, the earth landing system had failed to jettison the
   apex cover and drogues as scheduled and had had to be fired
   manually, without first disabling the reaction-control system
   thrusters. With the CM oscillating, the thrusters began firing rapidly to
   compensate, and combustion products -including a small amount of
   nitrogen tetroxide- entered through the cabin-pressure relief valves.
   As soon as the RCS system had been disabled, fresh air was once again
   drawn into the cabin. The crew members told flight officials that they
   had put on oxygen masks once the spacecraft had landed, and then
   activated the postlanding vent system.
      Because of the crewâ€™s discomfort, further shipboard ceremonies
   had been canceled and the crew had been sent to sick bay and then to
   Tripler Hospital in Hawaii for observation until 8 Aug.
      Primary ASTP mission objectives were to evaluate the docking and
   undocking of an Apollo spacecraft with a Soyuz, and determine the
   adequacy of the onboard orientation lights and docking target;
   evaluate the ability of astronauts and cosmonauts to make inter-
   vehicular crew transfers and the ability of spacecraft systems to
   support the transfers; evaluate the Apolloâ€™s capabilit of maintaining
                                                          P
   attitude-hold control of the docked vehicles and per orming attitude
   maneuvers; measure quantitatively the effect of weightlessness on
   the crewsâ€™ height and lower limb volume, according to length of
   exposure to zero-g; and obtain relay and direct synchronous-satellite
   navigation tracking data to determine their accuracy for application to
   Space Shuttle navigation-system design. The objectives were
   successfully completed, and the mission was adjudged successful on

    U.S. and U.S.S.R. crews of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project: â€œ n a few
    short hours, you will be opening a new era in the exploration of space.
    Although others have goae before you, you will be blazing a new trail
    of international space cooperation.â€ In the less than 2 decades since
    Yuri Gagarin and John Glenn orbited the earth, realizing the dreams
    of those early rocket pioneers who had believed firmly that man could
    fly in space, spaceflight had expanded considerably our knowledge of
    earth, moon, planets, and universe. â€œYour flight represents ahother
    stage in manâ€™s efforts to further his understanding of his environment.
    It has already demonstrated something else-that the United States
    and the Soviet Union can cooperate in such an important endeavor.
    Since the Apollo-Soyuz project was agreed to 3 years ago, crews,
    scientists, and specialists of both countries have worked diligently
    and productively, and in a spirit of cooperation, to bring us where we
    are today. I am heartened by the example of dedication dnd
    cooperation you have displayed. I am confident your efforts and
    example will lead to further cooperation between our two countries.â€

∞The Washington Post reported that, after launch of the Apollo-Soyuz
    Test Project, more than 1800 persons would lose their jobs. With the
    liftoff came the end of the Apollo and Saturn programs which had be-
    gun 25 May 1961 with President Kennedyâ€™s request for anational com-
     mitment to a lunar-landing program. Layoffs would cut the Kennedy
     Space Center workforce to less than 8500, down from a peak of 28 000.
     Of those who would lose their jobs, 1100 worked for NASA contractors-
     Rocketdyne Division pf Rockwell, Boeing Co., Chrysler Corp., and
    McDonnell Douglas Corp.-who built and mated the stages of the
     Saturn launch vehicle to the Apollo spacecraft. Another 700 worked for

       Only 100 launch-operations contract employees would remain to
     help plan the launches of the Space Shuttle. The Shuttle launch force
     would begin to increase in size in 1977, but would never reach the size
     of the Saturn team because of increased automation. (Oâ€™Toole, W

     design, construction, installation, and assembly of the facility.
        The 3-m infrared telescope, scheduled for 1977 completion, would
     be the worldâ€™s largest. The Univ. of Hawaii would operate it in support
     of NASAâ€™s planetary exploration programs, particularly the 1977
     Mariner mission to Jupiter and Saturn. The facility would provide a

16 July: At a Moscow exhibition of space art to commemorate the joint
     U.S. -U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Soviet art glorified manâ€™s
     role in space, whereas US. a t emphasized technology, the Baltimore
                                      r
     Sun reported.
        U.S. artists, commissioned by NASA and the National Gallery of
     Art to record the space program, showed basically factual treatments
     of blastoffs, launch towers, and mazes of steel gridwork. Artist Alden
     Wicks depicted Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s Vehicle Assembly Building
     as â€œThe New Olympus.â€ Men played subordinate roles in U.S. art;
     they swarmed through control centers or, as in Jamie Wyethâ€˜s â€œFiring
     Room,â€ sat by the dozens in front of individual TV monitors. En-
     gineers ministered to launch vehicles like priests before an idol. Even
     in the pen-and-ink drawings of individual astronauts, faces were
     diminished by the detailed minutiae of spacesuit and life-support
     paraphernalia.
        By contrast, man dominated the Soviet art. Artist Anatoly Yakushin
     depicted pioneer rocket theoretician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky against
     a geometric maze, but man controlled the idea. A painting by Boris
     Okorokov showed a young flight controller commanding abstract
     equipment, in contrast to Wyethâ€™s passive TV-monitor watchers.
        The irony of the two artistic visions was that they â€œreverse the tech-
     nological visions of the nationsâ€™ manned space programs,â€ the Sun
     said. In reality, U.S. flights left muchof the flying up to the astronauts,
     while the Soviets had kept their cosmonauts as passive as possible.
        Also included in the exhibition were paintings by Apollo-Soyuz
     Test Project cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov, the only one of the artists
     who had seen outer space. He painted cosmic scenes in brilliant
     colors: His deep space was not a flat black, but a composite of black
     and indigo, streaked with magenta and stars with violet coronas.
     The Leonov earth as seen from space was deep marbled blue with
     atmospheric sheaths surrounding it in hard-edged layers, pale hues
     close to the planet, darkening in stages to the night of space. (B Sun,

∞Department of Defense said the Navy had understated the long-term
     cost of building the new F- 18 carrier aircraft by at least $1.6 billion,
     the WashingtonStar reported. TheStar said the Navy Bad chosen the

     selected the F- 16 for its low-cost fighter instead of the fighter version
     of the F- 18. At the time the Navy estimated the cost of each F- 18as
     $7.8 million, or $2.6 billion to develop and produce the first 128
     F-18s; however, the Star reported, a DOD analysis found the 5-yr
     costs would be closer to $4.3 billion.
        The future of the program was under discussion. One alterna-
     tive would be to raise projected Navy budget to accommodate the in-
     creased costs of the F-18. Another would be for the Navy to drop
     F-18 and go back to industry to design and develop a lower cost
     fighter that would fit into the original budget and, in the interim, to let
     the Navy buy fighter-bombers from McDonnell Douglas to meet its
     fleet-modernization needs in the early 1980s. (Finney, W Star, 17

17 July: Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972 and traveling out of the solar
     system at 43 200 km per hr, was operating normally despite a report
     that the spacecraft was making unexplained orientation changes [see
     11 June]. The apparent changes were caused when, during a routine
     change in spacecraft orientation on 6 May, the spacecraftâ€™s star
     sensor made an undetected shift in its lock from the star Betelgeuse
     to the star Sirius. This shift twisted the frame of reference for measur-
     ing direction, and for changing the direction of spin-axis pointing. As
     a result, onboard and ground computers had recorded a gradual north-
     ward shift of the spin axis relative to the earthâ€˜s motion around the
     sun. Also, when the thrusters were fired to move the spin axis with
     the earthâ€˜s east-west course, â€œsouthwardâ€ impulses were necessary.
        No loss of data had occurred, and techniques were being designed
     to verify star reference during intervals when the star sensor was
     used. (ARC Astrogram, 17 July 75, 1)

        A U- 2 earth-resources survey aircraft would probe the strato-
     sphere up to 20 km to measure the distribution and extent of ozone,
     nitric oxide, and aerosol particles in the area between the equator and
     4V N latitude. Conducted by ARC to aid a national study, the sampling
     program was part of a semi-global study of the effect of ozone and
     nitric oxide on the worldâ€™s climate over a long period of time. Similar
     missions had been flown over higher latitudes and polar regions.
     Another objective of the U-2 flights was to collect remotely sensed
     data on the Hawaiian Islands in support of several investigations,
     including one of the decline and die-back of Ohia and Manami trees in
     the forested areas of Hawaii.
        NASAâ€™sKuiper Airborne Observatory, a C-141 jet aircraft
     equipped with a 91.5-cm infrared telescope, would make 16 flights to
     collect previously unobtainable data from the region of the galactic
     center, a highly complex intense source of infrared emission. (ARC

∞The International Telecommunications Satellite Organizationâ€™s board
     of governors had authorized issuance of a request for firm fixed-price
     proposals for design, development, manufacture, and test of seven
     Intelsat V satellites, with options for up to eight additional satellites.
        In 1979 Intelsat V satellites would replace the Intelsat IV- A series
     to be deployed in September 1975. Intelsat V satellites would have
     increased capacity by a fourfold use of the 614 ghz frequency band, use

    introduction of the 14/11 &z band for limited coverage in high-traffic
    regions; and a maximum effective bandwidth of 2280 mhz. A single
    satellite design would be used in all three ocean regions of the Intelsat
    global systems. Intelsat V satellites were expected to have a capacity
    of 12 000 two-way voice circuits plus one color TV channel. (INTELSAT

∞Lewis Research Center had awarded a contract to Rockwell Lnterna-
    tional Corp. Rocketdyne Div. for a laser-heated rocket thrust cham-
     ber for spacecraft. The concept included transmitting laser energy
    from a ground laser-generating station to a spacecraft; propellant
    carried aboard the spacecraft would convert laser energy into pro-
    pulsive thrust. The potential improvement in performance included a
    400% increase in payload capability for a Space Tug.
       Rockwell would build an experimental thruster, to be powered by a
     10-kw laser beam and tested at LeRC using an in-house carbon-dioxide
    laser system, and would provide a preliminary design for a 5000-kw
    thruster. (Rocketdyne Release RD- 16)
∞NASA announced appointment of Gerald D. Griffin as Deputy Associate
    Administrator for Operations in the Office of Manned Space Flight,
    effective 1 Aug. In his new position Griffin would plan for the most
    economical and flexible operation of the Space Shuttle and Spacelab.
    Griffin, who was Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs be-
    fore this appointfnent, would be replaced by Dr. Joseph P. Allen, an
     astronaut assigned to the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center.

18 July: The Los Angeles Times discussed the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
    mission in an editorial: At the instant the Apollo and Soyuz docked,
    â€œthe two ships ceased to be two and became one. And at that moment,
    the common fate of the five adventurers was indissolubly linked for
    the next 44 hours, symbolic of the shared destiny of the 4 billion
    passengers on the mother spaceship 140 miles below.â€ That the
    passengers were from two different countries was of no significance.
    â€œThey communicated in each otherâ€™s language, and they saw the
    lovely blue earth across the vistas of space through the same eyes,
    with the same perception. It is a vision that is desperately needed by
    earthbound statesmen.â€ (LA Times, 18 July 75)
19 July: Japanâ€™s National Space Development Agency and NASA signed a
    contract for launch of three Japanese geosynchronous satellites in
     1977 and 1978. NASA would launch the satellites on a Delta launch
    vehicle on a cost-reimbursable basis.
       The satellites-GMS, a meteorological satellite; CS, an experimental
    medium-capacity comsat; and BS, an experimental medium-scale
    broadcast satellitewould participate in the worldwide Global
    Atmospheric Research Project (CARP) sponsored by the United
    Nations World Meteorological Organization. (Kyodo, FBIS- Japan, 22

20 July: The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project docking system functioned well
    even though â€œconditions were not too favorable in the second dock-

    ture, is turned off, while the manual operation of the Apollo ship.
    should have been turned into a different mode.â€ At point of capture
    Soyuz began to turn on its axis at approximately 3â€ per sec, and the
    shock absorbers on the Soyuz â€œwere very strained in order to absorb
    this strain.â€ All the pitch was â€œquelledâ€ after about 40 sec,
    Syromyatnikov added.
       When a reporter asked why this happened, flight engineer Sergei
    Tsibin said, â€œWe know that at one moment on the Apollo there was a
    folding of the gyroscopic system. We also know that at the moment of
    locking and latching the Apollo and Soyuz were rolling at approxi-
    mately 1 degree a second. This should not have taken place.â€
       The Los Angeles Times reported on 21 July that the Russians were
    worried about a pressure drop in Soyuz and had voiced concern over
    possible damage to the Soyuz by the hard docking. However, the
    Times quoted NASA officials in Moscow as saying that the docking had
    been within prescribed limits though conceding that â€œit may have
    been a little harderâ€ than the first one. (USSR press briefing transcript,
    20 July 75; Toth, LA Times, 21 July 75)
∞Pope Paul VI told a crowd of 5000 at the papal palace near Rome that
    he was enchanted by the unique encounter of the Apollo and Soyuz
    crews in space [see 15-24 July]. He said, â€œWe too, our eyes dazzled
    by sky light or wide open toward the depths of nighttime space, will
    shout out, long live the heroic men of such a fantastic feat. Man has
    won and we cannot refrain from foretelling more wonderful advances
    in the dominance of nature beyond the heavenly sphere. Man will
    win.â€ (ASTP air-to-ground transcripts, 20 July 75)
∞The fierce rivalry between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. was not confined to
    ground, air, and sea, but extended to space, the Peopleâ€™s Republic
    of Chinaâ€™s The Peopleâ€™s Daily said in an article entitled â€œCompeti-
    tion in Space and Hardship on Earth.â€ Both superpowers had invested
    huge amounts of money, manpower, and materials to turn cosmic
    space into an arena for arms expansion and war preparations as well
     as espionage. U.S. and U.S.S.R. military satellites, which accounted
    for most satellite launchings, were used mostly to spy on each other.
    In recent years their rivalry in space had become more and more
    acute, disturbing tranquillity in space. (Peking NCNA, FBIS-PRC, 21

21 July: The 14-nation Arab League, joined by 6 other African and Mid-
    Eastern states in a 20-nation satellite organization, had finished
    initial technical and economic feasibility studies for an Arab satellite-
    communications network and were beginning to define specific tech-
    nical requirements for the system, Aviation Week and Space Tech-
    nology reported.
       Program goals were to meet telecommunications requirements of
    Arabic-speaking states in North Africa and the Middle East for police
    work, weather broadcasting, civil aviation communications, and ship-
    ping, and to expand Arab technology into space. The Arab States
    Broadcasting Union estimated immediate need of 15 radio channels
    for direct broadcast of educational and cultural programs to remote
    areas, and 2 TV channels each for general and educational broadcast-
    ing. Estimated need of the Arab countries by 1976 would be as many
    as 1060 telephone, teletypewriter, and telegraph channels, and up to
    6200 channels for this traffic by mid-1984.

    stations would be bought from Western countries, the long-term goal
    was to shift operation and control to Arab nationals after 6 mo.
       The system, which would provide communications and broadcast
    coverage for 95% of the Arab world, would include a main orbiting
    satellite, a standby orbiting satellite to replace the prime satellite in
    case of failure, and a reserve satellite ke t on the ground ready for

∞A recommendation by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, to
    transfer Skylab backup hardware to the Smithsonian Institution was
    agreed to by Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.), Chairman of the House
    Science and Astronautics Committee. In a letter to Dr. Fletcher,
    Teague said he understood the transfer would â€œin no way affect the
    status of the Saturn launch vehicles and Apollo spacecraft being re-
    tained for possible use.â€ Teague said he shared a â€œbelief that to dis-
    play the Skylab hardware to the public will foster a better apprecia-
    tion and increasing support for our national space program.â€
       Other equipment was being stored to permit restoration if addi-
    tional space missions should become desirable [see 9 Apr.]. (Letter,

∞Cosmic rays-the most energetic particles in the universe-probably
    originated in supernovas within our own galaxy, Dr. Floyd W. Stecker,
    Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, wrote in an article in Physical
    Review Letters. Dr. Stecker had based his conclusions on data from
    NASAâ€™s Explorer 48 (Small Astronomy Satellite-B, launched 16 Nov.
    1972).
       Scientists had been speculating on the source of cosmic radiation
    since its discovery at the turn of the century, when it was thought to be
    identical with gamma rays. With the advent of radio astronomy and
    the rapid development of new experimental techniques and instru-
    mentation, supernovas had been considered a possible source of
    cosmic rays; however, other scientists believed cosmic radiation had
    extragalactic origins, such as quasars. Explorer 4 8 , measuring
    cosmic-ray intensity without interference from earthâ€˜s atmosphere,
    had been able to obtain the gamma-ray information needed to com-
    plement ground-based radio-astronomy data.
       The SAS-B scientific team at GSFC had measured a large amount
    of gamma radiation coming from the Milky Way galaxy, the most in-
    tense coming from the center of the galaxy. As gamma rays resulted
    primarily from collisions of cosmic rays with interstellar gas, and the
    detailed Explorer 48 data had identified the direction from which
    most of the gamma rays came, Dr. Stecker could pinpoint an area
    of intense activity midway between the galactic center and the earth.
    The active area was a region containing numerous interstellar gas
    clouds-but not enough to account for all the gamma-ray produc-
    tion-as well as a large number of supernova remnants. Dr. Stecker
    deduced that cosmic rays were to be found in the same regions as
    supernova remnants and in proportion to their number. (Stecker,
    Physical Review Letters, 21 July 75, 188-90; NASA Release 75-221)
22 July: The National Research Councilâ€™s Space Applications Board,
    directed by the National Academy of Sciences and a NASA contract,
    released a report entitled â€˜â€˜Practical Applications of Space Systems,â€

   with particular emphasis on approaches to socioeconomic benefits.
   The report stated that present institutional arrangements were â€œnot
   adequateâ€ to encourage future applications of space technology to
   promising areas such as natural resource exploration and manage-
   ment, telecommunications for education and health care, and long-
   range weather and climate forecasting. The report added â€œThere
   exists at present no institutional mechanism that permits the large
   body of potential users. . .to express their needs and to have a voice in
    matters leading to the definition of new systems.â€
       Recommendations by the board included establishment of a
    national space applications council to direct policies affecting non-
    military space applications; to set priorities for meeting user needs; to
    provide for exchanges between users and providers of space tech-
    nology; and to encourage non-Federal investment in the application of
    space systems. The council could operate as an interagency group,
    with representation from state and local governments.
       To meet the launch needs of future applications satellites, the board
    recommended that plans for the Space Shuttle provide an early op-
    portunity to orbit payloads in either polar or geosynchronous orbits.
    The Shuttle-launched payloads would have applications in hazardous
    weather warnings and long-range weather and climate predictions;
    land-use planning; agriculture, forest, and range management; ex-
    ploration for food, water, energy, and mineral resources; and environ-
    mental monitoring.
       Other specific recommendations included lower cost, more acces-
    sible ground data-collection and readout stations; long-term observa-
    tions of climatic factors-such as albedo, heat control of mixed layer
    in ocean, cloud distribution, and climatically significant changes in
    vegetation, land use, and snow and ice cover-to help provide a sound
    basis for long-range weather prediction; a resolution of 3 to 10 m for
    land-use applications; greater emphasis on Federal research and de-
    velopment programs for spaceborne sensors of water resources;
    continued development of earth physics techniques, including a sys-
    tem to measure relative displacement of tectonic plates within 3 cm;
    and vigorous continuation of the SEASAT-A and Nimbus- C programs.
       The board had based its findings on the deliberations of 110 poten-
    tial users of space-derived information and services who had attended
    a July 1974 study group in Colorado. The participants represented
    Federal agencies, state and local governments, industrial and busi-
    ness communities, and educational institutions. (â€œPractical Applica-
    tions of Space Systems,â€ NAS publ, July 75)
∞Although more than 26 million Americans watched the Apollo-Soyuz
    Test Project handshake in space, TV coverage was â€œadequate without
    being particularly outstanding,â€ TV critic Lee Winfrey said in the
   Philadelphia Inquirer. Two obstacles were insurmountable. NASA â€œis
    doggedly efficient, it got us to the moon first and it did the job again
   this time. But it is as colorless as a pane of glass and invariably capable
    of making the highest excitement look like the dullest routine.â€™â€™ NASA
    had an unshakable air of the 1950s about it: all white, all male,
    crewcut, and straight-shouldered.
       The second obstacle was that the mission was â€œanother goodie that
    Richard Nixon drearned up for us. Which means it was all show and
    no substance.â€ The U.S. paid $250 million for an aerial handshake.

22-23 July: Nearly 200 NASA managers, engineers, and scientists-
     headed by Dr. Edgar M. Cortright, Langley Research Center
     Director, and Viking Project Manager James S. Martin, Jr.-met at
     Kennedy Space Center for the Viking launch-readiness review.
                                   Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Deputy
     Those attending-including
     Associate Administrator, and Dr. Noel Hinners, Associate
     Administrator for Space Science-heard status reports on the launch
     vehicle, spacecraft, and launch and tracking preparations. Every-
     thing was â€œin excellent shapeâ€ for the 11 Aug. launch of the nationâ€™s
     first mission to land unmanned spacecraft on Mars, said Martin. â€œWe
     still have three weeks of work ahead, but time to do it in an orderly
     fashion, and no significant open items.â€™â€™
        Viking- A would be mated with the Titan- Centaur launch vehicle
     on 28 July, followed by specialized tests, including an operational
     readiness test 6 Aug. during which the entire NASA and contractor
     Viking team would go through the countdown and several hours of
     simulated flight.
        Problems discussed during the review included the x-band radio on
     the Viking-B Orbiter in which a defective coaxial cable had been
     replaced. A leak discovered in the Viking- A gas chromatograph
     mass spectrometer after sterilization was found to be so small-
     0.000864 cubic centimeters per day-that it would not affect the
     mission. (NASA Releases 75- 210, 75-216; KSC Release 156- 75)

          The committee appropriation allowed for no new starts but did
       permit an increase of $400 million in funding for the Space Shuttle.
       The committee supported manned NASA activities such as an interna-
       tional cooperative space-docking mission built on the successes of
       Apollo and Skylab programs, and the development of the Space Shut-
       tle as an economical, versatile transportation system to give a wide
       variety of users access to space. The committee also endorsed a space
       science flight program furthering knowledge of the earth, atmos-
       phere, moon, sun, planets, interplanetary space, and stars; a re-
       search and development program to identify and demonstrate useful
       applications of space techniques in areas such as weather and climate,
       pollution monitoring, earth-resources survey, earth and ocean
       physics, communications, and space processing; U.S. leadership in
       aeronautics and space programs; worldwide tracking and data ac-
       quisition support for NASAâ€™s   manned and unmanned programs; a pro-
       gram to assist in the development of national energy self-sufficiency;
       and a technology utilization program to speed dissemination of tech-
       nological and engineering information gained during NASA programs
       to government, industry, and other users.
          The committee restored $48.4 million for the two-spacecraft Pio-
       neer- Venus mission scheduled for launch in 1978; the House had cut
       the funds requested by NASA in the original budget. The Senate
       agreed with NASA that the project had high scientific priority, and that
       delaying it to a less opportune launch window when Venus was further
       from the earth would require redesign of the spacecraft and would
       cost $50 million more than originally planned.
          The committee also restored $1 million cut by the House from the $5
       million requested for definition studies and advanced technological
       development of the Large Space Telescope. The study was necessary
       for NASA to define an optimum design at minimum cost.
          The committee added $7 million to the $7 million NASA request for
       research and development to help understand and monitor physical
       and chemical processes in the upper atmosphere, emphasizing the
       need for studies of the depletion of stratospheric ozone.
          Because some committee members had had reservations about the
       high cost and safety hazards of the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz
       Test Project, the committee said it would like to be notified well in

    ∞Walter Cronkite, U.S. broadcaster who had covered the space program
0
     from its beginnings to date, reminisced about the space program
     during an interview with Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s Spaceport News.
      Cronkite recalled that news coverage in the early 1950s was done from
      the beach with very little official information. â€œAll we had were tips
      from engineers and others we met in bars.â€ By Alan B. Shepardâ€™s 5
      May 1961 launch, things had improved only slightly; coverage took
      place from the back of a station wagon with a microphone, monitor,
      and very little incoming information. Later launches had seen drastic
      changes. â€œWeâ€™ve got so much information today that itâ€™s the traffic
      copsâ€™ job to take care of the flow, whereas before it was more imagina-
      tion and fill-in-the-blanks.â€
         Asked if he would be interested in riding aboard the Space Shuttle,
      Cronkite said, â€œI think newsmen will go on the Shuttle. . . . Just as
      soon as we prove out the equipment. . . . I would guess that somehow
      or other weâ€™re going to see that a pool man gets aboard, and I hope itâ€™s
      me.â€
         Regarding the apparent apathy of the American public toward ihe
      space program, Cronkite stated that it would be difficult in this age to
      sustain the â€œhigh intensity of feeling about the space program, the
      race to the moon, [and] landing on the moon. . . . We donâ€™t have an
      attention span in the modern world, with so much going on, that per-
      mits us to remain at that high level of excitement.â€ (Spaceport News,

25 July: At an Apollo-Soyuz Test Project crew-status briefing, Richard S.
     Johnston, Director of Life Sciences, told reporters that Houston con-
     trol could not make voice contact with the crew during Apollo reentry
     [see 15-24 Julyj. The first medical bulletin on the astronautsâ€™ condi-
     tion, received at Houston several hours later, had informed Houston
     officials of the crewâ€™s eye and lung irritation. After splashdown, astro-
     nauts Thomas P. Stafford and Donald K. Slayton had noticed that
     fellow crewman Vance D. Brand had passed out. He had revived after
     about 1 min when Stafford adjusted his oxygen mask and ensured a
     proper flow of oxygen.
        Johnston also said that preliminary diagnostic procedures had indi-
     cated that the crew did not have â€œany apparent medical problem at
     that timeâ€ but that x-rays had shown increased hylar markings origi-
     nating from the center of the chest. The doctors elected to move the
     crew to sick bay and keep them under observation. The astronauts
     had been given cortisone to decrease the inflammation of their lung
     tissue and relieve the symptoms of cough and substernal discomfort.
        During the briefing, word came that the astronauts had arrived at
     Tripler Hospital in Hawaii where they would enter the intensive care
     unit. â€œThey walked in smiling and they looked happy,â€ said JSC
     Public Affairs Officer Robert V. Gordon. (ASTP Transcript PC- 56)
  ∞The House of Representativesâ€™ $48-million cut in NASAâ€™s Pioneer-
     Venus program [see 19 June] had taken the agency by surprise, a
     Science editorial reported. â€œNot only had the program been scru-
     tinized and endorsed by House and Senate authorization committees,
     but construction of the spacecraft, for which planning began 4 years
     ago, is now well advanced.â€ The potential loss was even more bitter
     because it was the â€œchild of the scientific community.â€
        Although the House action was intended not to eliminate Pioneer-
     Venus altogether but rather to delay it, to consider the relative
     priority between the project and the Large Space Telescope, â€œthey
     are not in any way comparable in their scientific objectives.â€ The
     House Appropriations Committeeâ€™s action seemed to be based on â€œa
     misunderstanding of the physical constraints of launching a space-
     craft to Venus.â€ Once the 1975 launch window had passed, the next
     o portunity would be in 1980, when the relative position of the two
      P
     p anets would require spacecraft approach at higher velocities that
     would call for a larger retro-propulsion motor and more fuel. These
     requirements would reduce the scientific payload, necessitate
     redesign, and waste much of the 40 million already spent.
        The subcommitteeâ€™s decision seemed to have been made abruptly
     <b
       without any real attempt at investigating the consequences.â€ The

     subcommittee staff had never asked NASA whether the mission could
     be delayed.
        Even more remarkable, said Science, was the motivation given
     for the action in the committee report: â€˜â€˜Some astronomers have been
     critical of NASAâ€™s Space Science Program because they contend that a
     disproportionate level of NASA dollars have been used on planetary
     astronomy missions, while little or no funds have been allocated to
     deep space astronomy which is the principal mission of the Large
     Space Telescope.â€ The public bickering over funds among scien-
     tists tended to give â€œthe budget cutters . . . a field day.â€
        To many space scientists, the deferral raised questions about the
     credibility of the long-range planning process for large science proj-
     ects. Scientists argued that â€œcutting the mission after it has already
     been approved by Congress and after money and considerable talent
     have been committed to its development may jeopardize efforts to
     design efficient spacecraft and plan a logical program of planetary
     exploration.â€ (Hammond, Science, 25 July 75, 270-71)

28 July: Soviet engineers had been working on a â€œspaceplaneâ€ to carry
     cosmonauts to and from orbit as part of along-term project to establish
     a major space platform in the 1980s, the Christian Science Monitor
     reported. Western observers had expected the reusable spacecraft to
     be launched by an expendable booster, but CSM reported that the
     rumored aim was to fly it from the back of a ramjet-powered boost
     vehicle that would return to base. The project was thought to be linked
     with development of a large multiman modular space station that the
     Soviets expected to assemble in orbit before 1980. CSM reported that
     U.S. Air Force reconnaissance satellites had noted preparations at the
     Baykonur Cosmodrome to retest the huge SLX- 14 booster, scheduled
     to launch the station. The SLX- 14 had been delayed for 5 yr by a series
     of mishaps: Two launch complexes had been built for the SLX- 14, one
     of which burned during a 1969 fueling test. Intelligence reports
     indicated it had been rebuilt.

    Although â€œthe future of cosmonautics is largely connected with long-
    term orbital stations,â€ he said, the fact that carrier rockets were
    extremely expensive and could be used only once was â€œbecoming a
    serious brake on the development of cosmonautics and relevant
    research.â€ Neither the airplane nor the spaceship had proven capable
    of flying into orbit and then reentering. But there is every reason to
    believe that in the not-so-distant future aviation and cosmonautics
    would â€œdraw appreciably closer together.â€ Shatalov said Soviet and
    U.S. scientists had already made important high-altitude and high-
    speed experiments. Shatalov visualized â€œa new-type spaceshipâ€
    consisting of a smaller one launched from a larger one after reaching
    required speed. The carrier craft would return to a landing field, and
    the smaller craft would orbit, accomplish its mission, and then land.
    â€œCreation of an apparatus with greater orbital maneuverability would
    . . . make it possible . . . to deliver satellites on orbits in the
    spacecraftâ€™s freight compartment, serve and repair them in space and
    bring back to earth samples of explorations and observations and even
    the satellites themselves if they go out of order.â€ Although â€œcreation
    of this new type of space apparatusâ€ posed a host of technical
    problems, â€œmodern science and technology can solve themâ€ and â€œthe

    social and economic challenges that could benefit from space-
    reported data; and to relate space goals and objectives to national
    ones.
       Al space objectives defined by the study group were evaluated
        l
    in terms of their contribution to national interests, which included
    expansion of human knowledge, physical benefits to the u.S. and
    humanity, contribution to the vitality of the nation, exploration of
    the unknown, national prestige and self-esteem, and international
    cooperation.
       The report suggested categorizing space missions as either earth-
    oriented or extraterrestrial. Earth-oriented programs for the rest of
    the century should help increase food production by improved weather
    and water-availability forecasting, improved crop forecasting,
    improved detection and monitoring of diseases and infestations in
    vegetation. The consequent economic benefits and stabilization of the
    commodity market could gain hundreds of millions of dollars per
    year.
       Other earth-oriented space programs should emphasize improved
    forecasting of seasonal and climatic trends, to aid in the managing
    of food and energy resources and associated transportation require-

     ments. Benefits from improved climate forecasting could reach hun-
     dreds of millions of dollars annually.
        The space program should also address itself to the challenge
     of the unknown by adding to manâ€™s knowledge of cosmic and human
     evolution and destiny. Spacecraft could take instruments above the
     â€œdark and dirty glassâ€ of earthâ€˜s opaque atmosphere, and should
     continue to carry instruments to other planets, setting up laboratories
     there as well as bringing samples back to earth for analysis. Extra-
     terrestrial missions should include textural, chemical, and isotopic
     planetary studies and comparisons of atmospheric trends for all
     planets and their satellites.
        Plans should also continue for human activities in space, using both
     the space shuttle and free-flying laboratories to repair and maintain
     orbiting spacecraft systems and perform research in space. Al-
     though the study panel had found it difficult to assert that manned
     orbiting or planetary bases should be undertaken in the next 25 yrs, it
     found that man was an integral and necessary part of the more creative
     space-exploration programs. If the US. was to avail itself of the
     potential benefits of space, the next logical step for NASAâ€™s  manned
     program could be development of a permanent space facility in which
     crews could work for extended periods. (H.R.transcript)

30 July: Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) and Rep. Charles A. Mosher
     (R-Ohio) introduced H.R. 9058, a revised bill to establish national
     science policy and organization, incorporating the most promising
     features of H.R. 4461 [see 6 March] and the Administration bill H.R.
     7830 [see 9 and 11June].
        The proposed bill included a statement of national policy similar
     to that in H.R. 4461, but with language recommended during an
     earlier 3 wk of hearings. The proposal to establish an Office of
     Science and Technology Policy was based on the Administration bill
     with three major changes: First, H.R. 9058 would give the President
     the power to appoint up to four assistant directors, giving him the
     potential of a three- to five-man council as he chose; this would give
    later Presidents more flexibility of organization. Second, the Presi-
     dent-appointed Director and assistants would be subject to confirma-
     tion by the Senate. Third, H.R. 9058 described the duties and func-
     tions of the new office more precisely than had the Administration
     bill.
        H.R. 9058 would establish, within the Executive Office of the
     President, a Federal Science and Technology Survey Committee to

    decreasing pressure field, and a new technique for reentry simula-

    nozzle mouth, simulating the transition from moderate to maximum
    temperature and pressure. Previous techniques could show only
    variations between distinctly different materials; use of the new

During July: The worldâ€™s news media commented on the joint u.s.-
    U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [see 15-24 July].
       A 15 July article in West Germanyâ€™s Frankfurter Allgemeine said
    that â€œtechnically the Apollo-Soyuz enterprise will show nothing
    much.â€ The reason for the mission had been political since it was
    agreed upon in 1972. It was â€œfully in line with the detente and rap-
    prochement policy of the two superpowers.â€ The astronautic field was
    particularly useful for propaganda because it could mark the â€œbegin-
    ning of an intellectual and scientific exchange of opinion of advantage
    to both sides.â€ However, â€œif one looks. . .at rapprochement in other
                            ..  , one must remain skeptical regarding â€˜at-

       Milika Sundic, a Yugoslavian commentator, said concerning ASTP,
    â€œNobody doubts its success, or. . .the good intentions and will of the
    two superpowers.â€ The technical aspect of the mission was least
    important, and the political side â€œconstitutes its essence.â€ The joint
    undertakings both on earth and in space reflected the superpowersâ€™
    belief in a â€œfull equilibrium of forces rather than trust in one another.â€
    This lack of trust was the consequence not only of different systems
    but different interests which went beyond national borders. The fact
    that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were leaders of two military alliances could
    not lead to greater trust between them. But, â€œwithout blocs and

      world.â€ One hoped that nobody intended to divide up space along bloc
      lines and that nobody would misuse it for solving this worldâ€™s prob-
      lems. â€œThird World countries may not be present at todayâ€™s rendez-
      vous in space, but they have a claim on the part played by science in the
      Soviet-American undertaking.â€ Regarding their rights on the earth,
      â€œthe Third World has no intention of renouncing them, and even less
      of abandoning the fate of peace to the big powers, for peace is indivisi-
      ble both on earth and in space.â€
         Hungaryâ€™s 15 July issue of Nepszabadsag said the joint space flight
      was a scientific undertaking inseparable from â€œnormalizationâ€ be-
      tween the two states and reflecting the advance of peaceful coexist-
      ence. The joint cosmic attempt called attention to the vast pos-
      sibilities inherent in dynamic scientific cooperation between the two
      countries in other, no less important, areas.
         Bulgariaâ€™s 15 July Rabotnichesko said in an editorial that ASTP not
      only would mark â€œa new stage in the development of space research
      and will open up new prospects for cooperation between the U.S.S.R.
      and U.S.A. but will also be a telling example to be followed by all other

      states and peoples on the earth.
         A 26 July commentary by a Peking correspondent in the Peopleâ€™s
      Republic of China said that the U.S.-U.S.S.R. handshake in
      space-despite the show and all the money spent to advertise it-
      could not â€œcover up their fierce struggle on earth.â€ In fact, the two
      superpowers â€œregard each other as the enemy in space. They have
      been contending for military superiority in space ever since the first
      satellite was launched.â€ The handshake was but a contention with
      â€œeach trying to cheat and outwit the other.â€
         Finlandâ€™s Karjalaimen called the joint mission â€œhistoricâ€ from the
      point of view of both space technology and world politics. The super-
      powers had found it necessary to begin together to regulate the worldâ€™s
      conflicts to prevent a world conflagration or wars that could endanger
      the interests of the superpowers. ASTP was one of the public symbols
      of this policy. (NCNA, FBIS-PRC, 28July 75, AI; FBIS-Bulgaria, 16July

3 August-6 November: Ariel 5, a U.S.-U.K. cooperative satellite launched
    15 Oct. 1974 to study galactic and extragalactic x-rays, detected weak
    cosmic x-ray emissions from the constellation Orion on 3 Aug. The

    emissions, subsequently confirmed by NASAâ€™s
    Small Astronomy Satellite launched 7 May 1975), steadily increased
    in intensity until they were five times greater than any observed to
    date. New York Times reporter Walter Sullivan quoted Dr. Terry
    Matilsky, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, as saying
    that when the emissions were first observed â€œwe couldnâ€™t believe it.â€
       Sas 3-operated by Goddard Space Flight Center-was able to
    pinpoint the location of the emissions to within 1 or 2 arc-min.
    With this clue scientists hoped to explain the phenomenon using
    ground-based optical and radio telescopes. Observataries around the
    world had been alerted and were trying to pinpoint the source.
       The Philadelphia Inquirer reported MITâ€™S Dr. Saul A. Rappaport
    as speculating that the emissions probably had been caused by
    masses of material falling from a large star into an extremely dense
    neutron star or black hole. The falling matter would heat up enough
    to emit bursts of x-rays and visible light.
       Dr. Noel Hinners, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science,
    reported 6 Nov. to the House Committee on Science and Technologyâ€™s
    Subcommittee on Science and Applications that the Explorer 53
    observations had identified the optical counterpart of the x-ray
    emissions as a faint, otherwise normal-looking star that had brightened
    100 times over previous observations. Dr. Hinners repeated Dr.
    Rappaportâ€™s theory and told the subcommittee that, because a similar
    brightening of this star had been observed in 1917, it was being
    classified as a recurrent nova. (1977 NASA authorization hearing

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1975                                  August
4 August: NASA announced completion of a program conducted by Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory to measure the constituent gases of the strato-
    sphere to help determine the effects on the earthâ€˜s ozone layer of
    gases released from aerosol spray cans. Using a Fourier interfer-
    ometer onboard a U-2 aircraft, JPL scientists had measured the dis-
    tribution of hydrogen chloride molecules at altitudes between 10 and
    21 km during 6 separate flights in May. Hydrogen chloride-produced
    by the breakdown of aerosol gas molecules in the upper atmosphere
    and released naturally, in small amounts, from the ocean surface and
    volcanic eruptions-was one of several trace gases thought to play a
    major role in controlling the equilibrium of the protective ozone layer.
    JPL had found traces of the chloride beginning at 15 km, and reaching
    a maximum of almost 1 part per billion at 20 km. Although the results
    did not represent a direct effect of aerosol gas, or Freons, on strato-
    spheric ozone, JPL scientists recommended continuing measure-
    ments to detect any future buildup.
       The ozone measurements, part of NASAâ€™s       Stratospheric Research
    Program, had begun when a JPL-designed instrument was flown on
    the Anglo -French Concorde supersonic transport in 1973. Data
    collected on these flights included the first detection of nitric oxide,
    along with new information on the geographic and vertical distribution
    of water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane, and
    furnished a base for the 1975 study. (NASA Release 75-223; Miles,
    LA Times,21 Aug 75)
∞The Vertical Motion Simulator (ms),      an aeronautical facility designed
    to reproduce up-and-down and sideways motions of aircraft during
    takeoff and landing, was being built at Ames Research Center, NASA
     announced. Costing about $3.5 million, the VMS would move as much
    as 18 m in height and 12 m sideways, accurately simulating flare and
    touchdown. Practice in the simulator would enable pilots to cope
    better with the complexities of flying sophisticated aircraft such as
     short takeoff and landing (STOL) and vertical takeoff and landing
    (VTQL) types. (NASA Release 75 -224)
∞Michael Collins, Director of the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s National Air
    and Space Museum, and Santiago Astrain, Secretary General of the
    International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, signed an
     agreement to transfer three early Intelsat communications satellites
    to the Museum as part of its 1976 inaugural display. INTELSAT was
    providing the museum with a backup model of the INTELSATâ€™S Early
    Bird 1, launched 6 Apr. 1965 as the first commercial comsat. A back-
    up model of the second-generation Intelsat II and an engineering
    model of third-generation Intelsat I11 satellites would also be sent for
    display. Fourth-generation satellites would not be represented because
    they were too large for display.
       The new Air and Space Museum, located in Washington, D.C.,was
     scheduled to open 4 July 1976. (INTELSAT Release 75-9)
  ∞Westar communications satellites would soon be used for communica-
    tions to and from offshore oil drilling platforms and exploratory
    vessels in waters adjacent to the continental U.S., Western Union
    Telegraph Co. announced. The offshore facilities previously had
     depended for communication on microwave relay networks and
    cabling, methods that had become increasingly expensive and im-
    practical as the facilities were moved farther and farther off shore.

∞Marshall Space Flight Center was seeking industry proposals for pro-
    curement of parallel definition studies of the atmospheric, magneto-
    spheric, and plasmas in space (AMPS) payload, a reusable research
    facility to be integrated with Spacelab. The proposed 12-mo studies
    were to define an overall AMPS program with special emphasis on
    ground- and flight-support systems and subsystems, systems engi-
    neering and integration, and groundorbital operations with the Space
    Shuttle and Spacelab.
       AMPs, a single laboratory system flown with the Space Shuttle,
    would perform experiments and observations in atmospheric science,
    magnetospheric physics, and plasma physics. (MSFC Release 75 -172)

5 August: The Saturn IB, used to launch three U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test
    Project astronauts into space [see 15-24 July], had experienced no
    unscheduled holds whatever during countdown, making it the most
    perfect launch of the Saturn series, Ellery B. May, manager of the
    Saturn Program Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center, said.
    Saturn 210, manufactured in 1967, was 10th of the IB series and had
    the oldest engine used. All Saturn launches had been successful and
    had met their objectives; although some had anomalies, such as leaks
    or faulty wiring, no major configuration cha es were ever necessary.

        The ASTP mission marked the end of t e Saturn series, but its
    impact on technology would continue. â€œSpace Shuttle main engines
    (Ssm)are an outgrowth of technology from Saturn engines,â€ May
    explained. The major difference between the two was that the Shuttle

∞The wingless unpowered X-24B lifting body had made its first landing
    on a concrete runway at Edwards, Calif., to demonstrate maneuver
    and safe landing of an unpowered reentry vehicle on a conventional
    runway. After launch from a B -52 aircraft flying at 14 000 m, test pilot
    John N. Manke, chief Flight Research Center got for the X-24B

    speed of 1381 km per hr and altitude of 18 300 m. Manke then shut off
    the engine and glided to a perfect 300-kph landing on the 4600-m
    runway.
       The 11.3-m-long X-24B was a part of a joint NASA-Air Force pro-
    gram to study transonic flight characteristics and landing ability of a
    vehicle designed for hypersonic speeds. (FRC Release 24-75; LA

∞Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) defended the nationâ€™s space program
    during a tour of Space Shuttle facilities at Rockwell International
    Corp. in Downey, Calif. According to Sen. Tunney, the most impor-
    tant justification for the space program was to provide new technology
    in weather mapping and control, to help increase the amount of land
    available for food production, and to locate additional stocks of natural
    resources in this country. Sen. Tunney stated, â€œI quite frankly think
    without a space program. . .mankind is going to have a rendezvous
                                                 .
    with destiny which would be catastrophic. . .â€ But with this kind of
    program, a world food supply and adequate resources can â€œkeep this
    country going indefinitely. â€ (Pasadena Star News, 6 Aug 75)
  ∞An Ames Research Center wind tunnel used primarily for testing the
    Space Shuttle had been shut down after a steel flange failed, setting
    off a high-powered explosion of compressed gas. The blast scattered
    hundreds of hot aluminum oxide pebbles over a wide area, causing
    several fires but no serious injuries. Space Shuttle testing had been
    postponed until the facility, which generated pressures up to 126
    kg/cm2 (1800 psi) in testing models at 14 times the speed of sound,
   could be declared operational again. An investigation board was
    formed to determine the cause of the accident and recommend actions
    to prevent recurrence. (ARC Astrogram, 14 Aug 7.51; ARC Experimen-

∞Two Boeing Co. scientists had proposed construction of a 64-million-kg
    solar power satellite, with 57 sq km of mirrors, to collect and concen-
    trate solar energy, together with thermal engines to convert solar
    power into electricity, the Christian Science Monitor reported. A
    microwave transmission system would convert the electricity to a
    form suitable for transmission to earth. CSM quoted Boeing as saying
    that within 2 decades â€œPowersatâ€ could provide up to 10 000 mw of
    useful power, twice the hydroelectric capacity of Grand Coulee Dam.

      needed to monitor third-stage ignition of the launch vehicle. The
      launch had been rescheduled to 8 Aug. at 6:48 pm PDT. COS-B would

      spacecraft scheduled to approach Venus in October would no doubt
      uncover a host of new unnamed features. Names for known features
      on Venus, Mars, and the moon would be officially chosen at the August
      1976 meeting of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), world
      clearinghouse for solar-system nomenclature. (Jones, CSM, 7 Aug

8 August: NASA launched C o s B scientific satellite for the European
    Space Agency at 3:48 pm PDT from Western Test Range on a three-
      stage thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster. Launch had been de-
      layed for 2 days because a telemetry aircraft was grounded with
      hydraulic-valve failure. The satellite entered the planned highly ellip-
      tical polar orbit with a 99 886-km apogee, 344-km perigee, 36.7-hr
      period, and 90.13â€inclination. NASAâ€™s   objective for the launch was to
      place Cos-B into a highly elliptical near-polar orbit with sufficient
      accuracy to allow the satellite to conduct its planned scientific exper-
      iments.
         Purpose of the Cos-B mission was to study extraterrestrial gamma
      radiation in the energy range 25 mev to 1 gev in order to establish the
      intensity of the average gamma-ray flux; examine large-scale aniso-
      tropy of the radiation over angular regions corresponding to galactic
      features; study quasars, x-ray, and radio sources of small angular size
      in supernova remnants; measure energy spectra of various galactic
      radiations; and study time variations of radiation from pulsars, x-ray,
      and radio sources.
         On 11 August, ground controllers sent low-voltage commands from
      ESAâ€™S space operations center (ESOC) in West Germany to check out
      spacecraft and experiment performance. After a second switch-on at
      high voltage, a series of inflight tests further validated all onboard
      systems and experiment performance. On 15 Aug. a complete review
      of spacecraft operational status showed all air and ground systems
      were operating normally; by 19 Aug., the first data had been returned
      to earth.
         Cos-Byfirst satellite launched for the newly organized ESA, was the
      eighth developed by ESAâ€™s predecessor, the European Space Research

     Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH, C o s B had been designed and
     built by organizations in 7 of the 1OESA member countries. The single
     experiment-a 115-kg spark chamber-had been assembled from five
     primary and two subsidiary experiment units supplied by six institutes
     in four European countries. After separating from the launch vehicle,
     C o s B transmitted data in real time to ground stations of the European
     Space Tracking Network with central control at the European Space
     Research Operations Center in West Germany.
        For NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center had the responsibility for
     the Thor-Delta launch vehicle under the direction of the Office of
     Space Science. GSFC also had responsibility for limited tracking sup-
     port. (NASA MOR S-492-301-75-01,           22 July 75, 10 Sept. 75; NASA

  ∞Science magazine reported that U.S. scientists had reprogrammed
               Landsat 1 earth resources satellite (formerly called Erts 1,
     NASAâ€™s
     launched 23 July 1972) to photograph large areas of the Soviet Union,
     although not specifically requested to do so by Soviet officials. The
     magazine reported that the intent of the u.S. scientists was to aid
     Soviet scientists, after discussions at a series of 1972 joint working
     group meetings4onvened for geological studies of comparable land
     sites in each country-indicated that the Soviets had nothing available
     to them equivalent to this kind of satellite imagery. Because the Soviet
     government was sensitive about u.S. satellites flying over the
     U.S.S.R., the Soviet scientists who were to benefit had never been
     directly informed about the reprogramming decision. Resulting im-
     ages had never been directly handed over to the Soviet scientists lest
     doing so should violate the 1972 joint space agreement signed by both
     countries. Science quoted Goddard Space Flight Centerâ€™s Dr. WiUiam
     Nordberg, scientist responsible for the reprogramming, as saying,
     â€œThey knew where they could buy them.â€ Science also reported that
     the Soviet scientists had ordered the Landsat images from the U.S.
     Geological Surveyâ€™s Sioux Falls distribution center. Dr. Nordberg
     denied that any of the reprogrammed imagery had been done for
       economic espionage.â€ (Science, 8 Aug 75, 444-2)

∞Photographs from Landsat 1 (launched 23 July 1972 as Erts 1 , Earth
    Resources Technology Satellite) indicated that a continental collision
    had been in progress between India and Eurasia, pushing China
    eastward at the rate of 2.54 centimeters a year, Massachusetts Insti-
    tute of Technology scientists reported in Science. This eastward
    movement could account for Chinaâ€™s unusual pattern of
    earthquakes-widespread instead of along narrow fault lines, the MIT
    geologists suggested. Despite the current theory that the Indian sub-
    continent was sliding under Eurasia, the MIT scientists had concluded
    that rigid Indian plates of rock were causing China to be pushed into
    the Pacific. (Molnar et al., Science, 8 Aug 75,419-425; NYT, 10 Aug

10 August: During a panel discussion at a 4-day meeting of the Astronomi-
    cal Association of Northern California, scientists rejected the idea
    that inhabitants of other planets would send manned spacecraft or
    unidentified flying objects to establish contact with earth. Such a
    venture would require enormous expenditures of energy and funds.
     The Washington Star quoted Ames Research Center scientist John
     Billingham as saying, â€œThe most logical way to establish contact is

    of intelligent extraterrestrial life, and how to reach it if it existed. He
    said that several persons around the globe had been constantly trying
    to make radio contact with outer space by aiming a radio telescope at a
    suitable star, hoping that an inhabited planet might be orbiting. (UPI,

∞Contrary to the impression of peaceful cooperation created by the
    U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project docking mission [see
    15-26 July], both countries had increasingly emphasized the military
    potential of manned space flight, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported
    the Center for Defense Information as saying. The Center, a private
    organization critical of defense spending, charged that the 1967
    United Nations treaty which reserved outer space for peaceful uses
    had not prevented either country from exploiting space for mili-
    tary purposes. Although the Pentagon had listed its space spending at
    $2.25 billion, it had acknowledged the existence of another $667 mil-
    lion in Air Force â€œmiscellaneousâ€ requests for secret space programs.
    The Center said that, although the Soviet Unionâ€™s space program was
     15 yrs behind the U.S., frequent launches indicated that they were
    attempting to catch up. The Center concluded that, contrary to the
    spirit of the outer space treaty, space technology and systems were
    being developed that had the potential for new confrontations be-
    tween the superpowers. (UPI, P Znq, 10 Aug 75)
∞Launch of the Viking-A spacecraft to Mars was postponed because of

     onstrate the use of minicomputers for experiment operation, con-
     trol, and data management, and the real-time interaction of payload
     specialists with experiment operations. The superfluid helium exper-
     iment examined characteristics of helium droplets at temperatures
     near 2.2 K (-512T), which would help in developing cryogenic
     techniques for use in Spacelab. The optical astronomy experiment,
     which demonstrated remote experiment operation by obtaining data
     from a Ferson 40.6-cm telescope 9.2 kilometers away, gave practice in
     investigator-experiment interaction and helped in developing comput-
     er control techniques, display requirements for telescope operation
     and data management, and astronomy training requirements for crew
     members. The four life-sciences experiments included studies of
     sporophore formation, the vestibular function, a clinical diagnostic
     system, and muscle-like contractile protein. Investigators also par-
     ticipated in an experiment to demonstrate the use of a computer in
     real-time mission planning, scheduling, and applications.
        By involving investigators in the CVT simulations, NASA would be
     able to plan the most cost-effective use of Spacelab. (MSFC Release

∞The development of space law, which had begun about the time of the
      launch of U.S.S.R.â€™s Sputnik 1 in 1957, was a unique process. â€œThe
      problems are both literally and symbolically out of this world,â€ NASA
      General Counsel Neil S. Hosenball said in an interview with the
      Orlando Sentinel Star. Does any state have the right to claim the
      natural resources of celestial bodies? Were earthâ€˜s criminal and civil
      laws applicable in space? What was the difference between
      establishing a planetary base and planting a nationâ€™s flag? Which
      court would rule on extraterrestrial squabbles? These were some of
      the questions lawyers and politicians would have to consider in the
      space age. Few precedents existed, and no judge had yet heard a case
      in a legal dispute originating outside the earthâ€˜s atmosphere. In fact, a
      world court, recognized by all major powers, did not exist.
         In 1962, a United Nations ad hoc committee on peaceful uses of
      outer space had developed principles later incorporated into the 1967
      Outer Space Treaty. These included a ban against military activity in
      outer space and against any nationâ€™s claiming a section of space or a
      planet as its own. Other treaties dealt with specific points such as the
      rescue of astronauts and the registration of spacecraft and space
      stations. Hosenball stressed that most charters and treaties were
      drawn up ahead of time in anticipation of problems likely to occur as
      space exploration expanded. The Sentinel quoted G. P. Zhukov, chief
      legal counsel of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, as saying that
      detente between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had been assisted by the
                                                .
      success of â€œlegal regulation in space. . . Manâ€™s foot had not yet
      stepped on the surface of-the moon and we had already formulated
      what man could and could not do on the moon. The law was ahead of
      science.â€ (Orlando Sentinel Star, 12 Aug 75)
    ∞NASA commemorated the 15th anniversary of the 12 Aug. 1960launch of

     Echo 1, worldâ€™s first communications satellite. Visible to millions
      around the world, the 30-m gas-inflated mylar (0.0013-cm thick
      aluminum-coated plastic) balloon served as a passive radio reflector in
      space, bouncing signals from one point on earth to another. Its first
      transmission sent the recorded voice of President Eisenhower from

    Goldstone, Calif., to Holmdel, N.J.; during its first year in orbit, it
    served in approximately 150 experiments, including voice, teletype
    and facsimile communications. Echo 1â€™s large size, small mass, and
    extreme sensitivity to solar radiation pressures and aerodynamic drag
    helped scientists confirm orbital behavior theory.
       Despite its original 1-yr life expectancy, Echo 1 remained in orbit for
    nearly 8 yr until, leaking gas through its skin bombarded by
    meteorites, it reentered the atmosphere and burned up 23 May 1968.

13 August: Dr. Wernher von Braun-German-born rocketry pioneer and
    former Marshall Space Flight Center Director and NASA Deputy
    Associate Administrator-had undergone successful surgery at Johns
    Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore for removal of a malignant
    tumor, the Washington Post reported. (AP, W Post, 13 Aug 75)
  ∞The launch of Viking A had been postponed for the second time [see 11
    Aug.] when Jet Propulsion Laboratory technicians discovered that the
    batteries had dropped from their normal charge of 37 volts to 9 volts.
    The batteries had been drained because a motorized rotary switch
    that should have remained off until 7 min before launch had
    accidentally turned on. The dangerously low voltage decided officials
    to remove the entire spacecraft from the launch vehicle and return it
    to the spacecraft assembly and encapsulation facility for trouble-
    shooting. At the same time, the Viking-B spacecraft, in a planned
    holding mode before mating with its launch vehicle, would be moved
    to the launch complex to replace its ailing sistercraft and become the
    Viking-A mission. The launch had been rescheduled for 20 Aug., with
    the launch window opening at 5:22 pm. (Viking Status Bulletin No 10,
    20 Aug 75; NASA Audio News, 14 Aug 75; Oâ€™Toole, WPost, 14 Aug 75,

14 August: A team of four physicists-Dr. Paul B. Price and Dr. Edward
     K. Shirk of the Univ. of Calif., and Dr. Weyman A. Osborne and Dr.
     Lawrence S. Pinsky of the Univ. of Houston-reported              finding
     evidence of a particle with only one magnetic pole. The discovery of
     the monopole, if confirmed, could have a major impact on physics,
     with practical applications such as new medical therapies, new
     sources of energy, extremely small and efficient motors and
     generators, and new particle accelerators of much higher energy than
     any yet built.
       The monopole, representing the basic indivisible unit of magnet-
     ism, would exist in two forms of opposite polarity, the north pole and
     the south pole. This would be analogous to the basic electric charge,
    the electron, which existed in the positive and negative charges, the
     proton and electron. Existence of the monopole had been predicted in
     1931 by Paul Dirac, Fla. State Univ. professor.
       The four physicists detected tracks of the particle that had ap-
    parently penetrated a sandwich of more than 33 layers of plastic and
    emulsion photographic film suspended from a balloon floating at
    39 600 m. (Sullivan, NYT, 15 Aug 75, 1; AP, B Sun, 15 Aug 75, A3;

∞U.S. intelligence reports indicated that the Soviet Union had fired 22
     missiles and orbited 9 satellites in July, making it one of the most
    active months in Soviet space history, the Baltimore Sun reported. In
    an impressive display on 2 July, the Soviets fired 11 ballistic missiles

    from four different sites within an hour, launched eight SSN-6
    submarine-based rockets at &see intervals, and launched an SS-7,
    SS-8, and SS-11 all within 2 min. Other tests included submarine
    missile launchings by northern and far eastern fleets, medium- and
    intermediate-range missile firings from Kapustin Yar,and a test flâ€™ ht
    of the new SS-17 missile which could carry four warheads. ?he
    monthâ€™s only failure was the malfunction of the second stage of a
    ss-19 missile, a vehicle believed to be capable of delivering six
    nuclear warheads to separate targets over ranges of 9260 km.
       The nine satellite launches included six Cosmos satellites, a
    Molniya communications satellite, a Meteor meteorological satellite,
    and the manned Soyuz 19, the Soviet spacecraft participating in the
    joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. (Corddry, B Sun, 14 Aug 75, A2)
  ∞The first 10 automatic landings of a powered-lift short-takeoff-and-
    landing (STOL) aircraft equipped with a STOLAND automatic flight-
    control system had been completed by Ames Research Center
    personnel at the Naval Auxiliary Landing Field in Calif. The STOLAND
    system, a versatile onboard digital computer, provided the pilot with
    navigation, guidance, and control information. Automatic controls,
    including control of the aircraftâ€™s lift with automatic flaps and
    augmenter nozzles, permitted steeper climbouts, approaches, and
    landings, offering potential relief for airport traffic congestion. Half
    the aircraftâ€™s lift was provided by engine thrust, permitting flight att
    much lower speeds than conventional aircraft.
       The STOLAND system was developed by Sperry Flight Systems for
    use in the joint NASA-Dept. of Transportation operating experiments
    program and the augmentor-wing handling qualities and flight-control
    programs. (NASA Release 75-226)
15 August: Flight Research Center pilot Einar Enevoldson, in a ground-
    based instrumented cockpit, guided the remotely piloted research
    vehicle (RPRV) to its first unpowered landing, at FRC. Following air-
    launch from a B-52 aircraft flying at 14.6 km, the 7.3-ti three-
    eighths-scale vehicle performed maneuvers to measure control
    effectiveness during spinning flight. The spin was continued until
    4.6-km altitude when Enevoldson deployed the landing geav and
    performed a series of stability and control maneuvers. He initiated
    final approach at 1524m altitude. The RPRVlanded on the dry lakebed
    using small steel skids individually mounted on the ends of three
    conventional automobile shock absorbers installed inside the air-
    craftâ€™s fuselage.
       The RPRV had been developed by FRC to provide a more economical
     and far less hazardous means of flight-testing new vehicles. Earlier
     versions of the RPRV had been recovered in midair using a parachute
     and helicopter. (FRC Release 26-75; FRC Proj O f Rezek, interview,

∞Kennedy Space Center deactivated its hyperbaric decompression
     chamber after 6 yr of operation. The chamber had never been used for
    its intended purpose-to save the lives of astronauts in the event of a
    malfunction during atmospheric chamber tests-but had treated 12
    local civilian divers for the bends, a painful crippling illness caused by
    formation of nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream when a diver moves
    too quickly from high-pressure water depths to the surface.

       The $100 000 chamber intended for the manned space program had
    been opened to public use by the center director. With the end of the
    Apollo program and the next manned flight 4 yr in the future, the
    decision was made to deactivate the chamber. The Orlando Sentinel
    Star quoted Russell P. Lloyd, KSC engineer in the Support Operations
    biv., as saying the possibility existed that the chamber would be
    reactivated for the Space Shuttle program, but for the time being it
    would remain closed. (Lloyd, interview, 19 Sept 77; Upchurch,

∞NASA and the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences had agreed on a joint tour
    of the U.S. and the Soviet Union by the 5 crew members of the Apollo-
    Soyuz Test Project mission [see 15-26 July]. U.S. astronauts Thomas
    P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton would join Soviet
    cosmonauts Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov on 21 Sept. in
    Moscow for a 2-wk tour of the U.S.S.R. Plans for the U.S. tour were
    not disclosed. (NASA Release 75-230)
18-20 August: A workshop on â€œOperational Applications of Satellite
    Snowcover Observationsâ€ was held at Lake Tahoe, Nev., to discuss
    recent progress in extracting meaningful snowcover information from
    satellites. Albert Rango, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist,
    reported that, with the cooperation of nine Federal and state agencies,
    NASA had developed an applications systems verification test
    (ASVTtusing data from satellites and instrumented aircraft, conven-
    tional ground information, and prediction models-to quantitatively
    determine the usefulness of remote-sensing technology in an
    operational applications system.
       In another paper Rango reported that low-resolution meteorological
    satellite data and high-resolution earth-resources satellite data had
    been used to map a snow-covered area over Wyoming mountains.
    Predictions based on satellite data of the April through June 1972
    streamflow were within 3% of the actual total. Also, composite results
    from 2 yr of data over the mountains indicated that Landsat snowcover
    observations could be useful in predicting runoff and seasonal
                .

       James C. Barnes of Environmental Research and Technology, Inc.,
    reported that the earth resources experiment package @REP) flown
    aboard the 1973-74 Skylab Orbital Workshop missions had provided
    the first opportunity to examine reflectance characteristics of snow-
    cover in several spectral bands from the visible to the near infrared.
    Results indicated that near-infrared methods could distinguish
    between snow and water droplet clouds and could detect areas of
    melting snow. (NASA H q WB, 28 Feb 76, 2; NASA SP-391, text)
18-21 August: Evidence of a 10th planet existing in earthâ€˜s solar system
    16 million yrs ago was presented at the 146th annual meeting of
    the American Astronomical Society in San Diego by Dr. Thomas
    C. Van Flandern, U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer. Studying the
    orbits of 60 long-period comets, including 1974â€˜s Kohoutek, Dr. Van
    Flandern had concluded they had shared a common origin 16 million
    yr ago-
       The evidence was consistent with calculations made in 1971 by
    Canadian astronomer Dr. Michael W. Ovenden. Dr. Ovendenâ€™s
    studies of irregularities in the orbits of planets, especially Uranus and
    Neptune, suggested that a major disruptive event had occurred in the

    solar system approximately 16 million yrs ago. He had arrived at this
    time by age-dating carbon-bearing meteorites that had fallen to earth,
    and theorized that the event could be explained by the explosion of a
    huge planet 90 times the size of earth.
       During the meeting Dr. Stuart Bowyer, Univ. of Calif. astronomer,
    surprised the 740 astronomers attending the meeting by reporting that
    a Univ. of Calif. telescope flown aboard the Apollo spacecraft during
    the joint U.S. 4J.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [see 15-26 July]
    had picked up the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation of a star. EuV, a
    small segment of the spectrum between normal ultraviolet and x-rays,
    had been considered by astronomers as practically invisible because
    of probable absorption by interstellar dust and gas. Dr. Bowyer said
    that the      had come from a white dwarf star 300 light yrs away in the
    constellation Coma Berenices. (NASA Gen Mgmt Review Rpt, 18 Aug

19 August: The Soviet Union might attempt to land an automatic micro-
    biological laboratory on Mars before the U.S. Viking spacecraft,
    whose twice-delayed launch is now scheduled for 20 Aug., could
    arrive, the Christian Science Monitor reported Finnish astronomer
    Heikka Oja as telling the British Interplanetary Society. By launching
    a probe between 17 Sept. and 3 Oct. and using higher speeds and
    shorter trajectories, the Russians could reach Mars in May 1976,2 mo
    before the scheduled Viking arrival. Between 1971 and 1973 the
    Soviets had made 4 attempts to land probes on Mars; only Mars 3
    (launched 28 May 1971) succeeded in softlanding a capsule (on 2 Dec.
    1971). Landing in a dust storm, it ceased transmitting after 20 sec.
    Oja said the Soviets hoped to repeat this experiment, this time in a
    region near the south polar cap of Mars where the thin, mostly carbon
    dioxide atmosphere might contain moisture. (Gatland, C S M , 19 Aug

20 August: Viking 1 was successfully launched at 5:22 pm EDT from East-
    ern Test Rangeâ€™s Launch Pad 41 on a Titan III-Centaur launch
    vehicle. The launch, first scheduled for 11Aug., had been postponed
    until 14 Aug. to replace a faulty thrust-vector control valve on the
    launch vehicle [see 11Aug.]. A second delay had occurred when the
    spacecraftâ€™s internal batteries had discharged to 9 volts, well below
    safe limits [see 13 Aug.]. The spacecraft, Viking A, had been removed
    from the launch vehicle and replaced by Viking B. The range safety
    officer had issued a waiver of standard procedures and permitted
    removal and installation of the spacecraft without detanking and
    depressurizing the launch vehicle, thus allowing the launch to be re-
    scheduled for 20 Aug,
       Viking 1 , consisting of a 2360-kg orbiter attached to an 1180-kg
    lander, was placed in a trajectory to Mars within the designed 3-sigma
    limits. Nearly 35 min after trajectory insertion, the Centaur stage
    separated from the spacecraft. The solar panels were deployed and
    oriented toward the sun, and the biocap-a container used to hermeti-
    cally seal the lander while in earthâ€˜s atmosphere-was jettisoned. On

    27 Aug. at 2:30 pm EDT a trajectory-correction maneuver targeted the
    spacecraft to its Mars orbital insertion point. By 28 Aug. a l systems
                                                                 l
    aboard the spacecraft were operating normally and in a cruise mode.
    Travel time to Mars was estimated at 10 mo, with a possible Mars
    landing on 4 July 1976, the height of the U.S. Bicentennial. A second
    spacecraft, Viking B, had been scheduled for a 1 Sept. launch to
    arrive at Mars in 12 mos.
       The Viking missions supported NASA's    planetary program goals of
    exploring the solar system and gaining knowledge of its origin and
    evolution, and of the origin and evolution of life and of the dynamic
    processes that shaped man's terrestrial environment. Specific pur-
    pose of the two Viking missions was to increase knowledge of Mars by
    making observations from Mars orbit and by direct measurements in
    the atmosphere and on the surface, with particular emphasis on
    biological, chemical, and environmental data on past or present exist-
    ence of life on the planet.
       Viking 1 was targeted to land in the Martian equatorial region, in a
    very low area resembling the fluvial plain of a dry river bed-an ideal
    site to search for organic material. Alternate sites for both Viking
    landers had been selected and there would be some flexibility until
    insertion into Mars orbit, after which the available band of landing
    sites would be narrowed by orbital geometry. Once in orbit, the orbiter
    would survey prospective landing sites; when the decision on where to
    land had been made, retrorockets would separate the lander from the
    orbiter and the lander would descend to the surface, sequentially
    braked by its aeroshell's drag, by a parachute, and finally by its
    retrorockets. After landing, the science instrumentation would be
    activated and exploration would begin; data would be transmitted
    back to earth by the lander radio or through a radio-relay link with the
    orbiter.
       The orbiter's main body, an octagonal ring 46 cm high with alter-
    nating 140- and 51-cm sides, consisted of 16 modular compartments.
    The entire structure was 10 m across the tips of the extended solar
    panels and 3.3 m high from the lander attachment points to the launch
    vehicle. Besides propulsion, navigation and control, communications,
    power, computer, and data-storage subsystems, the orbiter carried its
    science instrumentation mounted on a scan platform that could move
    with 2 degrees of freedom. The three science instruments were twin
    high-resolution, slow-scan TV cameras; an infrared atmospheric
    water detector; and a high-resolution infrared thermal mapper for
    detecting surface-temperature variations.
       The lander was a six-sided aluminum and titanium box 46.2
    cm deep and enclosed top and bottom by cover plates; it measured
    3 m wide and 2 m high from the footpads to the top of the S-band
    antenna. The six sides measured 109 cm and 56 cm alternately, with
    the three landing legs attached to the three narrower sides. The
    three retrorockets were mounted at 120" intervals on the lander;
    generating up to 2838 newtons (638 lbs) thrust, they would be
    ignited at an altitude of 1220 m to slow the lander's descent from
    222 kph to 9 kph at landing. Four small engines provided attitude
    control.
       In addition to subsystems for thermal control, power, and com-
    munications, the lander carried six instruments: twin scanning TV

     cameras, a sophisticated biology laboratory, a gas chromatograph
     mass spectrometer, an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a meteorol-
     ogy instrument, and a seismometer. Used with numerous tempera-
     ture, pressure, and magnetic sensors, the instruments would perform
     entry, landed, and radio experiments.
                 investigation of Mars had begun in 1964 with the launch of
        NASAâ€™s
     Manner 4 . That spacecraftâ€™s flyby on 15 July 1965 had revealed the
     planet to be moonlike with a dry, barren, cratered surface showing
     little evidence of wind or water erosion and no magnetic field. The
     better instrumented Mariners 6 and 7 that flew by the planet during
     the summer of 1969 reported a chaotic view of jumbled ridges and
     valleys unlike anything found on the earth or moon. The spacecraft
     also showed wide featureless expanses where craters had been some-
     how eroded, suggesting that Mars had been geologically active.
     Mariner 6 and 7 photographs showed a thin layer of snow-probably
     carbon dioxide-and       instruments measured a thin atmosphere of
     mostly carbon dioxide.
        High-quality photographs from Mariner 9 , placed in Martian orbit
     on 13 Nov. 1971, provided evidence of fluid erosion, glacial action,
     and volcanoes. The Viking missions had continued the Mariner ex-
     plorations of Mars.
        Viking was managed by Langley Research Center under overall
     direction of NASAâ€™s   Office of Space Science; LaRC also had manage-
     ment responsibility for the lander system designed and built by Martin
     Marietta Corp. Jet Propulsion Laboratory designed and built the
     orbiter system. The Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was the respon-
     sibility of Lewis Research Center; LaRC managed launch and flight
     operations executed by Martin Marietta, Kennedy Space Center, and
     JPL. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for tracking and
     data systems, and JPL managed the mission control and computing-
     center system. (NASA MORS S-815-15-01/02, 1 Aug 75,28 Aug 75,

∞Doctors had rechecked x-rays of Apollo-Soyuz Test Project astronaut
     Donald K. Slaytonâ€™s lungs taken before the 15 July launch and found
     that they also had shown a shadow revealed by postflight x-rays, Dr.
     Arnauld E. Nicogossian, NASAâ€™s      ASTP physician, said at a Johnson
     Space Center press briefing. Dr. Nicogossian said that the spot had
     not been noticed before because the x-rays were difficult to read and
     the spot had been covered by normal vasculature and bony structure.
     Only a 6 Aug. tomogram [see 25 Aug.] had verified that the shadow
     was a lesion. Dr. Nicogossian said the nitrogen tetroxide inhaled by
     the ASTP astronauts during reentry [see 15-26 July] had not been
     shown to have caused or increased the size of the lesion.

      Atmospheric Administration program designed to assess U.S. wheat-
      crop yields and to forecast production, could develop into a worldwide

      elevated in status and budget priority by President Ford, LACIE could
      accurately measure a worldwide grain feast or famine each year,
      identifying regions of big harvests and potential shortages, vital in
      allocating world food supplies to meet the needs of growing world
      population. Ter Horst quoted an advisor of President Ford as saying
      that, if the L A C E system were in worldwide operation, â€œwe would
      know what the Russian grain crop was likely to be, what they would be
      buying, and just how much of our crop we could afford to sell them.â€
         Ter Horst added that intelligence sources indicated the Russians
      had already measured U.S. crops by satellite. â€œIf true, that could
      explain the confidence of Russian grain-purchasing moves this year.
      It also indicates an accelerated U.S. political need to play catch-up in
      this phase of the space race.â€ (ter Horst, LA Times, 20 Aug 75)

      cluded a 10-wk (16 June-22 Aug.) NASA- Stanford University study at
      Ames Research Center by recommending that the U.S. adopt a space
      colonization program using available technology. The â€œcity in spaceâ€
      envisioned by the study group could be a 1.5-km-wide wheel-shaped
      habitat for 10 000 persons positioned on the moonâ€™s orbit at a point
      385 000 km from both earth and moon. Costing an estimated $100
      billion, the 454-million-kg wheel, or torus, would rotate around its hub
      at 1rpm to simulate earthâ€˜s gravity. The rim would house inhabitants
      as well as shops, schools, light industry, and closed-loop agriculture;
      heavy industry could be located outside to take advantage of
      weightlessness and high vacuum in space.
         A major commercial activity of the first colony would be to construct
      solar-power satellites. Placed in geosynchronous orbit above the
      earth, the satellites would collect and convert sunlight into energy and
      beam it to earth as low-density microwaves.
         The space colony would have several advantages that might make it
      self-supporting: weightlessness for manufacturing and transporta-
      tion, massive use of lunar minerals, and continuous natural sunlight
      for increased agricultural productivity. The study group had con-
      sidered social, cultural, safety, and ecological difficulties of a space
      colony, but had found â€œno unsurmountable problems that would pre-
      vent humans from living in space.â€ (NASA Releases 75-229,75-249;

    ∞The press commented on the mission of the Viking spacecraft to Mars
0
      [see 20 Aug.]. The WashingtonPost said that the essence of the space
      program had been â€œto provide mankind with new knowledge, not in

      but in hopes that it will expand our understanding of the universe in
                           ...
      which we live and           enable us to reach better solutions to our

      Viking missions had opened a new era in which the search for knowl-
      edge was to be done largely by machines; the rewards promised to be
      rich, beyond measure in strictly monetary terms.

      represented â€œan opportunity for mankindâ€˜s self-awareness to take a

    greater stride away from earth-centered thinking than was afforded by
    Neil Armstrongâ€™s historic step on to the moon.â€ Discovering organic
    life on Mars would strengthen the conviction that life existed
    abundantly throughout the universe and that we were not alone. Some
     had questioned whether the U.S. should spend a billion dollars on
    such aprogram when resources were hard pressed on earth, but anew
    discovery, that life was not a meaningless chance but part of a grand
    design, could give new inspiration to humanityâ€™s efforts to deal with
    earthly problems.
       Here was a challenge for the architects of dAtente, the Monitor
    asserted. The U.S. and Russia had been needlessly duplicating scien-
    tific efforts, their cooperation amounting to little more than â€œarmâ€™s-
    length information exchange.â€ The two countries had much to share.
    (6
      By abandoning costly competition for a truly joint program, the two
    countries could gain from each otherâ€™s capabilities, minimize the cost
    to each of them, and pursue this cosmic outreach on behalf of all man-
    kind.â€ (W Post, 22 Aug 75, A24; CSM, 22 Aug 75, 28)

24 August: A planetâ€™s size and bulk might be more important than its loca-
    tion in the solar system in determining whether it can support life, Dr.
    Robert Jastrow, Director of NASAâ€™sGoddard Institute for Space
    Studies, said in a New York Times article. Conventional scientific
    thought had always been that the chance of lifeâ€™s evolving on a planet
    was narrowly restricted by the planetâ€™s distance from its parent star.
    However, planetology-the        study of comparative geology of the
    planets, made possible by space probes such as Pioneer, Mariner, and
    Viking-provided evidence for the newer theory.
       The most important single factor in the geology of earth-like planets
    was the amount of internal heat left over from their birth. Planets as
    large as earth conserved heat, losing it very slowly through volcanic
    action over long periods of time. Molten volcanic material carried
    gases, including water vapor, that had been trapped below the
    planetâ€™s surface; the vapors condensed into oceans, other gases
    formed an atmosphere, and life began. Marinerâ€™s photos of Mars had
    confirmed the existence of volcanoes; but, because of the planetâ€™s
    relatively small size, these exhausted their internal heat supply and
    died out rapidly about 100 million yr ago. During its active period,
    Mars must have had in its atmosphere large volumes of volcanic
    gases, including water vapor; Manner photos had shown what were
    apparently dry river beds. When the volcanoes became extinct, the
    water and atmosphere leaked away into space and the small planet
    was left dry and nearly airless. Any life forms found on Mars by Viking
    or future space probes would probably be fossils.
       The study of lunar material added another example to the compara-
    tive geology of earth-like planets: The moon rocks brought back by

    Apollo astronauts had revealed volcanic activity on the moon: because
    the moon was smaller than Mars, this activity had stopped even earlier
    and the gases and moisture escaped even more quickly, leaving
    another dry, airless, and lifeless body.
       Scientists concluded that Mars was cold and lifeless not because it
    was farther from the sun than earth but because it was smaller and
    geologically inert. If the earth were moved out to the orbit of Mars, the
    average temperature of the earth would drop somewhat but its insulat-
    ing atmosphere, continually replenished by volcanic gases for some
    billions of years longer, would maintain a livable temperature over
    large areas of the surface. (Jastrow, NYT, 24 Aug 75, E7)

    ment of higher resolution observation-reconnaissance satellites. All

       Univ. of Calif. scientists continued the research, adapting the tech-
    niques for related work in measuring creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in
    the bloodstream. CPK, present in alL human blood, was produced in
    abnormally high quantities during muscle-cell degeneration that
    accompanied cardiac arrest or muscular dystrophy. CPK could be
    treated to produce ATP and, with the application of firefly chemicals,
    to produce a glow proportionate to the amount of CPK in the blood-
    stream. Researchers had used the measurements as aquick blood test
    to tell whether a patient had suffered a heart attack. (NYT, 25 Aug 75)

    annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of
    Science. First picked up accidentally by equipment testing space
    communications, and later monitored by a sounding rocket, the
    signals apparently had originated in the cataclysmic explosion-the
    â€œbig bangâ€- caused when a single primeval fireball exploded to form
    the universe. The observed radiation was â€œa relic of the high-tempera-
    ture phase of the universe,â€ Lovell stated, â€œperhaps within a second
    or so of the beginning of the explosion.â€
       Lovell urged scientists to reexamine their responsibility to society
    during their quest for knowledge of the universe and life on other
    planets; he questioned whether man could â€œsurvive for long the
    consequences of the probing of scientists,â€ saying that the search
    might produce answers too overwhelming for the mind of man to com-
    prehend. He warned that extensive military involvement might lead to
    great human disaster, recalling how manâ€™s quest for knowledge had
    led to the development of nuclear weapons. (AP, W Star, 28 Aug 75)
∞NASA announced that astronaut Thomas P. Stafford would leave the
    NASA astronaut corps effective 1 Nov. to become commander of the
    Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
    Serving as a NASA astronaut since September 1962, Stafford made the
    first rendezvous in space when he flew the Gemini 6 mission (launched
    15 Dec. 1965) to meet the already orbiting Gemini 7 crew. He also
    commanded Gemini 9 (3-6 June 1966), which rendezvoused with the
    previously launched augmented target docking adapter. Stafford was
    commander ofApoZZo 10 (18- 26 May 1969), first lunar-orbital mission
    to use the complete Apollo spacecraft; during the mission he and crew
    member Eugene A. Cernan flew the lunar module to within 15 km of
    the surface while John W. Young orbited the moon in the Apollo
    spacecraft. In July Stafford headed the three-man Apollo crew for the
    joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission (15-24 July

31 August: Communications Satellite Corp., U.S. representative in the
    International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, transmitted
    its twelfth annual report to the President, covering the activities of
    ComSat from 1July 1974-30 June 1975.
       Two more Intelsat IV satellites had been orbited, Intelsat IV F-8
    21 Nov. 1974 over the Pacific Ocean and Intelsat IV F- 122 May 1975
    over the Indian Ocean. A third satellite, Intelsat IV F-6, failed to
    achieve orbit when the launch vehicle malfunctioned.
       By 30 June 1975 a network of 112 antennas-27 more than last
    year-at 88 earth stations was providing 379 ComSat pathways, with
    107 countries leasing satellite services, an increase of 7 over the
    previous year.
       Comsat General Corp., a subsidiary, had entered into a joint
    venture with the European Space Agency and the Government of
    Canada on 3 Dec. 1974 to provide satellite capacity for an Aerosat
    (aeronautical satellite) communications test and evaluation program.
    Comsat General and International Business Machines Corp. had
    notified the Federal Communications Commission that they would
    seek to enter the domestic satellite business with one or more part-
    ners. ComSatâ€™s earth stations in Connecticut and California neared
    readiness for Marisat (maritime satellite) communications services in
    the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean areas.
       ComSat reported a net income of $44 918 000, or $4.49 per share,
    up from $36 299 000 or $3.63 per share in 1973. (Text)

1 September: NASAâ€™s
    plorer48 16 NOV.1972) had observed a pulsar in the Vela constellation
    that generated two bursts of gamma rays for each burst of radio waves,
    theAstrophysica1Journal reported. No other pulsar had been found to
    exhibit such properties. The new observation indicated that pulsars-
    small, dense, rapidly spinning stars thought to be remains of a huge
    stellar explosion or supernova-were much more complex than had
    been believed.
       Detection of gamma rays from Vela meant that pulsars were a likely
    source of cosmic rays. Many astrophysicists had believed that only
    very young pulsars could produce cosmic energies, but the Sas 2
    observations cast doubt on this conclusion: Scientists believed that the
    Vela pulsar was more than 10 000 yrs old. (D.J. Thompson et al.,

     that would be needed.â€ The JPL report voiced skepticism that industry
     could do the job alone. â€œAdditional funding from the federal govern-
     ment is required, as well as a commitment that introduction of an

     Hecker of the KSC Office of Earth Resources told the group that the
     4cent-per-sq-mi cost of obtaining satellite data was one-third the cost
     of aircraft-obtained data. Data collected by â€œon footâ€ surveys cost $20
     per sq mi, and the cost of using an automobile for this purpose ran
     about $2 per sq mi.
        Dr. Garland L. Thomas, coinvestigator for the earth-resources mis-
     sion of Landsat 2 (launched 22 Jan.) and employee of the Brevard

8-9,17 September: Data collected by sounding rockets, satellites,

     cans might be breaking down the earthâ€˜s ozone shield, scientists told
     hearings of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sci-
     encesâ€™ Subcommittee on the Upper Atmosphere. Ozone in the
     stratosphere screened the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation
     that might increase incidence of cancer and other skin diseases and
     prove lethal to many life forms as well as damage eyes, crops, and
     livestock. An increase in atmospheric fluorocarbons could also have a
     greenhouse effect, permitting sunlight to pass freely but inhibiting the
     escape of heat in the form of infrared radiation. This would warm the
     lower atmosphere and the earth, altering aquatic and terrestrial
     ecosystems and environmental chemicals, and creating climate
     changes. An extreme greenhouse effect had been blamed for Venusâ€™
     oven-hot temperatures.
        Dr. Warren R. Muir, cochairman of the Interagency Task Force on
     Inadvertent Modification of the Stratosphere, told the subcommittee,
     â€œBased on our preliminary assessment there seems to be a legitimate
     cause for concern.â€ If additional government research-with NASA
     coordinating-had proved more conclusively the danger to the envi-
     ronment, the government should take action for â€œprompt enactment of
     toxic substances legislation.â€
        Dr. Wilson K. Talley of the Environmental Protection Agency

     and that the total effect of releasing fluorocarbons and other halocar-
     bon compounds into the atmosphere might not become apparent for
     10 yrs. But, with evidence of public danger not strong enough to stand
     up to a court challenge by manufacturers, government regulation of
     the offending substances would be unenforceable. (Transcript; Sulli-

9 September: Viking 2 was successfully launched at 239 pm EDT from the
    Eastern Test Range on a Titan-Centaur launch vehicle. The space-
     craft entered on a trajectory toward Mars accurate to within the 3-
     sigma tolerance. If flown without midcourse correction, Viking 2
     would reach Martian orbit 279 259 km from the target.
        The launch had been rescheduled from 1 Sept., after the launch
     crew during a 28 Aug. precountdown test discovered a degradation in
     the detection threshold of the orbiter's S-band radio receiver. On 1
     Sept., project officials decided to remove the spacecraft from the
    launch vehicle for additional evaluation. The launch was rescheduled
    for 9 Sept. after evaluation concluded that the anomaly had been
     caused by a faulty connector or conductor between the diplexer mod-
     ule and the high-gain antenna. Since the faulty part could not be
    isolated, the antenna and cabling were replaced, the orbiter and
     lander retested, encapsulated, and mated to the launch vehicle. After
     launch, a l onboard systems and experiments were checked out. A
               l
     trajectory correction maneuver on 19 Aug. targeted Viking 2 for a
     rendezvous with Mars on 7 Aug. 1976.

∞A star tracker, STELLAR(Star Tracker forEconomica1 Long Life Attitude
     Reference), was being developed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory for a
     variety of future manned and unmanned space missions. STELLAR
     used a solid-state silicon detector, called a charge-coupled device
     (CCD), for image sensing and a microcomputer to process and format
     the data. Previous star trackers had used high-voltage vacuum-tube
     image dissectors for image sensing; the tubes were difficult to pro-
     duce, had a limited lifetime, developed errors, and could provide
     attitude-reference data from only a single star in any given observation
     frame. STELLA& which substituted a single low-voltage 6-mm-sq CCD
     chip for the complex and expensive tube, offered the advantages of
     solid-state reliability and of simple programming to adapt to varying
     mission requirements. In addition to substantial savings in cost of

    olutionize TV camera design, permitting miniature low-cost home
     monitors within the next several years.

∞NASA announced selection of the Boeing Co. and Martin Marietta Corp.
    for negotiations leading to a contract for delivery of a base module for
    the first of NASA's Applications Explorer Missions (AEM-A), also
    known as the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM). The base
     module would be a platform for the heat-capacity-mapping radiome-
    ter and all support instrumentation, including receivers, transmitters,
    power system, and attitude-control system. The contract would call
    for delivery of the base module within 20 mo of the award.
       Planned for launch in 1978, AEM-A would gather thermal-inertia
    data from the earth's surface, data which should distinguish rock
     types, locate mineral resources, detect soil moisture, and read tem-

10 September: Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told the
    Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that the com-
    bined efforts of government and industry could reduce fuel consump-
    tion of civil air transport by 40 to 50% without degrading the environ-
    ment or reducing aircraft safety. The conclusion was based on a study
    by NASA, Federal Aviation Administration, DOD, and industry at the
    request of the committee. Need for a vigorous fuel-conservation pro-
    gram had been underscored by estimates from the Federal Energy
    Administration and Air Transport Association of America that U.S.
     outlays for imported oil had increased from $3 billion in 1970 to $24
    billion in 1974, and could reach $32 billion by 1977. Jet fuel costs had
    risen from 12 cents a gallon (4.4 cents per liter) in 1973to 29 cents (10.5
    cents) in 1975.

    ∞Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center were completing tests seek-
0
      ing to refine the means of towing to shore for refurbishment and reuse
      recovered solid rocket boosters from Space Shuttle launches. These
      tests explored the question of whether the parachute recovery lines
      and riser lines on the three recovery parachutes to be attached to each
      booster would, when under tension during descent, stretch enough to
      develop sufficient latent energy to deploy the 52-mm-dia by 15-m long
      tow rope from a tray located in the boosterâ€™s forward skirt. The tests
      employed a 10-m Saturn S-11-stage adapter ring, to which the
      parachute lines were attached. A crane hoisted the adapter ring until
      the stress on the rings was 12 000 kg, about one-half the stress ex-
      pected on the parachutes lowering the booster. An explosive bolt was
      detonated, abruptly freeing the parachute lines; they contracted and
      the lines and fitting to which they were attached were yanked upward
      more than 60 m, quite enough energy to deploy the tow line.
         The recovery system parachutes would be fitted with flotation
      devices so they could be recovered. On the first six Shuttle develop-
      mental flights, the set of parachutes would be cut free from one
      booster in each set of two and both would be tested to determine which
      configuration made it easier to retrieve and tow the booster. (MSFC

    ∞The appearance of a supernova on 5 July 1054 had been recorded in

      primitive art by ancient Indians on the walls of a N. Mex. cave, the
     New York Times reported. Goddard Space Flight Center astronomer
      Dr. John C. Brandt, leader of the team of astronomers who had dis-
      covered the cave art, said that the date of the pictograph-a crescent
      moon with a nearby object variously described as a circle, cross, or
      asterisk-coincided with records of the Chinese Sung dynasty. The
      Chinese had reported that, on the morning of 5 July 1054, a minor star
      in the constellation Taurus appeared to explode into extraordinary
      brilliance. Ancient Chinese astronomers had described the event-

      supernova, â€œWhat we have is circumstantial evidence that, to us,
      looks pretty good,â€ Dr. Brandt said. No other supernova of known
      date had been visible from North America near a crescent moon.

11 September: NASA launched a two-stage solid-propellant Nike-Hawk
     sounding rocket from Wallops Island, carrying an 84-kg payload to a
     164-km altitude. The flight, to demonstrate successful mating of a
     surplus Hawk engine with the Nike M-88 first stage, also tested a
     newly developed recovery system for both the single-stage Hawk and
     the Nike-Hawk vehicle. The system, designed for both land or air
     recovery, could return up to 136 kg of payload by parachute. The
     sounding rocket carried a Univ. of Pittsburgh high-resolution photo-

∞NASA was considering resuming exploration of the moon in 1980, using a
     low-cost unmanned satellite to map the entire lunar surface from
     orbit, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist Marius B. Weinreb told
     United Press International in a telephone interview. The proposed
     satellite, together with a small communications relay satellite, would
     gather information needed by scientists to organize the vast amount of
     data collected during the Apollo lunar landing missions.
        One mission of the satellite would be to provide a detailed chart of
     the lunar gravitational field, including field variations, to tell scien-
     tists more about the composition of the moon and perhaps about its
     origin and evolution. Previous lunar orbiters had merely mapped and
    photographed the lunar surface. Although scientists had learned
     much from Apollo data about the gravitational field of the moonâ€™s
    near side, they knew little about the far side. The proposed satellite-
     equipped with instruments including x-ray and gamma-ray sensors-
     and its accompanying high-orbiting comsat, which would remain in
     range of both the satellite and the earth at all times, would send back
    to earth data on the entire lunar surface.
        Weinreb told UP1 that NASA administrators had considered in-
    cluding the proposed project in the FY 1977 budget. Budget restric-
    tions might prevent NASA from initiating new projects. (UPI, W T ,

15 September: In a letter to Rep. Don Fuqua, chairman of the House of
    Representativesâ€™ Committee on Science and Technology Subcommit-

    James C. Fletcher summarized options for missions that could use the
    remaining Apollo-Saturn flight hardware. Options included an earth-
    orbital mission as an Apollo-Soyuz Test Project backup; a Skylab re-
    visit; an Apollo geosynchronous mission; a lunar orbital mission; an
    earth-orbital mission to visit a Soviet space station; and a manned-
    satellite inspector. The hardware could also be used to launch a U.S.
    unmanned space station carrying a large U.S.S.R. payload, a large
    orbiting reflector, a space solar-power demonstration, a planetary
    probe, or multiple payloads. Another possibility might be to carry an
    Apollo spacecraft into space aboard the Space Shuttle to provide a
    crew-rescue capability or to serve as a habitable module, to demon-
    strate a Shuttle-serviced free-flying module, or to inspect and service
    orbiting satellites.
       Dr. Fletcherâ€™s letter added that he did not foresee that funds would
    be available to support additional Apollo-Saturn missions in the
    period preceding the Space Shuttle operation. The subcommittee at a
    25 March meeting had asked NASA to summarize the options when the

     temperature sensors to measure heat levels of major components at
    jettison of the two expended solid-propellant boosters.
        Two other Shuttle tests also had been completed for NASA at AEDC:
     A smaller model and computer-controlled systems were used to study
     aerodynamic forces during the separation of the expended solid
     boosters. During the test the Orbiter and external fuel-tank models
    were attached to the tunnel supports and a solid booster model was
     attached to the computer-controlled support. Measurements were
    recorded with a single booster model at various points below, beside,
     and behind the Orbiter-tank combination and with the booster and
    Orbiter-tank at various pitch and yaw angles.
        In the third test, heating data were obtained on an Orbiter model
     positioned at a high angle of attack at mach 8. Special paints that
     changed from a solid to a liquid at specified tdmperatures were
     used to record heating histories on the surface of the model, and oil-

    arms. â€œBoth sides-the United States and the Soviet side-should
    make every possible effort for good, neighborly relations, really good,
    in all aspects, from every point of view,â€ he said.
       On 23 Sept. the two crews and their families began a six-city tour of
    the Soviet Union that took them to Leningrad, Kiev, Volgograd,
    Novosibirsk, Sochi, and Tbilisi. Everywhere the crews were swamped
    by enthusiastic spontaneous crowds of up to 3000 persons waiting on
    corners and at airports for hours to cheer the spacemen. â€œThe
    hospitality is fantastic,â€ Stafford remarked at Volgograd. The New
    York Times reported that each appearance of the spacemen was
    greeted with applause and cheering and they responded with waves
    and autographs.
       The astronauts ended their Russian tour on 4 Oct. with a farewell
    press conference back in Moscow. Stafford, Brand, and Slayton
    praised the â€œenthusiastic people with warm heartsâ€ they had met
    during their tour. During the press conference-held exactly 18 yr
    after the U.S.S.R. had launched the first manmade satellite, Sputnik
    1, on 4 Oct. 1957-Stafford encouraged continued cooperation
    between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. in such areas as lunar and planetary
    exploration, space medicine, space meteorology, and earth environ-
    ment.
       The three u.S. astronauts and their families flew to London for an
    overnight stay before flying back to Houston on 5 Oct. (B Sun, 21
    Sept-6 Oct 75; NYT, 21 Sept-6 Oct 75)
22 September: NASA and the Air Force Systems Commandâ€™s Space and
    Missile Systems Organization had jointly contracted for procurement
    of 12 advanced meteorological satellites, saving more than $37 mil-
    lion, AFSC announced. Both agencies had developed satellites to
    observe and report worldwide weather conditions and were negotiat-
    ing procurement of improved, longer lived meterological spacecraft.
    The contracts for long-leadtime parts for the new satellites-nine for
    NASA and three for the Air F o r c e w e r e a follow-on to an earlier Air
    Force procurement program for a meterological satellite identified as
    Block 5D. Although some of the systems differed, similar technical
    requirements permitted the basic spacecraft to serve both agencies.
    Use of an already developed basic design would save NASA about $33
    million, and the joint production contract would save both agencies
    nearly $2.4 million in material and assembly costs. (AFsC Release OIP

∞The appointment of Lt. Gen. Duward L. Crow (USAF, Ret.) as Associate
    Deputy Administrator became effective. Gen. Crow succeeded Willis
    H. Shapley, who retired. Before joining NASA in September 1974 as
    Assistant Administrator for Dept. of Defense and Interagency Affairs,
    Gen. Crow had been Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force
    since October 1873. He had previously been Comptroller of the Air
    Force.

∞A NASA-developed low-cost highly efficient solar thermal-energy col-
    lector and a ball bearing design with alife expectancy 20 times greater
     than that of present ball bearings had been selected to receive Zndus-
    trial Research magazineâ€™s award for two of the 108 most significant
     new products developed during the year, NASA announced.
       Developed at Lewis Research Center in cooperation with Honey-
    well, Inc., the solar collector absorbed 20% more solar-radiated
    energy and produced a greater flow of high-temperature fluids. The
    flat-plate collector combined an efficient flow scheme, insulation,
    dual antireflective glass covers, and black chrome absorption coating
    to provide heating and cooling, with low cost and low pollution, for
    both commercial buildings and homes.
       LeRC developed the bearing with General Electric Co. and Indus-
    trial Tectonics, Inc., using computer analysis for maximum perform-
     ance and reliability. Advanced techniques for producing and melting
     steel provided a cleaner, longer lived material for the bearing, and
    advanced fabrication and machining methods contributed greater
    accuracies and surface finishes to the bearing rings. The bearing was
    lubricated through holes in the bearingâ€™s split inner ring rather than by
    a conventional lubricant jet pointed at the bearing rings. This
    advanced bearing design was expected to replace mainshaft-thrust
    ball bearings presently used in large turbine engines, pumping
    systems, electric utilities, and petroleum pipeline operations. (NASA

    committee appropriated to NASA $2 677 380 000 for R&D, qkM.4 m a o n
     more than the $2 628 980 000 proposed by the House [see 19 and 24
    June] and $8.0 million less than the $2 685 380 000 proposed by the
     Senate [see 24 and 26 July].
        The conference committee agreed that NASA could reprogram
     $7 000 000 from the R&D total for an upper atmospheric research,
    technology, and monitoring program. The committee also agreed that
     $1 000 000 of the total funding of $48 400 000 proposed for a Pioneer-
     Venus mission might be reprogrammed for further planning of the
     Large Space Telescope, though not beyond evaluation of phase B
     studies. Appropriations for construction of facilities and for research
     and program management had been previously agreed on and re-
     mained unchanged.
23 September: NASA Pilot William H. Dana made the last rocket-powered
     flight of the X-24B lifting body, from Flight Research Center. Al-
     though a four-chamber firing had been planned, only three chambers
     ignited, and a three-chamber flight plan was executed. The X-24B
     reached an altitude of 17 678 m and a speed of mach 1.2. Six more
     glide flights were planned.
        Objectives of the flight were to observe stability and control with
    rudder bias at lo", to test handling qualities with al damper gains at
                                                           l
     zero, to survey body pressure, to perform a qualification test of a high-
    density reusable surface insulator, and to make a lefthand fin tuft
    study. The X-24B was part of a joint NASA-& Force program to test
    concepts for a manned vehicle that could reenter the atmosphere
    from space, and to provide advanced technology for a future hyper-
    sonic cruise aircraft. (FRC X-Press, 26 Sept 75, 2; NASA Hq X-24B

25 September: A NASA Atlas-Centaur vehicle launched Zntelsat-IVA F -1 at
    8:17 pm EDT from Eastern Test Range into the planned synchronous
     transfer orbit. The communications satellite had been launched for
    the Communications Satellite Corp. under a cost-reimbursable
    contract. At 11:18 pm EDT 26 Sept., ComSatCorp fired the apogee
    kick motor to put the satellite in a geosynchronous orbit with a 35 821-
    km apogee, 35 294-km perigee, 23-hr 44-min period, and 0.1"
    inclination.
        NASA objectives for the mission were to review design, perform-
    ance, and flight readiness for the Federal Communications Com-
     mission and to assure compatibility of the Intelsat spacecraft with
     NASA launch vehicles and launch environmental conditions, and to
    launch Zntelsat-WA F-1 into a transfer orbit that would enable the
    spacecraft apogee boost motor to inject the spacecraft into a synchro-
    nous orbit. Objectives were completed and the mission adjudged
    successful 29 Jan. 1976.
        ComSatCorp objectives were to fire the apogee boost motor, posi-
    tion the satellite into the planned geostationary orbit, and operate and
    manage the system for the International Telecommunications
    Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).
        Intelsat-ZVA F - 1 , built by Hughes Aircraft Co., was 698.5 cm high
    and 238.2 cm in diameter, with a liftoff weight of 1515 kg and orbital
    weight of 825.5 kg. The spin-stabilized satellite consisted of two main
    elements: A rotating section contained the power subsystem, a
    cylindrical solar array and two nickel-cadmium batteries; the
    anhydrous hydrazine-powered positioning and orientation system; the

                                     194

     solid-fueled apogee motor; and the despin-control system. The
     despun earth-oriented platform section contained the communica-
     tions repeater, antennas, and associated elements of the telemetry
     and command subsystems. A l spacecraft antennas were supported
                                    l
     by a single tubular mast.
        For 24 hr after apogee-motor firing, Zntelsat-ZVA F-1 drifted
     eastward at a rate of lo" per day; then a velocity-correction maneuver
     slowed the spacecraft drift to 2.9' east per day. While the spacecraft
     was drifting, the Hawaii earth station checked out the spacecraft
     systems. Its final operating location, over the Atlantic Ocean at 335"
     east longitude, would be reached by mid-December. As primary
     Atlantic satellite in INTELSAT'S global commercial communications
     satellite system, it would serve more than 40 earth stations, offering
     users 6250 two-way voice circuits and two TV channels.
        Zntelsat-ZVA F-1 was the first in the Intelsat IVA series; its com-
     munications capacity was two-thirds greater than satellites in the
     Intelsat IV series, seven of which were still operating. The Intelsat
     system began with the launch of Zntelsat-Z F - 1 (Early Bird 1 ) on 6
     April 1965; since then NASA had launched 16 successful comsats for
     ComSatCorp in the Intelsat 11, 111, and IV series.
        Although Intelsat IVA satellites had been designed primarily for
     use over the Atlantic with its heavy communications traffic, INTELSAT
     planned to launch as many as five additional IVAs, some to provide
     service for the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Intelsat IVAs had
     a design lifetime of 7 yr and a capacity sufficient to meet inter-
     national communications requirements through 1979, when the sys-
     tem would be augmented with the even larger capacity Intelsat
     V comsats.
       INTELSAT, created in August 1964 by adoption of the Interim
    Agreements for the Establishment of a Global Commercial Comsat
    System, now comprised 91 member nations; a 24-member board of
    governors exercised overall responsibility for design, development,
    construction, establishment, operation, and maintenance of the In-
    telsat space segment. ComSatCorp, a privately owned carrier com-
    pany operating under a U.S. congressional mandate, had provided
    technical and operational management services to INTELSAT and the
    global system under a cost-plus-fixed-fee management services con-
    tract.
       NASA had been responsible for procuring the Atlas-Centaur launch
                  ducting preflight testing, and launching the spacecraft
                   stern Test Range into a synchronous transfer orbit.
                   engineers in the INTELSAT Spacecraft Technical Control
     Center in Washington, D.C., then assumed responsibility for the
     mission.
       Overall management for the NASA portion of the mission was under
    the direction of the Office of Applications. Lewis Research Center
    was responsible for Atlas-Centaur development and operation.
    Kennedy Space Center was responsible for vehicle checkout and for
    launch. (NASAMORs E-491-633-75-01,25            Sept 75,30 Jan 76; NASA

    of the Space Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program
    Office, JSCâ€™s Roundup reported. The office had been created to plan
    and develop JSC payload for the Space Shuttle. The Apollo Spacecraft
    Program Office had been abolished, and personnel from that office
    and the Payloads Coordination Office had been reassigned to the new
    program office. Besides managing Shuttle payloads and compo-
    nents-including the Interim Upper-Stage low-cost modular space-
    craft, long-duration exposure facility, and Large Space Tele-
    scope-the     new office would manage JSC participation in inter-
    national space activities, including any future U.S. -U.S.S.R. activi-
    ties. (JSC Roundup, 26 Sept 75, 1)
  ∞X-ray satellites-including Uhuru (Explorer 42 launched 12 Dec. 1970)
    and Os0 7 (Orbiting Solar Observatory launched 29 Sept 1971bhad
    revealed a previously unidentified class of x-ray sources associated
    with very old star clusters, Science reported. In at least five docu-
    mented cases, satellites had detected x-rays from globular star
    clusters coming from above and below the pinwheel disk of the Milky
    Way galaxy. These clusters, left behind when the rest of the primor-
    dial galactic matter fell into the disk of the galaxy over 10 billion yrs
    ago, stillorbited the galactic center, bound to it by gravitationalforces.
       Scientific evidence had indicated that the birth of new stars within
    clusters ended soon after the formation of the clusters themselves; the
    clusters had not been expected to contain any young binary star
    systems, those believed to make up the majority of galactic x-ray
    sources. This fact, along with the finding that sources were much
    more plentiful in globular clusters than in the galactic disk, indicated
    that some different process of x-ray production was at work.
       Scientists offered three explanations for the findings: existence of
    very large black holes, 1000 times as massive as the sun, within the
    clusters; a smaller black hole steadily fed with matter from the sur-
    rounding disk; and origin of the x-ray emissions in binary stars
    behavinglike x-ray binaries in the galactic disk but with very different
    origins.
       Scientists were hoping that two more x-ray satellites, U.K.â€™s Ariel 5
    (launched 15 Oct. 1974) and Ans 1 (Netherlands Astronomical Satel-
    lite launched 30 Aug. 1975), would contribute additional data to the
    study. (Metz, Science, 26 Sept 75, 1073-74)
∞A vertical motion simulator to reproduce the critical maneuvers of air-
    craft during takeoff and landing was being built at Ames Research
    Center. Costing $3.5 million, the VMS would use an existing cab and
    computer system, but would have new hardware to provide large-scale
    vertical motions. It would move as much as 18 m vertically and 12 m
    horizontally and would accurately simulate flare and touchdown of
    such aircraft as the short takeoff and landing (STOL) and vertical
    takeoff and landing (VTOL). (FRC XPress, 26 Sept 75, 4)
∞Johnson Space Centerâ€™s Roundup reported that Scott Aviation Co.
    would begin commercial production .of a new lightweight breathing
    system for firefighters based on concepts and hardware developed by
    JSC engineers. Called the Scott Air-Pak 4.5, the new apparatus was
    the first major improvement in compressed-air breathing systems in
    more than 20 yrs. New features of the equipment included a 40%
    weight reduction; an improved pack frame and harness, with the
    unitâ€™s weight carried on the hips rather than the shoulders; and a
    redesigned face mask for better vision.

       NASAâ€™s in developing the apparatus had begun in 1970 when a
           part
    national meeting of municipal officials identified the need for an im-
    proved system as their highest priority. NASAâ€™s effort had been carried
    out at JSC as an engineering applications project under the Tech-
    nology Utilization Program. After a design had been chosen from a
    number of candidates, prototype units were successfully field tested
     under actual firefighting conditions by the Houston, New York City,
     and Los Angeles fire departments.
        Scott Aviation was the first manufacturer to annovnce commercial
     production of an apparatus based on NASA effort. (JSC Roundup, 26

∞Aetna Life and Casualty would become the third partner with Comsat
     General Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. in a ven-
    ture to establish a domestic satellite system, the three companies
    jointly announced.
        In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, the three
     companies had proposed a corporate structure of the jointly owned
    CML Satellite Corp. under which each of the three companies would
    own a part of the organization. IBM would purchase 42.5% and Aetna
    would purchase 15% of CML stock, with Comsat holding the remaining
    42.5%. Aetna would also purchase a convertible note, bringing its
    investment to the same level as Comsat and IBM; the three partners
    would have equal representation on the board of directors. The
     arrangement would comply with FCCâ€™s requirement that no partner
                                                       stock [see 23 Jan.].
     own less than 10% nor more than 49% of CMLâ€™S
        After FCC approval, the three partners would each invest up to $55
     million with additional funding obtained from outside financing.
        CML had been formed in 1972, with other stockholders, to enter the
     U.S. domestic communications satellite business; Comsat had owned
     a l the stock of CML since July 1975 and, with IBM, had been seeking a
      l
     third partner.. Both Comsat and IBM had been providing the interim
    financing. (Aetna-Comsat-IBM Release, 26 Sept 75)
28 September: Plans had been completed for the first U.S. experiments to
     be flown on a Soviet spacecraft, Dr. David L. Winter, NASA Director
    of Life Sciences, announced. As a result of joint U.S.-U.S.S.R.
    working group meetings on space biology and medicine, 4 U.S. life-
    science experiments and 7 tissue investigations were to fly aboard a
     Soviet biological satellite scheduled for launch later in the year. The
    U.S. experiments-all       passive and completely autonomoue from
    spacecraft power, telemetry, and data recording-would be housed in
    5 Soviet-built containers, each 17.8 cm long by 12.7 cm wide by 11.5
     cm high. Maximum weight for each container, including experiments,
    would be 2.5 kg. Unique to this spacecraft was a Soviet-designed on-
     board centrifuge. U.S. experiments would be flown both on the
    centrifuge and on a stationary platform.
        The 4 flight experiments included a plant tumor-growth experiment
    to study the effects of weightlessness on sensitive plant systems; a
    carrot-cell-culture experiment to assess the effects of weightlessness
                                                           x
    on plant systems and on normal development of emb onic tissues; a
    heavy-particle radiation experiment to measure high-c arge and high-
    energy particle radiation aboard the spacecraft; and a killifish or
    mummichog (minnows) embryogenesis experiment to evaluate the
    effect of weightlessness on development of the vestibular system
    during embryonic development in a vertebrate animal.

        Six of the tissue investigations would use rat tissue-and the
     seventh flies-supplied by the Soviets from their animal experiments.
     Soviet scientists would prepare the animal tissues for U.S. scientists
     to use in their investigations and would return the U.S. experiment
     packages upon completion of the flight.
        Ames Research Center was managing 3 of the life-science experi-
     ments and all tissue investigations. Johnson Space Center would
     manage the fish-egg development experiment. (NASA Release 75 -

        In announcing the changes, NASA Administrator Dr. James
     Fletcher had said that the exchange of these functions would â€œprovide
     a more logical alignment of responsibilities as we move into Space

29 September: Johnson Space Center announced that the first of two
     Space Shuttle training aircraft had been test flown at Grumman
     American Aviationâ€™s Bethpage, N.Y ., plant. The modified Gulfstream
     I1 would be used to train crews for Orbiter descent and landing pro-
     cedures. The cockpit layout and the aerodynamic modifications of the
     trainers provided motion and visual cues and handling qualities
     similar to those of the actual Orbiter. The two trainers would be
     delivered to Johnson Space Center early in 1976. (JSC Roundup, 10

30 September: Marshall Space Flight Center had resumed acoustic testing
     of a 6.4%-scale model of the Space Shuttle to provide information
     needed in designing the Shuttle and its launch facilities, MSFC
     announced. The tests would also produce data on effects of hot
     exhaust gases on the aft portion of the Shuttle immediately after
     ignition. Data from earlier testing of the model, which included the
     liquid-fueled engines and solid rocket motors, had alerted designers
     that special provisions would be needed to deflect hot gases out of the
     solid rocket boosters away from the facility fuel lines near the launch
     pad. A pad design based on this analysis had been tested and proven.
     During the tests, which had begun originally in Ahgust 1974, the
     model was held in a test stand while its engines were fired from 6 to 10
     sec. (MSFC Release 75-205)
During September: NASA had invited nearly 5000 scientists worldwide to
     propose experiments for a possible 6-yr mission to Uranus, beginning
     with a November 1979 launch. The mission, which could include a
     swing by Neptune, was being studied for inclusion in NASAâ€™s 1977FY
     budget request. A mission to Uranus and Neptune would mean that
     every planet in the solar system except Pluto would have been probed

   by a U.S. spacecraft by 1988. The spacecraft itself would be adapted
   directly from the Mariner probe now under development at Jet
   Propulsion Laboratory for a planned 1977 mission to Saturn; like
   Mariner-Saturn, the Uranus mission would use the gravity of Jupiter
   to hurl the spacecraft on toward the more remote planet. If the
   spacecraft remained healthy after it investigated Uranus, it would use
   the gravity of that planet to fly on to Neptune, more than 1.6 billion km
   deeper into space. (GSFC Goddard News, Sept 75,2; UPI, NYT, 4 Sept

3 October: Johnson Space Center announced award of a $11.5-m3lion
    contract to General Electric Co. Space Div. to provide acceptance-
    checked equipment for the Space Shuttle orbiter. The equipment
    would be used to conduct standard tests and to detect variances in
    spacecraft systems in assembly at the Rockwell International Corp.
    plant. GE would also provide checkout support during the approach
    and landing phases of the Shuttle missions. (JSC Release 75-92)
∞Johnson Space Center announced signing of a $44 800 000 contract
    amendment with Lockheed Electronics Co., Inc., for electronic,
    scientific, and computing-center support services at JSC. The services
    would support JSC programs including Space Shuttle, earth

5 October: Design and construction of a cost-saving municipal sewage-
    treatment plant, using a Jet Propulsion Laboratory-developed
    process, would begin late in the year in Orange County, Calif., JPL
    announced. The new system used a pyrolytic reactor to convert solid
    sewage materials to activated carbon, which was then used to treat
    incoming waste water. Besides reducing sewage-treatment costs by
    25%, the new system was expected to virtually eliminate sewage
    solids, produce cleaner waste water for delivery to the ocean, remove
    heavy metals contained in the sewage, and eliminate odors. Gases
    generated by the sewage solids would be used as a source of power.
       The plant-a pilot project funded by Federal, state, and municipal
    grants totaling approximately $2 million-would        replace a small
    mobile unit installed by JPL in 1974. Project officials hoped that,
    following evaluation, the system could be scaled up 100-fold and
    adopted for urban waste treatment. (JPL Release 5 Oct 75)
∞The Univ. of Chile would build and operate a ground station to receive

    directly from the satellite as it passed over Bolivia, Uruguay,
    Argentina, Chile, and sections of Peru and Brazil. (NASA Release

6 October: A massive new power source for earth-transmission of solar
    energy by microwave frequency-had been under study by the Jet
    Propulsion Laboratory at the Goldstone station near Barstow, Calif.
    The dish antenna equipped with a 450-kw klystron tube for microwave
    transmission, represented a space station; the tower a mile away with
    an array of solar receivers to which the experimental power converted
    to microwave energy had been beamed represented a ground station.
    This research had been designed to lead to a network of space stations
    that would collect solar energy 24 hr a day and beam it to ground
    stations; the Goldstone tests had been the first high-power field trials
    of the system. Tiny rectifying dipole antennas-called rectennas-
    collect and convert the radio-frequency beam; the 17 panels in the
    tower receiver contain 4590 of the rectennas. The system had
    demonstrated a maximum output of 30.4 kw converting the
    microwave beam to usable electricity, an efficiency of 82.5%. A space-
    to-earth system would be 6 times more effective than a surface
    system, the Los Angeles Times commented, and could probably
    supply 15% to 20% of the earthâ€˜s energy needs in the next century.
    Development of a utility operating system delivering 10 000 mw of
    power would cost about $60 billion, as much as NASA has spent to date
    on space programs. A single equatorial space station carrying a l-km-
    diameter antenna transmitting to a U.S. earth station 15 km long and
     10 km wide could supply all the electrical needs of New York City or a
    third of the needs of the Los Angeles basin. (LA Times, 6 Oct 75, 1;

7 October: Dr. William R. Lucas, Director of Marshall Space Flight
    Center, announced the establishment of an advanced mineral-
    extraction task team within the Program Development Directorate.
    Working with the Dept. of Interiorâ€™s Bureau of Mines, the team would
    use NASA expertise and technology to increase the nationâ€™s ability to
    extract energy and minerals at acceptable cost and with minimum
    effect on the environment. One of NASAâ€™s       first tasks would be to
    improve the efficiency of the long-wall shearer-a coal-removing
    machine used by miners that could leave a foot or more of
    unrecoverable coal along the edges of a vein-by using sensors,
    remote controls, and TV monitors to guide the machine. (MSFC

    would offer a capacity of 100 million bits, serial or parallel data
    inpudoutput operation, user-selected data rates, and direct access to
    the memory. Rockwell would complete the work in two phases: A
    prototype would be completed by early 1977, and a flight-qualifiable
    model would be produced by early 1978. Langley Research Center
    would manage the contract for NASA. (NASA Release 75-272)
∞Cosmos 775, believed to be third of a series in the Soviet Unionâ€™s
    Statsionar communications-satellite program, was launched from
    Baykonur Cosmodrome into a very low near-circular earth orbit. Its
    predecessors, Cosmos 637 and Molniya I-S, had been launched 26
    March and 29 July 1974. The satellites were to supply communica-
    tions, including telephone, telegraph, Tv, and phototelegraph
    transmissions, between the Soviet Union and Europe and between the
    capital and extreme eastern portions of the U.S.S.R. Once the
    Statsionar communications system was established, the U.S.S.R.
    was expected to undertake implementation of a synchronous
    meteorological satellite system as early as the 1976-77 period. (SBD,

10 October: The first of a series of 5 conferences on design requirements
    for Space Shuttle and Spacelab payloads had been held at Marshall
    Space Flight Center. About 50 scientists and engineers from
    government, industry, and universities had met to define functional
    requirements for payload equipment to further NASAâ€™s Space
    Processing Applications (SPA) program, including analysis of selected
    design approaches and recommendations for getting the most use out
    of SPA payloads for the materials science and technology community.
    The meeting would hear presentations on the two SPA competitive
    engineering designs by General Electric and TRW Systems, Inc. The
    next 2 days would be used by working groups to discuss their
    specialties-biological   preparations; chemical processes and fluid
    phenomena; glasses and ceramics; and solidification of metals,
    alloys, composites, and electronic materials. The 5 scheduled
    meetings should define payloads that are compatible with the Space
    Shuttle and Spacelab and that would meet the research needs of the
    industrial and scientific communities. (MSFC Release 75- 218)
∞NASA announced signing of an agreement with the Federal Aviation
    Administration to act as a third party for the purpose of receiving,
    processing, and analyzing safety reports filed under FAAâ€™s Aviation
    Safety Reporting Program. The third-party arrangement would
    stimulate the free and unrestricted flow of information, by assuring
    users that FAAâ€™s   objective in the program was to provide the safest
    possible aviation system by identifying and correcting unsafe
    conditions before accidents occur. The agreement provided for
    specific procedures to protect the identity of persons involved in the
    reports submitted to NASA, except in criminal cases or accidents.
       NASA would set up an aviation safety reporting working group under
    its Research and Technology Advisory Council to advise NASA on the
    reporting system, to evaluate and review the program once it is under
    way, and to ensure the anonymity of those submitting reports. The
    group would include aviation and consumer groups and others
    involved in operational aspects of the national aviation system. (NASA

         space applications. Five practical processes in the space environment
         would be crystal growth, purification and separation, mixing, solidifi-
         cation, and processes in fluids. The gravity-free environment would
         permit the manufacture of items such as contamination-free glass for
         laser requirements, pure crystals for semiconductors, and highly pure
         vaccines. Also, if materials like copper-lead alloys that do not mix on
         earth could be combined in zero gravity, real breakthroughs in aircraft
         and automotive parts manufacture might be possible. (SBD, 14 Oct

         tory, the Univ. of Texasâ€™s 27-m telescope facility in Austin, made the
         discovery by using high-resolution spectra. Dr. Reinhard Beer, JPL
         leader of the team, reported that the near-infrared spectra had been
         produced by a Connestype Fourier spectrometer in 1974; spectral
         lines-the â€œsignaturesâ€ of various molecules-had         disclosed that
         carbon monoxide molecules were present to a depth of at least 50 km
         into the lower atmosphere. Carbon monoxide had been previously
         found in minor amounts in the atmospheres of earth, Venus, and
         Mars. Although the spectra had shown no indication of carbon dioxide
         in the Jovian atmosphere, Dr. Beer reported, future telescope

16 October: NASA launched the first geostationary operational environ-
    mental satellite, GOES-A, at 6:M pm EDT for the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration aboard the 106th successful Delta
    from Kennedy Space Center. Transfer orbit elements were: apogee,
    36 795 km; perigee, 200 km; inclination, 23.7"; period, 650.9 min.
    Apogee boost motor fired at 10:51 am EDT 17 Oct. had put the space-
    craft into a synchronous orbit at 36 200 km altitude, where it wodd
    drift to its scheduled position approximately 50"N. When the GOES- A
    had been moved to position and checked out, it would be designated
    Goes 1 and turned over to NOAA for operational use.
       GOES was the first operational version of the prototype synchronous
    meteorological satellites (Sms 1, launched 17 May 74 into geostation-
    ary orbit at 75"W, and Sms 2, launched 6 Feb. 75 and positioned at
      115"W).
        Sms 1 , originally stationed over the eastern Atlantic in support
     of the Global Atmospheric Research Program, had provided the
     first near-continuous daylight coverage of a major hurricane
     (Carmen) in Sept. 1974. The day-night time-lapse motion pictures
     produced from Sms 1 images had aided understanding of hurricanes
     and tropical storms, as well as the total weather pattern in the
     Atlantic. Sms 2, from its station over the equator, had viewed the
     western half of the U.S., including Hawaii. Other N O h i satellites
     in polar orbit (Essa 8, Noaa 3, and Noaa 4 ) had collected global
     data for transmission to ground stations in Alaska and eastern
     U.S. This information has been available worldwide to any indi-
     vidual or agency with equipment that could receive the trans-
     missions.
        Goes 1 would provide NOAA scientists with images of a quarter of
     earth's surface at 30-min intervals, day and night. The satellite would
     also collect and relay nonvisual environmental data transmitted from
     thousands of manned and unmanned remote-sensing facilities on land
     and sea. Its radiation sensors would monitor solar activity and
     transmit its findings to NOM'S Environmental Research Laboratories
     in Boulder, Colo., for use in predicting solar storms that would affect
     radio communications on earth. Goes 1 would also transmit weather
     maps and other material from NOAA's station at Wallops Island, Va.,
     in a format suitable for use by.ground stations at regional forecast
     centers. (NASA Release 75-270; KSC Release 251-75; MORS E-608-

    outlasting much of its ground-support equipment and all but one of the
    technicians originally assigned to the experiment. The test had proved
    that flight hardware could stand temperatures as much as 30Â°C cooler
    than those encountered on missions already completed, and that simi-

17 October: More than 1000 instrumented platforms-either floating
    buoys or balloons-were being used to provide information on tropical
    and polar weather and ocean and ice conditions, NASA announced.

    The platforms would transmit data from their sites to NASA's
    meteorological research satellite, launched 12 June 1975, which
    would record and play back the data on command to ground stations
    around the world. The stations would then disseminate the infor-
    mation to investigators in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Norway,
    South Africa, and the U.S. Platforms would be located in such remote
    areas as the South Pole, Indian Ocean, Africa, Samoa, and the Arctic.
       The National Center for Atmospheric Research was releasing more
    than 400 balloons to altitudes up to 14 km from American Samoa,
    Ghana, and Ascension I. to study the atmosphere in the tropics. About
    50 low-level balloons were being released to an altitude of 750 m from
    the Seychelles island group, just north of the Malagasy Republic, by
    the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique in Paris to study the air-
    sea interface to determine its effect on monsoons in India. About 30
    ice buoys were being placed in the Arctic and Antarctic, one only 45 m
    from the South Pole, as part of a major U.S. government project to
    understand ice packs, icebergs, and weather patterns near the poles.
    Scientists from the Norsk Polarinstitut in Norway were deploying four
    drifting buoys to help chart ice drift in the Greenland area. (NASA

∞The Soviet Union may establish a ground station to receive data directly
    from the U.S. Landsat earth resources satellites, under a cooperative
    program in which the US. would establish facilities to receive data
    from Soviet weather satellites, NASA Administrator James Fletcher
    announced in Moscow. Landsat could be of enormous value to the

20-22 October: More than 100 astronomers from the United States and
    several foreign countries had gathered at Goddard Space Flight
    Center to exchange information on x-ray astronomy. The symposium
    had been arranged to discuss compact double-star systems that emit
    x-rays and that had been observed in other spectral bands-radio,
    optical, ultraviolet. Earthâ€™s galaxy alone contained 100 binary (double-
    star) x-ray objects, discovered by spacecraft observing their emissions
    beyond the radiation-absorbing blanket of earthâ€˜s atmosphere.
       Astronomers had considered the compact stars in these binary
    systems the most exciting objects of current research: the stars have
    masses close to that of earthâ€˜s sun, but diameters of only about 10 km.
    Neutron stars, for example, had been found so dense that a teaspoon-
    ful would weigh a billion metric tons, and â€œblack holesâ€™â€™ would be even
    more dense. Five satellites currently in earth orbit had been observing
    celestial x-rays: Copernicus, Os0 8, and Sas 3, managed by GSFC, and
    the U.K.â€™s Ariel 5 and the Netherlandsâ€™ Am I, for which GSFC had
    coordination responsibility. In the past year spacecraft had dis-
    covered six new and extremely powerful x-ray sources, brightness in
    the sky, known as x-ray novas from their sudden brightening and sub-
    sequent fading after several months. One of these x-ray novas is as
    bright as earthâ€™s sun and more than 10 times brighter than the easily
    visible Crab Nebula, most famous of the supernovas (exploding stars).

22-25 October: Two unmanned Soviet probes, Venera 9 and 10,dropped
     landers to the surface of Venus after 4.5-mo journeys and relayed to
     earth through 297 million km of space the first photographs of the
     Venusian surface. The two main probes went into differing 2-day-
     period orbits about the planet. The Venera 9 lander functioned for 75
     min in the atmosphere and 53 min on the surface, and the Venera 10
     for 75 min in the atmosphere and 65 min on the surface.
        The descent module of Venera 9 separated from the main space-
     craft 20 Oct., 2 days before it reached the Venus atmosphere, which it
     entered at 11:58 pm EDT 21 Oct., landing on the surface at 1:13 am EDT
     Oct. 22. When the atmosphere had slowed the descent sufficiently, a
     parachute system had been deployed at about 50 km above the
     surface, and the lander studied the cloud layers and atmosphere dur-
     ing the rest of the descent. The lander modules had been built to with-
     stand the hostile environment at the Venus surface, with tempera-
     tures that reach 500Â°C and pressures up to 100 times that of earthâ€˜s
     atmosphere. Before landing, the modules had been cooled to - 10Â°Cto
     provide a reserve of cold temperature that would permit operation for
     about an hour before overheating. Venera 10, launched 14 June and
     following the same procedure, had separated from its orbiter 23 Oct.
     and had landed on Venus at 1:17 am EDT 25 Oct.
        Venera 9, launched 8 June from the Baykonur cosmodrome, was the
     third Soviet spacecraft to make a soft landing on Venus: Venera 7 and
    8, which landed on Venus in Dec. 1970 and July 1972, respectively,
     had transmitted technical data for 23 and 50 min, respectively, but did
     not carry cameras.
        Pictures sent by the Venera 9 lander showed a rugged surface with
     sharp-angled and flat-surfaced rocks 30 to 35 cm across and some
     boulders. Pictures sent by the Venera 10 lander, which touched down
     2200 km from the site of Venera 9, showed what seemed to be an older
     mountain formation with smooth rounded rocks. Soviet scientists had
     expressed amazement that both sites were bathed in light. The dense
     cloudcover that hides Venus from earth had been thought to keep the
     planet in perpetual shade. Dr. Arnold Selivanov, one of the TV system
    designers, said that they had â€œexpected poor lighting conditions and
     built our instruments accordinglyâ€; this is why they had received
      good pictures. . .that can be used by newspapers without any pre-
    (6


    liminary processing.â€
        The horizon of Venus discernible in a corner of the Venera photos
     did not appear concave (ends bent upward), as had been expected as a
     result of the theorized distortion resulting from the planetâ€™s dense
     atmosphere. The apparent geological youth of the rocks on Venus

    earthquakes-we        should say Venusquakes-which             took place
    recently,â€ said Soviet mineralogist Dr. Aleksandr Basilevsky. â€œVenus
    apparently is internally active.â€ This conclusion had affirmed
    American theory that Venus resembled earth in having a liquid core, a
    mantle, and a rocky crust.
       Four Soviet scientists reviewing the Venera 9 and 10 program in an
    article in Pravda had summarized the descent-module findings: Tem-
    perature and pressure at the landing sites, 468Â°C and 90 atm, respec-
    tively; surface illumination, about 10 000 lux; local wind velocity at
    landing site, 0.4 to 0.7 meter per sec (Venera 9) and 0.8 to 1.3 meter per
    sec (Venera 10); natural radioactive elements in Venus rock, 0.3%
    potassium, 0.0002% thorium, and 0.001% uranium. Orbiting module
    findings were: Temperature of Venus clouds at upper boundary,
    about -35Â°C; cloud temperatures on nocturnal side, about 10Â°C
    higher; atmospheric temperature decreased with altitude, but local
    temperature elevations were observable at the 66 to 55 km level;
    Venus ionosphere was thinner than the terrestrial and closer to the
    surface; and the electron concentration on the daytime side was
    significantly higher than on the nocturnal side but about 10 times
    smaller than in the terrestrial ionosphere. Much of the information
    relayed from Venus had still to be processed.
       Cameras in the orbiting spacecraft of Venera 9 and 10 had pro-
    ceeded with photographing the dense cloudcover of Venus, their first
    pictures received 26 Oct. showing a panorama of more than 1500 km
    of the clouds circulating around the planetâ€™s equator. Scientists at the
    Deep Space Communications Center in Moscow said the pictures
    â€œconfirm the presence of powerful streams of circulating flows in the
    planetâ€™s atmosphere, first detected on board the American probe
    Mariner 10 in February 1974.â€ There was no indication, the Baltimore
    Sun commented, how long the two Venus mother ships would con-
    tinue in orbit. ( W T ,23 Oct 75,l; 26 Oct 75,1, sec. 4 p 7; FBIS 208,210,

During October: Air Force scientists under contract to NASA had com-
     pleted a study of the physiological effects on man resulting from trans-
     fers from one atmosphere to another during the 15-24 July Apollo-
     Soyuz Test Project. The difference between the Soyuz 7031-kg-per-
     sq-m atmosphere of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrogen and the Apolloâ€™s
     3515.5-k&per-sq-m 100% oxygen represented the transition between
     3048 m and 8230 m in altitude. In 1973, scientists, using a hyperbaric
    chamber to simulate spacecraft environment, had found that volun-
     teer subjects showed symptoms of decompression sickness (the
     bends) when moving from one atmosphere to the other. During the
     following year the scientists had found a way to lessen the chance of
     decompression sickness: The most satisfactory procedure was to
     increase the time allowed for denitrogenation (breathing 100% oxygen
     at ground-level pressure). This helped to remove excess nitrogen-
     cause of the bends-from the body. The Air Force study had helped
     NASA and Soviet ASTP planners schedule the actual transfers. (ASFC

∞ A new computer-controlled tracking device for telescopes, called VIP
     (video inertial pointing), had been developed at Ames Research
     Center to improve the aim of balloon-borne, airborne, and space
     telescopes. The two main functions of VIP were to help the astronomer
     steer the telescope, and to continuously update the automatic stabi-
    lization system that holds the telescope steady during viewing. Auto-
     matically stabilized telescopes heretofore had used gyroscopes to
     keep the telescope aimed at a point in space and counteract the
     rotation of the earth and other disturbances; gyroscopes had been
     found subject to drift, causing the telescope to wander off target. VIP,
     using a single video sensor, could generate the signals required for all

                                     214

      three control axes-roll, pitch, and yaw-and could use the visual
      information to point at nonvisible (infrared) sources. Previous systems
      using star trackers had needed from two to six conventional sensors to
      do the same job.
         Development of VIP had made use of several state-of-the-art
      devices: the microprocessor, a complete digital computer on a single
      printed circuit card, was the computer inside the VIP electronics. Two
      types of video sensors used by VIP were the solid-state imaging device
      called a CCD (charge-coupled device) that incorporated a matrix of
      light-sensitive elements on the surface of a silicon chip measuring
      0.01 mm on a side, and an advanced vidicon tube for night vision
      called an ISIT (intensified-silicon intensified-target) camera. By
      reducing the amount of hardware required for good performance, use
      of these new instruments had lowered the cost of the system. Ames
      would use VIP to provide accurate automatic pointing of the Space-
      lab Infrared Telescope Facility for the Shuttle that was under
      development at Ames and on contract. (Ames Astrogram, 9 Oct

    ∞NASA had awarded a $45.8-million contract to Radio Corporation of

      America Astro-Electronics Div. to design and build eight Tiros-N
      third generation meteorological satellites. The 635-kg Tiros-N
      (Television InfraRed Operational Satellite) would have 4 times the
      payload capacity of the previous generation of metsats, and was
      expected to be able to forecast weather 2 days in advance with ac-
      curacy equal to the 1-day predictions. In addition to providing day and
      night imagery, the Tiros-N spacecraft would take atmospheric and
      sea-surface temperature readings; measure proton, electron, and
      alpha-particle activity surrounding the earth; and collect data from
      weather platforms on balloons and from ocean buoys. (GSFC Goddard

      the Air Force, was developing an experimental ground electro-optical
      deep-space surveillance (GEODSS) system to scan nighttime skies for
      orbiting and geosynchronous satellites. The system was being in-
      stalled at White Sands Missile Range, first of a proposed five-site
      GEODSS worldwide surveillance network. The network would augment
      the Air Forceâ€™s Aerospace Defense Commandâ€™s spacetrack coverage
      which maintained a day-by-day count of all satellites and debris
      circling the earth.
         GEODSS combined two sophisticated telescopes with electro-optics,
      a T camera, and a digital computer, as well as system-related
          V
      equipment. Mounted at the focal plane of the larger telescope was aTV
      camera to transmit the signal to the observatory control room for
      instant screening and analysis. (AFSC Newsreview, Oct 75, 14)
    ∞The Air Force had successfully test-flown an F-lllD turbofan jet
      engine with all-composite third-stage fan blades 40% lighter than

      Force Base-marked the first military flight evaluation of a rotating
      structural engine component made of composite materials. Objec-
     tives of the flight-test program were to determine long-term environ-
      mental effects on the material and to verify potential operation and
      maintenance cost benefits. Use of composites could provide a 15 to
     20% weight savings in jet engines, allowing increased payloads or
      extended range. (AFSC Newsreview, Oct 75, 1)

∞Two visiting research associates working under 2-yr associateships
    awarded jointly by NASA and the National Research Council com-
   pleted their research at NASA. While at NASA Dr. Ditmar Kranzer of
   the Technical University of Vienna, Austria, had designed and fabri-
   cated charge-coupled devices on silicon and sapphire wafers. This
   type of electronic device would be used as part of an electronic circuit
   for imaging, storage, and signal processing. The device had a high
   speed capacity, a low power requirement, and a very high packing
   density, which would decrease the number of outside connections
   needed for the circuits and reduce the area required for data storage.
      Dr. Tsuneo Yoshikawa had developed steering laws for single-
   gimbal and double-gimbal control-moment gyro systems during his 2-
   yr tenure at NASA. These laws, which apply to any spacecraft
   requiring highly accurate attitude-control systems, had been formu-
   lated in an effort to minimize performance deterioration. (MSFC Re-

1 November: A newly discovered dwarf galaxy called Snickers, 55 000
    light years from the sun, and nearest neighbor to the Milky Way yet
    found, could lead to more accurate estimates of the size of earthâ€˜s
    galaxy. Announcing his find in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, Dr.
    S. Christian Simonson of the U. of Md. said the new galaxy had been
    hidden from earth view by dense star fields and cosmic dust clouds.
    Spots of hydrogen gas detected on radioastronomy maps were the clue
    that led to the discovery, first to be made solely through
    radiotelescope observations of hydrogen gas. Until now, the Magel-
    lanic Clouds-twin galaxies about 205 000 light years away-had
    been considered the galaxies nearest to the Milky Way. Dr. Simonsonâ€™s
    new galaxy had been christened Snickers by his colleagues, who said
    â€œit was like the Milky Way, only peanuts.â€ (B Sun, 2 Nov 75, A23)
2 November: Efforts to charge batteries on the Viking 2 lander failed for
    unknown reasons, but controllers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory were
    confident that time would allow them to solve the problem. Both
    Viking 1 and 2 were launched with their lander batteries essentially
    uncharged to prolong their lives; the batteries aboard the Viking 1
    lander were charged without difficulty 2 wk ago, and the same
    procedure had been scheduled for Viking 2. The spacecraft carried a
    backup as well as a prime battery charger, but NASA had not at-
    tempted to use it in case the problem had originated outside the
    charger system. Use of the backup before the problem had been
    identified might have damaged it as well as the prime charger. Viking
    2, originally scheduled to be launched first, had been pulled back for
    repair after its orbiter batteries had been accidentally drained;
    officials said there was no connection between prelaunch orbiter
    problems and the lander situation. (NASA Release 75-288; Aero Daily,

∞Marshall Space Flight Center forwarded the experimental payload for
    the first launch of NASAâ€™s Space Processing Applications Rocket
    (SPAR) project to Goddard Space Flight Center, where the payload
    would be integrated with its launcher, a Black Brant sounding rocket.
    The integrated unit would undergo checkout before being sent to N.
    Mex. for firing by White Sands Missile Range early in Dec. The pay-
    load consisted of nine scientific experiments on processing materials
    in near-weightlessness. After the first launch, three flights per year
    carrying similar payloads had been planned through 1980. All pay-
    loads were to be recovered by parachute for ground analysis. The low-
    cost SPAR missions would provide data on space processing until
    Space Shuttle flights began in the early 1980s. (MSFC Release 75-233)
4 November: Inflation and procurement reforms had hiked NASAâ€™s        charge

∞Soviet polar station Severny Polyus-22 had been scheduled to get a
    companion, a Moscow Tass broadcast reported. Drifting on an ice floe
    in the Arctic for the past 3 yr, the stationâ€™s scientists had made about
    200 scientific landings on the ice since last spring to observe the ice,
    the ocean, and the atmosphere. Another ice floe in the area of the

    the first deliveries of prefab houses and stocks of fuel and food had
    already been made by air. Scientists were to arrive at the new station
    in a few days. The high-latitude expedition, called Sever-27, was
    described as the biggest in the history of Arctic exploration, aimed at a
    comprehensive survey of the Arctic Ocean between the coasts of the
    U.S.S.R., Canada, and Greenland; about 50 scientists had par-
    ticipated. Work had also been done under an international program
    called Polex, to photograph the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and to
    study the lower surface of the polar ice cap. (FBIS No 214,4 Nov 75)

       The subcommitteeâ€™s three-volume report, â€œFuture Space Pro-
    grams,â€ called for new space systems for educational and medical
    services, and for new earth-survey satellites to provide maritime,
    agricultural, geological, and demographic data. The report stressed
    that the agency should offer both short-term and long-term plans. The
    latter should include plans for lunar bases, orbital colonies, extra-
    terrestrial communications, planetary and stellar exploration, satel-
    lite solar power, and disposal of nuclear waste.
       Chairman Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) of the House Committee on
    Science and Technology endorsed the subcommittee report, which he
    said contained â€œsensible recommendations,â€ noting particularly the

  ∞Workmen on the largest building in the world using solar energy for
    heating and cooling had doubted that the system would work, until
    they turned on a water hose, said Dr. Robert San Martin of the Energy
    Institute at N. Mex. State Univ. When the time came to put the collec-
    tors on the roof, the foreman told the crew to run water through them
    with a garden hose; the workmen forgot that the collectors had been in
    the sun and were quite hot. â€œWhen they ran the water through, violent
    steam came shooting out the other end,â€ said Dr. Martin. â€œAt that
    moment they were convinced.â€
       The one-story building, a facility for the N. Mex. Dept. of Agricul-
    ture, would use 330 units mounted on its roof as a solar collector. Fluid
    circulated through the collectors heated by the sun would provide 80%
    of the heating and cooling of the 23@-sq-m structure. Biggest test
    would be use of solar energy for cooling, relatively untried as yet.

    pressed to the point of fusion. A test reactor at MIT called Alcator had
    successfully raised the magnetic field containing the hot plasma to
    75 000 gauss, about 150 000 times the strength of earthâ€˜s magnetic
    field at the equator; this, said Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Admin-
    istrator of the Energy Research and Development Administration,
    â€œexceeds by a factor of five anything previously achieved anywhere in
    the world.â€
       The Soviet Union in the 1960s had developed toroidal (doughnut-
    shaped) machines called Tokamaks that produced better tempera-
    ture, containment time, and particle density in combination than
    anything before; a similar machine built in France had achieved a
    figure of 2 trillion for the density-multiplied-by-containment-time, at a
    temperature of 20 millionâ€™c. MEâ€™S Alcator had achieved 10 trillion, at
    a temperature of 10 millionâ€™c. ERDA officials and university scientists
    noted that the plasma confinement would have to be another 10 times
    as effective, at temperatures 10 times higher, than those of the Alcator
    experiments before fusion could be achieved artificially in the
    laboratory. Although the U.S. had begun a program to build the first
    fusion-power plant by the end of this century, the economy of this new
    power source would remain doubtful in spite of the availability of
    cheap fuel from the ocean: The costs of such plants had been esti-
    mated at billions of dollars each. (NYT, 6 Nov 75,27; CSM, 6 Nov 75,l;

    been detrimental to the economics of the private sector. Karl G.
    Harr, president of AIA, told the House Subcommittee on Aviation &
    Transportation R&D during hearings on H.R. 11573 that a proper
    partnership between NASA and the aerospace industry should be main-
    tained, and warned of the prospect that the government might move to
    â€œincrease its share of that partnership.â€ Involvement of government
    in postresearch activities such as prototype development â€œthreatens
    to weaken our private technological base,â€ Harr said. â€œWe do not feel
    that NASA and other government agencies should both identify the
    needs and pursue the solutions on their own.â€ Commending NASA for
    its 10-yr aircraft fuel-reduction program, Harr said the program was
    â€œan ideal opportunity to develop the government-industry team into
    its most efficient and cost-effective form.â€ (Transcript, Vol I1 Part I,

9 November: All four batteries on the Viking 2 lander had been fully
    charged, NASAâ€™s Propulsion Laboratory reported. The problem
                         Jet
    had been solved by using a backup charger system carried on the
    orbiter after the primary system failed earlier [see 2 Nov.]. Recharg-
    ing took about 24 hr per battery. The voltage had to be replenished
    before the spacecraft entered Mars orbit and before the lander
    separated from the orbiter. The difficulty with the landerâ€™s primary
    charger had been traced to failure of one of four resistors in the cir-
    cuitry. To prevent unforeseen problems with the backup charger,
    Viking project officials had decided to keep at least one of the batter-
    ies charged throughout the remainder of cruise flight, to ensure acti-
    vation of the switch shifting the lander from its solar-panel power to

      Institute that might be spending up to $50 million annually within 3 yr
      after its establishment. Competition had begun even before issuance
      of formal criteria describing the centerâ€™s mission and needs, expected
      later in November. A report on the center by a special committee of
      the National Research Council-an agency of the National Academy
      of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering-had forecast
      a staff of about 800 professionals and 800 support people. The
      committee had recbmmended a single institute administered by a
      nonprofit corporation, like those that govern many other large national
      laboratories; geographical location had not been considered as
      important as â€œintellectual atmosphere, technical suppliers and
      availability of services for a substantial laboratory.â€ Issuance of
      criteria by the Energy Research and Development Administration
      would call for proposals early next year, with site to be chosen in
      April or May 1976 by Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Administrator of
     ERDA.
          Among those already in competition were the state of N. Mex.,
      which had put a proposal for the solar center in Feb. 1975 when ERDA
    . was a month old; a consortium of universities and industries on Long
      Island, N.Y.; the governors of six New England states, sitting as the
      New England Regional Commission, who voted to â€œwork as a regional
      forceâ€ to get the center for New England; and the state of N.Y.,which
      had designated a coordinator to work on getting the center, including
      6b
         assembling the necessary real estateâ€ from various areas of the
      state. (NYT, 9 Nov 75, 33)
10 November: Marshall Space Flight Center had awarded contracts worth
      $500 000 each to Martin Mariettaâ€™s Denver Division and to TRW Sys-
      tems Group, to define the Spacelab payload called AMPS(atmospheric,
      magnetospheric, and plasmas in space). The definition studies would
      emphasize flexibility, low cost, and an evolutionary approach to
      environmental research.
          One of the first payloads considered for Spacelab, AMPs had been
      conceived as a manned orbiting scientific laboratory to study the near-
      space environment of earth and the effects on it of changes in incident
      solar energy and of emissions from earth. Instrumentation would in-
      clude a laser beam to define the composition of the various constitu-
      ents of earthâ€˜s atmosphere. Missions would last from 7 to 30 days, with
      extensive involvement of the scientist crews in conducting the
      experiments. (MSFC Release 75-239; SBD, 20 Nov 75, 108)
  ∞The u.S. space program was an adventure whose potential benefits
      were undefinable and incalculable, NASA Administrator Dr. James C.
      Fletcher told the National Academy of Engineering. Speaking on the
      â€œOutlook for the Space Program,â€ Dr. Fletcher noted that the public
      and the Congress were â€œnowâ€ oriented, and that concentration on
      immediate benefits might jeopardize â€œthe vast potentialâ€ of the
      national space program. Admitting that â€œNASAâ€™s    present actions seem
      to speak louder than its words,â€ in that its money had been spent on
      current needs rather than on tomorrowâ€™s goals, Dr. Fletcher said this
      did not result from lack of vision but from â€œaccommodation with

11 November: Development of a reusable single-stage Space Shuttle that
    could perform better than the current partially reusable design, and
    cost less, would be feasible before the end of this century â€œif pushed
    aggressively enough,â€ Robert E. Smylie, Deputy Associate Admin-
    istrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology for NASA, told the
    House Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. Studies by
    the agency had shown that structural weight reductions of 25% and
    propulsion-system improvements of 5 to 6%, relative to current space
    flight technology, could be achieved in the late 1990s. In other areas of
    space technology, Smylie cited the concept of solar-electric propul-
    sion that had been considered for planetary missions using the Space
    Transportation System, and described research in automated pro-
    cessing of microcircuits, robot vehicles for planetary exploration,
    vitreous materials resistant to laser radiation, and dry lubricant with
    application in space payloads. (Transcript, Vol I Part 1, 696, 726,

    Landsat information to users, NASA had planned expansion by May
    1977 to handling 200 Landsat scenes a day and delivering magnetic
    tapes from the data centers to the user within 24 to 48 hr after receipt
    of data at GSFC. (CR, 11 Nov 75, S19689; SBD, 17 Nov 75, 84)

13 November: The earthâ€˜s ozone layer, a shield of heavy molecules of
    oxygen that prevents some harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching
    the earthâ€˜s surface, might be in less danger from aerosol sprays than
    from the increasing worldwide use of chemical fertilizers. Michael B.
    McElroy, professor of atmospheric sciences at Harvard University,
    had predicted that a projected increase in the use of nitrogen
    fertilizers over the next 25 yr could reduce the ozone layer 20 to 25%.
    Theoretically, each 1% reduction in the ozone layer could lead to
    thousands-as many as 15 000-additional cases of skin cancer in the
    U.S. alone.
       Al life needs nitrogen to make proteins, McElroy pointed out. The
        l
    earthâ€˜s atmosphere would have lost al its nitrogen long ago except for
                                            l
    the process by which bacteria â€œdenitrifyâ€ decayed matter in the soil;
    most nitrogen returned to the atmosphere in the same inert pure form
    in which it was taken and converted to use by earthâ€™s plant life, which
    then formed a source of nitrogen for other plants and animals;
    however, some nitrogen returned in a form that acted as a catalyst to
    destroy ozone. Man had recently been extracting nitrogen from the air
    and putting it into plant life in the form of fertilizer on a scale rivaling
    nature; by the year 2000, said McElroy, the amount of nitrogen
    extracted from the air would be double that removed by natural
    causes. With a sharp increase in the natural denitrification process,
    more nitrogen catalysts destructive to ozone would be released.
    Serious effects should be evident within the next 4yr, McElroy said.
    Although aerosol sprays could be dispensed with, nitrogen fertilizers
    were a necessity for increased world food production. Increased
    incidence of skin cancer concerned light-skinned humans, who were
    unlikely to get much sympathy from darker-skinned inhabitants of
    areas where the fertilizers-and increased food production-are
    urgently needed. (WSJ, 13 Nov 75, 13)

∞Calculation of crop acreage from satellite images had proven â€œgenerally
    adequateâ€ in NASA tests involving wheat acreage in nine Great Plains
    states during the past year, NASA Associate Administrator Charles
    W. Mathews told the House Subcommittee on Space Science and
    Applications. Reporting on the 9.9% error rate in the LACE (large area
    crop inventory experiment) test using Landsat data, Mathews said
    that the U.S. had demonstrated the feasibility of an operational global
    forecasting system for wheat. Mathews mentioned other Landsat
    data applications: The Geological Survey and NOAA had developed
    computer techniques for processing multispectral Landsat data that
    made oil slicks clearly visible. Other computer techniques using the
    data had detected subtle differences in surface soils and rocks that
    revealed mineralization and potential ore deposits. (Transcript, Vol I

∞Estimated cost of the Spacelab being built for the first Space Shuttle
    flight had risen from $400 million to $500 million during the last year,
    and the program had fallen 3 to 6 mo behind schedule, NASAâ€™s     Space-
    lab program director Douglas Lord told the House Subcommittee on
    Space Science and Applications. The European Space Agency, which
    was developing Spacelab, was confident of delivering it in time to fly
    on the Shuttle. Lord and NASA Associate Administrator John F. Yard-
    ley said the increased development cost would not affect NASAâ€™s     cost
    in purchasing the modules, because NASAâ€™s agreement with ESA pre-
    cluded the Europeans from recouping development costs. NASA had
    been committed to buying one set of Spacelab hardware at a cost â€œrea-
    sonable to NASA,â€ although pricing proposals would not be received
    for 6 to 8 mo. The two officials said European cooperation on the pro-
    gram had been â€œexceptional.â€ (Transcript, Vol I Part 1, 889)
14 November: Pan American World Airways announced the industryâ€™s
    fiist nonstop flights from New York and Los Angeles to Tokyo,
    beginning early in 1976. The announcement came a day after a new
    Boeing 747SP jetliner had made a demonstration flight New York to
    Tokyo in 13 hrs 33 min, fastest commercial service to Japan from the
    U.S. Current commercial time on that route, which required a
    refueling stop, was more than 17 hr. The Boeing 7 4 7 ~ ~       (special
    performance) was 100 seats smaller than the 747-21, but had the same
    fuel capacity and the same four engines as the larger model. The SP
    had been capable of cruising faster and higher than any other
    commercial jetliner and had a range of 1200 km beyond that of the
    standard 747. (B Sun, 15 Nov 75, A9)
15 November: Observation of the sunâ€™s magnetic fields might make it

    University. Investigators at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration in Boulder, Colo., and at Stanford said that magnetic

    forces from the sun played a role in formation of pressure troughs on
    earth, which bring rainy weather; observations from space, cor-
    roborated from earth measurements, indicate influence on weather
    from solar flares, sunspots, and high velocities of the solar wind.
       The weather effect involved two phenomena, the sunâ€™s magnetic-
    sector structure and a concept called the vorticity-area index. The
    index is a measure of the size of low-pressure troughs in square
    kilometers, calculated by computer from twice-daily standard
    weather-service maps. As solar magnetic sectors and boundaries
    were measured regularly at Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Astro-
    physical Observatory in the Crimea, and the Stanford Solar
    Observatory, scientists could compare the solar magnetic structure
    with the vorticity-area index to see whether the sun structure affected
    the nature and size of low-pressure troughs that bring rain and stormy
    weather. (NYT, 16 Nov 75, 40)
∞A nova that exploded about 10 000 yr ago and attracted the attention of
    primitive farmers in the Near East may have been a stimulus to the
    rise of manâ€™s first known civilization, according to the New York
    Times. Reporter Boyce Rensberger, writing on the theory published
    in the Explorers Journal by amateur scholar George Michanowsky,
    described clues found by Michanowsky in cuneiform texts regarding a
    gigantic star in the constellation Vela. No particularly bright star was
    to be found in Vela in modern times, Michanowsky pointed out, but
    astronomers had agreed that a supernova of uncertain date had
    probably been the forerunner of the present Gum nebula, a huge
    glowing cloud of hot gases centered on a relatively cold pulsar.
    Occurrence of the supernova had been placed anywhere from 6000 to
    15 000 yr ago. In the times after the starburst, the primitive
    peoples-especially Sumerians-developed astronomy, mathematics,
    and writing; Michanowsky had suggested that the supernova had
    stimulated great attention to stellar phenomena and led to a more
    careful study of the heavens, to formal astronomy and mathematics,
    and to the need to make written records. (NYT, 15 Nov 75, 29)
17 November: The U.S.S.R. launched its 76th space mission for 1975, an
    unmanned Soyuz 20, from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam,
    and established a new procedure by identifying the unmanned flight
    as a spacecraft designed for manned flight. Reuters quoted Soviet
    scientist Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov as saying the purpose of the flight
    was to develop a transport system either to supply a space station with
    expendables, or to serve as an emergency rescue ship. One possibility
    would be to automatically dock a Soyuz with the manned station after
    one of the cosmonauts had removed the original Soyuz, or perhaps a
    new Soyuz would be used as a new return vehicle: one of these
    procedures would be required unless the Salyut space station had
    been designed with two docking positions.
       The Soviet director of Julyâ€™s Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Konstantin
    Bushuyev, in Houston for a conference, said Soyuz 20 had not been
    designed to transfer expendables to the current Salyut 4 space
    station; Christopher S. Wren, reporting from Moscow for the New
    York Times, pointed out that it was not known how provisions could be
    transferred from the Soyuz to the space station, since neither craft
    had been reported to have such an automatic capability. (NYT, Nov20

     overall employment on the space program had been forecast down
    68%, or 278 000 workers, from its peak of 409 000in 1965. NASA would
     lose 17 more Federal positions in FY 1976 after losing 521 Federal
     employees in FY 1975. NASA is paying more for fewer employees, Liuy
     pointed out, because agency manpower expenses go up about $6
     million a year, offset by only $1million in replacing retired workers
     with new workers in lower grades. Total Federal employment at NASA
     had hit a high of 33 924 in 1966; NASA Federal employees now

     Calif., to Edwards Air Force Base for its approach and landing tests, a
    Rockwell official said as the orbiter made its first appearance for the
    press. Original plan had been to send the orbiter piggyback on NASAâ€™s
     Boeing 747 scheduled to launch the unpowered craft during its tests at
    Edwards. Travel on the ground would take 6 hr to go about 32 km,

    nounced. Salyut 4 , the orbiting space station, had been visited by the
    crew of Soyuz 17 for almost 30 days and by the crew of Soyuz 18 for
    more than 60 days. The Soyuz 20 mission had been analyzed as
    transfer of fuel to Salyut 4 ; in orbit since 26 Dec. 1974, the space
     station was thought to be running low on maneuvering fuel. Reporters
    had speculated that a new two-man crew might be sent to Salyut 4
    later this year for a stay of 3 mo or longer that would break the 84-day
    record set by U.S. astronauts in 1974. The value of the automatic
     docking for resupply would be the economy of not sending men with
    each flight, although the Soviets had never indicated the cost of their
    launches.

    phere explorers was the unusually large onboard propulsion system
    that enabled the later spacecraft to move themselves up or down in
    space by hundreds of km or go from highly elliptical to circular orbits.
    The name â€œdeep-dippersâ€ meant that the spacecraft could drop into
    the atmosphere and pull out again, taking measurements only while in
    the upper reaches of the thermosphere. This region, important
    because it absorbed most ultraviolet light and heat received from the
    sun and because movement of that heat determined the structure of
    the upper atmosphere, had been difficult to study because the altitude

    was too high for all aircraft and most balloons and too low for other
    satellites. The dipping orbit prevented accumulation of excessive heat
    in the metal skins of the AE spacecraft.
      Explorer 55 would also cany a backscatter ultraviolet spectro-
    photometer to obtain a vertical profile and density measurements of
    the ozone layer between 20â€N and S; the measurements would be
    compared with those from Nimbus 4 , launched in 1970, to evaluate the
    long-term accuracy of the Nimbus instrumentation. A mission opera-
    tions report 23 Dec. said Explorer 55 had completed more than 400
    orbits and all subsystems were performing well. (NASA Release 75-

20 November: Pioneer 11 had been scheduled to take its first look at
    Saturn, according to controllers at Ames Research Center. Upon its
    encounter with Jupiter on 2 Dec. 1974, Pioneerâ€™s trajectory was
    altered by the gravitational effects of Jupiter to one that would take
    Pioneer to Saturn on or about 1 Sept. 1979. The spacecraft had
    returned the only pictures ever taken of Jupiterâ€™s polar regions and
    probed the planetâ€™s intense inner radiation belts for the first time,
    attaining the highest speed ever attained by a manmade object
    (171 000 km per hr).
       Pioneer was still more than 1287 million km from Saturn, but in a
    position to observe the ringed planet at a phase angle 4 times larger
    than the largest angle at which Saturn could be seen from earth. The
    total amount of light and the polarization of sunlight reflected from a
    planetâ€™s atmosphere at different angles could reveal the composition
    of the atmosphere; scientists would watch Saturn throughout Pioneerâ€™s
    approach to note changes in intensity and polarization of light re-
    flected from the planet with changes in phase angle. The viewing
    angle would also permit study of the light-reflecting characteristics of
    Saturnâ€™s rings in large areas of shadow from the planet, an effect not
    visible from earth. Pioneer was headed upward out of the plane
    containing the sunâ€™s planets, and in 1977 would attain a distance
    above this plane of about 161 million km, allowing it to measure
    phenomena coming from higher latitudes on the sun than previously
    observable. (ARC Release 75-53; MOR S-811-73-07, 19 Nov 75)

∞The Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Organization awarded a
    $36.3-m=on contract to McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. for
    building and testing in earth orbit a space laser communications

    to relay high-data-rate messages by laser to aircraft, ground stations,
    or other satellites, with a capability of transmitting a billion pieces of
     data per sec-about 20 times the data volume possible with present
    commercial communications-satellite systems. The award includes
    development of the space and ground-station equipment. McDonnell
    would work on high-accuracy pointing of the laser beams, within 10
    millionths of a degree. (St. Louis P-D, 20 Nov 75,13; LA Times, 9 Dec

    and AEM- B (the stratospheric aerosol gas experiment-SAGE).
    AEM-A, scheduled for launch in 1978, would carry a heat-capacity
    mapping radiometer that NASA would acquire independently, to gather
    thermal-inertia data on rock types, location of mineral resources, soil
    moisture, and vegetation-cover temperature measurements.

    carrying 4 U.S. experiments as well as materials from Russia, Czecho-
    slovakia, France, Hungary, Poland, and Romania, to be recovered in
    Soviet territory in about 3 wks. Launched from Plesetsk into an orbit
    with 405 km apogee, 227 km perigee, 62.8" inclination, and 90.5 min
    period, the satellite provided an opportunity for U.S. scientists to fly
    biology and weightlessness experiments that would otherwise have
    had to await flights of the Space Shuttle in the 1980s. Last U.S.
    biology research spacecraft, Biosatellite 3, had been launched in

       Cosmos 782 was the first satellite equipped to simulate gravity in
    space, to compare effects on biological processes with those of
    weightlessness. A specially constructed centrifuge, consisting of a
    small disk that would rotate at a constant speed, would create a
    centrifugal force equal to gravity on earth for packages placed at the
    right spot on the disk. Comparing the specimens exposed to lack of
    gravity during orbital flight with similar specimens feeling the pull of
    gravity would prove any effects had resulted from weightlessness.
    Results of the experiments should be available in about 90 days, ac-
    cording to the Tass news agency.
       Ames Research Center managed the U.S. participation in the
    Cosmos 782 flight. It had had no advance notice of the launch date,
    place of launch, or mode of orbital operation, although life limitations
    of the biology materials had dictated a launch near this date. NASA had
    been invited to participate in a second Soviet biosat mission in 1977,
    and had planned to fly Russian experiments on its Space Shuttle in the
    early 1980s. (NYT, Nov 75, 62M; NASA Release 75-292; SBD, 28

    with heat and contracts with cold in the usual way, had been designed
    to hold stable the mirrors of NASAâ€™s    Large Space Telescope without
    being distorted by temperature changes. Built by Boeing Aerospace
    Co. under a $185 000 contract with Marshall Space Flight Center,
    the structure had been subjected to a 2-day vacuum-chamber test at
    Boeingâ€™s Space Center in Seattle under temperatures ranging from
     -84Â°C to +21â€C without suffering lens-limiting thermal distortion.

   ∞The Soviet Academy of Sciences chose Anatoly Alexandrov, a 72-yr-old
     nuclear physicist, as its new president, the Tass news agency re-
     ported. Peter Osnos commented in the WushingtonPost that the main
     speaker at the Academy meeting-Mikhail Suslov, the Communist
     Partyâ€™s chief ideologist, who is not even a member of the Academy-
     made the only speech on Alexandrovâ€™s behalf. This, said Osnos,
     showed the extent to which the choice was determined by Kremlin
    leadership and the Partyâ€™s growing influence over the once-
    autonomous scientific establishment. Academy members tradition-
    ally had voted in secret ballots and had maintained their own organiza-
    tional structure in running the countryâ€™s important research facilities;
    Alexandrov was chosen on a secret ballot, but apparently there were
    no other candidates. Alexandrov, head of the atomic research institute
    in Moscow, was one of the few Academy members also a member of
    the Party central committee. (W Post, 26 Nov 75, A8)
26 November: Under a decision of the Federal Communications Commis-
    sion, the Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSat) had been
     making too much money and would have to reduce its rates on interna-
    tional communications services by up to 35%. The order followed a
     10-yr FCC investigation of the entire range of ComSat services. Essen-
    tially a wholesaler of communications, ComSat had been selling satel-
    lite circuits to telephone and telegraph firms that retailed the services
    to consumers. The FCC order could substantially reduce overseas
    telephone and telegraph charges; an accompanying order required the
    international firms that had been dealing with ComSat to pass the
    reduced rates on to their customers. FCC ruled that ComSat was

29 November: Radio astronomers in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had
    intensified their search for possible civilizations out in space, Walter
    Sullivan wrote in the New York Times.Little publicity had been given
    the search to prevent raising public expectation for â€œwhat is likely to
    be a prolonged effort.â€ Costs were minimal, because the observations
    had made use of equipment also used for other research. Dr. Hans
    Mark, Director of Ames Research Center, had told students at the
    Polytechnic Inst. of N.Y. that the search for other civilizations would
    become â€œone of the major scientific enterprises,â€ and cited his belief
    that â€œcommunicative civilizationsâ€ had been a natural consequence of
    biological evolution. Dr. Mark pointed out that the U.S. giant antenna
    at Goldstone, Calif., used for spacecraft communications, could pick
    up emissions only from the vicinity of the nearest stars. One American
    search is using the largest antenna on earth-the        dish at Arecibo,
    P.R.-to    scan the five nearest galaxies at 1420 mhz, the frequency of
    radio waves given off by hydrogen atoms, long considered a logical
    frequency for civilizations trying to make contact. The Arecibo search
    had been conducted by two Cornell professors, Dr. Frank B. Drake
    and Dr. Carl Sagan. Another American search had been using the
    National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, W. Va., to
    scan 700 stars (resembling earthâ€˜s sun) within 80 light years of the
    solar system for signals at the 1420-mhz wavelength. No obvious
    signals had been detected, but the recordings had not been subjected
    to detailed analysis, according to Dr. Patrick Palmer of the Univ. of
    Chicago and Dr. Benjamin M. Zuckerman of the Univ. of Md.

    Union. The moven&er issue of karus, international journal of solar-
    system studies, had carried a prospectus of the Soviet CETI (communi-
    cation with extraterrestrial intelligence) program divided into two
    phases. CETI 1, scheduled from 1975 to 1985, included the whole-sky
    scan by eight stations plus monitoring by two space stations and a
    survey of nearby galaxies like the one under way at Arecibo. Only the
    eight-station prdject had been initiated, as far as U.S. scientists knew.
    CETI 2, from 1980 to 1990, had been scheduled to continue satellite
    monitoring but would also use semirotatable antennas such as the
    RATAN-600 antenna 6 0 m wide, known to be located high in the
    Caucasus; the system consisted of numerous plates that had to be

                      to perfprm this ro e. The Soviets also envisioned a
    monitoring station at the point beyond the moon where the gravita-
    tional fields of earth and moon would balance each other; a station at
    that point would be protected from the earthâ€˜s own radio emissions.
    Identical fluctuations of signal recorded simultaneously at widely
    separated points would be considered to have extraterrestrial origin
    rather than to result from a local manmade effect. (NYT, 29 Nov 75,

During November: An x-ray telescope assembled at Marshall Space Flight
    Center fdr the study of remnants of an exploded star had been shipped
    from England, where it had undergone payload integration, to the
    Woomera Rocket Range in Australia for launch. The project, called
    Skylark for the British sounding rocket on which the telescope would
    fly, was a joint British-American undertaking to study a supernova
    remnant. known as Puppis A for information on the evolution of stars
    and perhaps on the formation of neutron stars. The flight would
    provide at least 3 min 20 sec for the 346.5-kg payload to make its
    observations above 120-km altitude. (NASARelease 75 -287; MSFC

    successful day-to-day tracking of ice-pack movement in the Arctic
    Sea north of Alaskaâ€™s oil-rich Prudhoe Bay area. Knowledge about the
    interaction between the winter sea ice and the continental shelfwould
    be important to government and to oil companies; government would
    use the information in allocating driUing areas and overseeing their
    use by private industry. Oil companies would need to know whether to
    locate drilling rigs on the ice or sink them into the sea bed; whether to
    bury pipelines under the ocean floor, lay them along the bottom, or run
    them over the ice to loading areas. The exterior sphere of the plat-

      forms, built to be dropped on the ice from small aircraft, had been
      constructed of a tough material to foil the hunger and curiosity of polar
      bears, which reportedly would attempt to chew on anything appearing
      different from the usual surroundings.
         The tracking and data-relay experiment aboard Nimbus 6 had suc-
      cessfully completed its share of a transmission test that sent sensor,
      telemetry, and ranging signals from its near-polar 1110-km orbit to
      NASAâ€™s Ats 6 in geostationary orbit 35 900 km above India. The signals,
      relayed to NASAâ€™s    Madrid receiving station, were immediately re-
      transmitted to GSFC. Information gathered in the test would be used to
      design the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) planned
      for late 1979. The system would use two geostationary satellites to
      relay tracking data, commands, and communications between a cen-
      tral ground terminal and a number of spacecraft in low earth orbit; this
      would increase low-orbit spacecraft access to ground stations from 15
      to %%, reducing NASA requirements for ground-station networks.
      General Electricâ€™s Space Div., reporting on the success of the test,
      said the quality of all data received was excellent. (Marshall Star, 26

    ∞The Bangui Anomaly-a massive magnetic disturbance in the earth
0
      along the equator in Africa, suggesting rich deposits of heavy metals
      like iron and uranium-had been accidentally discovered by Ogo 1,
      launched in 1964 with magnetometers that were stiU measuring the
      earthâ€˜s magnetic field in 1970 when the Geological Survey decided to
      use them for other purposes.
         Attempting to measure the ionosphere for traces of a jetstream
      above the equator, Survey scientists noticed a â€œkinkâ€ in the data and
      had checked their findings by scanning the region with magnetome-
      ters in aircraft. Results showed a magnetic difference so great that it
      could be caused only by an ore body larger than the Mesabi range in
      Minn., largest in the U.S. Scientists had deemed the find so important
      that NASA had suggested putting a satellite in orbit to do nothing but
      chart the earthâ€˜s magnetic field.
         The anomaly was named for the capital of the Central African
      Republic, an extremely poor nation almost as big as Texas with a
      population of about 2 million. The deposits had been localized in hilly
      regions away from the Ubangi River, so that a railroad or highway
      would be needed to carry ores to the river for shipping. State Dept.
      sources said that interest in the region among foreign mineral-
      extraction companies had risen. (Oâ€™Toole, LA Times, 15 Nov 75, 1)
    ∞Energy from the Mideast had been forecast for cooling buildings in the

      sweeten the waters of the Dead Sea, heat water for householders in
      Cyprus and Israel, and desalinize water for military units in Saudi
      Arabia. First desalination plant of its kind to use solar energy would be
      built at Aqaba by the Jordanian Royal Scientific Society working with
      Dornier of West Germany; the latter company would also build the
      small desalting plants for the Saudis. A world conference on solar

    ∞A simple device familiar for centuries-the     flywheel-had been the
0
     subject of a national symposium as a possible solution for some of
     Americaâ€™s critical energy problems. The first conference on flywheel
     technology, held at Berkeley, Calif., under sponsorship of the Energy
     Research and Development Administration and the Lawrence Liver-
     more Laboratory, had been told that modern materials and design had
     made possible a superflywheel that could transform the energy pic-
     ture. The principle upon which flywheels performed-storage            of
     mechanical energy by a spinning wheel-had been enlarged by the
     use of fiber composites developed for use in spacecraft nosecones that
     had greater strength-to-weight ratios, being 10 to 20 times stronger
     than steel and much lighter. As the amount of energy stored by the
     flywheel varied as the square ofthe rotation speed, the limit had been
     on the tensile strength of the material used; the fiber wheel could be
     spun faster to store more energy per kg than the conventional metal
     one, and would also cost less. A superflywheel might spin at 100 000 or
     even 200 000 rpm. Both the Soviet Union and American industry had
     displayed interest in developing the flywheel; use of the technology in
     automobiles would reduce pollution and would represent a safety
     improvement. The flywheels also could act in backup systems for
     homes using solar energy and windmills for their energy needs.
     Further investigation of the materials under stress-rupture tests was
     being conducted at the Lawrence laboratory and elsewhere. (MT,30

     of Congress. The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sci-
     ences said the study would be â€œmost usefulâ€ in its continuing investi-
     gation of pollution in the upper atmosphere. The study called for an
     international system of data gathering and institutional control, at the
     same time emphasizing the lack of conclusive evidence that
     fluorocarbons had reduced atmospheric ozone-although it found
     â€œvery strong groundsâ€ for believing that probable cause of harm
     existed. (SBD, 4 Nov 75, 12)

1 December: National Science Foundation held in Chicago the first of 7
     meetings scheduled nationwide to obtain public views on a Federal
     program for greater public involvement in science policy issues.
     Subsequent meetings would be held during Dec. in Atlanta, Dallas,
     Denver, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Boston. Oral and

2 December: Space programs that create new commercial activity, new
     wealth, and new jobs were essential to the growth of both the US. and
     Europe, Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) told the Assembly of Western
     European Union. Reviewing policies that had governed agreements
     on space with Western Europe, Moss warned that continued
     cooperation in space would hinge on Europeâ€™s paying its full share of
     the expenses. Concentration on programs with immediate application
     to earth problems should not mean abandonment of space science, or
    loss of â€œthe vision and imagination that have been so important to our
     achievements to date,â€™â€™ the senator said. (CR, 10 Dec 75, S 21650;

0
      an artificial earth satellite for the first time, becoming the third
      country after the U.S. and the Soviet Union to develop a technique for
      returning a satellite from orbit. The satellite, which had been
      launched 26 Nov., was Chinaâ€™s fourth; the third had been orbited in
      July and the fiist two in 1970 and 1971. Edward K. Wu, Hong Kong
      correspondent of the Baltimore Sun, noted that Chinese scientists and
      engineers apparently had solved technological problems including
      development of a heat-resistant alloy to withstand reentry tempera-
      tures, automatic techniques for remote control, and a trigger system
      to fire the satellite back to earth. (B Sun, 4 Dec 75, A4)
    ∞The automated docking of the U.S.S.R.â€™s pilotless Soyuz 20 with the
      unmannedSaZyut 4 space station [see 19Nov.] had been a preliminary
      to Soviet experiments aimed at building a permanent space base, the
     Christian Science Monitor said. Recalling the failure of the automatic
     docking system in August 1974, CSM quoted Maj. Gen. Vladimir
     Shatalov-head of the cosmonaut group-as saying that the Soyuz
     was being developed as a universal spacecraft for carrying crews,
     fuel, and provisions to scientific stations and for assembling com-
     plex structures in orbit; craft of this kind would â€œundoubtedly become
      assembly sites for large space stations to be set up in orbit.â€ European
      observers had said the Soviet plan would be to launch the central part
      of the space platform first, followed by separate laboratory modules
      that would plug into docking ports to draw on the power and facilities
      of the mother station. The orbital stations would be supplied with
     consumables by a modification of the existing Soyuz, and this
      experience would be applied later to shuttles and space tugs. (CSM, 3

    ∞Evidence that aerosols from spray cans had damaged earthâ€˜s ozone layer
9
      had been under study by an independent scientific panel that would
      make its report early in 1976, the â€˜wallStreet Journal said, but Federal
      action against fluorocarbons was not considered likely before that
      time, and foreign governments were considered unlikely to act before
      the U.S. did. Fluorocarbon manufacturers and users had insisted that
      the ozone-depletion theory had not been proved, and warned of
      damage to an industry that had made products worth $400 million
      to $450 million a year, with manufacturing facilities worth $300
      million. U.S. producers had accounted for about half the worldâ€™s pro-
      duction of fluorocarbons, which was approaching about 0.9 billion kg
      a year.
         Two Univ. of Chicago chemists-Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood
      Roland-had advanced a theory 18 mo ago that fluorocarbons used in
      spray containers and in refrigerators and air conditioners were getting
      into the upper atmosphere, encountering ultraviolet light (more intense
      at high altitudes) that split the fluorocarbon molecules to release
      highly active chlorine. The chlorine had depleted the atmospheric
      ozone by converting it to ordinary oxygen. The theory had been partly
      confirmed in the laboratory by National Bureau of Standards chemists
      who showed that ultraviolet lamps would split fluorocarbons to
      produce either one or two chlorine atoms, depending on the ultraviolet

    wavelength used. However, no one had discovered a way to measure
    the ozone to tell whether it had been affected by chlorines from
    fluorocarbon dissociation. Another clue had been to search for
    chlorine products such as hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere;
    tests conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using U-2 flights and
    balloons had confirmed the presence i the stratosphere of hydro-
                                              n
    chloric acid that had not originated from the earth. Granting the effect
    of aerosols, opinions had been divided upon the significance of ozone
    depletion: possible consequences of additional ultraviolet radiation
    impinging upon earth included increased incidence of skin cancer,
    harmful effects on animal and plant life, and alteration of temperature
    patterns in the stratosphere with resulting alteration of weather
    patterns on earth. Even without proof of damage, public apprehension
    of risk had increased pressure for a ban on the suspect chemicals,
    especially in aerosols. (Tannenbaum in WSJ, 3 Dec 75, 1)

4 December: NASAâ€™s    winter phase of meteorological rocket and satellite
    comparisons had been completed at Wallops Flight Center, where 31
    single and two-stage rockets had been launched since 18 Nov. Data
    obtained from the launches had been compared with measurements
    received from the Nimbus 6 satellite passing over the Wallops facility.
    The Super-Loki single-stage rocket had carried three types of pay-
    load: inflatable spheres of mylar to obtain atmospheric density and
    wind measurements; datasondes to obtain temperature and wind data;
    and ozone-measuring devices. The Nike-Cajun, a two-stage vehicle,
    carried acoustic grenade payloads to measure wind and temperature
    by recording time and location of detonation on arrays of sensitive
    microphones at the launch site that could measure time lapse and
    direction of sound arrival. The rocket and satellite data comparison
    had been the latest of several conducted from the Wallops facility
    since 1970. (WFC Release 75- 14)

     Research stations on such floating islands made it possible to trace
     circulation of Arctic ice over many years; the Severny Polyus-22
     station operating in the Arctic for 3 yr had moved in a clockwise

     satellites-a small rigid sphere of aluminum and a large inflatable
     sphere of mylar-similarly instrumented with a mass spectrometer
     and associated electronics. The satellites were to have been in 90â€œ
     polar orbits intersecting periodically, to measure atmospheric densi-
     ties ai two differing altitudes but at the same latitudes at the same
     local-hour angle of the sun. The measurements would show effects on
     upper atmosphere readings of changes in solar heat input and the
     relationships between upper and lower atmospheres.

∞Marshall Space Flight Center issued a request for quotations from
    industry for development of a flat conductor-cable wiring system
     suitable for use in residences and commercial establishments. Sur-
    face mounting, a feature of the flat cable system originated by NASA to
    reduce the size and weight of wiring harness in space capsules,
    would eliminate the need for routing wires in walls, ceilings, and
    floors because it could be covered by paneling, tile, or even wall-
    paper. Use of the flat wiring would reduce costs of wiring new con-
     struction and permit savings in renovating, remodeling, and re-
    wiring of existing buildings. The successful proposer would develop
    a surface-mounted baseboard system using a cable 63.5 mm wide;

10 December: Marshall Space Flight Center announced it would distribute
    the first NASA Standard Parts List (NSPL) to all NASA centers and
    contractors in Jan. The NSPL was to include electronic parts selected
    from experience in flights, tests, failure analyses, and recent plant
    surveys, to ensure reliability. The standardization had been under-
    taken to solve problems of small-quantity buying, high cost, long
    delivery schedules, market fluctuations, â€˜part failures, and extensive
    rework. The cost of correcting problems resulting from failure of parts
    had been estimated as 100 times the cost of preventing the use of poor-
    quality parts to begin with. The NASA Standard Parts Lead Office,
    located at MSFC because of its experience in parts management
    developed during the Saturn program, would establish requirements
    for parts, coordinate the effort with all NASA Centers, and issue and

∞A long-duration free-flying manned space station in earth orbit appeared
    to be the most economical way of providing a continuing manned
    presence in space, according to â€œManned Orbital Systems Con-
    cepts,â€ a study conducted for Marshall Space Flight Center by
    McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. A station that could significantly
    extend the time in space planned for the Space Shuttle would offer
    advantages for doing a given amount of work with fewer flights and
    reducing the number of turnarounds, checkouts, and similar opera-
    tions. A permanent facility could offer maintenance and repair and
    even reconfiguration of payloads. The study envisioned development
    of four-man facilities that would serve as building blocks for growth
    into larger stations for 12 or 24 workers as needed; the four-man
    configuration would consist of a subsystems and habitability module
    carried into orbit by one Shuttle and joined with a logistics and
    payload module carried on a second mission. Several payload modules
    could be docked in tandem with the core vehicle, or in radial locations
    through use of a multiple-port docking adapter. The core vehicle
    would be left on station for a nominal lifetime of 5 yr, logistic and
    payload modules being replaced at 90-day intervals. Crew exchange
    and resupply would occur every 90 days. The study concluded that
    problems anticipated by the world in the 1990sshould be solved in the
    19809, and that an extended-duration manned orbital facility could
    contribute significantly to those solutions. (MSFCRelease 75- 26)

  ∞NASh marked the 10th year in space of Pioneer 6, launched 16 Dec.
     1965 to make the first detailed measurements of the interplanetary
    medium, some spanning more than 805 million km. Pioneer 6 had
    measured the sunâ€™s corona, returned data on solar storms from the
    invisible side of the sun, and measured the tail of Comet Kohoutek,
    during what was believed to be the longest operating life yet attained
    by an interplanetary spacecraft; it had also helped to chart the solar
    wind, solar cosmic rays, and the solar magnetic field, all of which
    extend far beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Pioneer 6, and three sister
    craft-Pioneers 7, 8 , and 9-all years beyond their 6-mo design
    lives, had constituted a network of solar weather stations that circle
    the sun in locations millions of kilometers apart. Two younger craft-
    Pioneer 10 and 11-had flown past Jupiter in 1972 and 1973 and were
    headed for the outer reaches of the solar system. (NASA Release 75-

14 December: The Air Force launched a â€œspy satelliteâ€ from Kennedy
    Space Center at 12:15 am EST into a stationary orbit at about 36 000
    km above earth. Although no announcement had been made of the
    success or failure of the launch, observers next day concluded that
    the launch had been successful. The satellite was one of a series de-
    signed to monitor missile launchings in China and the Soviet Union to
    give a 30-min warning of a land-launched attack or about 10-min warn-
    ing of a missile attack from submarines. It had been launched by a
    Titan IIIC, 24th of this type launched from Cape Canaveral, and
    was thought to carry both infrared sensing equipment and still and TV
    cameras to permit day and night monitoring. (NYT, 16 Dec 75, 14;

15 December: Giant designs stretching for miles on the Nazca plains of
    Peru had possibly been laid out by observers in hot-air balloons, Time
    magazine reported, as members of the InternationalExplorers Society
    constructed and flew such a balloon over the area using materials and
    techniques available to the ancient Indians. Documents discovered in
    Portugal had revealed that in 1709 a missionary had demonstrated a
    model of a hot-air balloon reportedly used by the Indians. Textiles re-
    covered from desert graves provided evidence that the Nazcas had
    the materials to make a balloon envelope, and a picture of an ancient
    ceramic appeared to represent a hot-air bag. The IES members built
    a balloon about 27 m high with fabric resembling the Nazca material,
    with lines and fastenings from local fibers and a gondola woven from
    reeds growing in Peruâ€™s Lake Titicaca. Named Condor I, the device
    flew about 4 km in 18min and reached an altitude of more than 300 m.

    achieve a tenfold improvement in reliability over mechanically driven
    recorders now in use. The bubble-domain technology would make
    the recorder about a third the size and half the weight of present
    recorders and would require only half the power for operation. Dr.

    launched 26 Nov., had been recovered, leading observers to believe the
    Chinese engineers had perfected soft-landing techniques. Weights of

    photographs taken during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, according to
    Dr. Farouk el-Baz, director of the Smithsonian Center for Earth and
    Planetary Studies at the National Air and Space Museum. Dr. el-Baz,
    who coordinated the earth-observation study of ASTP, said the photo-
    graphs provided geologic evidence of the continental drift theory in
    color shots of a vast complex of fault lines extending north from the
    Red Sea through the Gulf of Aqaba, the Dead Sea, and the Sea of
    Galilee. The fan-shaped pattern revealed the movement of the Ara-
    bian landmass to be a rotation rather than simply an eastward drift,
    Dr. el-Baz said. Until the ASTP pictures became available, the fault
    line had not been known to extend beyond the Golan Heights region,
    probably a pivotal spot geologically as well as politically. (NYT, 18

18 December: Allegations that the Soviet Union had been testing a laser
    system to blind u.S. spy satellites were discussed in an article in the
    Christian Science Monitor. A satellite watching Russia from a spot in
    the sky over the Indian Ocean had set off false alarms of a missile
    attack 18 Oct. when its sensitive instruments detected heat such as
    might result from the firing of missiles. The heat had originated from
    a fire caused by breaks in a natural gas pipeline, as later satellite
    photographs confirmed, but between the alarm and the photographs
    U.S. intelligence had speculated that the Soviets had trained lasers
    on the satellite to prevent detection, in violation of the U.S.-Soviet
    agreement on arms. The gas fires had set off other warnings after 18
    Oct., apparently because the ruptures and fires occurred at different
    times and places in Russia in both October and November. CSM
    quoted an article in Aviation Week magazine questioning whether
    lasers could be used to prevent monitoring of military activity on the
    ground by satellites, noting that officials at the u.S. Arms Control
    Agency had discounted the reported incidents. Both the U.S. and the
    Soviet Union were known to be spending large amounts on laser
    research, and the December issue of the authoritative Janeâ€™s Weapon
    Systems had discussed the implications of laser research for military
    uses in both countries. (CSM, 18 Dec 75,3; Miami Herald, 24 Dec 75,

∞The Soviet Union for the first time had discovered atoms of â€œnatriumâ€-
    sodium, as it is known in the U.S.-at an altitude of nearly 100 km,
    in the lower ionosphere. The experiment was difficult, said Tass,
    because at that altitude only 1 atom of natrium exists per 1000
    million molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. A laser unit had estab-
    lished a relationship between natrium content in the upper at-
    mosphere and meteor showers; the announcement said the discovery
    would be signifcant because of the effect of natrium on long-
    distance television and radio communications. (Tass, in FBIS No. 248,

    named Satellite Business Systems fied applications with the Federal
    Communications Commission seeking authorization to establish an
    all-digital system to serve large industrial, government, and other
    users beginning in 1979. The new partnership had been formed by
    subsidiaries of Aetna Life & Casualty, Comsat General, and IBM, each
    of which intended to own one-third. The proposed system, using
    higher frequencies at 12 and 14 gigahertz and advanced technology,
    would permit customers in geographically dispersed locations to com-
    bine voice, data, and image communications into a single integrated
    private-line network; small automated ground stations would be lo-
    cated at customersâ€™.premises and connected where possible to exist-
    ing terminals to minimize terrestrial communications costs. The sys-
    tem would use two satellites in geostationary orbit at about 36 000

    neuver in response to signals from earth, 458 million km distant. Con-
    trollers at Ames Research Center ceased communications with the
    Pioneer for several hours, giving the spacecraft time to command
    itself into a change of position, fire its thrusters, and reposition itself
    with antenna pointing back to earth. The maneuver increased space-
    craft velocity by 108 km per hr, to ensure that Pioneer would have
    a choice of approach as it neared Saturn: between the rings and the
    planet, or under the rings and upward outside them. Recent tests
    had shown the onboard camera working well; Pioneer 11 had been
    scheduled to take the first closeup pictures of Saturn and its rings
    upon arrival at the planet in 1979. If its course had been set inside
    the rings, Pioneer 11 should be able to look closely at Saturnâ€™s sixth

   ∞The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had developed
     a new remote-sensing technique to â€œseeâ€ nitrogen oxide in the
     stratosphere, permitting scientists for the first time to calculate the
     actual rate at which the nitrogen compounds destroy stratospheric
    ozone. Much of the work on the ozone cycle had been theoretical,
     based on computer models and laboratory tests; seasonal variations in
    the stratosphere at high latitudes, revealed by spectrometers on jet
     aircraft, had not been predicted by theory, which meant that the com-
    puter models had not provided close simulation. The new technique,
    using a spectrometer to measure the light spectrum and isolate that
    portion caused by nitrogen dioxides, would permit routine checks on
    daily, seasonal, and latitudinal variations in the content of the strato-
     sphere. The method would be applied by small automated instru-
    ments run by minicomputers at N o h i stations in Alaska, Samoa,

∞The Air Force had awarded a $28.5-million contract to Lockheed Air-
    craft Corp. for design, development, and testing of a strengthened
    wing for the C -5A transport airplane that the New York Times called a
    symbol of Pentagon â€œcost overruns.â€ Aim of the original C -SA con-
    tract with Lockheed had been to produce a transport capable of
    carrying a 99 700-kg payload and having a service l i e of 30 000 flying
    hours. Even before it had gone into full operational use, the C-5A
    wing had been shown in static ground tests to be too weak to carry the
    prescribed load and had developed fatigue cracks in. the metal struc-
    ture. The cracking had been attributed to high stresslevels inherent in
    the design, ineffective fasteners on the wing panels, and difficulty in
    mating the stiff contours of the wing and joints during manufacture.
    The Air Force had paid $4.5 billion on delivery of 81 C-5As; it had
    already spent more than $198 million through June 1975 correcting
    deficiencies for which Lockheed was responsible under the original
    contract, renegotiated when Lockheed was in financial difficulty in
    1971. In addition to $1.3 billion for furing the wings, the AF planned to
    spend another $200 million to fu other defects. Cost of the repairs

    have to be grounded beginning in 1979 when the flying-time safety

    British-French Concorde, could fly at an altitude of up to 46.3 km,
    higher than conventional airliners. Although the flights had been
    billed as the first commercial service by a supersonic jet, and had been
    scheduled to get ahead of the Concorde passenger service set for
    January between Paris and Rio and between London and Bahrain,
    Tu-144 would not carry passengers until the second half of 1976 at

    supersonic transports-pointed out that the effect of Concorde pollu-
    tion would be completely swamped by other factors that had been
    shown to decrease atmospheric ozone-nitrogen fertilizers, carbon
    tetrachloride, and fluorocarbons. Banning the Concorde from the U.S.
    would not prevent it from depositing pollutants elsewhere; in any case,
    military planes flying in the stratosphere and subsonic planes pushing
    to higher altitudes to avoid traffic would produce the same pollution
    effect as the Concordes. Singer, now a professor of environmental
    sciences at U. of Va., called for more study of the effects of Freon and
    fertilizers and for modification of the engines of future SSTs. (Miami

    Raketen A.G. to build and launch rockets on a commercial basis,
    starting in 1980: if successful, it would be the world's first private
    space-launch venture. NASA had been charging at least $25 million to
    put a $lZmillion satellite into space; Kayser had designed a "space
    truck" to put satellites in orbit for half the NASA price. His rockets
    could not be used for military purposes, he said, as he had no plans to
    sell equipment, but would do the launches himself and sell only
    booster services. As the launches could not take place in crowded
    West Germany, they would have to be done from either a ship at sea or
    from a base in some sparsely populated country. After ground tests of
    Kayser's rocket engines last summer, German scientists had been
    convinced that his spacecraft would fly.

       Kayser said that if the Germans would not su port him, he would
    seek backers elsewhere, in South America or sia. He had hoped
    more than half the backing would come from private investors, and the
    rest from banks. The West German government had spent about $2
    billion to encourage German and European space projects that could
    offer an alternative to the NASA monopoly, but such projects had not
    succeeded.
       The first "space truck"-now under construction for suborbital test
    next year-would be 39.62 m high and consist of inexpensive conven-
    tionally produced materials. To make mass production possible, a l   l

30 December: Pulsars had been discovered to be not only superdense but
    also superfluid, Columbia University physicists reported indstrophys-
    ical Journal. Pulsars, collapsed remnants of exploded stars formed
    almost entirely of neutrons, had been shown to be so dense that a
    spoonful would weigh millions of metric tons. Theorists had suspected
    that such objects, even with a thin rigid crust of iron, would be
    superfluid-a state produced experimentally on earth in small helium
    specimens cooled almost to absolute zero, where both friction and
    viscosity disappear. Material inside such an object, stirred into mo-
    tion, would swirl indefinitely.
       The Columbia Univ. experimenters had attempted to measure the
    surface temperature of a young pulsar, such as the one in the Crab
    Nebula. If the temperature were less than 8.8 million'c, the object
    would probably be superfluid; a fast-spinning neutron star would cool
    rapidly because of its reduced heat capacity. Temperatures of such
    objects could be detected by x-ray wavelengths, but the x-rays pro-
    duced could not penetrate earth's atmosphere. Space observation was
    necessary, and rockets launched by NASA from Hawaii and N. Mex.
    tested the Crab nebula pulsar, using the moon as a curtain. As the
    moon passed across the whole nebula several times, cutting off its
    various x-ray emissions, the physicists had been able to identify the
    x-rays indicating temperature. Since the Crab nebula pulsar's tem-
    perature was shown to be less than 5 million "C, the hysicists con-
    cluded that the pulsar must be superfluid. (NYT, 30 f;ec 75, 40)
∞Predictions of a trend toward harsher winters for North America had

    Environmental Satellite Service had published a document, â€œMonthly
    Winter Snowline Variation in the Northern Hemisphere from Satellite
    Records, 1966- 1975,â€ containing the most complete record available
    of hemisphere snowcover. Analysis of the charts had revealed no
    significant change in North American snowcover during the entire
    period. Predictions of harsher weather had raised the possibility of
    southward movement of the polar ice cap, which could be caused by a
    drop of only a few degrees in average winter temperature. The docu-
                                                              .
    ment concluded that â€œLack of systematic increase in . . snow cover
                                          .
    tends to contradict the evidence. . that the current climate is chang-
    ing adversely.â€ (NOM Release 75-217)
∞President Ford had signed legislation establishing a 17-member U.S.
    Metric Board to plan for voluntary conversion of the nation to the
    metric system. Dr. Ernest Ambler, acting head of the National Bureau
    of Standards, said the signing of the bill would encourage U.S. indus-
    try and commerce to export products made to metric dimensions,
    which â€œshould stimulate additional international trade.â€ (SBD, 30 Dec
    75, 299)
During December: Goddard Space Flight Center and the Fla. Dept. of
    Natural Resources had approved the first long-range, space-assisted
    program to develop an â€œearly warning systemâ€ for the onset of red
    tide, an ocean-borne organism that had left tons of dead fish rotting on
    beaches around the world. Dr. Warren A. Hovis of GSFC had designed
    an ocean-color scanner capable of detecting subtle variations in the
    color of coastal waters that might indicate changes in concentration
    and species of marine phytoplankton, especially the red-tide dino-
    flagellate Gymnodinium breve. Red tide had been a major problem
    because of oxygen depletion in ocean water from fish decomposition,
    and eye and respiratory infections caused by toxic particles produced
    in the organism. Shellfish beds affected had been closed for months by
    authorities. An outbreak of red tide in 1971 had cost the state of Fla.
    more than $20 million in lost tourist business. The ocean scanner,
    developed for use in the Nimbus-G pollution-sensing spacecraft
    scheduled for launch in 1978, could be used in photographic over-
    flights by aircraft and Landsat spacecraft, in connection with on-site
    sampling of ocean waters by research ships, to detect the organism in
    time to take countermeasures and warn the public about affected
    areas. (Spaceflight, Vol 17 No. 12, Dec 75, 425)
∞The boards of directors of the All-Women Transcontinental Air Race
    and the Ninety-Nines, Inc., had decided to terminate the Powder Puff
    Derby-worldâ€˜s largest and longest speed race for light aircraft-after
    the 1976 bicentennial race, because of the nationâ€™s current financial
    and energy problems, the National Aeronautic Association an-
    nounced. Sponsored by N M since its beginning in 1947, the derby had
    a safety record unparalleled in air race history: no fatalities. The N U
    newsletter noted that the derby had inspired countless women to fly,
    and that recent races had more than 100 aircraft competing. The final
    derby had been scheduled for 12-19 July 1976 from Sacramento,
    Calif., to Wilmington, Del. (NAA News, Dec 75)
∞Space scientists and astronomers had been wrestling with a â€œcultural
    crisisâ€ in putting names to features of distant worlds that had never
    been clearly seen before, as closeup views of several planets became
    available and more were on the way. Working through the Interna-

      tiond Astronomical Union, the scientists had been forced to look
      beyond the names of scientists and explorers that had been used
      almost exclusively for objects on the moon and on Mars. A meeting on
      the problem in Moscow in July 1974 had agreed that objects on Venus
      would be called after women famous in mythology and history. New
      maps of the recently photographed surface of Mercury would bear the
      names of contributors to the arts and other humanities; the scientists
      had sought advice from scholars in the humanities to get the widest
      possible representation from past and present cultures.
         The Moscow meeting on new approaches to names for planetary
      features had been preceded by intense work on naming newly dis-
      covered configurations on the moon and on Mars. A complete scheme
      of names for more than 500 large formations on the far side of the
      moon-visible only to spacecraft because one side of the moon had
      always been turned toward earth-had been approved in 1970. Soviet
      scientists had rejected suggestions of names from the humanities for
      features on the moon and on Mars; they had urged a fresh start on
      Mercury, a new planet, with formations named not only for authors, as
      the Americans had originally suggested, but also for persons in other
      branches of the humanities. (MT,25 Dec 75, C10)
    ∞Space communities that could supply enough energy to the earth to end
0
      its energy crisis permanently had been described in an article by Dr.
      Gerard K. ONeill in Aerospace magazine. Recalling the conclusions of
      Princeton Univ. conferences on space colonization in 1974 and 1975,
      and his own testimony before the Subcommittee on Space Sciences
      and Applications of the House Committee on Science and Technology
      23 July 1975, Dr. O'Neill said that within 13 yrs after beginning
      construction in space, the amount of usable electricity delivered to the
      point where power would enter the distribution system would exceed
      the peak capacity of the Alaska pipeline. An investment of about $96
      billion over a 6-yr period would serve to establish the beachhead
      colony, and even with program costs of up to $300 billion the payback
      after 9 yr would exceed the total investment and interest, he
      estimated. (Aerospace, Dec 75, 3)
    ∞Establishment of manufacturing facilities in space might be feasible
0
      within this century, Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill wrote in the December issue
      of Science magazine. Construction of satellite solar power stations
      (SSPSs) from lunar materials, for example, could be shown more
      economical than building such stations on earth and lifting them into
      orbit. The space manufacturing facility (SMF) that had been envisioned
      by Dr. O'Neill and others would be a self-sustaining habitat for a large
      number of people whose energy needs could be met by solar power
      used directly for agriculture, as process heat for industry when con-
      centrated by mirrors, or indirectly as electricity. Dr. O'NeiU had
      assembled tables and figures from the literature to accompany his
      argument for the SSPs as a means of meeting increased demands for
      electricityon earth in a time of shortage of fuels and concern about use
      of nuclear energy. (Science, Vol 190, 4218)

    World space activity increased in 1975. Total launches, 125, increased
from 106 in 1974. Of this total, the u.S. had 28, described in the introduc-
tion to Appendix B. The U.S.S.R. had 89 launches with 112 payloads, 85 of
these in the Cosmos series; Cosmos payloads included such specialized
spacecraft as Cosmos 775, part of the Statsionar series for TV relay, and the
Cosmos 782 biosat carrying 4 U.S. experiments. The Soviets also launched
10 spacecraft in the Molniya comsat series, 4 in the Meteor series, 2
Intercosmos spacecraft carrying experiments from other countries, the 2
Venus landers (Venera 9 and l o ) , the magnetospheric investigator Prognoz
4 , a color-TV comsat called Raduga (Rainbow), and 5 Soyuz spacecraft
including the April 5 â€œanomalyâ€ and theSoyut 19 that participated in ASTP.
The U.S.S.R. also launched Aryabhata for India in April, and Sret 2 for
France as a piggyback payload with Molniya 1-30 in June.
   The number and variety of launches by other countries also increased in
1975. In Feb., France launched Starlette, a passive geodetic satellite, first
for the Diamant booster developed by cms; in May it launched Castor and
Pollux, first 2 satellites launched by France on a single booster; in Sept.,
the industry-managed satellite Aura went into orbit on the last Diamant
booster. The U.S.S.R. had launched Franceâ€™s Sret 2 in June, and a
French-West German consortium sponsored the launch of Symphonie 2 by
NASA in Aug. In Feb., Japan launched Taiyo to observe solar radiation and
thermospheric structure; in Sept., it launched Kiku to measure tempera-
tures in space. The Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in July launched its third
satellite, first in 4 r (previous launches were in 1970 and 1971); in Nov.,
                    ZI
it launched a fourt satellite and shortly announced its successful recov-
ery, becoming the third country to retrieve a payload from orbit. In Dec.,
the PRC launched its fifth satellite, third for 1975, in what observers
considered a step toward its first manned space flight.
   The following table includes all payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as
probes, ascended to at least the 6500-km altitude that traditionally had
distinguished probes from sounding rockets; or (c) conveyed one or more
human beings into space, whether or not orbit was attained. The 1975table
lists for the first time in this series the identities of Soviet launch vehicles;

              MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1975

   The following table of major N S launches includes payloads carried by
                                  AA
all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched in 1975 by N SAA
or under N S direction.
            AA
   During 1975, the U.S. had 34 launches of which 28 were successful. Of
these, 7 were launches by DOD. The remaining 21 were N S launches, 10
                                                           AA
for its own program, including ASTP in July; the two Viking spacecraft
launched toward Mars in Aug. and Sept. ;3 applications satellites, Landsat
2, Geos 3, and Nimbus 6; and 4 scientific satellites-oso 8, Sas-C (Explorer
53, launched by an Italian crew from the San Marco platform into an
equatorial orbit); AE-D (Explorer 54), and AE-E (Explorer 55). In 1974,
N S had launched only one all-U.S. scientific payload. Launches for
  AA
others included 3 spacecraft for DOD; 3 comsats-Zntelsat IV in May and
Zntelsat IVA in Sept., and the RCASatcom 1 ;2 for NOAA, Sms 2 in Feb. and
Goes 1 in Oct.; and 3 international satellites-Anik for Canada in May,
C o s B for E A in Aug., and Symphonie 2 in Aug. for the West German-
             S
French consortium.
   The table includes vehicle and payload performance under categories S
for successful, P for partially successful, and U for unsuccessful. A fourth
category (Unk) indicates payloads that did not operate because of vehicle
failure. The categories, which are unofficial, do not take into account that
U missions may produce valuable information, or that payloads with along-
life design may fail to meet design requirements and become officially
unsuccessful at a later date. Further information on these launches ap-
pears in Appendix A and in the indexed entries in the text.

              MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS, 1975

  A high point in NASAâ€™s activity in 1975 was the Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project, in which three astronauts in the Apollo (ASTP) spacecraft and two
cosmonauts in the U.S.S.R. Soyuz 19 flight-tested a mechanism for joining
two orbiting manned spacecraft from different countries, in historyâ€™s first
international manned space flight. The ASTP achieved a number of firsts:
First space flight involving crews and spacecraft of more than one nation;
first linking in orbit of spacecraft of more than one nation; first detection of
a pulsar outside earthâ€™s galaxy; first separation of live biological materials
in space, by electrophoresis; first communications between a manned
orbiting spacecraft and ground controllers through an orbiting unmanned
satellite (Ats 6 ) . The Soyuz 19 liftoff for ASTP was the first Soviet launch
shown on live television, and its parachute descent and landing were the
first to be televised live. Of the 28 ASTP experiments, 21 were U.S., 5 were
joint U.S.-U.S.S.R., and 2 were West German. All primary mission ob-
jectives were met. ASTP was the only U.S. manned flight of the year, and
would be the last until the Space Shuttle flights scheduled for the 1980s.
   The U.S.S.R. attempted 4 manned launches including Soyuz 19 for
ASTP; 3 of these were successful. The April anomaly was attributed to a
booster failure, and the crew was retrieved safely; the incident called into
question the safety of crews during ASTP, but the latter ended successfully.
   By the end of 1975, the u.S. had made 31 manned space flights: 2
suborbital, 20 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and 6 lunar landings, with a
total of 43 different crewmen. The U.S.S.R. had made 27 manned flights,
all in earth orbit, with 34 cosmonauts. The U.S. total of manned-spacecraft
hours in flight was 7681 hr 10 min; the U.S.S.R. total, 5265 hr 3 min. Total
cumulative man-hours in space for the US. were 22 503 hr 39 min; for the
U.S.S.R., 10 734 hr 48 min.

   NASA SOUNDING ROCKET LAUNCHES, 1975

  The table following lists the 83 sounding rockets of the Arcas class and
above launched by NASA in 1975. The launches took place in Peru,
Greenland, Canada, and the Kerguelen Islands of the Indian Ocean as well
as in the United States. Payloads were carried for the Naval Research
Laboratory, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and three NASA
centers; fifteen universities; and two u.S. corporations. Onboard
experiments included 35 physics; 18 meteorology; 11 each astronomy and
aeronomy; 7 performance tests; and 1 space-processing experiment.
  Information fcr the table came from Goddard Space Flight Centerâ€™s
Quick Look Sounding Rocket Data sheets, issued after launches, with
additional information from some of the experimenters concerned. The
Kerguelen Islands launches in January and February were part of a joint
Soviet-French exercise called ARAKS-artificial aurora between Ker-
guelen and Sogra (U.S.S.R.)-from      which the usual telemetry reports
were not available. Launch dates in the table are local time, with the date
by Greenwich Mean Time given if different.

   Lifting bodies are wingless vehicles that receive aerodynamic lift from
their shape alone. NASA undertook in the early 1950s a program to de-
velop concepts for a maneuverable manned vehicle that could reenter the
atmosphere from space and to provide a technological basis for hyper-
sonic cruise aircraft. Since 1963, NASA's   Flight Research Center (called
Dryden Flight Research Center after January 1976) has flight-tested the
M2 configuration designed by Ames Research Center, the HL-10
designed by the Langley Research Center, and the X-24A and X-24B
in a joint program with the Air Force.
   The X-24B program began with a captive flight in 1973 and ended with
the 36th and fmal flight on 26 Nov. 1975. The X-24B was launched
from a B-52 aircraft, usually at an altitude of 13 700 meters; in captive
flight, the vehicle remained attached to the B-52. In unpowered free
flight, the vehicle glided through maneuvers to landings on a dry lake bed;
in powered flight, the rocket engine was ignited to take the vehicle to
higher altitudes and achieve higher speeds.
   The following table lists all X-24B missions that left the ground in 1975,
even those eventually aborted because of weather or mechanical prob-
lems. The flight number includes vehicle designation (B for X-24B
                        number-B-52 carry number. "B -19-30" was the
vehicles)-free-flight
19th free flight of the X-24B and the 30th time it was carried by the
B-52. C or A appearing instead of a free-flight number indicates a captive
or an aborted flight.
   Information for the table appears in flight reports issued by the Office
of Aeronautics and Space Technology at NASA Headquarters and in the
X-24B flight summaries issued by the Flight Research Center.
