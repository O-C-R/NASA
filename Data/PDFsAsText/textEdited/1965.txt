  The year 1965 recounted by this volume was an outstanding one in the
U.S. space program. In his space report to Congress, President Johnson
called it â€œthe most successful year in our history.â€ It was one filled with
noteworthy milestones deriving from less noticed decisions, actions, and
labors of previous years. In the same way, milestones of the future are to
be seen in their formative stages in this chronology for 1965.
   Man received his first close-up view of our neighboring planet Mars
when on July 14, MARINER IV relayed to earth its photographs of lunar-like
craters on the Martian surface. The conclusion of the Ranger program was
witnessed by millions of Americans who watched on live television as the
cameras of RANGER IX approached the moon on March 24. ALOUETTE 11
was orbited by NASA for Canada in November and FR-1 for France in
December.
   The orbiting of ten Gemini astronauts in a series of five spectacular flights
during the year ended a 22-month gap since the last Mercury flight, FAITH
7. The man-rated version of the Air Force Titan I1 reliably launched all
Gemini flights, Astronauts Grissom and Young in March, as well as McDi-
vitt and White in June, the latter marking his â€œspace walkâ€ outside the
                                              ..

Conrad in GEMINI v demonstrated that trained space pilots were physically
capable of a lunar mission. Orbital rendezvous techniques were thoroughly
demonstrated by the flights of GEMINI VII and VI. Astronauts Borman and
Love11 in GEMINI VII took another long step in astronautics with their four-
teen-day mission in December of 206 revolutions. Throughout the Gemini
operation, the team effort involved closest cooperation of all of NASA and the
military services, contractors, and the scientific community.
   Milestones in the lunar-landing Apollo program were not as well publi-
cized as Gemini but marked significant progress. The Project Fire success
in atmospheric entry of a test vehicle at speeds simulating a return from
the moon provided a geometric jump in reentry physics. The first full-
duration test of the gigantic Saturn V first stage of 7.5 million pounds of
thrust on August 5 was a significant milestone in an engine program begun
in 1958. As the Saturn I concluded its operational life with ten straight
successes with the orbiting of Apollo boilerplate capsules and three Pegasus
micrometeoroid satellites, the Saturn IB was being erected on the launch
pad to begin its flight tests in 1966.
   Spectacular scientific and manned spaceflight events of 1965 could not
overshadoh the practical utility to man on earth of communications and
meteorological satellites. TIROS x, placed in orbit for the Weather Bu-
reau, maintained service to worldwide needs for weather data, while
TIROS Ix provided the first complete picture of theâ€™ cloud-cover over the
entire earth on February 13. NASA launched EARLY BIRD I for the Com-
                                                                       111

munications Satellite Corporation in April. During the same month, NASA
turned operational control of SYNCOM III over to the Department of Defense
for service in important Far East communications.
   A chronology is not an adequate substitute for a documented narrative
history. But in this chronology, spliced alongside the US. space events of
1965, one can note the less publicized decisions, actions, and discussions
concerned with the shaping of the future. About 90 percent of NASAâ€™s
$5.175 billion went to contractors for work done by almost 400,000 people
in the factories and laboratories of some 20,000 prime contractors and
subcontractors. In the university program about 10,000 scholars at 100
universities in all fifty states were working on space-related topics.
   In addition to NASA-related events the chronology gives some of the im-
pact on the American scene of the space effort, including critical comment
testing in democratic fashion the pace and scale of space efforts. Actions,
deliberations, and comment as part of international cooperation and com-
petition are likewise represented in these pages. Hopefully this volume
will serve the serious student of today as he seeks knowledge of past events
so as to better understand the future.
   The late Hugh L. Dryden once wrote :
     Free peoples everywhere must retain a reliable perspective from which to dis-
     cern better the future scientific, social, economic, political, and strategic con-
     sequences of dynamic advances now underway. The manner of the impact
     of technology upon society in the future will partly result from the broadest
     possible appreciation of its full significance.
His passing on December 2 of this eighth year of the Space Age was noted
throughout the world. He leaves lasting contributions to the development
of space technology and of a sound philosophy of astronautics. This vol-
ume helps to document 12 months marking what Dr. Dryden called â€œthe
opening of a brilliant new stage in manâ€™s evolution.â€ It should assist its
readers in gaining helpful perspective upon manâ€™s challenging venture into
space.

   This chronology is designed to collect in preliminary form pertinent in-
formation on aeronautical and space affairs. Future historical research
and narratives will of course deepen the process of documentation and
enrich perspective on the high velocity of contemporary science and tech-
nology, as well as their impact and implications. The volume was pre-
pared from open public sources to provide a reference for future historians
and other analysts, scholars, students, and writers. Its detailed index was
intended to provide ready access to most specialized needs.
   The entire NASA Historical Staff in Headquarters participated in source
collection, review, and publication. The Science and Technology Division
of the Library of Congress was responsible for drafting of the text proper,
in the persons of Miss Lynn Catoe, Mrs. Anne Horton, and Miss Shirley
Medley. The index was prepared by Arthur G. Renstrom, also of the Li-
brary of Congress. General editor of the entire Astronautics and Aeronuu-
tics, 1965 project was Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian;
Mrs. Helen T. Wells was technical editor. Lloyd Robbins and Creston
Whiting (ATSS-T) provided timely translations of Russian materials. His-
torians and historical monitors throughout NASA contributed useful inputs :
validation was the constant concern of many busy persons throughout NASA.
   Appendix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights-l%J65,â€
and Appendix B, â€œMajor NASA Launchings, 1965,â€ were prepared by Dr.
Anderson. Appendix C, â€œSummary Chronology of Manned Space Flights,
1961-1965,â€ was prepared by William D. Putnam, Assistant NASA Historian
for Manned Space Flight. Mrs. Wells prepared Appendix D, â€œAbbrevia-
tions of References.â€
   This preliminary chronicle is but a first step in the historical process of
documenting the dynamic and complex events of space exploration and
exploitation. Comments, additions, and criticism are welcomed at any
time.

January 1: Operation o SYNCOM 11 and SYNCOM 111 communications satel-
                         f
    lites was transferred to DOD by NASA, which had completed its R&D ex-
    periments. Telemetry and command stations and range and range-
    rate equipment operated by NASA for the Syncom program would be
    transferred to DOD along with the satellites. DOD had furnished the
    communications ground stations used to relay transmissions via the
    two Syncoms for the past two years and would provide NASA with cer-
    tain telemetry and ranging data of continuing scientific and engineer-
    ing interest. SYNCOM 111 was to prove useful in DODâ€™S Vietnam com-
    munications. (NASA Release 65-5)
  ∞About 500 employees of the Manned Spacecraft Centerâ€™s Florida Opera-
    tions were transferred to the Kennedy Space Center, effective today,
    under a realignment announced Dec. 24, 1964, by NASA Hq. Elements
    of the manned space flight organization were regrouped to meet the
    requirements imposed by concurrent Gemini and Apollo launch sched-
    ules. (MSC Roundup, 1/6/65, 1)
 ∞ Two hrs. and 20 min. of radio signals from Jupiter were received around
    midnight New Yearâ€™s Eve as predicted by George A. Dulk of the Univ.
    of Colorado. The signals were received at the Altitude Observatory of
    the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, which had
    kept its radiotelescope operating for the event. (Osmundsen, NYT,
    1/2/65, 1)
January 2: NASA had compromised the scientific value of the interplanetary
    research program by spending too little on the Deep Space Net com-
    munications system, according to Frank Drake, prof. at Cornell Univ.,
    in Saturday Review article. Drake noted that MARINER IV would only
    be able to relay 22 photos of Mars back to earth and that these would
    be of lesser quality-all because of communications limitations: â€œ. . .
    one concludes that the space program could well use an array con-
    taining a hundred or more 65-ft. antennas. One array might cost
    $40,000,000, still only a few per cent of what will almost certainly be
    spent on planetary exploration in the next ten years.â€ ( S R , 1/2/65)
 ∞ Soviet cosmonaut Col. Vladimir Komarov, who commanded the three-
    man spacecraft VOSKHOD I on its orbital flight, told a Havana news-
    paper: â€œI believe I will take part in a similar trip-if not to the moon,
    then to another place.â€ Komarov was a member of the Soviet delega-
    tion in Havana for celebration of the sixth anniversary of Fidel Castroâ€™s
    revolution. (New Orleans Times-Picayune, 1/3/65; AP, Hartford

January 2: Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., received the first patent for
     a satellite communication system with its own orbit pattern. The satel-
     lite would linger for a considerable period over each of two widely
     separated areas ; while hovering virtually stationary, it could relay
     television and radio programs within its range, and also store programs
     from one area to play later on the other side of the globe. (Jones,
     N Y T , 1/2/65; Chic. Trib., 1/3/65)
 ∞ U.K. was said to be considering the possibility of a licensing agreement
     with the U S . that would enable British manufacturers to make parts of
     late-model aircraft produced in the U S . American planes under con-
      sideration were: McDonnell Aircraft Corpâ€™s F 4 C (Phantom 11) carrier-
      based attack aircraft; F-111 low-level strike aircraft made by General
      Dynamics Corp. and Grumman; and c-141 and Orion, both made by
      Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (Farnsworth, NYT, 1/3/65, 13)
January 3: MARINER IV changed the rate of sending scientific data from 331h
      to 835 bits of information per second by an automatic switching op-
      eration. This was the first command initiated by the spacecraft itself
      since it performed its mid-course maneuver Dec. 5. MARINER IV had
      traveled nearly 63 million miles in its 325-million-mile flight to Mars;
      the straight-line distance between earth and the spacecraft was 6,156,-
      704 miles. Systems were operating normally after 36 days in space.
       (NASA Release 65-4)
  ∞ More than 50 million Europeans-including viewers behind the Iron
      Curtain-had received same-day transmission of the Tokyo Olympic
      Games via U S . satellites SYNCOM 1x1 and RELAY I last October, NASA
      announced. (NASA Release 65-2)
  ∞ Japanâ€™s Ministry of Telecommunications said signals from what they had
      thought a new Soviet satellite turned out to be Italian-US. SAN MARCO
      I. launched Dec. 15, 1964. (AP, Wash. Eve. Star, 1/2/65; AP, Wash.
      Sun. Star, 1/3/65)
  ∞ Dr. Albert J. Kelley, Deputy Director of NASA Electronics Research
       Center, said in an article in Boston Sunday Globe: â€œThe need for
       increased electronics research to develop devices which will meet the
      demands and rigors of long space flights will affect our industrial
      outlook and economy in many ways. By requiring a â€˜new lookâ€˜ at
       electronics, NASA, led by ERC, will provide a research emphasis such as
       we have not had since World War 11 when the golden age of electronics
       started.
          â€œWe have been in the â€˜rocket phaseâ€™ and are now entering the â€˜elec-
       tronic phaseâ€™ of space flight development, a phase which will affect US
       dramatically over many years.â€ (Boston Sun. Globe, 1/3/65)
  ∞ British designers had perfected a miniature rocket costing only $2,240
       per copy, it was reported. Nine ft. in length with a 7X-in. diameter,
       the rocket would use solid fuel and reach a speed of 3,500 mph,
       sending the casing containing scientific instruments to maximum
       altitude of 80 mi. plus. ( AP, Kansas City Times, 1/4/65)
  ∞ Scientists concluded that explosions and resultant earth-craters created
       by giant meteorites bore a striking similarity to the effect produced by
       the larger nuclear weapons; hence a meteorite fall might be mistaken
       for a nuclear explosion. Opinions varied as to the size of the body
       that could gouge a crater as large as the Meteor Crater of Arizona-
                                                                                        3

     anywhere from 30,000 tons to 2.6 million tons, with an explosive force
     of 20 million tons of TNT. Both the size of the meteorite and its
     velocity on impact would be factors in producing a crater. (Sullivan,
    NYT, 1/3/65,6Eâ€™l
January 3: Semyon A. Kosberg, 61, one of the Soviet Unionâ€™s leading de-
    signers of airplane engines, was killed in an automobile accident. He
    had been given the title â€œHero of Socialist Laborâ€ and had won a Lenin
    prize for his designs. ( N Y T , 1/5/65, 12)
  ∞Writing in Pravda, I. Akulinichev, Dr. of Medical Sciences, said:
    â€œ. . . Of course, the question of lunar laboratories is now only
    at the level of scientific planning. . . . To bring this possibility closer
    to our times, it is necessary to accomplish manned flights to the region
    of the Moon. Further, we need to solve reliably the question of meth-
    ods to use for a successful lunar landing of a spacecraft and the return
    of the cosmonauts to Earth. In my view, the first lunar laboratories
    will initially study the possibilities of the prolonged sojourn of man on
    the Moon. Scientists will investigate ways of using the lunar condi-
    tions for assisting the normal life activity of people. . . . Finally, the
    scientists will study the conditions of orientation on the Moon and the
    possibilities of the navigation of interplanetary spacecraft.â€
       In the same issue of Pravda, Soviet Academician B. Konstantinov
    wrote: â€œIn this New Yearâ€™s article, I wish to dwell on the possibility of
    international cooperation in the use of solar energy. . . . What ap-
    pears most attractive is the conversion of solar energy into electrici-
    ty. In the foreseeable future, man may solve this problem; along with
    this, it is conceivable that the problems of controlling the weather and
    climate will also be solved.â€ (Pravda, 1/3/65,4, ATSS-T Trans.)

  ∞According to Dr. Harold B. Finger, Manager of AEC-NASA Space Nuclear
    Propulsion Office ( SNPO) , NASA would not spend any further funds on
    Project Orion (nuclear-pulse propulsion project). The decision was
    based on the fact that such a system could not be used while the nuclear
    test ban treaty was in effect. In addition, NASA felt there were more
    urgent projects on which to spend the money. (M&R, 1/4/65, 9)
  ∞Dr. Barry Commoner, professor of plant physiology at Washington Univ.
    in St. Louis and chairman of the AAAS Committee on Science in the
    Promotion of Human Welfare, told Aviation Week and Space Tech-
    nology that the question of the probability of finding life on Mars had
    not been â€œfully and fairly aired,â€ and that an â€œoverbalance of the
    positive viewpoint has been presented to Congress and the public by
    NASA officials.â€ Dr. Commoner said that if asked his views on
    Voyager as a tax-paying citizen, his feeling would be that â€œthe value of
    pursuing a program to find life on Mars at this time is not worth the
    $1.25 billion to be invested because the problem of finding life there
    has not been adequately explored.â€ He had made similar charges in a
    speech at the AAAS meeting last December in Montreal.
       Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space
    Science and Applications, was reported by Aviation Week and Space
    Technology as listing six major points in defending NASAâ€™s                   position
4               ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    regarding Mars exploration: ( 1 ) Numerous competent scientists had
    said there was little liquid water on Mars and that the planet had
    a dry, dusty surface with high ultraviolet radiation. Changing pat-
    terns on the planet indicated some form of seasonal change, how-
    ever. (2) With the evidence at hand, it was not possible to say there
    was life on Mars, only that life might be there. (3) If there were life
    on Mars it might be similar to basic life forms on earth. (4) The only
    reasonable approach we could take to the exploration of Mars would
    be to make sure we looked for life before the planet was contaminated
    from earth. If life was not found on Mars, it still would be valuable
    to determine how far the planetâ€™s chemical processes had progressed
    toward life formation. ( 5 ) The Voyager program had not been sold
    to Congress on the basis that there was life on Mars. It has been
    pointed out during budget hearings that there might not be life on the
    planet but nobody could responsibly take the position that there
    wasnâ€™t. Therefore, the early emphasis of Project Voyager was on
    bioscience. ( 6 ) The Mars exploration was part of an overall program
    to explore the solar system, including the moon, comets, and other
    planets. Mars happened to be the planet NASA was focusing its at-
    tention on because it would be in the optimum launch position through
    the mid-1970â€™s. ( A v . Wk.,1/4/65, 18)
January 4: Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, director of the Lunar and Planetary
    Laboratory of the Univ. of Arizona and principal scientific investiga-
    tor on the Ranger project, replied to Robert C. Cowenâ€™s article, â€œWas
    the Ranger Worth the Cost?â€, which appeared in the Christian Science
    Monitor Nov. 18. Mr. Cowen had raised four principal questions: (1)
    Was the recent RANGER VII mission scientifically justifiable? (2) Was
    it well planned and executed? (3) Were the results up to expecta-
    tions? ( 4 ) Where do we go from here? Dr. Kuiper said in letter to
    CSM: â€œRanger was the U.S. pioneering program of deep-space research
     and accomplished much more than getting the 4,300 lunar photographs.
    It established the worth and feasibility of the â€˜parking orbitâ€™ and other
    concepts of space ballistics, power supply, and communication, as well
    as preparation for Mars and Venus probes. . . . The cost of the 4,300
    lunar records is therefore not the full $270 million (which moreover
    includes Rangers VIII and IX, not yet flown) but, say, $50-$100 mil-
    lion. No ground-based effort, even with the 300-4Winch telescope
    costing over $100 million, would, even in the absence of our disturbing
     atmosphere, have yielded 100th of the magnification (resolution) ob-
    tained in Ranger VII. I definitely know of no better and cheaper way
    to get high-resolution photographs. . . .â€
       In a reply to Dr. Kuiper, Mr. Cowen quoted from a letter by Dr.
    Andrew T. Young of Harvard College Observatory and published in

     science has not always been outstanding for its courage, its vision, or
     its optimism regarding goals for human efforts. Elements of con-

    program â€œby narrowly comparingâ€ the dollars spent for space with
     what those same dollars might accomplish â€œif devoted to other endeav-

     transferable ; that space dollars might change the general climate to
     one favoring broader aid to the whole spectrum of science; and that

January 11: NASA Langley Research Center scientist Windsor L. Sherman
    proposed conversion of Project Mercury spacecraft into unmanned,
     recoverable orbiting telescope platforms. Equipment would include a
     76-cm. Cassegrainian telescope, a camera recording system, and an
     attitude control system. The system would weigh approximately
     4,700 lb. and would be aimed for a 300-mi. orbit. The observatory
     would remain in orbit 1 W 2 0 0 days, exposing four frames of film on
     each orbit for a total of 6,000 frames. After all film was exposed, the
     system would be braked out of orbit and would descend into the
     Bermuda recovery area of the Eastern Test Range, using the same re-
     covery techniques developed for the manned Mercury landings. In
     addition to its capacity to perform a variety of such astronomical ob-
     servations as high resolution photography, photometry, and spectros-
     copy, Sherman said, the recoverable observatory would permit reuse
     of capsule, optical, and control systems. It would allow study of
     space effects on equipment, and the system could serve as a test bed
     for advanced orbiting telescopes. ( A v . Wk., 1/11/65, 2 3 )

 ∞ NASA Langley Research Center scientists Harry W. Carlson and Francis
    E. McLean said that for the first time there was hope for a significant
    reduction in the sonic booms expected from proposed supersonic air-
    liners. A plane flying faster than the speed of sound compresses the
    air around it into shock waves trailing from the nose, wings, engine
    inlets, tail, and any other protuberances. Near the plane there would
    be separate waves, producing â€œnear field effects.â€ Traced on a graph
    to show changes in pressure, the waves would make a jagged line
    resembling the letter â€œN.â€ As the waves traveled toward the ground,
    they would coalesce into two powerful waves-one appearing to trail
    from the nose and one from the tail-producing           â€œfar-field effectsâ€
    also shaped as a letter â€œNâ€ in terms of pressure patterns. The sharp
    peaks of this N-shaped wave were suspected of causing most of the
16              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    annoyance and structural damage possible from sonic booms. Carlson
    and McLean discovered that planes the length and shape of super-
    sonic airliner designs would not fly far enough away from the earth
    for their far-field effects to be felt on the ground, leaving only the
    less bothersome near-field effect to be taken into account.
        It was hoped that this new finding would mean that designs current-
    ly submitted to the Government in the design competition for super-
    sonic transport, or minor refinements of them, would fit within Gov-
    ernment-imposed sonic boom limitations and that still further
    improvement through design changes would bring further decreases in
    the boom.
        Dr. Floyd L. Thompson, LaRC Director, called what had been
    learned â€œsignificant new knowledgeâ€ and said it could, under the best
    of circumstances, â€œhave great significance.â€ He pointed out that the

    mission that could be performed by a number of different propulsion
    concepts. For example, manned trips by chemical rockets would be

    tems had only been ground tested, evaluations of complete nuclear

     tric propulsion systems for manned spaceflight were even further in the
     future and might not be ready by 1980; but by then the mission
     capability of the nuclear rocket would have been so thoroughly demon-
     strated that it would be more attractive than chemical engines for
     those missions requiring increased propulsion capability. Even fur-

    liner December 8, 1963, near Elkton, Md. The aircraft was carrying
    a mixture of JP-4 and kerosene when it exploded in a lightning storm,
    giving rise to the question of the relative safety of the two fuels includ-
    ing the effects of mixing the two. Consensus of the group was that
    the airlines should continue their policy of being individually respon-
    sible for selecting fuels and for safety practices associated with han-

January 17: Robert L. Sohn, scientist at Space Technology Laboratories,

        â€œWe donâ€™t expect to have boosters powerful enough to launch space-

    orbit around the sun.â€ He said traveling near Venus on the return
    journey from Mars would slow a spacecraft as it passed through the
    Venutian gravity field. Then, with some midcourse maneuvering and
    navigation, the astronaut could return to earth and reenter earthâ€˜s
     atmosphere with greater margin of error. (Macomber, Sun Diego

     will eventually lead to deathâ€˜. . . .
        â€œThe Soviets have also discovered a correlation between high accel-

        â€œA new missile system, the Poseidon [new name for Polaris B-31, to
    increase the striking power of our missile-carrying nuclear submarines.
     The Poseidon missile will have double the payload of the highly success-

     will permit its use effectively against a broader range of penetration of
     enemy defenses.
        â€œA new Short Range Attack Missile ( S R A M ) that can, if needed, be

     namic missile-a vast improvement over existing systems-would per-
     mit the bomber to attack a far larger number of targets and to do so
     from beyond the range of their local defenses.
        â€œA series of remarkable new payloads for strategic missiles. These
     include: penetration aids, to assure that the missile reaches its target
     through any defense; guidance and re-entry vehicle designs, to in-
     crease many-fold the effectiveness of our missiles against various kinds
     of targets; and methods of reporting the arrival of our missiles on

 ∞ Alfred Gessow, Chief of Fluid Physics Research, NASA, discussed before
     the Compressed Gas Association in New York City the problems of
     spacecraft deceleration and heating involved in return through the
     earthâ€˜s atmosphere. He explained why the blunt shape solved de-
     celeration and much of the heat problem in returning Mercury
     spacecraft from orbit through the atmosphere to earth. Looking
     beyond the satellite return speed (Mercury and Gemini) and lunar
     return speed (Apollo) , return from interplanetary flight poses the
     problem of much higher spacecraft speed (and thus heating). Re-
     search indicates â€œthat the more pointed shape, although it doesnâ€™t show
     up too well at the lower re-entry speeds, is better than the blunt nose at
     the higher speeds because the bow shock is weaker, thus producing
     lower radiant heating losses. Thus, in a very short time scale, but
     taking a big leap forward in the velocity-temperature scale, we find
     ourselves going into another phase of the blunt vs. pointed nose cycle.
         â€œ. . . The switching between slender and blunt shapes is not new in
     the race for h i g h speeds ai a!! times of history. Going through
     history, compact rocks were replaced by slender arrows ; the concept of
     powder guns created round cannonballs; the rocket age produced
     slender forms again, which ironically, finally got blunt noses. It is
     interesting to see how long it took to make such changes empirically
     and how rapidly these variations have been made by following
     scientific principles. . . .â€ (Text)

       The NASA request provided for initiation of a major new project-
    Project Voyager, budgeted at $43 million-and           intensive study of
    Apollo-X, with funding of $50 million. Hardware development funds
    were requested for the Advanced Orbiting Solar Observatory ($25.1

     the budget an austere one, but said the chances of landing a man on

     Dr. Seamans said the requested $43 million for Voyager would be
     spent on project definition of the spacecraft bus and landing capsule to
     explore Mars in the next decade. This funding would also enable
     NASA to make a Martian fly-by in 1969 to test the spacecraft and
     launch vehicle prior to the 1971 and 1973 missions.
         Major portions of the DOD space budget were alloted for the follow-
     ing: ( 1 ) pre-program definition phase of the Manned Orbiting Labo-
     ratory (Mol) ; (2) accelerated research on reentry and recovery of
     spacecraft; ( 3 ) continued development of the Titan 111 space booster;
      ( 4 ) development of the Defense Communications Satellite System.
         Two thirds of AECâ€™S budget request was earmarked for development
     of nuclear rocket propulsion and nuclear power sources for space
     applications. The nuclear propulsion program, Project Rover, was al-
      loted $W.l million ; the nuclear power source program, Snap, $70.5
     million; and advanced projects applicable to space, $12 million. The
      Pluto reactor program was not included in the budget request.
         The Weather Bureau would start its investment in an advanced
      weather satellite system in FY 66 with a $500,000 request for sensors
      and subsystem studies in conjunction with NASA studies. Funds for
      three Tiros Operational System (Tos) satellites and four Delta launch
      vehicles to be delivered in two years, $21.6 million, were included in

    billion in 1964.
       â€œExpenditures are continuing to increase. However, we have built
    up momentum and are concentrating on our highest priority
    goals. Therefore, we will no longer need to increase space out-lays by
    huge sums each year in order to meet our present objectives.
       â€œThis budget proposes that expenditures increase by $22 million in

    â€œ. . . Planning for the Defense manned orbiting laboratory program
    will also consider, in cooperation with NASA, broader objectives of sci-
    entific and general technological significance.
       â€œTOdetermine the essential characteristics of the vehicle that will be
    required, the DOD will continue intensive studies and design of experi-
    ments and systems aimed at the primary military objectives.
       â€œCooperative studies, by NASA and Defense, will identify and define
    scientific and general technological experiments which might be car-
    ried out, with NASA participation, in conjunction with the military
    program.
       â€œDOD, with assistance from NASA, will compare configurations of
    Apollo which may be suitable for military experiments with the Gemi-
    ni B-MOL configuration to determine the complete system that can meet
    the primary military objectives in a more efficient, less costly, or more
    timely fashion.
       â€œOn the basis of these studies, a decision will be made whether to
    proceed with full-scale development by Defense of a manned orbiting
    laboratory system and what the specific developments and vehicle
    configurations are to be. The Defense budget includes $150 million
    in FY 1966 for the program. . . .
       â€œDepending upon the manned orbiting laboratory decision, upon the
    progress in the Gemini and Apollo programs, and upon the results of
    NASA studies, a decision will be made whether to proceed with
    modifications to the Apollo system and the nature and timing of neces-
    sary specific developments. The NASA 1966 budget includes about $50
    million for proceeding with design and pacing developments. . . .â€

  ∞NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert Seamans said during FY
     1966 budget briefing: â€œ. . . it is conceivable . . . that the lunar
    landing would occur in early 1970 . . . we feel actually greatly en-
    couraged at the progress that has been made freezing the design, and
    we feel very reassured at the test results we are achieving on our
    propulsion systems and with our stages. So that we really feel that
    there is more chance that we can get off the flight on an earlier mis-
    sion than I would have said a year ago.â€
        Dr. Seamans said Apollo gave the nation a capability for a wide
    variety of scientific and technological flights in earth orbit, in orbit
     around the moon, and also for an extended lunar stay time. He com-
    mented that the objectives of the current extended Apollo (Apollo-X)
     design and feasibility studies were to extend the time of the lunar
    mission out to the order of two weeks. He also said that Apollo-X
     circumlunar flights, in polar orbit about the moon and taking pho-
     tographs of the entire lunar surface, on missions that could involve
     staytimes on the moon of up to one or two weeks, all would have great
     possibility and would offer great interest scientifically. In comment-
     ing on an earlier agreement (1963) with the Pentagon for developing
     of a manned orbiting laboratory, Dr. Seamans said: â€œAt the time of
30              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   that agreement, we were really thinking of something that we now
   realize is further out in time, namely, a more permanent space station
   that could stay in orbit for a yearâ€™s time and could be resupplied, and
   would permit the crew to be ferried into orbit and bring them
   back. The study really related to that kind of possibility which we
   now realize is much further out in time . . . we may end up with
   what is called the MOL, and we may also find that there are important
   uses for the Apollo system beyond the present manned lunar landing
   program.â€™â€™
       He said NASA studies of improving both the Saturn I B and the Sat-
   urn V launch vehicles indicated that â€œthese two launch vehicles can
   take care of our needs for an extended period of time.â€ ( N A S A Budget

 January 25: NASA announced two Radio Astronomy Explorer satellites
    (RAE-A and RAE-B) would be designed to investigate low-frequency
    (long wavelength) emissions from our galaxy, its planets, and the
    stars. These emissions are mostly intercepted by the ionosphere so
    that little can be learned about them from ground-based receivers.
    This would be the first attempt to map the galaxy for low-frequency
   emissions. The 280-lb. spacecraft would be launched by Thrust-
    Augmented Delta into circular orbits at altitudes of about 3,700 mi.
    and would measure the intensity of the signals, their frequency, times
    of emission and, within limitations, define the regions of space in
    which they originated. Proposed designs called for the development
    of two 750-ft., V-shaped antennas that would be mounted opposite
    each other, forming a giant X. They would be anchored to the basic
    spacecraft, a cylinder of about 40-by-40 in., capped by two truncated
    cones. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center would design, integrate,

                                  needs over the next 10 years. This space-
    cast of DODâ€™S and NASAâ€™s
    mission forecast served as a basis for determining the number of launch
    vehicles required and the cost of producing the various combinations
    of these launch vehicles.
        â€œThe result of the study is particularly interesting in that it shows a
    cost difference of less than 1 per cent among the alternative
    options. This difference is less than the accuracy of the data used in
    the analysis. The results indicate that any economies that might be
    realized by increased quantity production of boosters would be lost
    through cost of adapting specific mission spacecraft to a new vehicle
    where the costs of such work have already been incurred. . . .
        â€œThe major advantages of the recent comprehensive study . . . , as
    distinct from previous reviews, were the development of much im-
    proved methods for estimating the costs of launch vehicles considering
    the effects of quantity production, variety of vehicles, and inplant
    workload; the use of an inclusive or overall forecast as a basis for
    determination of both DOD and NASA space missions against which total
     launch vehicles costs could be calculated; and the value of the results

      form hard spores and are thus most likely to survive space flight are
      most sensitive to the freeze-thaw extremes of temperature that prevail
      on Mars. Thus, while the bacteria might survive on Mars in spore

        â€œ. . . I am concerned about the effect that the proposed termination

    factor in preventing the Russians from achieving a position of domi-

 ∞  NASA Ames Research Center was conducting tests on a Douglas F5D
     aircraft with a specially designed planform wing that might minimize
     landing speeds for the proposed supersonic transport. A tornado-like
     flow, called â€œvortex airflow,â€ and resulting from the sharp difference
     between the low pressure on the top of the wing and the high pressure
     on the underside, was generated along the ieading edges of the â€œ3â€-
     shaped wing. Engineers said use of the sharply angled wings with
     tornado effect on top had these advantages: ( 1 ) the tornadoes affected
     air flow over the entire aircraft and eliminated turbulence that would
     make other aircraft directionally unstable when coming in nose high
     for a landing; ( 2 ) the tornadoes made it almost impossible for the
     wings to lose their lift completely. Also, it was felt this wing shape
     took maximum advantage of the cushioning effect produced in com-
     pressing air between the underside of the wings and the ground which
     would make it necessary to level off sharply at the last moment before
     touching down.
         Existence of this tornado-like flow along the leading edges of the
     wing encouraged the belief that a supersonic airliner might be built
     without resorting to variable-sweep wings.

        â€œ. . . With Ranger 7, the prime factor was the expectation that the

     â€˜maria.â€™ So it was of great value to this program to find out as much
     as possible about the mare topography. In particular, it was neces-

     was exposed lava and how densely the small craters were scattered
     over the surface.
         â€œRanger gave some of the answers. In some areas, at least, small
     craters were indeed strewn very thickly. Probably such areas lie

    the general roughness may be comparable to some terrestrial lava
    fields where the lava is of the â€˜pahoehoe,â€™ or fluid variety. However,
    the absence of any significant number of features showing edges with a
    small radius of curvature, and the presence of small craters which have
    been filled with debris, point to erosion as a significant modifier of the
    primeval lunar surface. This erosion could arise from meteoric bom-

       â€œThe creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
   tion has provided another type of problem. NASA stemmed from the
    same kind of political philosophy that nurtured the AEC. Atom bombs
    were too powerful to allow the generals to play with them; ergo, a
    civilian agency must control nuclear power-and it must be channeled
    away from nasty military purposes. The same scientific-political pres-
    sure groups that advocated this concept helped (with President Eisen-
    howerâ€™s approval) to establish NASA, again on the theory that space
    efforts must be controlled by civilians and that space must not be used
    for military purposes. . . .
        â€œBut in the case of NASA, the problem has been compounded. For
    while the AEC is essentially a research and production agency, NASA is
    an operating agency as well. From a small highly efficient aeronau-
    tical research agency, it has now expanded into a gargantuan multibil-
    lion-dollar empire, with tentacles all over the country, managing the
    biggest program on which the United States has ever embarked-to
    place a man on the moon.
        â€œIn its early years, NASA was sluggishly if at all responsive to mili-
    tary needs, and the Pentagon itself was inhibited from any effective
    space developments (though, curiously, the only effective space
    boosters available were military ballistic missiles) . Gradually the
    liaison, due to Dr. [Edward C.] Welsh and others, has been greatly
    improved. Numerous military officers, active and retired, now hold
    some of the most important positions in NASA, and in addition the
    Armed Forces have furnished most of the astronauts and by far the
    most important part of the facilities and services used by the
    agency. The two-headed control still offers difficulties, but today the
    main stumbling blocks to the rapid development of military space
    projects are Secretary McNamara and his Director of Defense Re-
    search and Engineering, Dr. Harold Brown, who in his new political
     role in the Pentagon has become a remarkably unadventurous scientist.
        â€œOften the Presidentâ€™s Scientific Adviser, whose contacts with Penta-
    gon and other Government scientists cut squarely across organizational
    lines, has also acted as roadblock to new developments. He exercises
    tremendous power without either specific responsibility or specific au-
    thority; therefore, his intervention often not only delays but
     confuses. The Adviserâ€™s great power stems largely from his White
     House status; unfortunately around him has grown up a small but
     important office manned by men more impressive as bureaucrats than
     as scientists, who represent, in effect, another echelon of
    delay. . . .â€ (Foreign Affairs, 1/65; CR, 2/4/65, 2007)

During January: Marvin L. White. AFCRLâ€™S Space Physics Laboratory,
 predicted the sun was encircled by â€œringsâ€ of electric current totaling
 nearly 200 billion amps. Although total current was high, White
 postulated that the current density was low because the current was
 spread over a large area; he predicted current density to be about
 three trillionths of an ampere per square centimeter, the same order
 of magnitude as in the earthâ€˜s atmosphere. Whiteâ€™s calculations were
 based on particle flux data from MARINER II. (OAR Research Review,

∞In an article on detecting extraterrestrial life, William R. Corliss in Zn-

  collecting data on possible life-forms elsewhere and some of the factors
  making the search for extraterrestrial life so challenging. He noted
  the complications for Martian life-detection if retrorockets were neces-
  sary to brake the landing of a scientific package: â€œFirst, of course,
  they add weight to the landing package, right where it hurts the most.
  Also, their control adds complexity and increases the chance of failure.
  Finally and perhaps most importantly, they would make the problem
  of life-detection more difficult and any results more ambiguous ; the
   rocket exhaust would tend both to fuse the surface of the landing area
   (maybe even killing any existing organisms), and to add combustioii
  contaminants of its own in the most crucial area-around the lander.â€
   He listed the variety of experimental instruments proposed for detecting
  extraterrestrial life (or clues of life) and explained why the dependa-
  bility of these instruments-based on different physical and chemical
  principles-varied widely. (Znt. Sci. & Tech., 1/65, 28-34)

 February 2: Charles W. Harper, Director of NASA Hq. Aeronautics Div.,
    discussed aeronautical research at a luncheon of the Aviation/Space
   Writers Association. He said: â€œ . . . aviation has a tremendous PO-
   tential in the short-haul â€˜aerial bus.â€™ Both VTOL (vertical take-off and
   landing) and STOL (short take-off and landing) are being considered
   for this job. . . . On the basis of our current knowledge I would con-
   clude the VTOL commercial transport offers tremendous potential but
   requires additional research . . . before it is ready for detailed feasi-
    bility study as a commercial transport. On the other hand the STOL
    machine is ready for a careful examination since the major problems
    seem to be in hand.
       â€œA 20 to 50 passenger STOL machine should, or could, have a top
    speed of 300 to 400 knots, a steep approach with a touch down at 45
    knots and an operational field length of some 1200 to 1500 feet. All-
    weather operation is required and, with the aid of space technology
    advances, this appears quite possible. We think we can display elec-
    tronically to the pilot the important features of the airport so that he
    can approach it and land using the same information that he does in
    clear weather.
       â€œWe see two large markets for vehicles of this type. In a smaller
    simple version, perhaps bearing a little sacrifice in performance, an air
    transport well suited for use in underdeveloped areas. Rugged, easy
    to fly and simple to maintain, it could enable these countries to jump
    from jungle or desert trails to modern transport system without build-
    ing enormously expensive railways and highways. This would be a
    good market for U S . industry. In a larger sophisticated version it
    could be the vehicle to make the present short haul feeder lines self
    sufficient, not depending on connecting traffic from the trunk lines.
    This too would be a desirable situation for American industry. NASA
    plans to pursue both of these potentials actively until the air industry
    has enough confidence in success to proceed on its own. . . .â€ (Text)
 ∞Alfred J. Eggers, Jr., NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Advanced
    Research and Technology, addressed the Science Teachersâ€™ Associa-
    tion of Santa Clara County, Calif., at NASA Ames Research Center.
    He said: â€œThe question then is, what has man done in space to date?
    According to the eminent archaeologist, V. Gordon Childe, whatever
    man has done in the relatively short evolutionary history documented
    by his fossil remains, he has done without significantly improving
    his inherited equipment by bodily changes detectable in his skeleton.
    Moreover, this equipment is inadequately adapted for survival in any
    particular environment, and indeed it is inferior to that of most ani-
                                                                          51

   mals for coping with any special set of conditions. Yet in spite
    of his physical inferiority, man has been able to adjust himself
   to a greater range of environment than any other creature, to
    multiply much faster than any near relative amongst the higher mam-
    mals, and indeed to beat them all at their special tricks. Thus he
    learned to control fire, and he developed the skills to make clothes and
    houses, with the result that he lives and thrives from pole to pole on
    earth, and already he is concerned with a population explosion. He
    has developed trains and cars that can outstrip the fleetest cheetah,
    and he has developed the airplane so that he can mount higher than
    the eagle. Moreover, he developed telescopes to see further than the
    hawk, and firearms to lay low the elephant or any other animal, includ-
    ing himself. But whatever their use, the important point is that fire,
    clothes, houses, trains, airplanes, telescopes, and guns are not part of
    manâ€™s body. He can set them aside at will. They are not inherited
    in the biological sense, but rather the skill needed for their conception,
    production, and use is part of our intellectual heritage, the result of a
    tradition built up over many generations and transmitted not in the
    blood but through speech and writing.

        Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space
     Science and Applications, outlining progress made toward the objective
     of solar system exploration, said: â€œ . . . It would appear . . . that
     enough experience and know-how has been accumulated to make the
     move to a five-ton Voyager spacecraft on the Saturn IB Centaur launch
     vehicle a reasonable next step in the unmanned exploration of the solar
     system. There is no question but that the size and weight of Voyager,
     plus the increased demands that will be placed upon it, will make the
     development of the Voyager a complex and difficult undertaking.
     But certainly, the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory and Mariner
     have shown us that we can deal successfully with complexity. As a
     matter of fact, the increased weight and size may afford considerable
     relief from the need to tailor every last function to a gnatâ€™s eyebrow
     in order to achieve the intended mission, as has been the case
     hitherto. . . .â€
        Dr. Newell said that reliability was probably the most difficult
     problem for deep-space long-duration missions and that â€œ. . . the
     development of adequate spacecraft systems will not be the problem.
     The most serious threat to long life operation will lie in the potential
     random failure of one or more [spacecraft] components.â€
        He added that this would probably be an ever-decreasing problem as
     we gained experience with launch vehicles and that â€œ. . . launch
     vehicle reliability is far less a difficult program than that of long space-
     craft lifetime for very deep-space missions.â€™â€™
         In conclusion, Dr. Newell said: â€œ . . . Nevertheless, the time
     has arrived when many thoughtful people urge a vigorous program of
     solar system exploration. The President has in his Fiscal Year 1966
     budget request included funds to support initial conceptual and design
     studies of a Voyager spacecraft. Funds are also included for the
     development of a launch vehicle consisting of the Saturn IB plus
     the Centaur. Final decision as to whether to move ahead with the
      development of the Voyager spacecraft would come a little over a year
      from now.â€ (Text)
      Missiles and Rockets reported that scientists at the Symposium had
      differing opinions on Mars goals. Gilbert V. Levin of Hazleton Labora-

      although we insist that Mars should not be contaminated by ter-
      restrial life before we search for Martian life, we fail to recognize that
      this is tantamount to saying that the U.S. must get there first, because
      the U S . appears to be the only nation willing and able to sterilize its
      spacecraft.
          6C â€™
            I m all for Voyager, but an initial step in the Voyager program
      should be some early landers at the earliest opportunities. We should
       go ahead and devote efforts to develop a program to land on Mars in
     1969.â€
       Temple Neumann, Automated Biological Laboratory program engi-

       Lawrence B. Hall, NASA Special Assistant for Planetary Quarantine,
    re-emphasized â€œthe disastrous effects that an unsterilized spacecraft
    could have on Mars. . . . If a single micro-organism should land on
    Mars and have a replication time of 30 days, it could grow to the
    bacterial population of Earth in eight years. This could not only
    compete with Martian life but could result in drastic changes in the
    geochemical and atmospheric characteristics of the planet.â€
       JPLâ€™S Gerald A. Soffen said that â€œsince the decision between Mariner
    landers and Voyager missions has not been made yet, scientific experi-
    menters have to think in terms both of small payloads and large ones.
    Numerous small missions would provide a good opportunity to perform
    experiments in different locations and during different planetary sea-
    sons.â€
       Bruce C. Murray, of Cal Tech, said: â€œ. . . finding the right loca-
    tion, getting there, and interpreting the biological experiment results
    in a way that would indicate definitively whether life was or was not
    present would call for at least 100 times more photography than was
    currently assumed.
          . . . atmospheric effects, color, seasonal changes, and the large
       (6


    number of locations of interest will make Martian pictures 10-50 times
    more difficult to interpret than lunar pictures.â€
       Robert L. Sohn, TRW Space Technology Laboratories, stressed value
    of earth-return missions and recommended serious consideration of
    round-trip missions and multi-plan round trips using DSIF as guide. He
    suggested that an 800-lb. spacecraft could make a fly-by of Mars, using
    the Venus swing-by technique and return to earth to enable recovery
    of a 50-lb. capsule. Use of swing-by techniques for round trips reduces
    earth launch velocities to those of the favorable years and also reduces
    earth reentry velocities. Additional advantages were closer passage
    with Mars at encounter and the opporiuiiiiy to gathci dat2 â€I?       two
    planets.
       Elie A. Shneour, of Stanford University, said he â€œ. . . could not
    say whether it was possible to draw up a set of experiments that would
    definitively search for life.â€ He maintained, however, that â€œdiscovery
    of any form of extraterrestrial life will be tantamount to a basic
    determination of the nature of all life on that planet.â€™â€™ (M&R, 2/22,â€™

February 9 : Joint Congressional Atomic Energy Committee, in hearing on
    AECâ€™s FY 1966 authorization, asked NASA Administrator James E. Webb
    why NASA was dropping funds for the S n a p 8 spacecraft nuclear
    auxiliary power project. In the joint NASA-AEC project, AEC was work-
    ing on the reactor and NASA was working on the power conversion
    machinery. Snap-S was one of three projects that had been deleted
    from the NASA FY 1966 budget request. Mr. Webb said: â€œ . . . in
    the over-all budgeting . , . the President has a hard problem of
    adjusting resources to the needs of the Government. In this case, it
    was decided that these systems, these three systems, could not be
    financed within the resources available for allocation to YASA and
    therefore they were eliminated in the final decision relating to the
    Presidentâ€™s budget, but not on our recommendation. . . .
       Câ€˜
          Because we are on the verge of significant technical milestones

        Rep. Price said millions of dollars were being spent to develop these
    power sources for DOD and NASA but that the projects were often stopped
    short of flight testing because of lack of funds. He mentioned â€œseveral
    specific construction items which were not approved by the Budget

    decreased by tailwinds and crosswinds, with variations as much as
    2076, particularly in the mach 1.3 range; under some atmospheric
    conditions, including such factors as wind, temperature, and even the
    time of day, sonic booms may vary from a complete cut-off with no
    boom heard to heavy overpressures concentrated over a small area
    or spread almost unlimited over a wide lateral area; turbulence had
    the effect of distorting booms and increasing or decreasing intensity
    and distribution. (FAA Release 65-15; UPI, Minn. Trib., 2/12/65)

      the research, development and production of the most technologically
      advanced product that is possible-for whatever purpose desired.
                                                                             71

       LL.

    historical, present and future-that     have produced and will continue
    to produce this uniqueness.
       â€œFirst, the genesis and evolution of what is todayâ€™s aerospace in-
    dustry is a direct product of the nationâ€™s post-World War I1 history
    and is inextricably linked thereto. . . . World War I1 unleashed for
    the world, but particularly for the United States, two revolutions
    which have been gaining momentum ever since. The first of these
    was a form of economic revolution which saw the economy of the
    United States surge into new dimensions. The second was a scientific/
    technological revolution which saw all that had gone before in manâ€™s
    scientific history fade into a pale background. . . .
       â€œWorld War I1 itself provided an extreme example of the explosive
    expansibility of the industrial base of the United States. This ex-
    panded industrial base remained after the war to serve as a founda-
    tion for a general economic upsurge.
       â€œ. . . the aerospace industry has become and remains, in a very
    real sense, an instrument of national policy, not only in terms of the
    hardware directly provided the government, but also as it underpins
    the economic/technologic,al advances in the private sector of our
    economy. . . . â€™7

    viability of this industry is not tied to defense and space programs,
    important as these have been and will continue to be in shaping its
    destiny. It is tied, rather, to the total technological progress of the
    nation. meaning the application of advanced technology to whatever
    purposes may be desired.         Programs now well underway in such
    diverse fields as air freight, urban transportation, desalination,

 ∞ NAS4 and DOD announced a memorandum of agreement to establish a Delta
    launch capability at the Western Test Range ( W T R ) . Costs would be
    shared, based on the estimated use of the vehicle by each agency.
    Existing USAF Thor-Able-Star launch sites would be adapted for Delta
    use wherever practicable. Launch pads and blockhouses would be used
     on a shared basis, with each agency responsible for its own missions.
     NASA would exercise launch vehicle control over all WTR Delta launches.
    NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and IJSAF Space Systems Division
     would be responsible for carrying out the agreement.
        NASA would be responsible for developing an improved Delta launch
     vehicle to meet both agenciesâ€™ mission requirements for use at both
     WTR and ETR. DOD was planning to phase out the Thor-Able-Star and
     use the improved Delta for payloads carried by this vehicle class.

 ∞ Hearings on NASA budget authorization for FY 1966 began before the
     House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Of the $5.260 billion
     requested for FY 1966, $4.576 billion was for research and develop-
     ment; $74.7 million was for construction of facilities; and $609.4
    million was for administrative operations.
        Administrator James E. Webb testified: â€œThis budget . . . supports
     an on-going successful research and development effort and the use
     of this knowledge to develop and test operating systems designed to give
     us what we need to know for national security, for applications in
     meteorology, communications, and other working satellite systems, and
     from which to make any decisions which may be called for in the future.
        â€œAn important fact that underlies the Presidentâ€™s 1966 budget
     decisions is that the program is now operating at a level of 5% billion
                                                                         75

    dollars instead of at the optimum level of 5% billion originally recom-
    mended by President Kennedy or the â€˜fighting chanceâ€™ level recom-
    mended last year by President Johnson. This means that we cannot
    accomplish the 15 Saturn V-Apollo flights now included in the program
    within the period of this decade. If all 15 flights are required to
    succeed in the lunar landing, then this will not be done before 1970.
    However, our overall major milestones are being met and we still have
    a reasonable opportunity for success on a flight earlier than the 15th
    and thus within this decade. In effect we will be launching toward
    the moon on earlier flights than we thought a year ago would be
    possible, but we simply cannot predict which flight will be the first
    either to orbit the moon or to land there.
       â€œWhat we can say is this: the systems of equipment for the utiliza-
    tion of men for flights of all kinds out as far as the moon are now
    rapidly proceeding toward tests that will work out any imperfections;
    and our fast-developing knowledge of both the space environment and
    the capabilities of this equipment gives us more confidence than we had
    a year ago that we are on the right track and proceeding on a reason-
    able basis for the development of machines of this size and power. . . .
       â€œIn preparation of this budget, the President has faced two important
    facts. The first of these is that the central core of NASA activities as
    planned in 1961 is proceeding with excellent results. . . .
       â€œThe second major fact faced by the President was the necessity for
    a continued emphasis on supporting research and development. . . ,
       â€œBearing these two facts in mind, this budget and this request for
    authorization call for an operating level which is approximately the
    same as that approved by Congress for fiscal years 1964. and 1965.
    This means that the work planned in 1961 for accomplishment in this
    decade must be spread out over a longer period, and the cost for the
    total will be increased. . . .
       â€œThe essential funds to give us some opportunity to make the lunar
    landing within this decade are included. as are funds for studies toward
    further use of the Saturn launch vehicles and the AP~OIIO-LEM      manned
    space flight systems in the period following the lunar landing. By
     1969, we will have the capability to launch 6 Saturn-IBâ€™s and 6 Saturn
    Vâ€™s per year. In the unmanned area, we have begun planning for a
    Voyager-Mars mission in 1971 with the possibility of a test flight in
     1969; funds are included in the budget for expansion of this design
    effort during fiscal year 1966. Development and hardware procure-
    ment could then be initiated in fiscal )ear 1967 if appropriate. . . .â€

February 17: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden. NASA Deputy Administrator. testified
    before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics on NASAâ€™s
     activities in the field of international cooperation : â€œNineteen sixty-
    four was a year in which other nations emerged clearly as friendly
    competitors and valuable collaborators in space science and engineer-
    ing and demonstrated by emulation their endorsement of our view that
    energetic efforts in these fields are essential contributors to the better-
    ment of human society. I am thinking of such thinzs as the energetic
    space programs of France, the demonstrated competence of Canada
     and Italy, the entry of the British aircraft industry into spacecraft
    engineering, the formal establishment of the European Space Research
                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965
76
     Organization ( ESRO) and the European Launcher Development Or-
     ganization ( E L D O ) , and finally of the successful first test flight of a
     large new booster by ELDO. . . .
        â€œA year ago I reported our plans for including foreign experiments
     on N.4SA satellites under arrangements by which foreign experiments,
     selected in open competition with domestic proposals. are sponsored
     and financed by the experimenterâ€™s national space authority. One such
     experiment flew in 1964-a       British ion mass spectrometer on EXPLORER
     XX, the U S . fixed-frequency topside sounder. Six additional experi-
     ments were selected for flight, bringing the total to thirteen, with ten
     more under active consideration. We now have opened virtually all
     categories of NASA spacecraft, including Gemini and Apollo, to foreign
     participation on this cooperative basis. Indeed, we are now inviting
     foreign biomedic experts to a working conference in Houston, next
     April, to learn directly of the opportunities and constraints which apply
     to this program. . . .
        â€œA noteworthy development was the fact that ESRO became the first
     foreign space agency to seek a ground station on American territory.
     After conducting a site survey and finding a suitable location near
     Fairbanks. Alaska, ESRO has formally requested the Department of
     State to begin negotiations for an agreement. The ESRO station is
     projected as an element in a network of tracking and data acquisition
     facilities. . . . France is establishing a North/South fence from
     France through the Canary Islands, Algeria, Upper Volta, Congo
     Brazzaville, and South Africa. with an injection-monitoring station in
     Lebanon. This chain will also serve ESRO, which expects to have
      additional stations at Spitsbergen, Brussels. and in Australia and the
      South Atlantic. Both the ESRO and French networks will be entirely
      compatible with NASAâ€™s, to maximize possibilities for mutual assistance.
      This is to our advantage, and we encourage it. . . .
         â€œLet me bring you up to date on the status of our cooperation with
      the Soviet Union. You will recall that we have a series of agreements
      with the Soviet Academy of Sciences providing for three coordinated
      projects-in meteorology, in surveying the geomagnetic field, and use
      of ECHO 11 for communications tests. The project involving the ob-
      servation and use of ECHO II is completed. The Soviet side observed
      the critical inflation phase of the satellite optically and forwarded
      the data to us; although not including radar data, which would have
      been most desirable. Communications via ECHO 11 between the U.K.
      and the U.S.S.R. were carried out in only one direction instead of two,
      at less interesting frequencies than we would have liked, and with some
      technical limitations at the ground terminals used. On the other hand,
      the Soviets provided very complete recordings and other data of their
      reception of the transmissions.â€ ( Testimony ; N A S A Auth. Hearings,
    15-37)
February 17: Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Associate Administrator,
    told the House Committee on Science and Astronautics: â€œI feel that
    our record over the past calendar year is evidence of the success we have
    had in building a team that is dedicated to effective management. The
    space flight record for 1964 is impressive by several standards: num-
    ber of flights, percent of success, and variety of missions. The graph
     (spaceflight mission record) shows that, in terms of percentage, our
                                                                          77
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    19fj4 success record is nearly the same as the high achieved in 1963;
    83 percent compared with 85 percent in 1963. However, we more than
    doubled the number of successful missions from 1963 to 19&, from 1       1
             .
    to 25. . .
       â€œOther significant measures of the pace and rate of change in our
    space program have been our performance in terms of spacecraft opera-
    tions and data return. These performance indicators are at the heart
    of a successful space program.
       â€œFor example, in 19M an average of 54 experiments were function-
    ing in space throughout the year; this is an improvement of over 35
    percent from 1963, when we averaged 40 working experiments.
       â€œThe volume of information brought back from space, measured
    in millions of data points per day, shows a tenfold increase over
    previous years: in 1964 we were collecting about 57 million bits of
    information each day from our flight missions. , . .â€
       Dr. Seamans listed NASA management accomplishments during the
    past year â€œto find new techniques and new methods to carry out our
    jobs.â€ Among them: establishment of Mission Analysis Div. from the
    Hq. Office of Advanced Research and Technology at Ames Research
    Center; conducting the joint DOD-NASA Launch Vehicle Cost Study;
    growth of incentive contract program (â€œover $1 billion are under
    active incentive contractsâ€) ; and application of phased project plan-
    ning.
       â€œThe budget presented here has already undergone critical review
    by NASAâ€™s   management, the Bureau of the Budget, and the President.
    It does not provide any contingency funds for the approved missions;
    it is predicated on a cost reduction program that will require us to
    operate more efficiently; it represents a carefully pared program
    priority list. In summary:
       â€œFirst, NASA is dedicated to the accomplishment of the present ap-
    proved missions and projects in terms of cost, schedule, and technical
    performance.
       â€œSecond, new effort is needed to maintain a position of leadership
    in aeronautics and space. This includes the definition of a new pro-
    gram for exploration of the planets commencing with Mars in 1971;
    the research and design necessary for effective extension of present
    Apollo and Saturn capabilities for manned flight; integration of the
    Centaur stage with the Saturn launch vehicle for planetary and other
    unmanned payloads; initiation of an advanced solar observatory
    satellite; and utilization of a prototype XB-70 aircraft for aeronautical
    research.
       â€œThird, an aggressive research and advanced development effort must
     be maintained in many fields, including chemical and nuclear
    propulsion, to assure the nation meaningful options and alternatives in
    the selection of future aeronautical and space goals and the ability to
    react decisively to external pressures and opportunities. . . .â€

February 18: Dr. George E. hlueller, NASA Associate Administrator for
    Manned Space Flight, reviewing overall manned space flight objectives
    and reporting on the Gemini and Apollo programs in testimony before
    the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said:
       â€œChronologically, the first objective of manned space flipht is to
    establish manâ€™s capabilities in space. Next is the establishment of a
    national competence for manned space flight: including the industrial
    base, trained personnel, ground facilities. flight hardware, and opera-
    tional experience. Next, we use this capability for further space ex-
    plorations and for other purposes. Finally. accomplishment of all
    these objectives brings about United States leadership in space.
          . . . In 1964, we concentrated our efforts on Gemini ground tests
       6L


    and accomplished the first flight test, Filling the pipeline with hard-
    ware nnrl rarrying out development testing of subsystems were the
    major Apollo activities. Now in 1965. we have entered a year that
    will be devoted to Gemini flight test operations and the conduct of
    Apollo system development tests.
       â€œLooking at the remainder of the decade! 1966 will be the year when
    we learn new space flight techniques in the Gemini Program, and
    conduct unmanned earth-orbital flipht tests of the Apollo/Saturn IB
    space vehicle. In 1967, Gemini will be available as an operational
    system and we .will carry out manned earth-orbital flights of the Apollo/
    Saturn V space vehicle. Manned flights of the ApolloiSaturn V space
    vehicle are scheduled for 1968, leading to the beginning of manned
    lunar missions before the end of the decade.
          . . . I want to emphasize again that Apollo is an orderly pro-
       â€˜6


    gram. The buildup of the Apollo effort has proceeded over more
     than three and a half years to its full strength. I t is not a crash pro-
    gram.
       â€œThe duration of Apollo, as we reported to the Congress last year,
    is one of the longer United States research and development programs,
    resulting in a schedule that permits rapid, orderly progress. The
    Apollo priority is high but not overriding. Parallel and backup de-
    velopment efforts are limited. Flight testing is being carried out on a
    logical basis, and only after all possible tests are conducted on the
    ground.
80                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

       â€œEfficient use of available resources is a major consideration in the
   conduct of the Apollo program, whereas a crash program follows the
   most expeditious course regardless of cost.
       66 Finally, crash programs typically have goals beyond the existing

    state of technology and pursue these goals under the pressure of having
    to achieve a technological breakthrough. Apollo, on the other hand,
    harnesses current technology in the development of launch vehicles,
    spacecraft and facilities to permit effective space exploration. The
    greatest challenges in Apollo, in fact, are in the integration of those
    systems and the men who must fly them as well as the provision of
   ground operational support, and the overall management of this enter-
    prise.â€
        Dr. Mueller said that data received and analysis continued in 1964
    regarding radiation and the lunar surface indicated that these matters
    were of less importance than had been previously deduced: â€œ. . .
    First, the chance of a significant solar event occurring during a mission
     is very low. Second, if the worst solar flare previously observed had
     occurred during an Apollo mission, the maximum dose that could have
     been received at the bloodforming organs by astronauts in the command
     module would have been about 10 per cent of the allowable safe dose,
     rather than 15 per cent as estimated last year.
        â€œ
          Regarding the lunar surface. the data from RANGER VII have been
     very helpful. The large area photography has indicated the probability
     that there are many areas of the moonâ€™s surface where the design of the
     lunar excursion module is adequate with respect to surface slope and
     roughness. . . .â€ (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 53-134)

February 19: In testimony before the House Committee on Science and
    Astronautics, Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for
    Space Science and Applications, summarized significant mission re-
    sults : â€œUS. scientific satellites achieved the following firsts : discovery
    of the radiation belt, determination of the earthâ€™s irregular geoid,
    ionospheric topside sounding (with Canada), solar spectroscopy, x-
    ray and ultraviolet satellite astronomy, polar orbits, and highly ec-
    centric orbits to map the earthâ€™s magnetosphere. Our deep space
    probes achieved the first successful direct monitoring of the inter-
    planetary environment, the first lunar surface detail, and the first
    successful flight to Venus. We may soon achieve the first successful
    flight to Mars, if MARINER IV completes its mission. In launch vehicle
    development, this program has yielded the first rocket stage using the
    high energy propellant combination of hydrogen and oxygen. It has
    also yielded the first and only all solid propellant space booster. U S .
    meteorological satellites have yielded the following firsts : daylight
    cloud photography, night cloud observations including surface and
    cloud top temperatures, world cloud coverage, global heat balance and
    stratospheric temperature measurements, and direct cloud picture trans-
    mission to local users. Our communication satellites have been first
    in the following achievements: erection of large structures in space and
    their use as passive reflectors of radio signals; active repeating of
    radio signals at various altitudes and orbits of interest to system
    designers; transoceanic and intercontinental relay of teletype, facsimile,
    voice, data, and television; and achievement of the first true geostation-
    ary orbit.
       â€œThe specific record of 1964 space missions of the Space Science
    and Applications Program . . . is particularly informative because
    most major program areas achieved at least one highly significant SUC-
    cess in 1964. Of the 10 scientific satellite missions attempted, 7
    achieved full success and 2 partial success.â€
       Dr. Newell observed that SYNCOM 111 communications satellite had
    been placed in a â€œvirtually perfect circular equatorial orbit,â€ then
    maneuvered â€œto within about 1 mile of its station over the western
    Pacific where it successfully performed all its planned experiments.

  ∞ Col. John H. Glenn, Jr. ( U S M C Ret.), speaking at a National Space Club
     luncheon, said: â€œLooking back over the 3 years since the flight of
     Friendship 7, I am impressed most of all by the tremendous progress
     the United States has made in space science and technology.
          â€œI am proud of the determination the American people have shown
     to become the worldâ€™s leading spacefaring nation. . . .
          â€˜â€˜Three years ago, Mercury spacecraft were limited in weight to
     about 3,000 pounds. Today, the Saturn I booster is operational and
     can put 22,500 pounds into Earth orbit, or seven times the weight of
     Mercury. Saturn I-B, which will begin flying next year, will be able
     to orbit a payload equal to 11 Mercury spacecraft. Saturn V, which
                                                                                 83

    will fly in 1967. will be able to orbit a payload equal to more than
    80 Mercuries. Thatâ€™s some jump-but               it is no more than typical of
    the great gains we are making in national space capabilities.
       â€œThe accuracy requirements f o r all these missions are almost in-
    comprehensible and are one of the least understood parts of the space
    program. A good case in point was the launch of Friendship 7 3 years
    ago. The speed at insertion into orbit was over 25,000 feet per second
    or 5 miles per second, and the booster and spacecraft were accelerating
    at approximately 240 feet per second at a steadily increasing rate. At
    booster cutoff, each error of 1.4 feet per second resulted in a difference
    of approximately 1 mile in apogee on the far side of the Earth. Whcn
    you consider that before the onboard signal for cutoff was received,
    information had to be obtained by radar at the Cape, transmitted by
    landline to Goddard, run through the computers, returned by landline
    to the Cape, checked against Cape data and then transmitted 350 miles
    down range to the spacecraft, still allowing time for onboard delays
    in operation of relays. valves, and thrust termination, it looks like an
    almost impossibly accurate requirement.
        â€œThose accuracies. however, are rather crude compared with some
    now being obtained on the deep space probes.
        â€œNow we have Mariner I V which at 6 oâ€™clock tonight will be
    20,194,023 miles out from Earth on an extremely difficult and signifi-
    cant mission. As you know, there was a checkout of equipment aboard
    the spacecraft last week that indicates the chances are still good that
    we will get revealing pictures of Mars next July, when Mariner IV will
    be 134 million miles from Earth, so far it will take 12112 seconds to get
     a radio signal back.

February 19: Sen. A. S. (Mike) Monroney (D-Okla.) said in an interview
     that if commercial airlines would voluntarily join the Federal Gov-
     ernment in subsidizing helicopter lines, these services might be saved.
     Commercial helicopter lines operating i n New York, Chicago, LOS

     but President Johnson proposed in his budget message that they be
     cut off after Dec. 31.

     money. We havenâ€™t a chance of selling them or continuing the subsidy
     without added help from the airlines.â€ His plan involved artificially
     lowering helicopter fares so that a greater portion of the flying public
     would use them. This higher load factor, combined with the use of

February 20: RANGER VIII lunar photography probe struck its target on the
      moon at 4:57:36.8 EST, after radioing to earth about 7,000 close-up
      pictures of the lunar surface during the last 23 min. of flight. The
      point of impact was 2.59â€ north latitude, 24.77â€™ east longitude, in the
      Sea of Tranquillity, an area slightly east-northeast of the center of a
      full moon. The spacecraft impacted at slightly less than 6,000 mph.
      Total distance of travel along its trajectory from lift-off had been
      calculated as 248,766 mi. Accuracy of the shot was reflected in the
      fact that impact had been planned for 4:57:30, and at 3â€ north lati-
      tude and 24â€ east longitude.
         RANGER VIII had been programed to execute a â€œterminal sequenceâ€
      just before impact to point the six TV cameras more in the direction
      of flight; this sequence was omitted to allow the cameras to cover a
      larger area than planned and to provide greater continuity with the
      pictures transmitted by RANGER VII last July 31. A second change in
      the flight was to turn on cameras 23 min. before impact instead of 13
      min. and 40 sec. as planned. The new time had been chosen so that
      initial pictures would be about equal to earth-based resolution and
      then continue into impact.
         Two small anomalies: one part of the spacecraft had registered a
      higher temperature than had been anticipated and more telemetry data
      had been lost during midcourse maneuver than had been expected.

    conference that one of the most important results of this flight had
    been the discovery that the Sea of Clouds and the Sea of Tran-
    quillity were similar in structure. He noted several â€œodd depressed
    regionsâ€ and said that they could be areas where collapse had occurred,
    which might suggest the presence of lava fields. He believed the lunar
    surface was composed of very light, frothy material such as would be
    formed when rock was melted and allowed to resolidify within a high
    vacuum, like that on the moon. The material envisioned by Dr. Kuiper
    might be considered similar to certain volcanic rocks found on earth:
    while it would probably be lighter than water, it could still have sub-
    stantial strength. This theory was based on laboratory attempts several
    years ago to simulate conditions existing when the moon was formed.
        Ewen A. Whitaker of the Univ. of Arizona said he felt the lunar
    material, which he thought had a consistency of crunchy snow, would
    support a manned spacecraft. He said color lines and sharp bound-
    aries tended to show that the surface was some sort of frothy, lava-like
    material and definitely not dust.
        Another member of the Panel, Dr. Harold C . Urey, of the Univ. of
    California, noted dimples on the moonâ€™s surface and said their curved
    walls indicated material must have been thrown out of their centers
    when comparatively soft terrain was gouged by heavy masses of rock.
    He thought he saw spots in the center of some dimples into which soft
    material might be draining and estimated the depth of some dimples
    at 50 to 60 ft. Dr. Urey also suggested the surface material might
    have the consistency of crunchy snow. (NASA Transcript; Appel. N Y T ,

February 23: USAF 1.175-lb. Project Asset reentry glider, last in a test series
    of six, was launched from Cape Kennedy by a Thor-Delta rocket booster
    on a 13,300 mph suborbital flight; the spacecraft then was lost at sea.
    The experiment was to test materials for future lifting body reentry de-
    signs; it consisted of 2,000 tiny heat-sensitive spots in ten different
    colors designed to change hue as the glider came back through the
     atmosphere from an altitude of 40 mi. USAF said that most of the
     information sought had been radioed to the ground during the 30 min.
     flight, but that visual examination of the glider was necessary for data
     on heat distribution.
        Officials presumed the glider sank into the sea, although intermittent
     radio signals received had indicated it had been at least partially
     afloat for some hours. Planes and ships were combing an area in the

    ∞ Addressing the US. Military Academy at West Point, NASA Administrator
       James E. Webb said: â€œI would like to acknowledge the debt that NASA
       owes to the armed forces for early and continuing work that has con-
       tributed to some of our most successful space projects. As you know,
       NASA works closely with the Air Force in the development of launch
       vehicles and in the general technology of space flight. . . .

            As an example-among many-of cooperative NASA-DOD activities :
       on January 1, NASA transferred control of its operating SYNCOM II and
       SYNCOM 111 communications satellites to the Department of De-
       fense. . . .
           â€œWhen the great DOD missile site construction program-which       ran
        at one time to $2.8 billion a year-subsided, the Corps of Engineers
        brought its tremendous engineering capability to the construction of
        NASA facilities. AS the Corps moved toward completion of its work
        for NASA, its abilities will have been enhanced by the experience of
        building these great new national resources. The Corps, with new
        skills, will be able to move to new national requirements with assurance
       that it has performed extraordinarily well in engineering fields never
        before attempted.
           â€œToday there are detailed to NASA 254 active duty military person-
       nel. Five of our astronauts are graduates of this great Academy.
        Nothing could be more fitting. For the debt modern American science
        and technology owes to West Point is too large to be repaid. It can
        visibly be traced back to Sylvanus Thayer who not only is the father
        of this Academy but who had a tremendous influence for half a century
        in the field of technical and scientific education throughout the United

    the House Committee on Science and Astronautics: â€˜â€˜Since 1958, NASA
    has provided tracking and data acquisition support by means of the
    NASA Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network for approx-
    imately 50 DOD earth satellites. During 1965 we expect to provide
    continuing telemetry support for as many as 10 DOD earth satellites, and
    limited tracking support for several more. Also, our station at
    Carnarvon, Australia, being in an excellent geographical relation
    to the launch facilities at Cape Kennedy, will be used to support
    a number of DOD spacecraft, as well as NASA spacecraft, where data and
    flight control after one-half orbit is required. For example, the DOD
    TITAN 111 launch vehicle development program is vitally dependent on
    support by this station. We anticipate support of approximately 15
    TITAN 111 operations per year for the next two years.
       â€œIn a similar fashion, the tracking and data acquisition support
    which the DOD provides for NASA is extensive. At Cape Kennedy, for
    example, DOD has supported the launch phase of each NASA space flight
    mission. The extensive support provided by DOD for the Mercury pro-
    gram is well known. The Gemini program requires continuation of
    this DOD support.â€

    ment, is the increase in the number of spacecraft which will have high-
    ly elliptical or synchronous orbits. Spacecraft in highly elliptical
     orbits must be supported by a particular ground station, much in the
    same way as done for deep space missions, i.e., a particular station is
     required to provide as much as S-10 hours per day of its available
    time for support of one satellite. Spacecraft in synchronous orbits

     and operations have absorbed much of our resources within the past
     few years, the N4SA has been and will continue to be dedicated to a
     strong program of aeronautical research keyed to the Nationâ€™s needs.â€
     He testified: â€œ. . . The [aeronautics] program embraces the entire
     spectrum of flight from lowspeed private and V/STOL aircraft to hy-
     personic vehicles. I have already described . . . our part in the
      evolution of the XV-5A and F-111 aircraft, in the evaluation of
     supersonic transport proposals, and in the solution of jet transport
      rough air problems. Looking ahead to FY 1966, we are requesting
      $42.2 million in Research and Development for aeronautics. This
      figure can be separated into two categories: one funds a broad and
      continuing effort in the scientific disciplines underlying advances in
      all areas of air transportation, civil and military; the other funds a
      more concentrated attack on specific advances in air transportation
      whose potential is identified by research in the various scientific
      disciplines. . , .
         â€œThroughout the aeronautics program budget, provision has been
      made to support the direct requests of the Department of Defense and
      the Federal Aviation Agency. It can be pointed out that although
      the Research and Development request in FY 1966 for aeronautics is
      $42.2 million, we expect to spend a total sum of $106.2 million in this
      field. The difference is accounted for by Administrative Operations
      and Construction of Facilities funds as well as supporting research and
      technology directly applicable to aeronautics in fields such as elec-

  I n testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics,
      George Friedl, Jr., N4SA Deputy Associate Administrator for In-
      dustry Affairs, said: â€œNAS.4 spends about 93 percent of its dollars
      on contracts with industry, universities and private research or-
      ganizations. These procurements during fiscal year 1964 amounted
      to $4.6 billion. Approximately 96 percent of this amount or $4.4
      billion was awarded by our field installations i n accordance with pro-
      gram and project research and development requirements. NASA con-
      tracts support our in-house research and development activities and
                                                                          91
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    establish our coupling with industry and the private scientific com-
    munity. . . .â€
        Reporting on contract administration, Mr. Friedl testified : â€œThe
    cost reimbursement contract has been the basic instrument for procuring
    research and development because the Government has had to risk the
    uncertainties and assume the high cost involved. No other type of con-
    tract provides the Government and the contractor the latitude and
    flexibility needed to relate scientific and technical requirements,
    schedules and use of resources to mission objectives. By adding in-
    centive provisions pertaining to time, quality and cost to this type of
    contract, it is our intention to offset some of its deficiencies and
    strengthen the purpose of the Government-contractor relationship.
        â€œNASA has made a concerted effort to introduce suitable incentive
    arrangements in our cost reimbursement type contracts whenever
    practicable. In each case, the objective is to encourage the contractor
    to manage better and improve his performance; adhere to schedules;
    and hold down costs.
        C6
           As a consequence of our incentive contracting drive, there has
    been a marked increase in this activity in the past 4% years. In fiscal
    year 1961 we had one contract worth about $100,000. By December
    31, 1964, we had awarded 75 contracts with a target value of over
    $751 million, 7 of these have been completed leaving 68 contracts
    totalling over $724 million currently being administered. . . .
        â€œIn view of the undesirable features of letter contracts, NASA Head-
    quarters began a concerted effort, early in 1963, to curtail the issuance
    of new letter contracts and to assure the timely definitization of all
    outstanding letter contracts. Headquarters issued instructions to all
    centers directing program and project managers to plan ahead and
    .!!ow arleqiiate lead time for the initial negotiation of definitive con-
    tracts. . . . At the end of January only 3 letter contracts having a
    total value of $4 million were outstanding. We expect that these con-
    tracts will be definitized in March 1965.â€
        Mr. Friedl said that NASA had â€œstructured a sound practicable man-
     agerial technique to direct the planning, approval and execution
    of . . . future programs. We believe that adoption of what we have
    termed â€˜phased project planningâ€™ will materially assist us in achieving
    this goal.
        â€œPhased project planning represents an orderly sequential progres-
    sion in the execution of NASA major projects. It provides for formulat-
     ing proposed work goals and missions, and allows for decisions, re-
     appraisal points for management consideration to advance or replan
    such proposals, as well as the resources to implement them.
        â€œSpecifically, phased project planning provides for four distinct
    phases as follows:
        â€œPhase A Conceptual/Feasibility Phase . . .

      probe, which ceased normal functioning ten days after the Nov. 28,
       1964, launching, had become understandable to scientists through anal-
      ysis of a component failure i the plasma probe. Telemetry from a

       â€œ. . . the past )-ear saw the continued strengthening of the coordi-
    nation and the mutual support between NASA and the DOD in space and
    aeronautics. The Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board
    has continued to be an effective medium for formal coordi-
    nation. During 1964 3.4SA and the DOD developed procedures for the
    coordination of the space science programs; a national program in
    satellite geodesy was established by the DOD, NASA, and the Department
    of Commerce: a standardized basis for reporting space and aeronau-

    which the Soviets expected their space program to provide as a part of

    and, in fact. that their activities may be further increased. During

116             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   were day-night changes and temperature, atmospheric, and pressure
   fluctuations.
       For ten years, Brown had kept potato tubers under constant pressure
   and temperature and in constantly dim light, yet they continued to
   fluctuate at same rate and time as potatoes planted in Illinois and
   they detected atmospheric pressure changes. Brown concluded that
   â€œsomething is getting thru to the isolated potatoes to tell them what the
   weather is outside. It could be the earthâ€˜s magnetic or electric fields
   or radiation, since they all observe a 24-hour pattern geared to the
   rising and setting sun, but we are not sure.
       â€œ. . . biological clocks are necessary to keep a living system a coor-
   dinate, living, functioning whole. If the clocks are stopped, the orga-
   nism may go beserk and die.â€ If the orbiting potato were to die
   within 90 days, it would indicate that a 24-hour rhythm was
   vital. (Kotulak, Chic. Trib., 3/9/65)

     This flight demonstrated that ion beam neutralization will take place
     satisfactorily in space and, therefore, eliminated the only uncertainty
     regarding the basic feasibility of successful space operation. A second
     major accomplishment was the design, fabrication, and test of a 30

       Discussing nuclear propulsion programs, he said: â€œ1964 was a year
    of significant progress in the Nuclear Rocket Program. It was
    marked by the successful completion of the KIWI series of reactor
    development experiments and the successful initiation of the NERVA
    reactor testing. These reactor experiments, coupled with work in
    other portions of our Nuclear Rocket Program, provide assurance that
    the graphite core nuclear rocket can be available to fulfill its role as
    the next major space propulsion system.
       â€œOf particular significance in 1964 was the successful demonstration
    of the adequacy of the reactor structural design, the elimination of
    reactor structural vibrations, full power reactor operation for over ten
    minutes at an altitude equivalent specific impulse of about 750 sec-
    onds, a rapid automatic startup, the ability to restart the rocket reac-
    tor, the determination of the effect of a maximum reactor power excur-
    sion, and the neutronic investigation of two rocket reactors located
    side-by-side as would be necessary in clustered engine configura-
    tions. . . .
       â€œDuring this year emphasis will be placed upon extending our reac-
    tor technology to higher temperature, longer duration, and higher
    power while we proceed as rapidly as possible to close coupled nuclear
    rocket engine system testing. We face this task of developing nuclear
    rocket technology including component, subsystem, and engine system
    work, with a confidence that is based on the solid accomplishments in
    our reactor development program and with the knowledge that the
    technology we are developing will provide the propulsion capability

March 16: Dr. Homer E. Neuell. NASA Associate Administrator for Space
    Science and Applications, told the House Committee on Science and
    Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications that
    NASA had an obligation to make information gained from space ex-
    ploration available to the public. He continued: â€œTo help achieve this,
    a National Space Science Data Center was established at GSFC in April
    1964. . . .
        â€œThe Data Center is responsible for the collection, organization, in-
    dexing, storage, retrieval. and dissemination of all scientific data re-
    sulting from experiments in space and the upper atmosphere. Since
126             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   its establishment the Data Center has begun: (1) to maintain a con-
   tinuing inventory of data from sounding rockets and spacecraft; (2)
   to acquire data generated by spacecraft previously launched; ( 3 ) to
   collect selected ground correlative data; and (4) to produce the an-
   nouncement publications which support its functions.
       â€œIn anticipation of the need for this facility, NASA has established a
   line item in the Physics and Astronomy budget, Data Analysis, of
   three million dollars in FY 1966. Of this, 600 thousand dollars is for
   the operation of the Data Center and 2.4 million dollars is for analysis
   of data from a flight experiment under the flight project. After the
   initial results have been published by the Principal Investigator and
   the data are placed in the data center, the additional analyses of these
   data will be funded from Data Analysis funds on the basis of propos-
    als from competent scientists throughout the Nation . . . This approach
    is expected to . . . encourage them to use all of the available informa-

       Dr. Newel1 discussed NASAâ€™s     orbiting observatory program : â€œThe
    primary reason for . . . solar studies is to meet the overall NASA ob-
   jective to expand human knowledge of space phenomena. . . .
       â€œOSO-c [Orbiting Solar Observatory-C] is the next spacecraft to be
    launched and it is undergoing final testing at this time. On 30 May a
    solar eclipse of unusually long duration will occur. Every effort is
    being made to launch OSO-c prior to this event so that two OSOâ€™S,
    with complementary payloads, can be operating and transmitting
    unique data on the solar radiation at the time of the eclipse.â€
       He said that the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (Ogo) program
    would make a major contribution to our understanding of earth-sun-
    environment relationships and that although OGO I had not functioned
    as planned â€œit has proven that the basic spacecraft design is adequate
    and that large numbers of experiments can be integrated and operated
    from a single satellite. Furthermore, should OGO I continue to trans-
    mit data for a reasonable period, it is expected that the results will
    contribute substantially to studies of the Earth-Sun relationships.
       â€œInvestigation of the OGO I failure indicated there was no common
    cause for failure, but as a result of the investigation, design modifica-
    tions and additional tests are planned for future OGO spacecraft. The
    modifications include: (1) relocation of the horizon scanner and cer-
    tain boom appendages to assure a clear field of view for the horizon
    scanners; (2) the use of a new type development spring and the addi-
    tion of separate appendage â€˜kick-off springs; and ( 3 ) the relocation of

   problem. To understand what is going on and to eliminate, or at least
   minimize this communication difficulty, one must be able to calculate
   the distribution of free electrons about the body in order to predict
   when the plasma sheath will become opaque for certain radio
   frequencies. This calculation cannot be made until the flow field
    (temperature, density, pressure and velocity) about the body is
   known. A significant part of the fluid physics program is concerned
    with the investigations of flow fields. The results of these studies also
   give us better information on the heat transfer to reentry bodies.
       â€œAS a possible remedy for the communications blackout, we are
    studying the characteristics of various gases, called electrophylic gases,
    which have the unique property of capturing free electrons. Such a
    gas, which effectively reduces the electron concentration when injected
    into the flow, might solve the problem. . . . This work is tied closely
    with the work on radio attenuation going on at the Langley Research

March 17: Discussing the need for sustaining engineering funds for Cen-
    taur starting in F Y 1966, NASA Associate Administrator for Space
    Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell testified before the
    House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Subcommittee on Space
    Sciences and Applications: â€œA preliminary study and design phase is
    being initiated by NASA this Fiscal Year [for adaptation of the Centaur
    to the Saturn IB]. The primary mission for this vehicle is the
    Voyager. Initial studies indicate this vehicle is capable of launching
    a payload to Mars in excess of 8000 pounds during all of the opportu-
    nities in the 1970â€™s. Generally, the modifications necessary to create
    this stage combination are not particularly difficult. They do repre-
    sent a large engineering effort, but there is nothing apparent at this
    time which indicates that new technologies will be required. The Cen-
    taur will be mounted, along with the Voyager, inside a fairing the size
    of the Saturn (260-inch diameter). By constructing this size fairing
    the technical problems associated with adaptation of the Centaur to this
    new booster are significantly reduced and the diameter required for all
    of the Voyager missions is obtained.â€
        Dr. Newell described NASAâ€™s     sustaining university program as an
    effort â€œto broaden the national research base in areas of importance to
    the national space effort and increase our capability to replenish con-
    tinually the reservoir of basic knowledge. . . .
        â€œIn response to the continuing manpower requirements, NASA con-
     ducts a predoctoral training program, under which grants are made to
     universities to select and train outstanding students in space-related
     fields. Specialized training for selected students offers them identifica-
    tion with the national space effort, and involves them directly in the
     new programs of the space age. . . .
        â€œAt the present time, about 1,957 students are in training at 131
     institutions. The disciplines represented by these 1,957 students are
     distributed as follows: physical sciences, 51 percent; engineering, 37
     percent; life sciences, S percent; behavioral sciences, 4 percent . . . In
     September 1965, about 1,275 new students will begin their three years
     of study and research as NASA predoctoral trainees. At that time, 142
     institutions, located in every state in the union, will be participating.
     With the proposed budget of $25 million for fiscal year 1966, about
     1,300 new students would enter the program. Consequently, the NASA
     goal of an output of 1,000 Ph.D.â€™s per year will not be reached before
     fiscal year 1968 or fiscal year 1969 . . . Of the students participating

    have several important and serious physiological and behavior effects
    upon the performance and well being of man that need to be investi-
    gated further. There were changes in the circulation system, in the
    biochemical characteristics of the blood and urine, and in the electro-
    encephalogram indices, all pointing to a need for more detailed investi-
    gations. The results from the Biosatellite studies will have broad
    application to long term, manned space flight, including manned space
    stations and lunar and planetary bases.
       â€œProlonged manned flights may involve changes similar to those
    observed after 10 days of strict bed rest on the ground. These are
    moderate losses of bone minerals such as calcium. particularly in the
    vertebrae; loss of muscle tone and physical capability; certain cardio-
    vascular changes; and metabolism in general. The effect of continued
    sensory deprivation on behavior and performance is unknown.
       â€œBiosatellite experiments are of both scientific and practical impor-
    tance and extremely profitable to investigate. We do not presently
    have sound theoretical bases for making precise quantitative (and in
    some cases qualitative) predictions of what we expect to happen. It

    succeed in reaching to goals we have set-and one which will see new
    goals-one that can see beyond the moon and into fields where we can
    only speculate about the knowledge awaiting us.â€
       The Vice President spoke briefly about the Soviet Unionâ€™s VOSKHOD
    11 flight: â€œIt is well for us from time to time to take stock-to   take a
    careful look-in    order to see how we are making out in comparison
    with our main competitor. The facts are that we do have very strong
    competition and hence we have another big reason for a major space
    effort-namely, prudence. Our national security alone would suggest
    reason enough for us to strive for absolute leadership in space explora-
    tion.â€
       Humphrey pointed out that the Soviets remained ahead in propul-
    sion for their rockets, while the U S . continued to lead â€œin the directly
    useful fields of weather reporting, navigation, and communications.â€
    He continued: â€œThe Soviets clearly have an advantage in studying the
    effects of space environment on human beings. . . . We can salute
    the Russian achievements . . . but we would be foolish if we did not
    understand the military implications of Soviet space science as well
    as our own.
       â€œEach Russian shock has produced action here. But a mature na-
    tion should not need shock treatment. We are a peaceful
    nation . . . but we would ignore the real interests of the free world if
    we diminished our military efforts in space.â€

    their latest feat?â€ replied: â€œThe Soviet accomplishment and our own
    scheduled efforts demonstrate, I think dramatically and convincingly,
    the important role that man himself will play in the exploration of the
    space frontier. The continuing efforts of both our program and the
    Russian program will steadily produce capability and new space
    activity. This capability. in my judgment, will help each nation
    achieve broader confidence to do what they consider they ought to do
    in space.
       â€œI have felt since the days \then I introduced the Space Act and sat
    studying Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 that it was really a mistake to
    regard space exploration as a contest which can be tallied on any box
    score.
       â€œJudgments can be made only by considering all the objectives of
    the two national programs. and they will vary and they will
    differ. Our own program is very broadly based. We believe very
    confidently in the United States that we will produce contributions that
    we need at the time we need them. For that reason, I gave Mr. Webb
    and his group every dollar in the Budget that they asked for a manned
    space flight.
       â€œNOW the progress of our program is very satisfactory to me in
    every iespect. We ale committed to peaceful purposes for the benefit
    o i aii mankind. We stressed that in our hearings and our iegisiation

    into 115-mi.-altitude parking orbit with 17,500 mph orbital speed,
    the Agena engines were cut off. Second burn of the Agena lasted
    about 90 sec., increasing the velocity to about 24,525 mph and freeing
    RAXGER IX from the major pull of the earth's gravity. RANGER IX
    then continued on its 21/$-day, 245,000-mi. trip to the moon. About
     70 min. after launch. NASA announced the spacecraft had been com-
    manded to deploy its solar panels that would convert solar energy to
    electrical power for its equipment.
        Projected target was the crater Alphonsus, about 12" south of the
     moon's equator, where gaseous emissions had been reported. On the
     day of impact, Alphonsus would be illuminated by slanting sunlight.
    producing long shadows and bringing out subtle surface features.
    The terminator-dividing      line between the dark and sunlit portions
     of the moon-would      be only 11" from Alphonsus.
        Five hours after lift-off, NASA announced that RANGER IX'S course

    rotating about 800 meters [900 yards] from our ship.â€ Neither the
    satellite nor the orbit in which it was traveling was identified.
       The cosmonauts related the part that each had played. Col. Be-
    lyayev had operated the controls of the decompression chamber
    through which his companion left the spacecraft, recorded Leonovâ€™s
    pulse and respiration rate, and oriented the spacecraft so that Leonov
    was always in sunlight during the televised sequence transmitted to
    earth. Col. Leonov said that when he opened the hatch of the air lock
    after decompression, he was â€œstruck by a flow of blindingly bright
    sunlight like an arc of electric welding.â€ The spacecraft was in its
    second orbit, passing over Kerch Strait. Space had an unexpected
    aspect, he said: â€œAhead of me was black sky, very black. The sun
    was not radiant, just a smooth disc without an aureole. Below was
    the smooth-level earth. You could not tell it was a sphere, only by the
    fact that the round edge showed on the horizon.â€ The acrobatics
    tired Leonov, especially because of the effort required to move. He
    said that although the program required that he carefully wind the
    rope that had tethered him to the craft, he found i t â€œa waste of timeâ€
    and simply pulled it into the hatch. â€œThe commander quickly closed
    the hatch cover and injected pressure into the air lock,â€ Leonov said.
       Describing the manually controlled landing, Col. Belyayev said the
    controls were switched on in time and all systems had â€œworked without
    a hitch.â€ He said the spacecraft landed in the northern Ural moun-
    tains between two big spruce trees in snow 5-10 ft. deep. (Shabad,

    which had to be made in the preparation of this hudget was the deci-
    sion to terminate the programs to develop the &I-1 large liquid hydro-
    gen fueled engine, the large 260-inch solid propellant motor, and the
    SNAP-8 nuclear electric power supply. The reduction in the requests
    for space technology activities amounting to ahout $18 million when
    compared with fiscal year 1965, results mostly from these
    terminations. However, as this Committee knows, there is pending
    before it notification of a plan to reprogram $16.950,000 of 1965
    funds so that these projects can be carried forward into 1966 to appro-
    priate developmental points at which important segments of the engi-
    neering data for which the projects were originally planned can be
    obtained for incorporation in our total bank of technological and engi-

    of life, Nimbus took 12,13i individual frames of AVCS pictures, an
    estimated 1.930 APT cycles, and over 6,880 minutes of HRIR data. Hur-
    ricanes Cleo, Dora, Ethel. and Florence were observed and Typhoons
    Ruby and Sally in the Pacific were located by this spacecraft. . . .
        â€œThe launch and successful operation of Nimbus I has proved the
    success of the basic Nimbus spacecraft design. It has also given NASA
    a better insight as to what additional modifications will be required in
    the system design for the next Nimbus flight. As mentioned previous-
    ly, the primary limitation of the first Nimbus flight was the result of
    the failure of the Agena B vehicle to inject the spacecraft in the proper
    polar, near-circular orbit and the failure in the spacecraft solar paddle
    rotation mechanism. The first of these failures resulted in less than
    complete global cloud coverage and the second reduced spacecraft

 ∞NASA Langley Research Center scientists Arthur L. Newcomb, Jr., Nelson
    J. Groom, and Norman M. Hatcher reported their work on an infrared
    sensing instrument to help a spacecraft determine which way was up, at
    the IEEE national convention. The device described was sensitive to
    the difference between infrared radiation in space and that emitted by
    a planetary or lunar body; it employed a mechanically-driven system
    of mirrors to scan the region of space in which it was operating. Ra-
    diation gathered by the mirrors was focused into four germanium lens-
    es, each containing a thermistor sensitive to infrared. When the scan-
    ning mirror crossed the horizon of a planet, the increase or decrease
    registered on the thermistor and generated an electronic signal that
    could be processed through a series of special circuits to provide a
    stabilizing or control command to the spacecraft.
       The new sensor concept was expected to be useful for weather and
    communications satellites, as well as for space probes and other types
    of spacecraft. ( LaRC Release)

 ∞Reasons for choosing the moon crater Alphonsus as the target for
     RANGER IX were given by David Hoffman in an article in the New
     York Herald Tribune: â€œFirst, they are just plain curious. Rangers 7
     and 8 photographed two lunar seas and taught scientists that all such
     â€˜mariaâ€™ are pretty much the same. Now scientists want pictorial cov-
     erage of the moonâ€™s rugged highlands.
        â€œAlphonsusâ€™ walls rise 7,000 to 10,000 feet above its crater floor,
     and in the basin thus formed astronomers have observed reddish gas
     seeping from the surface. The question, then, is whether Alphonsus is
     really a lunar equivalent of a live volcano.
        â€œSecond, some space experts believe Apollo astronauts, as they de-
     scend on the moon, may encounter an emergency. That emergency
     might force them down in the moon mountains instead of onto a flat
     lunar plain. Accordingly, NASA wants to know surface roughness of
     the smoothest part of the moon mountains.
        â€œThird, there are some who believe the smoothest areas on the moon
     actually lie within the great craters (Alphonsusâ€™ diameter is 70
     miles). If this proves true, astronauts might select a crater floor as
     their touchdown point, assuming there is no volcanic activity.â€ (Hoff-

March 22: NASAâ€™s actions in releasing foreign satellite information were
    criticized in a report by the House Committee on Government

    they were designated as secret information by Norad. â€œNASA has not
    once challenged these security classifications, blindly accepting the mil-

    facts had been carefully deleted from its routine report of satellite

    of craters not caused by meteorite impact.

    the Univ. of Arizona said parts of the highlands around the crater

March 24: Both U S . and U.S.S.R. space research were criticized by a
    Vatican weekly magazine, Lâ€™Osservatore della Domenica, which said
    they were using it as a â€œpolitical instrument.â€
        In an editorial, the publicationâ€™s deputy director, Federico Alessan-
    drini, said space competition was â€œbeneficial because it widens manâ€™s
    understanding and offers new methods of observations which tomor-

 ∞ NASA Administrator James E. Webb reported to President Johnson and
     the Cabinet on both the two-man GT-3 flight and the RANGER IX pho-
     tographic mission. Mr. Webb made these points: â€œThe most
     significant accomplishment of the GT-3 flight was that . . . it provid-
     ed verification of the basic design, development, test and operations
     procedures NASA is using to develop manned spacecraft, man-rated
     launch vehicles and a world-wide operational network. . . .
         â€œWe now know that at least two spots, and perhaps three, when we
     look more carefully at the RANGER IX pictures, are at least smooth
     enough for the Lem [manned moon landing]. . , .â€
         An American astronaut probably would be able to open his space-
     craft and partly emerge from the cabin during the GT-5 flight. Mr.
     Webb said under questioning that there might be some possibility of
     achieving this in the next Gemini flight, but that GT-5 was more
     likely.
         He regarded a Russian cosmonautâ€™s leaving a space vehicle briefly
     as spectacular but said the U.S. was more intent on developing a space
     suit that would enable American astronauts to work outside on space
     vehicles and develop or put together space centers. (Text; UPI, N.Y.

March 25: At a press conference, Maj. Virgil I. Grissom ( U S A F ) and
    LCdr. John W. Young ( L E X ) described the three-orbit GT-3 flight of
    Mar. 23, as busy, exhilarating, near-perfect, and short on surprises.
    They said it was highly significant for future flight in space since it
    proved that a spacecraft could be maneuvered precisely, at will, and
    more independently of the g o u n d than before. They said it also
    proved that man can eat and safely dispose of wastes as they will need
    to do on long flights.
       Major Grissom suFgested two possible reasons that the â€œMolly
    Brownâ€ had undershot the target landing area: one was that something
    might have gone wrong during the final orbit change or when subse-
    quently the braking rockets were fired to start the spacecraftâ€™s descent;
    the other was that there might have been a miscalculation of the craftâ€™s
    center of gravity. ( i ~ . 4 ~ Transcript)

    has developed so far point strongly toward a military space
    effort. The development of a capability by the Soviet Union to de-
    liver strategic weapons from near space or to deny to the United States
    the opportunity to continue its present programs in space would
     amount to a serious threat and would negate our present favorable

 ∞Kenneth Gatland, Vice-president of the British Interplanetary Society,
    urged US.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in manned lunar exploration
    in New Scientist article. â€œ. . . it seems we are faced with the ludi-
    crous situation of the worldâ€™s two most powerful nations, each with
    massively expensive rival programmes, heading for a common objec-
    tive which each proclaims is being pursued in the highest interests of
    peaceful scientific exploration.â€ A joint venture would have the ad-
    vantage of providing for contingencies such as rescue of astronauts
    possibly stranded on the moon or in lunar orbit-a            capability not
    included in Project Apollo. â€œThis situation can only be satisfactorily
    resolved by the provision in lunar orbit of a second soft-landing vehi-
    cle and back-up crew capable of mounting an emergency rescue
    operation. To achieve this would require a specially adapted version
    of the craft already designed to soft-land astronauts.
       â€œThis is where the merit of US-Soviet cooperation lies for, as an
    international venture, a project to land men on the Moon would surely
    not be undertaken as envisaged in project Apollo; and certainly not
     with such rigid constraints on time. In all probability it would be
    planned as an operation rather than a solo mission, with logistic sup-
    port from a second space vehicle placed in lunar orbit ahead of the
    main expedition. . . .
       â€œThe essential requirement in terms of the eventual lunar expedition
    is that launchings should be coordinated so that expedition compo-
    nents arrive in lunar orbit together. By the mid-l970â€™s, orbital ren-
     dezvous techniques should be well established with the ability of men
     to move between orbiting vehicles. An agreed crew could then de-
     scend to the lunar surface Mhile another ship remains in reserve
     orbiting the Moon in case of need. Alternatively, a reserve vehicle
    might be landed, unmanned, in advance. . . .
       â€œAlthough at this stage such . . . [a combined lunar expedition]
     would have little influence on overall costs, it could mean a great deal
    to the safety of initial manned missions.
       â€œSuch a move would demand concessions on both sides. It would
    mean America abandoning her 1970 target date for placing men on
    the Moon, and while allowing Russia to keep her rocket secrets she
    would have to be prepared to reveal her programme for manned
    spaceflight. . . .â€ ( N e w Scientist, 3/25/65, 774-76)

   dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe in the interests of
   science and for the good of all mankind.â€
       Belyayev said VOSKHOD 11 was capable of maneuvering in space as
   did the U.S. GEMIKI 111 but that this was not in the Soviet flight plan.
       Leonov described time outside the ship saying â€œit is too early to call
   it a pleasant walk. It could not have been done without hard
   training.â€ He reported his small push on VOSKHOD 11 to move away
   from it after going out of the hatch started the spacecraft into slow
    rotation. In pulling himself back to the VOSKHOD 11 by his cable,
   Leonov disclosed he had yanked rather vigorously and had to put his
   hand out to avoid collision with the spacecraft.
       Belyayev said he and Leonov were found by a helicopter 2% hrs.
    after a soft landing in snowy woods near Perm. He said VOSKHOD 11

    and could be used again if necessary. ( A P , Wash. Eve. Star, 3/26/65;

        â€œSeldom, if ever, has a complex technological effort in its early
     phases returned such valuable dividends as this project. In the early
     stage Tiros was an Army project. When the National Aeronautics

     velopment of the spacecraft.
        â€œThe United States Weather Bureau utilized the data from the very

     hours when it began transmitting to NASA ground stations cloud photo-

     The advanced orbiting space station can likeizise lead to an orbiting
     launch complex for planetary missions such as Martian flyby and
     exploration shelters or a lunar base for potential exploitation of the
     lunar environment. . . . In Earth orbit. the AES can provide for

     and (3) development of advanced technology for support of both
     manned and unmanned space operations. . . . In the field of Earth-
      oriented applications of manned space operations, NASA has been
     conducting studies and investigations jointly with the Departments of
      Commerce. Apiculture. Interior and Defense to determine how we
      might apply Apolloâ€™s unique capabilities to improve our ability to

    and the availability of a market. The extent is also dictated by the
    extent of their earnings on marketable products for which the Govern-

      Island Spaceport. I hope you noticed that I used the term Spaceport,
      instead of Moonport, as it is often referred to in the news media. We
      call it a Spaceport because its basic concept is not to exist as a research
      and development facility for any one mission only; it is being created
      to function as an actual port, with a space vehicle launch rate that may
      be some day as high as one manned launch per month.
         â€œHowever, just as important to consider is the spaceportâ€™s capacity
      for growth. It can accommodate launch vehicles with up to 40 million
      pounds of thrust, 32.5 million pounds more than the Saturn V here can

    received from a â€œsuper civilizationâ€ in outer space. The astronomers
    explained that their studies had been based on a radio signal from a
     point in space called CTA-102-a    designation of the California Institute
     of Technology for a quasi-stellar radio source. Signals had been picked
     up from CTA-102 systematically in fluctuating strength that followed
     a regular 100-day pattern. They said that although no other radio
     emission from outer space had the same periodicity, it was too early
     to tell whether the radio signals were artificially made by intelligent
     beings or whether they came from a natural source.
        The Soviet astronomers appealed to their Western counterparts to
     help study CTA-102 to determine whether the signals were artificially

April 15-16: World scientists met in a special conference on the lunar
    surface sponsored by the International Astronomical Union and NASA
     Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md.
        Noting areas of disagreement among scientists, theoretical astro-
     physicist Thomas Gold of Cornel1 Univ. tried to explain why the
     Ranger pictures resolved so little: â€œThe Ranger pictures are like a
     mirror. Everyone sees his own theories reflected in them.â€ Prof.
     Gold saw a moon covered with dust; young craters composed of solid
     rock while older craters had somehow gone soft; and vast sheets of ice
     locked under compacted sediment beneath much of the lunar surface.
        Dr. Harold C. Urey, Nobel prize-winning chemist from the Univ. of
     California, referred to evidence of widespread collapse of the lunar
     surface, probably due to underground movement: â€œThe RANGER IXâ€™S
     pictures scared me more than anything. Thereâ€™s all sorts of evidence
     that some of these craters are sinking.â€

    and Planetary Laboratory. Dr. Kuiper concluded that the lunar sur-
    face had a bearing strength of between one and two tons per square
    foot. His calculations, made from data extracted from RANGER IX
    photographs. was based on the size of rocks ejected from a given impact
    crater and the distance they traveled. Other tentative findings were
    that the dark portions of the maria were due to some unknown fluid
    flows and not lava or ash flows; that the maria were not completely
    covered with lunar dust; and that the moonâ€™s surface exhibited a re-

     Technology: â€œIn the modern laboratory the basic research activity is
     essentially an information-gathering intelligence operation. The opera-
     tives must be trained to speak, and allowed to speak, the language of
     the area on which they are expected to keep informed, and to interact
     with other researchers in the same area. It is this apparently excessive
     freedom of action on the part of employees which makes for the concern
     of students of administration about the management of research, or the
     lack thereof. My conclusion is that most of this problem evaporates
     once it is realized that a director of research directs the research pro-
     gram-but certainly not the individual researchers.
        â€œThe partnership of science, engineering and industry is really a
     rather new concept developed since the turn of the century and only
     now reaching maturity. An even newer concept is the partnership of

    Union, meeting in Washington. The scientists were collecting particles
    by â€œcore samplingâ€-boring through the ice with a thermal drill and
    analyzing particles to determine their origin. Team studying Greenland
    samples-E. L. Fireman, J. Defelice, and C. C. Langway, Jr., of the
    Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the U S . Army-believed
    their dust samples to be nonterrestrial in origin. Team studying
    Antarctic samples-M. B. Giovinetto of the Univ. of Wisconsin and
     R. A. Schmidt of NASA-was not certain of the origin of these particles.
    They reported a high concentration of spherucles in the core samplings;
    the amount of these particles, which closely matched those found in
    volcanic eruptions, made identification of dust origin more difficult.

      including not only NASA, but also DOD, AEC, and activities in this area by
     other agencies. In FY 1957, approximately $150 million was expended
     by the Federal Government on space programs. In FY 1960, the total
     was still below $900 million. In FY 1966, the tenth year of the space
      age, the Presidentâ€™s budget provides for space expenditures of $6.9
     billion.
         â€œWhere does this amount stand in relation to amounts in the admin-
     istrative budget for other programs? It is less than the total amounts
      to be spent in 1966 on national defense; on health, labor, and welfare
     programs; and on interest on the national debt. But it is greater than
     that to be spent for any other function of Government. Space expendi-
      tures of all agencies will be greater in 1966 than those for international
      affairs and finance, for agriculture, for natural resources, for commerce
      and transportation, for housing and community development, for vet-
      erans benefits and services, or for other general Government.
         â€œThe space program has not been, since it was initiated, and is not
      today, a budgetary underdog.
         â€œThe second specific point to be made is that the budget process by
      its very nature is an exercise in priorities. . . . A great many merely
      desirable projects get deferred throughout the Government every year
     under the press of the budgetary process.
         â€œIn the past, this pressure has not been felt as severely in the space
      area as it has in most others because of the emphasis that has been
      given to creating in a hurry a vast capability to operate in space. The
      space program has been very successful in meeting this aim. In fact,
      it has been so successful that space is now coming of age with other
      Government programs. We will soon have a technical capability to do
                                                                         193
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    a great many more space missions than we as a nation will probably
    want to pay for. . . .
        â€œThere is one other point that. as a budget examiner. I feel I must
    mention. Funding and schedule estimates for space programs have
    been historically quite unreliable. Cost estimates have tended not so
    much merely to grow, but to multiply! At the same time, schedules
    have tended to slip, slip, slip.
        â€œThis was an understandable situation while the space program was
    new, but we have had enough experience that there will be considerable
     resistance from now on to escalation in price and radical slips in sched-
     ule of the next generation of space projects. The more detailed plan-
    ning we are doing now, the phased project procurement processes, and
    the experience we have gained in the technology and the techniques of
    Space operations must be expected to show returns in better ability
    to make good cost and schedule estimates in the first place, and then to
    meet the cost and schedule targets that are approved.â€ (Text)

    seen there through telescopes. They also reported that radar observa-
    tions indicated the planet Mercury rotated on its own axis once each
    54 to 64 days, exposing all sides to the sun in a year. Its full day,
    corresponding to a 24-hr. earth cycle, would be about 180 earth days
    long. It was inconclusive whether Mercury rotated in the opposite
     direction from its orbit-a retrograde rotation-r     in the same direc-
     tion as its orbit-a direct rotation.
        Dr. Gold also speculated that Mercury could not have been in its
    present orbit for much longer than 400 million years. Otherwise, he
    postulated, the sun would have held the planet over a long enough
     period of time to force it into a synchronous or 88-day rotation.

     of Venus but broke away or was tugged away to establish its own orbit
     around the sun. (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 4/21/65; Clark, NYT,

        66
           It has been shown that the lack of biological, as well as critical
     environmental, data about Mars can have important ramifications in
                                                                         195

     not only the cost, but possibly even in the feasibility of performing
      early manned missions to Mars. The importance of preliminary
     knowledge about the interaction of possible Martian organisms with
     man and his equipment has been shown to significantly affect surface
     operations, decontamination requirements, and equipment reliability.
     Further, the need for some preliminary data about the nature of
     Martian organisms is necessary in order to intelligently design an
     experimental program for use by the first manned landing expedition.
     The conclusion can therefore be supported that a precursor biological
     mission, such as that represented by the current ABL studies, is manda-
     tory in the early 1970 time period if manned missions are to make
     effective use of the mid-1980 launch opportunities.â€ (Text, AIAA Paper

    for Manned Space Flight, discussed in a speech NASAâ€™s      emphasis on
     manâ€™s part in future planned space experiments: â€œThe role of man in
     space is basic to any discussion of our planned space experiments. . . .
     We have always recognized his inherent characteristics as a sensor,
     manipulator, evaluator and investigator.
        <c
          As a sensor, man adds little to automatic equipment in spac-
     sometimes nothing at all. . . . instruments can measure . . . phe-
     nomena that man cannot perceive at all.
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965
196
        â€œBut instruments are limited by the knowledge we now have on
     earth; they cannot cope with the unexpected or the unknown. Man, on
    the other hand, can operate in any unprogrammed situation and reap
     full benefits of the true objective of manned operations. He can ex-
     plore the unknown.
        â€œThe second function of man in space is manipulation. Gus Grissom
     demonstrated superbly last month that a man can operate the space-
     craft controls for delicate maneuvering. . . .
        â€œIn the conduct of space research also, man as a manipulator can
    probe into his environment. He can make use of motor responses and
     verbal skills to carry out procedures and to assemble, operate and
     repair equipment. . . .
       â€œWith the capacity to evaluate, man achieves a substantial degree
     of self-reliance in controlling what he perceives and how he reacts.
    When a man remembers, analyzes, compares, and induces-using             a
    solid foundation of knowledge--he has improved the degree to which
    meaningful data can be translated into useful knowledge. . . .
       â€œThe most advanced role of man in space is that of an investigator
    who responds creatively to unexpected situations. He is able to
    postulate theories and hypotheses, and to devise and use systematic
     measurements. In this role, the astronaut is a full-fledged scientist.â€

    a maximum as usual.
       The cycle was of vital interest to planners of a manned moon land-
     ing since it had been discovered that some solar eruptions shoot out
     protons at so close to the speed of light they could kill an astronaut.
     While astronauts were on the moon, or inside the Lem, they would
     be poorly protected against such a proton shower. Dr. Herbert
     Friedman, of the Naval Research Laboratory, said during the sym-
     posium they would be comparatively safe if they could return to their
     orbiting command capsule. The goal, therefore, he said, was to learn
     enough about these events so that astronauts could have sufficient warn-

April 25: FAA Administrator Najeeb E. Halaby said that FAAâ€™s sonic boom
     tests over Oklahoma City last year had shown that construction of a
     supersonic airliner prototype was clearly warranted : â€œMy current con-
     clusion is that a supersonic airplane can be designed in terms of con-
     figuration, operating attitudes and flight paths so as to achieve public
     acce~i;ta?ce: the early 1970s.â€™â€™ Halabyâ€™s statement was in conjunction
                 i:
     with release of a three-volume final report on the Oklahoma City ex-
     periment.
        The FAA report, which included preliminary results from boom tests
     at the White Sands Missile Range, concluded that only abnormally
     massive booms would create serious problems. A principal finding in
     the â€œcommunity reactionsâ€ study stated: â€œSubstantial numbers of
     residents reported interference with ordinary living activities and
     annoyance with such interruptions, but the overwhelming majority
     felt they could learn to live with the numbers and kinds of booms
     experienced during the six-month study.â€

  ∞Expansion of the role of the National Science Foundation and expenditure
     by Federal mission-oriented research agencies of more money on basic
     research were two major recommendations of a special panel of the
     National Academy of Sciences to Congress. Recommendations were in
     a report, Basic Research and National Goals, submitted to the House
     Committee on Science and Astronautics.
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965
200
       The panel, headed by Dr. George B. Kistiakowsky of Harvard Univ.,
    former science adviser to the President, was comprised of 15 scientists,
    engineers, and economists. The panel held that the National Science
    Foundation, as the sole agency of Government whose purpose was
    support of science across the board without regard for immediate
    practical gains, should be expanded to serve as a â€œbalance wheelâ€ to
    soften the impact of variable research policies of mission-oriented
    agencies on â€œlittle science.â€ The recommendation that agencies should
    devote greater portions of their budgets to basic research was based
    on the view that in many cases these budgets were becoming stationary
    while the capacity for scientific growth was expanding. The panel
    also recommended that in some cases the Congress should extend the
    mission of the agency to include the pursuit of certain branches of basic
    research.
        Three general opinions were widely held by the panel regarding the
    balance of science support today: first, Federal funds should be
     allocated with some consideration to the geographical-social effects of
    their expenditure: second, biological sciences had been under-supported
    and should receive support to expand them faster than the physical
    sciences; third, there was an impending crisis in the physical sciences
    because mission-oriented agencies, faced with stationary budgets, would
     probably not expand their support of basic physical research as fast as
     capacity to do basic research expanded. (Clark, NYT, 4/26/65, 55;

April 25: Dr. Hideo Itokawa, professor at Tokyo Univ. and deputy director
     of Japanâ€™s Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, was quoted on
     Japanâ€™s role in space activity by Peter Temm in an article in the
     Washington Sunday Star: â€œSpace research i s not a competition. It
     should be a cooperative undertaking among all countries, to explore and
     study the universe.
        â€œBoth America and Russia appear to be chiefly interested in artificial
     satellites and manned space vehicles. I see Japanâ€™s role as filling
     some of the gaps skipped over by these two nations.
        â€˜â€˜I believe it is possible that Russia may be preparing to abandon its
     project of putting a man on the moon in favor of assembling a satellite
     space station; at least, this how I interpret the recent Voskhod flight
     and its emphasis on carrying out tasks outside of the capsule.
        â€œI sincerely hope if this is so, that American space scientists will
     not swerve from their intentions of getting to the moon. There are
     many sides to space research, and the ideal approach is for all nations

April 26: A 37-man study group chaired by Dr. Colin Pittendrigh of
     Princeton Univ. and convened by the Space Science Board of the
     National Academy of Sciences at the request of NASA had reconfirmed
     the Academyâ€™s appeal for exploration of Mars t o receive â€œthe highest
     priority among all objectives in space science-indeed in the space
     program as a wholeâ€ and endorsed NASA plans to use the 1969-73
     favorable Mars window for intensive study of the planet with the
     Voyager spacecraft. In its final report transmitted to NASA Adminis-
     trator Webb, the group said that â€œgiven all evidence presently avail-
                                                                         201

    able, we believe it entirely reasonable that Mars is inhabited with
    living organisms and that life independently originated there,â€ and thus
    that â€œthe biological exploration of Mars is a scientific undertaking of
    the greatest validity and significance.â€
        The panel noted, however, that â€œwhile we are eager to press Martian
    exploration as expeditiously as the technology and other factors permit,
    we insist that our recommendation to proceed is subject to one rigorous
    qualification : that no viable terrestrial microorganisms reach the
    Martian surface until we can make a confident assessment of the
    consequences.â€
        The group made seven basic recommendations: (1) â€œevery oppor-
    tunity for remote observation of Mars by earth-bound or ballon-and
                                                               .
    satellite-borne instruments should be exploitedâ€; ( 2 ) â€œ. . An adequate
    program for Martian exploration cannot be achieved without using
    scientific payloads substantially larger than those currently employed
    in outer unmanned space research program. . . . We see very sub-
    stantial advantages in the use, from the onset, of the new generation of
    large boosters which are expected to become operational toward the
    end of the decadeâ€; (3) since flyby missions â€œyield at best a fleeting
    glimpse of the planetâ€ and carry a relatively small array of instru-
    ments, â€œwe deliberately omit an explicit recommendation in favor of
    any flyby missions additional to those already executed or plannedâ€;
     (4) â€œEvery effort should be made to achieve a large orbiting mission
    by 1971 at the latest. This mission should precede the first lander. . . .
    By â€˜largeâ€™ we mean a scientific payload that would include instru-
    mentation for infrared and television mapping, microwave radiometry
    and bistatic radar, infrared spectromztry, and optical polarimetryâ€;
     ( 5 ) â€œThe first landing mission should be scheduled no later than 1973
    and by 1971 if possibleâ€ and will â€œultimately demand a large landerâ€
    like Ab1 (Automated Biological Lab) ; (6) â€œThe task of designing an
    Ab1 should be initiated immediately as a continuing projectâ€; and
     ( 7 ) to maintain â€œa continuing dialogue among all potential investi-
    gators and the engineers responsible for implementing their scientific
    goals,â€ the Academyâ€™s Space Science Board should have a standing

April 29: At the Spring Meeting of the American Physical Society, Dr.
     Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and
     Applications, attempted to answer the question â€œWhat can the space
     program do for experimental sciences like physicsâ€: â€œ. . . the impact
     that space techniques are having and have already had on geophysics
     . . . is three-fold in character. First, the geophysicist finds in the
     space program powerful tools to use in a new approach to solving old
     problems. Seccndly, the application of space techniques to geophysics
     has already turned up a number of exciting new problems, greatly
     broadening the scope of the discipline. Thirdly, as space probes, and
     eventually men. reach other bodies of the solar system such as the
     moon and planets, the domain of geophysics grows beyond the con-
     fines of a single body of the solar system. Let us consider each of
     these extensions to geophysics a little further.
         â€œ. . . space techniques have provided new tools for studying old
     problems of geophysics. Geodesy, meteorology, upper atmospheric
     physics, ionospheric research, and sun-earth relationships have all
     benefited from the application of space techniques. In the case of
     geodesy, the influence of the earth upon the orbits of various artificial
     satellites has been measured by careful radio. radar, and optical track-
     ing and used to obtain quantitative measures of the various harmonics
     in the expansion of the earthâ€™s gravitational potential. As a con-
     sequence of such measurements it has been found that the earthâ€˜s
     equatorial bulge is some 70 meters greater than one would expect. . . .
     Other departures of the geoid from the figure of hydrostatic equilibrium
     have also been determined from these satellite measurements. . . .
     These measurements in turn have important implications for the
     distribution of matter within the earth, and for the internal strength
     of the earthâ€˜s mantle.â€ (Text)

    important purposes,â€ and these viewpoints are â€œpushed too hard and
     can lead the nation in dangerous directions.â€ The more significant
     criticism on scientific grounds was that ground-based instruments (sup-
    plemented by unmanned probes) can gather data about space, the
     moon and other celestial bodies more effectively than rocket-launched
    exploration. This criticism, he said, â€œmisses the mark completely be-

    the NASA part of it-was       conceived simply as a scientific venture.
     . . .â€ He recalled the words of the National Aeronautics and Space

    compared with those from, say, programs for stepped-up research into
    cancer or for building. giant accelerators that would permit physicists
    to peer more deeply into the recesses of the atomic nucleus. That
    broader consideration may well suggest a less concentrated program

May 3 : Editorializing in Aviation Week and Space Technology, Robert
   Hotz said that during the Eurospace meeting in Philadelphia, Euro-
   pean members had made significant points of interest: â€œEurope needs
   a technically strong, economically beneficial and politically imagina-
   tive space program of its own if it is to remain a powerful economic
    entity and maintain its present standard of general prosperi-
    ty . . . Europe must organize its technical and political resources on
    an over-all European level to be successful in space technolo-
    gy. . . . European industry faces a formidable task in selling the
    economic and political benefits of space technology to its people and
    governments. . . . European industry must develop its own space
    technology and cannot remain technically dependent on the U S . re-
    gardless of how much support this country is willing to
    provide.â€ Hotz concluded that â€œthe fact that the discussions were so
    blunt and realistic proved the value of an organization such as Euro-
    space where these admittedly knotty                problems     can   be
    aired. . . .â€ (Hotz, Av. Wk., 5/3/65, 11)
  Discussions at last weekâ€˜s Eurospace meeting in Philadelphia indicated

    recognize that U.S. cooperation will often simply strengthen the Euro-

    facts in mind, it is obvious that the purchase of U.S. hardware does
    not best fulfill Europeâ€™s aimsâ€™. . . .

    Cutoff apparently resulted from a failure in the probeâ€™s solar panels
    caused by meteoroid impact or solar radiation, he said. Other facts
    about the Soviet space program made public for the first time: (1)
    pressure in Cosmonaut Aleksey Leonovâ€™s spacesuit during his walk in
    space on March 18, was about 5.9 lbs. psi; ( 2 ) Leonov had trouble
    with his vision and in orienting himself while in space, but was
    capable of performing useful work; (3) Soviet scientists have the
    technological know-how to perform orbit-changing spacecraft maneu-
    vers. A thirty-minute movie of Leonovâ€™s walk in space gave closeup

       Discussing investigation of space by the U.S.S.R., Skuridin said
    that from 1962, the problem of going to the moon had been studied
    with the Cosmos series of spacecraft. He said COSMOS 111 and COSMOS
    IV had studied solor plasma, its energy and location in earth areas,
    and during the period April 24 to May 2, 1962, had transmitted to
    earth more than 50 million measurements; 20 million more had been
    stored in a data-storage system. COSMOS XLI had investigated
    charged particles at 40,000 mi. altitude. The Elektron series, he con-
    tinued, had made important measurements of the atmosphere up to an
    altitude of 3,000 km. The ions of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen had
    also been measured.
       Discussing future flights, Skuridin said the Soviet Union would like
    to study Saturn, Pluto, and the sun, but added that a satellite was
    needed that could be launched to far-off planets and the sun and return
    to earth. (UPI, NYT, 5/6/65, 2; Kotulak. Chic. Trib., 5/7/65; M&R,

 USAF Chief of Staff General John P. Mcconnell, speaking at a meeting of
   the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., said: â€œ. . . As airmen,
   all of us in the Air Force look at space with real concern. Will it
   someday become an area of military operation? If SO, what will be
   the US. posture? In military language, what is our readiness? . . .
       â€œSpace exploration is the responsibility of the National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration. . . . The act which created the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration gave NASA broad responsi-
   bilities for meeting many of the broad needs of the nation. It also
   stated that the Department of Defense should be responsible for and
   direct those space activities peculiar to or primarily associated with the
218             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   development of weapon systems, military operations or the defense of
   the United States.
       â€œSO we have both NASA and Air Force assigned specific responsi-
   bilities. We have the basis of a partnership. And a partnership it is
   in carrying out the national program as recommended by the President
   and authorized and funded by Congress. The intent of Congress is
   very clear. The members wanted the broad space capabilities of the
   nation to be built up as rapidly as possible without unnecessary dupli-
   cation of effort or of waste. This we are attempting to do. And
   while I would not ordinarily try to speak for Jim Webb, the NASA
   Administrator, I think I can speak for him today on this subject, in
   saying, that it is a very well understood mutual objective between the
   Air Force and NASA.â€
       Asked his opinion about spending of $20 billion to reach the moon,
    McConnell said: â€œI think it is necessary for us to get everything we
   can out of space. And I think we should get it as rapidly as we can at
    as reasonable cost as we can. But you canâ€™t get it rapidly and at the
   same time cheaply . . . going to the moon is just the end product of
    what we are getting out of it. If we were just going to the moon, I
    wouldnâ€™t think it would be worth 20 billion dollars to go to the
    moon. But I donâ€™t hesitate to say that all of the other things which
    we have to do, the preliminaries, and the things that weâ€™re going to
    learn in the process of achieving that goal is well worth the expendi-
    ture of whatever money is required to attain the knowledge which we
    will attain as a result of this project.â€ (Text)

    NASA had requested $5.26 billion.
       During the debate preceding passage of the bill, Rep. James G .
    Fulton (R-Pa.) said: â€œWe have moved quickly. But we are not in a
   crash program. We are now conducting a reasonable program . . .
   it is a well-planned program.
      â€œIt is impossible to believe that in the fiscal year 1959 only
   $48,354,000 was authorized for space [NASA]. In fiscal year 1960 it
   went up ten times to $485,550,000. It doubled again in fiscal year
   1961 to $915 million.
       â€˜â€˜In fiscal year 1962 it went to $1,361,900,000.
       â€œIn fiscal year 1963, it went to $3,742,162,000 and in fiscal year
    1964 to $5,238,119,400.
       â€œIn fiscal year 1965 it went to $5,193,810,500.
       â€œFor this fiscal year, the committee has recommended $5,183,844,-

       â€˜â€˜I want the House to know we have gone over these programs
    thoroughly. We have made cuts in the committee, and the cuts were
    worthwhile. They are responsible, and they are substantial. They

       Regarding. funds restored to the NASA budget, Rep. Fulton said:
   â€œThe-M-1 engine development, the 260-inch eGgine development, and
   the SNAP-^ development, were ongoing .programs of research that were
   approved by the committee and authorized by the House over the past
   several years. However, for reasons of economy, the Administrator
   cut these three programs entirely from the NASA budget. The commit-
   tee on the other hand, believed that such actions in the long run would
   be extremely wasteful and later result in very high costs when it would
   become necessary to reactivate these programs.
       66
          Consequently, the committee restored $15 million to the M-1pro-
   gram to continue it on a technological development level, $6.2 million
   to the 260-inch solid rocket program to carry it through the test firing
    of two full length rockets, and $6 million to the SNAP-8 continue it
                                                                  to
   at the scheduled level of effort.â€
       Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) discussed changes made by the
    Manned Space Flight Subcommittee: â€œThe total request by NASA for
   manned space flight for fiscal year 1966 is $3,567,052,000. . . . The
   subcommittee is recommending a total reduction of $42,825,000.
       â€œNASA requested $3.249,485,000 for research and development in
   manned space flights. Total reduction in research and development
    amounts to $30 million. All of this reduction comes from the Apollo
   program. It is the view of the subcommittee that in the areas of
   Apollo mission support and engine development that program improve-
    ments could be made. However, the reduction was made in the total
   request to allow NASA io iiiake pxgrarn n!teratims with a hroad man-
   agement latitude of choice without adversely affecting the total
   program. It was recognized by the subcommittee that NASA, prior to
   coming before the committee, had made substantial reductions in their
   total research and development program. A further reduction was
    also made by the Bureau of the Budget. Based on this, the $30 mil-
   lion reduction is considered a maximum amount that could be taken
    without jeopardizing the pace and progress of the Apollo
   program.â€ ( C R , 5/6/65,9291,9296,9301)
Muy 6: Saturn V booster (s-IC stage) was static-fired for the second time
   at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The five F-1 engines were
   ignited in a 15-sec. test during which they generated 7.5 million lbs.

  Recently released photograph of the recoverable capsule of the U.S.S.R.
    Vostok spacecraft revealed that the craft was spherical and that one
    third of it was covered with an unidentified material marked by con-
    centric rings. In a New York Times article, Frederic Appel said that
    the U.S. had rejected a spherical design for U.S. spacecraft because of
     its lack of dynamic stability and because, during reentry, too much
     surface was exposed to hot gases deflected by the heat shield raising
    the internal temperature above allowable limits. Appel speculated that
     the Soviets might have solved the problem with greater heat insulation
     or a more powerful cooling system and that the material marked by
     concentric rings could be the remains of a heat shield that had burned
     away. (Appel, NYT, 5/9/65,14)

  Decision to narrow the choice of type of broadcast satellite it

    18 satellites, orbiting in random positions; the other would have 12
   satellites, orbiting at â€œphasedâ€ or controlled positions. The third ap-

      levels to be reached, according to Gazenko. Comparison of the data
      of the Voskhod flights with other space flights showed fewer cardiovas-

      voice and data transmissions via satellite, all-weather navigational
       â€˜fixesâ€™ for ships at sea, and precise map making by means of satellite
      observations have become almost commonplace events. Space launch-
      ings at frequent intervals are providing a continuous stream of new
      information of value to science and mankind. . . . In total, the var-
       ious agencies of the United States carried out sixty-one successful sat-
      ellite and space probe launchings ; however, because of the occasional
      practice of launching several satellites at a time . . . the total number
      of useful discrete payloads in Earth orbit or escape trajectory was
                       .
       seventy-seven. . .
          â€œIn addition, the United States launched seven large high-altitude
       rocket probes, in the range from 700 to 1100 km., and well over one
       hundred other scientific sounding rockets, most of which reached alti-

   tudes between 110 and 250 km. Twelve hundred twenty-three small
   meteorological rockets, having a payload of about 5 kg. and a maxi-
   mum altitude of about 60 km. were fired on regular schedules by the
   meteorological rocket network and more than one hundred scientifical-
   ly instrumented large balloon flights were made during the period.
       â€œTechnological advances made during this period which will con-
   tribute significantly to the space-research capability of the United
   States include the launching of three SATURN I booster rockets, capable
   of putting about 7500 kg. of useful weight into Earth orbit, one TITAN
   IIIA booster, and successful tests of the CENTAUR liquid hydrogen
   rocket. Electrostatic ion accelerator rocket propulsion devices were
   tested in space during 19@, and more recently a nuclear reactor with
   thermoelectric energy conversion devices successfully began an endur-
   ance run in space which is still continuing. Passive gravity-gradient
   stabilization techniques have been perfected by means of additional
   satellite tests to the point where this technique is ready for useful
   employment in a variety of space applications. The highly directional
   properties of a lasar beam were successfully used in tracking a satel-
   lite. Significant improvements were also made i n sounding rocket,
    high altitude balloon design and in data conversion facili-
   ties.â€ (Text)
       K. Maeda, chief Japanese delegate to the sixth international space
    symposium of COSPAR, told Missiles and Rockets Japan would launch
    its own satellite with its own launch vehicle within the next three
    years. A four-stage, solid-fueled rocket would be used, with the Mu
    rocket as first stage. The satellite, to be used solely for scientific
    research, would weigh between 50-100 kgs. and be sent into a
    500-1,OOO-km. (311-621-mi.) orbit. (M&R, 5/17/65, 9)

    the outer rim of the heat shield; thrust vector of the rockets was
    aligned with the gravity vector of the spacecraft.
        Structural reinforcement of the heat shield area was current solution
    for preventing damage to the spacecraft in a rough water landing. If
    the landing rocket system proved desirable, it would cut several
    hundred pounds from the weight of the Apollo command module in
    addition to providing an improved emergency and landing capability.

   A descriptive report on the three generations of Soviet manned space-
    craft-VOSTOK I through vOSTOK VI, first generation; VOSKHOD I, sec-
    ond generation ; and VOSKHOD 11, third generation-was prepared by
    Space Daily, in collaboration with Soviet space officials and the Novos-
    ti Press Agency: â€œThe Sovietâ€™s first three generations of manned space-
    craft are injected into orbit within a standard cone-cylinder configura-

    nal configuration essentially the same. The major modification . .
    was the internal arrangement providing a capability for two astronauts
    instead of one which included the requirement for an additional hatch.

     allocated money-had been wasted on the abortive B-70 bomber proj-

     of how much of the money spent was wasted arose when McNamara
     was asked whether knowledge from the B-70 work would be valuable
     to other military and civilian projects. McNamara suggested that at
     least 80 per cent of the money had been wasted, Margolis said. Mc-
      Namaraâ€™s general view had been that substantial â€œwasteâ€ of this sort
      was unavoidable in the defense program since it was rarely possible to
     know how valuable a development project would be before large s u m
     had been spent. Margolis added that McNamara suggested minimizing
      such waste by insisting on good evidence of probable value before
      allocating large expenditures and, even then, by limiting spending as
      much as possible until the value of a project was proven. (Margolis,

Week of May 16: A $300,000 telescope produced through gifts of parts and
   money was put on display at the Stamford (Conn.) Museum and
   Nature Center. The 22-in. photo-visual telescope, designed to track
   even man-made satellites, was the result of a project compared to a

May 16: EXPLORER XXIII and PEGASUS I meteoroid technology satellites
   continued to transmit useful information after months of operation in
   the space environment, reported Milton B. Ames, Jr., NASA Director
   of Space Vehicles Research and Technology.
       EXPLORER XXIII, launched by Scout rocket from Wallops Station,
   Va., Nov. 16, 1964, was last of three S-55 series satellites which were
   the first spacecraft orbited specifically to measure meteoroid penetra-
   tions through spacecraft structures. Performance of EXPLORER XXIII
234              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   had been entirely satisfactory, and indications were that it would have
   a useful life of more than a year, Ames said. Orbital parameters
   were: apogee, 615 mi. (990 km.); perigee, 290 mi. (467 km.) ; in-
   clination to the equator, 51.95â€™.
       PEGASUS I, launched Feb. 16, 1965, was first of a series of three
   satellites intended to measure meteoroid penetrations of greater struc-
   tural thicknesses and contained a meteoroid penetration area of almost
   2,300 sq. ft. Ames said that although useful results had been obtained
   with .0015-in.-thick panels, the data obtained with .008-in.-thick and
    .016-in.-thick panels had not been fully satisfactory because of difficul-
   ties in the operation of the detection system. Still, PEGASUS I had
   provided significant information leading to improvement of detection
   systems on the remaining two Pegasus spacecraft. Orbital parameters
    for PEGASUS I were: apogee, 451 mi. (726 km.); perigee, 311 mi.
     (500.7 km.) ; inclination, 31.75â€™. (NASA Release 65-157)
May 16: Editorializing, the Hartford Courant said: â€œ. . . Lunik Vâ€™s pur-
    pose was openly said to be a soft landing on the moon, an experiment
    that might have sent back the first pictures of the moon from the
    actual lunar surface, and information about the physical nature of that
    surface. Possibly the Russians were sure they had the problems of a
    soft landing solved. But just possibly they decided this time to be
    frank and out in the open about the whole business. After all, why be
    scared? Look at all the failures the United States has admitted.
     And right now the Russians have something to console themselves
     with. Itâ€™s called honesty, and its just as good to be distinguished for
     this as it is for technology.â€ (Hartford Courant, 5/16/65)
Muy 17: Britain and France signed an agreement to jointly build two
    supersonic military aircraft for the 1970s: (1) a strike trainer; and
     (2) a pivoting-wing attack plane. The strike trainer, to be based on
    Franceâ€™s twin-engine Breguet 121, would be built by the British Air:
     craft Corp. in cooperation with the SociCt6 des Ateliers dâ€™Aviation
     Louis Breguet. Rolls Royce, Ltd., and Turbomeca, a French engine
     concern, would supply the engines. The variable sweep wing, aircraft
     similar to the American F-111 fighter-bomber, but smaller, would be
     based on the concept of British aircraft designer Dr. Barnes Wallis
     and built by the British Aircraft Corp. and the SociBt6 GCnCrale ACro-
     nautique Marcelle Dassault.
        The agreement committedâ€˜ each country to an initial expenditure of
     $56 million, most of which would be spent on a prototype for the
     strike trainer. (Farnsworth, NYT, 5/18/65, 8 )

   Aviation Week reported: â€œNASA is considering the possibility of launch-
    ing two manned Gemini spacecraft within a few days of each other SO
    that the two would operate concurrently in space for a day or
    two.â€ Noting that the plan was not yet approved, the item speculated
    that such action would probably not take place until late in the Gemini
    program. Since only one Gemini launch stand existed, it was most

May 17: Robert Hotz said in an editorial in Aviation Week and Space
    Technology: â€œWith each passing year it becomes more and more appar-
    ent that the Soviets agreed to the partial nuclear test ban treaty at
    a time most advantageous to them and most disadvantageous to
    us. The Soviets already had tested their nuclear warheads over the
    entire spectrum-from       underwater devices to 50-megaton air bursts
    including live ICBM warheads. The U.S. had not tested any of its
    nuclear warheads in strategic systems and can only theorize about the
    effects that high-altitude nuclear blasts in the 50-megaton-and-up range
    will have on communications and control networks of silo-based ICBMS
    and other strategic systems.
       â€œMr. McNamara has based his defense policy on the belief that he
    will be able to detect any new Soviet weapons development in time to
    develop a U.S. counter-measure before the Russians can become opera-
    tional with their new force. Since several of the new Soviet ICBMS
    and an anti-ICBM shown in recent Red Square parades came as a
    complete surprise to the Western intelligence community, it would ap-
    pear that this assumption by Mr. McNamara is open to serious
    challenge. History may prove that Mr. McNamaraâ€™s view of the time
    span available for the U S . to counter-develop weapons to thwart a
    Soviet challenge is as wrong as his forecasts of the war in
    Vietnam.â€ ( A v . Fk.,   5/17/65,21)
  â€œThe Soviet Union, with its May 9 display of missile and space might,
    has dealt a major blow to the complacency of those persons in the
    United States who consistently have underestimated the competence of
    the Russians in these fields,â€ wrote William J. Coughlin in an editorial
    in Missiles and Rockets. He continued: â€œThe appearance of Soviet
    soiid-iuei missiles olâ€™ a type siiiiilar to &e U.S. Minutem~r!ICEM indi-
    cates that the Soviets finally have overcome the chemical roadblock
    which until now has made possible the U.S. lead in solids. . . .
       â€œIn a film which the Moscow correspondent of the New York Times
    estimated to be at least three years old, the Soviets also displayed
    launching5 from an underground silo. The combination of these
    events suggests the Soviets now are in a position to rapidly close the
     missile gap with the United States to the point where it is of no
    consequence in military calculations. . . .
       â€œIn the film release, the Russians for the first time showed their
     anti-missile missile in action. One sequence was of intercept of an
                ..
            .
    ICBM.
       â€œThe increasing Soviet confidence also is indicated in the space
    field. The Soviets let it be known more than a month in advance that
    their next space spectacular could be expected May 9. . . . The
    launch of LUNIK v obviously was right on schedule. The acknowl-
    edgement after launch but in advance of impact that its goal was a
    lunar soft landing also is a more realistic approach to space develop-
    ments than previously shown.
       â€œThis shift toward a franker attitude is supported by the open ad-
    mission of the Zond 11 Mars probe failure by Soviet scientists attend-
    ing the Space Exploration Symposium in Chicago on May 4  .

       â€œAt the same time, the Russians released more information on the
    Soviet space program at the Chicago meeting than heretofore.
       â€œAll of this points toward greater maturity in both Soviet missile
    programs and Soviet space programs. The competition therefore is
    far keener than many persons in the US.have been willing to admit.
       â€œThe conclusion is clear. The U.S. cannot afford to let down or it
    will be far outdistanced in areas which will continue to be vital in its
    national security and well-being for many, many years.â€ (Coughlin,

  3C-9, a quasar (quasi-stellar radio source) receding from the earth at
     149,000 mps or 80% of the speed of light, had been discovered with

May 19: A 71-ton Little Joe 11 rocket fired from White Sands Missile
   Range, N. Mex., to test the Apollo spacecraft escape system split into
   fragments three miles above ground following a series of excessive
   rolls occurring about 25 sec. after launch. The escape rocket fired
   immediately, however, and carried the 14-ton Apollo boilerplate free of
   the debris; the parachute recovery system operated normally, lowering
   the command module to the ground. Apollo program manager Dr.

       The greatest activity in space 35 yrs. hence would be in earth orbits,
    von Braun felt, and space would provide a â€œtremendous military

       Space stations would be in a variety of orbits and many would be
   manned by scientists and repairmen shuttling back and forth in reusa-
   ble vehicles. Scientists would spend up to six weeks at a time in the
   stations to make their observations. The use of reusable boosters
    would cut the cost of delivering payloads to orbit down to some 10%
    of todayâ€™s costs, von Braun added. ( NSC Newsletter, 5/65,6/65)

   that are just opening up to him: space and the ocean depths. A space
   flier, for example, could be protected from the destructive forces of a
   less-than-soft landing on another planet if he were in a cockpit filled
   with oxygenated liquid that he could also breathe; a free-swimming
   underwater explorer with liquid-filled lungs could go deeper, stay
   longer and ascend faster and more safely than a diver breathing a
   gaseous mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. (Osmundsen, NYT,

  Secrets unearthed by MARINER 11 and just made public were reported
    by Frank Macomber in the San Diego Union: â€œVenus is no lush sea-
    and-swamp world, possibly teeming with primitive life, as some astron-

    surface must be like fuming slag or lava. The surface temperature is
    about 80O0F.-hotter than molten lead.
       â€œThe clouds surrounding Venus are a dense, unbroken pall of hy-
    drocarbon smog, boiling up to at least 60 miles from the planetâ€™s

  General Bernard A. Schriever, AFSC Commander, said in an address to
    the Aviation-Space Writersâ€™ Association Conference in Albuquerque:
    â€œThe Air Force responsibility for our nationâ€™s military developments
     in space is clearly established. This morning I would like to review
242              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1%5

   our current progress in the areas of unmanned space programs,
   boosters and propulsion, and finally, manned space programs. . . .
      â€œIn the late 1950s, a small group of Air Force officers began a
   program to develop a space-based missile detection and warning
   system. To obtain information on the background as observed from
   space and on the signature of ballistic missile rocket motors, the Air
   Force initiated a series of measurement programs. Instrumented air-
   craft were used to obtain data on our missile target, from many
   aspects and in various weather conditions. Concurrently, a spacecraft
   â€˜piggybackâ€˜ program for background measurements was instituted.
   This program has resulted in information of great value and is still
                                .
   collecting valuable data. . .
      â€œThe second area of interest is anti-satellite defense. Last Sep-
   tember, President Johnson announced the existence of operational US.
   anti-satellite defense systems. . . .
      â€œThe third area of interest is the detection of nuclear detonations in
   space. The original effort was formerly known as â€˜Vela Hotel,â€™ and
                                                                .
   has now emerged as the present Vela Satellite Program. . .
      â€œIn 1963 the first pair of Vela Satellites was launched from Cape
   Kennedy; the second launch occurred in 19M. Both launches were
   completely successful, and the four satellites are still functioning. . . .
      â€œThe last area that I would like to consider in unmanned military
   space systems is communication satellites--commonly called COMSAT.
   Our current philosophy of controlled response has placed an additional
   emphasis upon communications between field commanders and the
   highest level of our nation. . . .
      â€œIn summary, space is a new environment of activity. We need to
   exploit it effectively for our own purposes to prevent it from being
   used against us. We are aware of the many problems confronting us
    and do not pretend to have all the solutions. But much has been
   done, and we are building a broad technological base to meet the even
   greater challenges of the future.â€ (Text)
May 20: NASA MARINER IV was 85 million miles from earth and traveling

May 20: AECâ€™S Snap-lOA nuclear reactor, aboard SNAPSHOT satellite,
   launched by USAF into circular polar orbit Apr. 3, automatically shut
    down on May 16 for unknown reasons, AEC announced. Snap-1OA had
   been producing power for its own telemetry; first indications of mal-
   function came when telemetry ceased. Telemetry resumed about 40
   hrs. later, powered by stand-by batteries, and indicated the reactor had
    shut itself down and was no longer producing power.
       The prototype of future auxiliary power systems, planned to operate
    at least 90 days, had been operating successfully although the ion
    engine experiment included in the spacecraft had been shut down when
    it developed electronic noise. The spacecraft containing the defunct
    power system would remain in orbit more than 3,000 yrs.; it would
    take 100 yrs. for the reactorâ€™s radioactive elements to decay to a safe
    level.

        â€œWell, if this is the case, one thing is certain. The Martians forgot
     to take their radios with them. For the past five months, Mariner 4
    has been sending a steady stream of radio chatter back to earth . . . If
     little Mariner 4 can do that, there is no apparent reason why the

May 22: NASAâ€™s     200-lb. Project Fire II spacecraft-similar in shape to an
     Apollo command module-was            launched into a ballistic trajectory
    from ETR by an Atlas D booster that sent it over 500 mi. into space in
    test of reentry heating of spacecraft returning from the moon. Some
    26 min. later, when the ballistic path of the payload turned it toward
    earth, a solid-fueled Antares rocket fired for 30 sec., accelerating the
    payload into the atmosphere at 25,400 mph. As a fireball estimated at
     20,000â€F formed a shock wave in front of the spacecraft, instruments
    in its interior radioed information to tracking stations. Tracking re-
    ports indicated that the heat probe impacted 32 min. after launch in
    the south Atlantic about 5,130 mi. southeast of Cape Kennedy. The
    spacecraft had been dubbed a â€œflying thermometerâ€ because it was to
    radio more than 100,000 temperature readings.
        First Project Fire flight took place from Cape Kennedy April 14,
     1964, and was the fastest controlled in-flight reentry experiment ever

  X-22A vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (V/Stol) was inspect-
    ed by Government and military representatives at the Bell Aerosystems
    plant in Niagara Falls. Its unique characteristic was the ducted fan
    concept of propulsion consisting of four shrouded propellers-two for-
    ward and two on the tips of the 39-ft. wing aft-driven by four T-58
    turbine engines. The four engines, expected to propel the aircraft at a
    cruising speed of 300 mph, were run for about five minutes.
       X-22A was constructed for the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a
    Navy-administered contract for $25 million. First flight test would be

May 26: NASA launched an ionosphere experiment from Wallops Station,
    Va., on a four-stage Javelin (Argo ~ 4 )      sounding rocket. Primary
     objectives of the flight were to measure ion and electron densities and
    temperatures and the ionic composition in the upper atmosphere. A
     malfunction in the launch vehicle caused the 140-lb. payload to reach
     an altitude of only 200 mi. instead of the planned 520 mi. Telemetry
     data were received for about nine minutes. Project officials termed
     the flight a partial success despite the failure to achieve peak
    altitude. (Wallops Release 65-31)

 On the floor of the Senate, Sen. Ralph W. Yarborough (D-Tex.) advo-
    cated that rights to patents from Government-sponsored research
     should belong to the Government: â€œIn this struggle between the public
    interest and those who seek a public subsidy to enrich private coffers,
    the stakes are immense. The Federal Government every year becomes
    more involved in the financing of scientific research. This being the
    case, it is the responsibility of Congress to protect the public purse,
    rather than to construct private pipelines from the Public Treasury to
    private recipients.â€ (CR, 5/26/65)

          We cannot return to the time when the century was young, yet we
    still need the ingenuity and luck of gifted individuals. It is important
    to establish an environment with incentives to bring new ideas for-
    ward.
       â€œI think of the British Admiraltyâ€™s prize for a shipâ€™s chronometer.
   The chronometer appeared, and changed the entire art of navigation.
   Lilienthalâ€™s gliding experiments, the Wrightsâ€™ flights and Sikorskyâ€™s
   helicopter were individual contributions, not in government programs.
       â€œScientists have a favorable climate for their own research provided
    by the Universities and Foundations, with opportunity for publication
    and recognition through the learned societies. Could we not devise a
    plan to bring ideas of individuals before sensitive and wise people who
    would select wheat from chaff and arrange for development testing of
    some of the harvest. We must be patient. I am reminded of Dr.
    Paul Footeâ€™s remark that, for a new chemical, it is usually seven years
    from test tube to tank car.

          What we must avoid is centralized control of the exploration of
    ideas by the people responsible for immediate needs. There is noth-
    ing more discouraging to an engineer than the statement: â€˜We have no
    requirement for what you are thinking of.â€™

   the threats that lie ahead.â€™
       â€œQuantum advances in technology follow availability of scientific

 ComSatCorp may well face competition from foreign satellite com-
   munications systems in the next few years, David Sarnoff, chair-
    man of the Board of Radio Corporation of America predicted at the
    convention banquet of the Armed Forces Communications and Elec-
    tronics Assn. in Washington, D.C.: â€œWe can expect that ultimately
    Russia will set up a satellite communications system competitive to our
    own and offer it to other nations on favorable terms determined more
    by political than economic considerations.â€
       Mr. Sarnoff advocated creation of â€œa single, privately owned Ameri-
    can companyâ€ to handle all international communications currently
    handled by six private carriers. He argued that, among other
    benefits, a single â€œunified carrierâ€ was the only way the U S . could
    â€œdeal on equal terms with foreign government [communications] mo-
   nopolies.
       The RCA chairman warned that in only five years the interim agree-
    ment between ComSatCorp and the 45 participating nations would be
    up for re-evaluation. The US., he said, â€œwill have to negotiate a new
    contract under different circumstances and possibly vastly altered bar-
    gaining conditions.â€
       It was technically feasible, Mr. Sarnoff said, that direct radio/Tv
    broadcasting by satellite could be undertaken by 1975. Three equato-
    rial, synchronous orbit satellites powered by nuclear energy, each
    equipped with a three-Tv-channel capability, would be able, he said, to
    broadcast programs to the entire United States and parts of
    Canada. He estimated that the three satellites, exclusive of ground
    stations, would cost $30 million and compared this with the $50 mil-
    lion annual cost to the three major networks for leasing circuits to
    transmit programs to their affiliated stations or to the $30 million cost
    of a single large city television station. (ITâ€˜S,/, 5/27/65, 6; Wash.

May 26-28: NASA-sponsored Fifth National Conference on the Peaceful
    Uses of Space and St. Louis Bicentennial Space Symposium was held
    in St. Louis with participants from Government, education, industry,
    and the scientific community. (NASA SP-82)
        NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden, delivering the keynote
    address, said: â€œThe rate of growth of space activities in the first six
    years of the space age has been unprecedented in the history of a new
    field of science and technology but there are signs of attainment of a
    certain degree of maturity. The most obvious is the establishment,
    following several years in which available funds nearly doubled each
    year, of a level of five to five and a quarter billions for congressional
    appropriations to NASA, or about seven billions for space activities of
                                        .
    all agencies at the suitable level. . .
        â€œMaturity is also indicated by the drastic reduction in the number
    of unsuccessful missions, the result of increased knowledge and experi-
    ence in the previously unknown field of space. Thus in calendar year
     1958 in the first three months of NASA, four missions were attempted
    without a single success. In the following year eight of fourteen were
    successful, whereas in 1964. twenty-five of thirty more difficult missions
    were successful, a percentage of 83 which has been maintained now for
    three years. . . .â€ (NASA Release 65-83; Text, NASA Release 65-165)
        Answering the query â€œWhat does the future hold in store?â€ NASA
    Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E.
    Mueller told the Symposium about future manned flight options: â€œIn
    near-earth space, missions could include low and high inclination, po-
     lar, or synchronous orbits to accomplish research, technological, and
    applications objectives. . . .
        â€œIn a low inclination orbit, below the Van Allen belts, the basic
    pr~hlems keeping men in space for extended periods can be studied,
                 of
    rendezvous and resupply problems could be worked out, and scientific
    experiments conducted.
        â€œIn synchronous orbit, where the spacecraft hovers over a fixed area
    of the earth all the time, experiments could be carried out which in-
     volve manned observations over a given portion of the earth or which
    use man to assist in the operation of various experimental systems.
        C<
           In polar orbit, scientist-astronauts could monitor and observe the
    entire surface of the earth as it passes beneath the spacecraft, mapping
                                                      .
    it and surveying most of the worldâ€™s resources. . .
                           .
        â€œIn earth orbit . . a medium-size manned orbiting research labo-
    ratory might be developed. Such a space station would accommodate
     six to nine men and remain in orbit for up to five years. . . . Resup-
    ply vehicles, or space shuttles, could be used for crew rotation and for
    delivery of equipment and supplies. The laboratory would provide
    roomy quarters with a shirt-sleeve environment for conducting a wide
    variety of experiments in space. It would also contain a centri-
    fuge, should it be found essential for reconditioning crew members to
    withstand the effects of gravity after periods of weightlessness.
        â€œFollowing this a larger permanent manned orbiting research labo-
    ratory accommodating 20 to 30 men, might then be developed, by
    assembling three or four of the medium-size laboratories in
    space. Artificial gravity could be provided in the laboratories by ro-
    tating them about their axes.

          â€œPossibly the most challenging long-term goal of the entire space
      program is manned exploration of the planets-especially of
      Mars.â€ (Text)
         Comparing the space programs of the US. and the U.S.S.R. Dr.
      Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and
          ace Council, said:
      spc61. number of earth-orbiting payloads the United States has
                In
      launched almost three times as many as has the USSR, although the
      1965 rate is less than two to one.
          â€œ2. In the weight of such payloads, the USSR has put up almost three
      times as much as has the United States.
          â€œ3. In propulsion, the Soviets have from the beginning enjoyed an
      operational advantage over the United States. However, we are cur-
      rently making great strides in this regard and it is hoped that we will
      keep moving up the propulsion ladder so as not to be overtaken again.
          66
             4. In manned space flight, the USSR is ahead of the US., not only in
      hours of flight but also in multi-manned flight and extravehicular ac-
      tivity. So far, the U S . astronauts have completed 40 orbits of the
      earth, the Soviet cosmonauts have completed 342 such orbits. More-
      over, as our Gemini schedule proceeds and contributes continued
      progress, we must look for much more activity on the part of the
       Soviets.
          â€œ5. In the application of space developments to directly useful pur-
      poses, the United States is well ahead, particularly in such fields as
      weather observations, navigation, and communications. However, the
      Soviets have potential capabilities of these types and have already be-
      gun to show some actual experience in space communications.
          â€œ6. In lunar and interplanetary activity, the U S . may have an edge
      with the spectacular success of the Rangers and Mariners. We have
      developed this advantage, even though the Soviets have made a greater
       relative commitment in this regard, both from the view of absolute
      numbers of launches and also in regard to weight of payloads.
          66
             7. Based upon clear knowledge of our own program and upon as-
      sertions by the Soviets about theirs, one can reasonably conclude that
      both countries have manned lunar landing projects under way. It
      would be impossible to state definitely who is ahead in this regard but
      I am hopeful that we will turn out to be.
         â€œ8. As regards the collection of scientific data from space, both
      countries have made impressive strides, resulting in a possible advan-
      tage to the USSR regarding the effects of space environment on human
      beings.
         â€œ9. Both countries are in a position to make many observations
       from space, but both countries have pledged not to orbit weapons of
      mass destruction and have stressed that their programs are dedicated
      to peaceful uses. I can only speak for this country in regard to our
      intent and do state that we will maintain our defenses while pledging
      not to use space for aggressive purposes.â€
         Dr. Welsh warned: â€œLet us not expect our space program to proceed
      indefinitely without some tragedy involving our astronauts.â€ (Text)
         Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Ad-
      vanced Research and Technology, said: â€œIn assessing our growth in
      space capability in terms of three steps from earth to earth orbit, from
                                                                    253
            ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

earth orbit to moon, and from moon to planets, it is important to
recognize that the first two steps rest on essentially the same tech-
nologies. These are technologies which have evolved for decades and
which are familiar: chemical energy conversion, relatively common
engineering materials, measurement and control systems generally con-
sistent with aircraft and ground technology and microwave
communications. However, the third step will demand performance
and efficiency well beyond the first two. An entirely new level of
technology is needed ; nuclear energy conversion, new refractory mate-
rials, accuracy of sensors-improved by orders of magnitude-and
laser communications. There are the underlying requirements of
higher reliability and longer lifetimes than have yet been demon-
strated, together with low specific weight.
   66
      The requirement for improvement in this spectrum of space-re-
lated technologies will drive them well beyond their present level. The
presence of difficult goals can have a profound influence on earth-
bound consumer products through the advancement of common fields
of technology in addition to opening the gateway to deep space. The
NASA program of advanced research and technology embraces most of
these elements at least in their fundamental forms. Without this re-
search the space program would soon wither and die. With it, by the
year 2000, an enormous influence can be exerted on national prestige
and strength.â€ (Text)
   Discussing space projects of the future at the Conference on the
Peaceful Uses of Space, Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of NASA
Marshall Space Flight Center, said: â€œThe reusable vehicle seems to be
the key to development of an economical earth-to-orbit transportation
system. Passenger conveniences must be improved so that scientists,
engineers, technicians, military personnel-and      even politicians and
journalists-can make the trip.
   â€œOne of the methods we have been studying several years combines
the experience gained in the x-15 rocket plane program with present
Saturn know-how, for building a high performance two-stage rocket
â€œplaneâ€-called the Re-Usable Orbital Transport. It appears entirely
practical to develop a vehicle that would not subject passengers to
more than three gâ€™s in ascent or descent.
   â€œIn the orbital transport under study, the first stage would fly mis-
sion paths similar to the X-15, with the second stage, carrying pas-
sengers and cargo, launched from a piggy-back position. The second
stage would fly into and out of orbit, gliding to a power-off landing
 after re-entry in the same manner the X-15 does now as routine proce-
dure.
    â€œIt would offer passengers who are in a hurry transportation over
global ranges with about one-hour flight time. If we can develop a
single or two-stage chemical rocket aerospace vehicle and learn to fly it
over and over before it is worn out, the high-income traveler should
find the operational cost acceptable. But, of course, the thing we must
have is the demand-the traffic, cargo, and passengers to make the
system economical.
    â€œAfter we have tried our wings in the immediate earth environment,
our next major step in exploring and utilizing the solar system is the
moon. And after that, the planets.â€ (Text)

       Dr. Joseph V. Charyk, ComSatCorp president, announced at the
   Space Symposium that the corporation might invite the aerospace in-
   dustry to submit detailed proposals for satellites that would connect
   the television networks to their affiliated stations and would provide
   new facilities for airplane companies to communicate with aircraft in
    flight.
       Dr. Charykâ€™s disclosure was a consequence of the American Broad-

 NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in a statement to Pat Houtz of
    the Huntsville Times: â€œ. . . it is extremely important that both the
    Legislature and the Governor fully understand the importance of the
    George C. Marshall Space Flight Center operation to the success of the
    current United States effort in space and, also, the importance of our
    ability to work in that state in an environment conducive to the most
    effective uti!ization of our ablest scientists, engineers, technicians, and
    industrial contractors.â€ (Text; Huntsville Times, 5/28/65)
  Dr. George Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight, said at a news conference in Cocoa Beach, Fla., that Astronauts
    McDivitt and White would attempt to steer the Gemini 4 spacecraft to
    a rendezvous with the spent second stage of its booster rocket. This
    plan was outlined for the flight: When the Gemini 4 spacecraft separat-
    ed from the second stage six minutes after launching, Maj. James A.
    McDivitt, as command pilot, would fire jet thrusters to hold a tight
    formation with the spent stage, which would trail the astronauts by
    about 300 ft.
       Throughout the first orbit, the astronauts would make a complete
    check of all their systems. At the start of the second orbit they would
256              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   begin preparing for Maj. Whiteâ€™s emergence by unpacking life support
   packs, the maneuvering unit, and the 25-ft. lifeline.
      Sweeping over the Indian Ocean during this orbit, they would begin
   to depressurize the spacecraft cabin and pressurize their spacesuits.
   Over Hawaii, Maj. McDivitt would maneuver the spacecraft to within
   25 ft. of the second stage.
      Maj. White would open his hatch and at a point west of Guaymas,
   Mexico, he would leave the vehicle. That would be about three hours
   after launching.
      Using the hand-gun maneuvering unit, Maj. White would slowly
   rotate toward the second stage, which is 27 ft. long and 10 ft. in dia.
   and would be equipped with two flashing lights. The astronaut would
   carry a 35-mm movie camera to take pictures of the earth, star back-
   ground, the booster, and the spacecraft.
      After 10 min., over Florida, Maj. White would begin returning to
   the spacecraft. The cabin would be repressurized and the suits
   depressurized.
       Then Maj. McDivitt would fire thrusters so that the spacecraft would
    move about 16 mi. away from the booster. During the fifth orbit,
    about three hours later, the Gemini again would be maneuvered so that
   it would approach the second stage high over Africa.
      The craft would close to within 10 ft. this time to determine how
    well they can approach an orbiting craft, sighting on the flashing
   lights. (Transcript; Appel, N Y T , 5/29/65, 1)
May 28: Scientists at NASA Lewis Research Center had successfully operat-
   ed a high-field-strength cryomagnet having a volume many times
    larger than any previously known, NASA announced. The cryogenic
   magnet would provide research facilities for magnetics, solid state

   frequently as feasible. Hours would be 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. to
   9 p.m. (Schedule I ) and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (Schedule 1 1 ) . Channels
   would accept standard TV signals. TV channel rentals must be made
   for at least a 30-min. period. Rent: $2,400 for first 30 rnin., $475 per
   immediately following 15 min. (Schedule I ) ; $3,825 for first 30 min.,
   $710 per immediately following 15 min. (Schedule 1 1 ) . Regular
   channels would be on one-way monochrome. Two-way monochrome
   and one-way color would rent for an additional 50%. Interruptions
   of more than 30 sec. and not the responsibility of the customer would
   be refunded in amounts proportional to the interrupted period. If a
   customer canceled his application for use of a TV channel, he would
   be billed as though he had not and would be required to pay any
   additional charges involved in acquiring temporary use of a voice
   channel if his application had made such acquisition necessary. TV
   channels would be rented on a first-come-first-servebasis.
      Rates covered only transmissions between Andover. Me., and the
   satellite. The arrangement whereby refunds would be made for tem-
   porary TV use of voice channels was necessary because EARLY BIRD
   I cannot handle both kinds of transmissions simultaneously.

May 29: NASA successfully launched EXPLORER XXVIII Interplanetary
    Monitoring Probe (Imp-C) from ETR on a three-stage Thor-Delta
    booster. A slightly longer than planned burn by the third stage en-
    gines placed the 130-lb. probe into an orbit with 164,000 mi. (264,040
    km.) apogee and 120 mi. (193 km.) perigee instead of the scheduled
    orbit of 130,000 mi. (209,300 km.) apogee and 120 mi. (193 km.)
    perigee. Inclination was 34"; period, 5 days, 22 hrs. The spacecraft
    was equipped with devices to report on the earth's magnetic field,
    cosmic rays, and the solar wind throughout its highly elliptical orbit.
      Confused telemetry signals from the EXPLORER XXVIII for 31/2 hrs.
    after launching made it seem the spacecraft had not separated from the
258             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   third stage of the booster; however, later signals indicated that all
    spacecraft systems were operating normally, that separation had oc-
   curred.
       The Imp series began with EXPLORER XVIII (Imp-A) launched
    Nov. 26,1963. (NASA Release 65-164; Wash. Sun. Star, 5/30/65)
May 29: MARINER IV, NASAâ€™s      Mars flyby and photographic probe, reached

  An â€œantirockâ€-a meteorite composed of anti-matter-may have hit the
    earth in 1908, accounting for what was perhaps the most violent explo-
    sion ever observed on earth, said a report in Nature by Dr. Clyde
    Cowan of Catholic Univ. and C. R. Atluri and Dr. Williard F. Libby
    of the Univ. of California. The 1908 explosion, referred to as the
    Tunguska meteorite, took place in the air at a height estimated at
    three miles. Its effects were comparable to those of a nuclear weapon
    with a yield equivalent to that of 30 million tons of TNT.
       The hypothesis had been supported, to some extent, by an analysis
    of tree rings formed during, before, and after the year of the
    explosion. It was calculated that an anti-matter explosion would
    create enough additional atoms of carbon 14 to produce a worldwide
    enrichment of this radioactive substance. In the study, a 300-yr.-old
    Douglas fir from Arizona and an oak tree from near Los Angeles were
    analyzed. Wood was stripped from a number of annual rings from
    1873 to 1933. In both trees, the highest content of carbon 14 was
    from wood formed in 1909, the year after the explosion. Another
    supporting fact was that the blast left no cloud such as that produced
    by an atomic or chemical explosion; a mass of anti-matter, plunged
    into the atmosphere, would be annihilated, leaving no cloud. (Sulli-
    van, NYT, 5/30/65, 1,50)
  NASA Lewis Research Center scientist Charles A. Low, Jr., was co-recip-

    was underway at LRC on use of colloidal particles as propellant in
    various thrustor designs. The system could cut interplanetary flight
    durations by as much as one-half or increase interplanetary payloads
    by substantial amounts. (LRC Release 65-39)
May 30: A modified Convair 990A jet transport-NASAâ€™s new high-altitude
    research laboratory-carried 30 scientists from five countries and a
    million dollars worth of delicate instruments in a race with a total
    eclipse over the South Pacific. Path of the eclipse stretched from the
    northern tip of New Zealand 8,000 mi. east to the coast of Peru. Ex-
    cept for a few small islands, the eclipse was not visible in any heavily
    inhabited parts of the earth.
       Taking off from Hilo, Hawaii, the jet flew at an altitude of 39,500
    ft.; in its 9 min. 42 sec. race with the 1,700 mph eclipse, it reached a
    speed of 587 mph, doubling observation time possible from a ground-
    based station.

260             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

       According to the drawing and the text description, MOLNIYA I had
   an airtight cylindrical body with conical ends, one of which contained
   a rocket engine used to correct the orbit, as well as other solar orienta-
   tion devices.
       Expanding like spokes of a wheel from the cylinder were six long
   panels of solar batteries to supply electrical power to the satellite for
   retransmission of signals received from earth. It was equipped
   with two parabolic antennas, one active, the other in reserve. These
    were pointed toward earth with a high-precision direction finder for
   earthbound transmissions. MOLNIYA I would make two 12-hr. revolu-
   tions around the earth every 24 hrs. One loop would take it over the
    Soviet Union during daytime periods, when it could be of most use for
    transmissions. The other loop would take it over the United

May 31 : All technical problems threatening the scheduled launching of
    Gemini 4 on June 3 had been cleared up, NASA said. One problem
    involved what had been thought to be a malfunction in the water
    management system of the spacecraft which would provide water for
    drinking and cooling. Instead of a leak, technicians found that a
    valve had been left open in error. A second problem, rupture of an
    underseas communications cable 10 mi. south of San Salvador in the
    Bahamas, was sidestepped when USAF rented a commercial cable from
    Puerto Rico to West Palm Beach to replace the severed line. (UPI,

  â€œAlong with the development of a nuclear weapon, Communist
    China has also conducted a program to develop rockets,â€ wrote Cheng
     Chu-yuan in Military Review. He continued: â€œSince early 1956, when
     Peking mapped out the 12-year plan for the development of science
     and technology, jet propulsion has been listed as one of the 12 major
     tasks, exceeded only by the use of nuclear energy. The project is
     under the supervision of the Institute of Mechanics in the CAS.
        â€œIn 1958 several new institutes were set up within the Academy-an
     Institute of Upper Atmosphere Physics in Wuhan; and an Institute of

    students, specialists in aeronautical engineering, have been graduated.
    In 1963 the China Aeronautical Engineering Society was formally
    established, indicating the rapid growth of technical manpower in this
    field.
        â€œSince Communist China has several capable men with long years of
    experience in the rocket field, and since China began her rocket
    project almost in the same period with the nuclear weapons program,
    the development of a rocket booster might soon be anticipated. It is
    quite possible that China may launch her first rocket within the next
    two or three years.â€ (Military Review, 5/65, 10F)
May 31: Aerobee 150A sounding rocket, launched from Wallops Station,
    Va., attained peak altitude of 90.5 mi. (145 km.) . Primary experi-
    mental objective was to measure spectral irradiance of the stars Spica
    and Alkaid in the wavelength interval from 1,100 A to 4,000 A. Instru-
    mentation consisted of an ultraviolet stellar spectrometer with photom-
   eters and optical telescope. Attitude control was obtained with a
    modified Attitude Control System (Acs) , a roll-stabilized gyro plat-
    form, and an optical tracker-the combination known as Strap. The
    Strap system performed correctly. Due to an incorrect gain setting,
    the star-tracker failed to lock-on throughout most of the flight. The
    telescope and spectrometer functioned properly, but obtained no data
    due to the failure to lock-on. Experiment was conducted by CSFC.

  Article in Soviet Life by Academician Anatoli Rlagonravov described
    the â€œthree-directions of modern astronauticsâ€:
       â€œThe first is the study of the earthâ€™s upper atmosphere and the
    portion of space adjoining our planet. . . .
       T h e second is the study and exploration of . . . the moon.
       â€œThe third is the study of solar space, including the nearest planets,
    Mars and Venus.
       â€œSoviet scientists are working in all three directions.
       T h e first to be launched, always, are the automatic scouts, fol-
    lowed by men.
       â€œ. . . The final stage in the solution of the first problem-explora-
    tion of near space-will probably be to set up a permanent manned
    space observatory-town, with bilateral contact maintained through
    rockets. Of course, long before this, reliable systems of meteorolog-
    ical sputniks, worldwide television sputniks, navigation sputniks, etc.,
    will have been established. . . .
       â€œSeveral interesting moves have been taken in the second direction
    [lunar exploration]. . . . The automatic devices have not yet ex-
    plored the moonâ€™s surface in detail, have not yet determined the condi-
    tions prevailing there. Presumably, they will be followed by
    animals. Only after the safe return of the ship to earth has been
    assured will man go to the moon.
       â€œManned landing will be preceded by numerous earth-moon
    flights. In the course of these flights the conditions along the entire
    route will be studied, detailed maps of the lunar surface made, and
    lunar space investigated. Need I add that all these flights will be
    made by teams of scientists only?

    permanent research station on its surface. . .
       â€œIn the third direction-the    exploration of near solar space and
    near planets-only the first steps have been taken, the first flights of
    automatic scouts. . . . The interplanetary routes will be explored
    again and again by automatic stations that will bring back much need-
    ed information on space and the nature of the planets to which they
    are sent. Only then will the first interplanetary expeditions take
    off. They will carry even larger teams than the lunar reconnaissance

During May: Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, President of Cal Tech, discussed objec-
    tives of the space program and what men hoped to learn through the
    space program about the moon, the planets, the sun, interplanetary
    space, and the earth itself. He concluded:
       â€œManâ€™s growing understanding of the nature and constitution of the
    universe had led to new advances in our knowledge of physics and of
    chemistry; and these in turn have led to applications of this knowleJge
    to the development of things which men have found useful. We have
    never been able to predict in advance what the usefulness would be of
    new knowledge about the nature of the physical universe. All we
    know is that, by and large, new knowledge always has proved useful-
    and often it has proved useful in the most unexpected and unforesee-
    able ways. No one would have predicted that Newtonâ€™s enunciation of
    the laws of motion would lead to the age of machinery; that Faradayâ€™s
    experiments would lead to the age of electricity; or that Einsteinâ€™s
    theory of relativity and Bohrâ€™s theory of the atom would lead to the
    atomic bomb and atomic power.
       â€œWe do know one thing: that scientific research which has been
    aimed at purely practical problems though it often has been oi great
    value, has over a long run been of less value in producing wholly new
    things than has the research aimed solely at the extension of
    knowledge. The extension of manâ€™s knowledge is the basic and the
    overriding purpose of the space exploration program.â€ (Text, JPL

                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

June 3-7: NASAâ€™s    GEMINI IV spacecraft was launched at 11:16 a.m. EDT with
    two-stage Titan 11 booster from the Eastern Test Range and began
    the four-day space flight of Astronauts James A. McDivitt (Maj., WAF)
    and Edward H. White, II (Maj., U S A F ) , who would make 62 revolu-
    tions around the earth in 97 hrs. 56 min. Two minutes and 36 sec.
    after liftoff, the first stage of the booster separated. Six minutes later,
    traveling at 17,567 mph, the spacecraft was inserted into an orbit with
    apogee, 174.8 mi. (283.2 km.) ; perigee, 100 mi. (161 km.) ; period,
    94 min. Original plans had been for GEMINI IV to be maneuvered
    within 25 ft. of the burned out second stage of the TITAN 11 booster
    rocket and for White to approach and possibly touch it during his
    extravehicular mission. Three hours into flight, ground stations
    reported that excessive tumbling of the second stage had increased
    atmospheric drag and that it was orbiting 32 mi. ahead of and 5 mi.
    below GEMINI IV. Mission Director Christopher Kraft confirmed Com-
    mand Pilot McDivittâ€™s suggestion to abandon further attempts at ren-
    dezvous because of a potential fuel shortage.
        Whiteâ€™s extravehicular activity, planned for the second orbit, but
    delayed until the third to allow astronauts more preparation time, began
    at 3:45 p.m. EDT. The cabin was depressurized; White, equipped with
    tether carrying oxygen and communication and with chest pack for
    emergency oxygen supply, emerged from the spacecraft just past
    Hawaii. Carrying a modified 35 mm. single-lens reflex camera loaded
    with color film and propelled by a hand-held, oxygen-jet gun, he went
    three times to the full length of his 25-ft. tether and then returned,
    using the gun to halt his motion and prevent his hitting the spaceship.
    When the gas supply in the gun was depleted, he returned to the
                       --n+L + n w n ; n w â€œâ€˜7 the tether line. At one point.

    McDivitt exclaimed : â€œYou smeared my windshield, you dirty dog.â€
        Flight plans had called for a ten-minute walk in space but White
    remained outside the spacecraft for 22 min. He experienced no dis-
    orientation during his â€œwalk.â€ When he finally heeded commands
    to return to the capsule, he had difficulty closing the hatch and decided
    not to reopen it to jettison excess equipment. â€œItâ€™s the saddest moment
    of my life,â€ White said as he reentered the spacecraft.
         On June 5 during the 17th orbit, the astronauts spoke to their wives
    at MSC. During the 20th orbit, McDivitt spotted a satellite with â€œbig
    arms sticking out.â€ He was unable to identify it positively.
         On June 6 during the U t h orbit, trouble developed with the space-
    craftâ€™s computer and attempts to repair it with the aid of ground in-
    structions failed. The malfunctioning computer made it necessary for
    GEMINI IV to reenter on a ballistic trajectory.
        Throughout the flight the daily routine of the astronauts included
    eating, exercise, and performance of medical and scientific experi-
    ments. They alternated rest periods. During 12 of the 62 orbits,
    when GEMINI IV passed through a heavy radiation area called the South
    Atlantic anomaly, Astronauts McDivitt and White switched on radia-
    tion and magnetic field measuring devices to take readings inside
    and outside the spacecraft and near their bodies. They also attempted
    to improve the knowledge of the earthâ€™s terrain through high-quality
     color photographs ; to measure with instruments the electrostatic
266   AE
                                                                           267

     because of the one-second error in the firing of the thrusting rockets
     and one-second delay in the firing of the retrorockets.
        Fifteen minutes after splashdown, Navy frogmen, lowered into the
     water by helicopter, placed a flotation collar around the capsule.
     Before egressing from the spacecraft to be hoisted to helicopter,
     astronauts took biomedical data on themselves. About 40 min. later,
     Majors McDivitt and White were landed by helicopter on the flight
     deck of theâ€™carrier Wasp. They were taken immediately to the shipâ€™s
     sick bay for postflight examinations.
        Dr. Charles Berry, Chief Flight Surgeon for the astronauts, said
     after the examinations: â€œWe have knocked down a n awful lot of straw
     men. We had been told that we would have an unconscious astronaut
     after four days of weightlessness. Well, theyâ€™re not. We were told
     that the astronaut would experience vertigo, disorientation when he
     stepped out of that spaceship. We hit that one over the head.â€ The
     most serious problem was fatigue. â€œBoth men were bushed,â€ said Dr.
     Berry. Maj. McDivitt had a few flecks of caked blood in his nostrils,
     caused by the dryness of the mucous membranes from inhaling pure
     oxygen for so long. X-rays taken of the astronautsâ€™ little fingers and
     heel bones both before and after the flight to determine if long exposure
     to weightlessness would cause a substantial loss of calcium were being
     studied.
        Commenting on the historical significance of the Gemini flight,
     Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of NASAâ€™s         Office of
     Manned Space Flight, said the flight had included â€œat least two world
    firstsâ€: a record length for two-man flights and the first time a pilot
    had maneuvered outside a ship with a propulsion gun, which gave him
     control over his movements.
        American astronauts had flown a total of 259 hrs. 34 min. in space;
     Soviet astronauts had accumuiated 507 hrs. and i6 rnin. (NASA Re-

June 3: In an article suggesting the possibility of catastrophe during the
     Gemini G T - ~  flight, William Hines had said in the Washington Evening
     Star: â€œThe truth is that the only â€˜firstâ€™ the United States has a chance
     to achieve in Gemini 4 is â€˜first casualties in space7-and nobody (in-
     cluding the Russians) seek this dubious record.â€ Commenting on the
     planned â€œrendezvous,â€ he said: â€œ. . . the other and more questionable
     added spectacular on the present mission-is       a risky business of un-
     known proportions . . . There are several purely technical objections
     to this exercise. First, it is not part of the original Gemini 4 mission,
     but an afterthought. Second, the spacecraft was not built for rendez-
     vous. Third, the rocket was never envisioned as a target vehicle and is
     uncontrollable in space. . . .
        â€œBut if tragedy should strike as a result of something that happens
      on the first few orbits of Gemini 4, how will the responsibility be fixed:

    deuterium in the waters of the ocean to helium is the biggest potential
    resource. . . Thereâ€™s just the possibility that Venus may possess an
    atmosphere of hot steam. If this is so, pushing Venus a little farther
    from the sun would cause the whole steam atmosphere to collapse into a
    much cooler ocean. In fact . . . with the energy availabilities I have
    been talking about, conversion of Venus to a pianet iike earth would

  NASA terminated its contract with the Thiokol Chemical Corp., and its
    subcontractor, Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., for de-
    velopment of a 260-in.-dia. solid rocket motor. Reason for the deci-
    sion was the difficulty encountered by the contractors in processing and
    welding special steel required for the rocket case and the time which
    would be required to develop an alternate method.
       During a hydrostatic pressure test April 1 of the first rocket case

    considerably below the normal operating firing pressure with the

lune 6: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National
    Aeronautics and Space Council, told the graduating class of Clark
    University: â€œYour country has wisely although belatedly made a firm
    decision to conduct a vigorous national space program. It is a clear
    responsibility of each of us to learn what he can about that program,
    find out what it means to the country as a whole and to the individuals
    who live here.â€ He continued: â€œAs we attempt to carry out our
    responsibilities in educating the general public about space, there are a
    few concepts which need particular emphasis :
       â€œ1. Education. The space program has been a catalyst, a stimulus
    to education at all levels, with particular attention to science and
    engineering. . . .
                                 .
       â€œ2. National Security. . . How much more secure are we, due to
    improved communications, more accurate navigation, and more com-
    plete weather information? How much is it worth to be better in-
    formed about potential sources of danger? How can we assess the
    advantage of developing competence to detect and offset possible ag-
    gression from space? How important is it to know that we intend to
    keep peace and freedom in space so that all who would go there with
    peaceful intentions are free to do so? I cannot judge the worth of this
    national security. . . .
       (6
          3. Innovations. The space program stimulates the development
    of new materials, new products, new productive processes, and new
    managerial techniques. . . .
       â€œ4. International Status. A substantial difference in influence in
    world affairs evolves from whether a country is in a first position or a
    second position in power. In many respects, a nationâ€™s relative position
    depends on how it stands in advanced technology. Power and influence
    in world affairs depend to a great degree upon the technological
    capability of a nation. . . . The ideal picture is that of a nation strong
    in ideas, in technology, in freedom, in standard of living, and in
    military power to protect the viability of the other prestige ingredients.
    The space program, effectively and imaginatively conducted, con-
    tributes positively to all of those ingredients. Of even greater impor-
    tance is the potential impact the space program can have on world peace
    through substituting competence in space exploration for competence in
    building implements of aggression. . . .
       66
          5. Economics. Combining the best talents in management, in
    engineering, and in science, with the most modern facilities available,
    the net result of the space program is the production of progress. . . .â€

     by the Soviet Union and the United States â€œis a waste of money and
     know-how.â€ The West Berlin press highly praised the U.S. policy
     of reporting the Gemini flight as it was taking place. Swedish news-
     papers refrained from any comment amid a wave of anti-American
     sentiment over Viet Nam and the Dominican Republic. The Hin-

June 14: That antimatter could exist in aggregations of particles, not only
    as isolated subatomic particles, was demonstrated by physicists study-
    ing under AEC funds at Columbia Univ. Nevis Cyclotron Laboratory
    and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Protons placed in Brookhavenâ€™s
    AGS synchrotron were hurled at almost the speed of light and energy
    of 30 billion electron volts at a tar,aet of beryllium; scientists used a
    high-transmission mass analyzer to detect anti-deuterons in the debris
    of collisions between high-energy protons and nuclei of atoms in the
    target. Research report appeared in Physical Review Letters. The
    existence of the antideuteron had been predicted theoretically, but its
    actual production indicated that properties of the nuclear force were
    closely mirrored in the world of antiparticles and that an antiworld
    would be conceivable in terms of contemporary nuclear physics.

 An instrumented experiment package capable of recording lunar phenom-

         The integration of a Russian booster and a n American capsule
   would be a technical impossibility. . . . The only plausible alternative

June 14: A New York Times editorial by Harry Schwartz concerning
    Soviet-American cooperation in space: â€œThe real issues relate to the
                                                                            of
    advantages and disadvantages in the moon race itself-including,
    course, its propaganda aspects.
        â€œThe argument that cooperation will not mean significant savings is
    strongest for the immediate future, but its force weakens rapidly as one
     extends the time horizon of both nationsâ€™ future space efforts. Even
     in the next year or two both countries could gain from a full pooling
     of space technology and knowledge because this would reduce the
     number of Gemini-type flights each would have to engage in. . . .
        â€œMajor cost advantages can certainly be gained by agreement on
     a division of labor between the Soviet Union and the United States, if
     it is accompanied by a decision to send mixed crews on major mis-
     sions. For example, a pooling of information and resources might
     permit one country to focus on the hardware needed for the moon
     trip, while the other concentrated on the equipment needed to send men
     to Mars. . . .
        â€œBut the major savings from real Soviet-American cooperation in
     space might come from another direction entirely. In both countries
     influential voices are urging major military efforts looking to the
     creation of armed national space fleets . . . The time is past due for
     decision between space cooperation, or the extension of a rivalry that
     could cost both Soviet and American peoples dearly-and perhaps not
     solely in terms of vast sums wasted.â€ (Schwartz, NYT, 6/14/65, 31,

opening remarks, Maj. Gen. Don Ostrander, AFOSR Commander, said:
â€œThe purpose of these Cloudcroft meetings is to stimulate ideas-to
act as an intellectual catalyst. . . . We all have a responsibility to try
to understand the complex interrelationships between science and tech-
nology, and between technology and national defense; through under-
standing, to participate in the excitement and urgency of the creative
turmoil which is such an inescapable part of the age in which we live!â€
   Historian A. Hunter Dupree, professor of history at the Univ. of
California (Berkeley) and a consultant to NASA, said that scientists
with a negative attitude regarding the Nationâ€™s manned space flight
activities had a laboratory-limited view of scientific endeavor and had
lost perspective of the contributions made to American and world
science through exploration and survey expeditions in the field. He
pointed out the relationship of the Pacific voyages of Capt. Cook to
Darwinâ€™s later theory of evolution and said: â€œOne can as little predict
the results of space exploration as Captain Cook could have predicted
Darwinâ€™s theory.â€
   According to Dupree, it was the general expansion of knowledge
that would lead to later fruitful developments. But to justify these
developments immediately or to justify exploration i n terms of pre-
dictable developments would be a mistake. (Simons, Vash. Post,

   An artificial frogâ€™s eye which could be sent to the surface of Mars

computer. Samples of Martian soil would be seen by the frogâ€™s eye
through the microscope. When movement was detected, the eye would
inform the computer. which would decide whether a picture of the
moving organism should be taken for relay back to earth. (Simons,

   Theories on biological rhythms were proposed by Colin Pittendrigh
of Princeton Univ. at the AFOSR seminar. He suggested that oscilla-
tions or biological rhythms were serving a fundamental function that
was not yet fully identified and that all organisms undergo oscillations
with a periodicity that matches that of the external world-roughly 24
hrs. Light, even in negligible amounts, could alter these oscillations.
In Pittendrighâ€˜s view, once the true face of biological clocks-time
measuring mechanisms innate in all living organisms-was seen, sci-
ence would have vital clues to how life developed on earth and how
biological rhythms determine what it is all living things do. (Simons,
Wash. Post, 6/22/65, A6)
   Star collisions were suggested by astrophysicist Thomas Gold of
Cornell Univ. as one way that energy now associated with a host of
new objects observed throughout the universe was released. He said
a prime candidate for providing the right kind of environment for star
collisions was elliptical galaxies. In their predeath condition, ellipti-
cal galaxies start to lose stars that comprise the galaxies. Star loss
causes the galaxies to shrink and become denser. The remaining stars
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1%5
282

    rush in and out through the heats of these galaxies at speeds possibly
    as high as 24 million mph-greatly         enhancing the chance for star
    collisions. The effect of collisions at these speeds would be to release
    amounts of energy equivalent to that calculated to be stored in the
    quasi-stellar radio sources. Gold had not observed such star collisions,
    but dense regions on the â€œbrink of destructionâ€ had been detected.
    â€œWe must inspect each in turn,â€ Gold said, adding, â€œmaybe we will
    learn that something totally different is involved, a new type of energy
    source that physics doesnâ€™t know about.â€ (Simons, Wush. Post,

     knowledge of our neighboring space bodies. We have developed a
     capability to produce large launch vehicles, to test them, and to launch
     them successfully. We are producing the space hardware for environ-
     mental testing that will prove out our concepts and engineering for the
     large launch vehicles and spacecraft that will be required to operate
     out to and on the moon and meet all the demands of our other difficult
     undertakings. We have successfully developed space technology for
     improved communications and weather reporting and forecasting sys-
     tems. The Ranger program, completed with Ranger IX, provided
      17,000 closeup pictures of the moon that have not only given us a
     better understanding of its topography but may reveal totally unex-
     pected processes taking place below the surface.. The first two
     manned flights of the Gemini program verified the system for using
     man in space, the capability of the Gemini spacecraft, the capability
     of an astronaut to operate outside of his spacecraft, and the utility of
                                                                       285

     the ground net and mission control, and provided the first tests of
     Some of the equipment designed to accomplish rendezvous and docking.
     They also served as an orbiting space laboratory with several experi-
     ments included on both flights.
        â€œThe second major fact demonstrated by recent space events is that
     the Soviet Union continues to make a major commitment to its aero-
     nautical and space activity. In late 19a, they launched the first
     multi-manned mission with the three-man Voskhod I satellite. So far
     in this calendar year, they have launched 17 Cosmos satellites; in the
     Voskhod 11 flight they achieved the first extravehicular activities of
     man in space; in April they placed in orbit Molniya I, their first active
     communications satellite; in May they launched a Lunik spacecraft to
     the moon with a successful midcourse correction but apparent terminal
     failure; and only a few days ago they launched another Lunik space-
     craft to the moon with an apparent unsuccessful midcourse correction.
     They, too, are expanding upon a sound basis for both manned and un-
     manned activities in space. The growth of their space activity is quite
     apparent. The exhibition in Paris yesterday afternoon of a new very
     large air transport indicates the same kind of emphasis on equipment
     to use the earthâ€™s envelope of air.
        â€œIn aeronautics, it is important to note the increasing tempo of our
     research in not only the aerodynamics, loads and structures, propulsion,
     and operating problems of supersonic flight, but hypersonic flight as
     well. There is a resurgence of interest in airbreathing propulsion in
     the form of advanced turbojet and ramjet engines to meet the require-
     ments of supersonic and hypersonic transports and to make them com-
     petitive with transports operating in the subsonic range. And of
     course, we are also engaged at the other end of the speed spectrum in
     our work with vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. . . .â€
        In response to questioning, Mr. Webb said: â€œA substantial amount
     of time is now being put into aeronautics by our top people. Remem-
     ber, we have to go through the air to get to space. The use of thin
     wall structures and the use of power delivered by engines all come
     out of the same research competence which we have.
           . . . I have been asked once or twice to consider whether NASA
        66


     should take on the management and development of prototypes and
     all other factors relating to the building of a supersonic transport.
        â€œEach time I have pointed out that we spend a large number of our
     dollars through the military services because they have the procure-
     ment capability. They are the only people in the US. Government
    today who know how to let a contract, monitor a contract, and take
    delivery on large airplanes and large numbers of airplanes. We use
    them for that purpose in boosters where they have already developed
    the competence; and in new boosters like SATURN V, w also use their

June 17: Charles W. Mathews, manager of the Gemini program, and Astro-
    nauts James McDivitt (Maj., USAF) and Edward White 11 (Maj., USAF)
    received NASAâ€™s Exceptional Service Award from President Johnson in
    a special White House ceremony. Introducing the President, NASA
    Administrator James E. Webb said: â€œ. . . we . . . should never for-
    get that at the beginning of the space age, in 1957, the challenge of
    this new frontier which was laid down to us was first met by the man
    who is now the President of the United States and who has so gracious-
    ly invited us here today to indicate again his interest in, and the im-
    portance he attaches to, the new systems we have developed for build-
    ing our national competence in space and using the science and tech-
    nologies acquired to work toward a peaceful world and a better world.
        â€œThis great leader of our nation, and of the Free World, is still
    pioneering, this time on an even more difficult frontier where we must
    learn to master the restrained but decisive use of the powers which
    technology gives our nation. Those of us who are responsible for the
    build-up of our new base of technology believe that power, based on
     advanced technology, can provide new means to hold back those ruth-
    less forces which answer not to the need of all men for security, free-
    dom, dignity, and opportunity. The pioneering which President
    Johnson is engaged in today on this new frontier is, if anything, more
    important than his pioneering actions in 1958 to create our national
    program in aeronautics and space.
        â€œSeldom in the history of the world has one man had to play so vital
    a role in developing the tools of modern science and technology and
    then in the development of a national capability to use them to achieve
    cooperation toward a world consistent with our own ideals and those we
    have sought for others as well as ourselves.â€
        Accompanying citations noted â€˜â€˜outstanding contributionsâ€ and
     singled out Major White as â€œthe first man to engage in self-propelled
    extra-vehicular activity.â€ Terming the three â€œthe Christopher Colum-
     buses of the 20th century,â€ Mr. Johnson said their work had nudged
    the world toward greater international cooperation. â€œMen who have
    worked together to reach the stars are not likely to descend together
     into the depths of war and desolation,â€ he said. Later, the recipients
     were guests at a luncheon held by Vice President Humphrey and re-
     ceived accolades in both the House and Senate. A crowd estimated at
                                                                       287

       In the evening, Majors White (USAF) and McDivitt (USAF) narrated
    a 20-min. film of the GEMINI IV flight for the chiefs of foreign diplo-
    matic missions. President Johnson, in a surprise appearance, told the
    astronauts to â€œtake the Presidential plane and travel outside this coun-
    try again.â€ He said: â€œMany people in many lands were thrilled by
    what you have done. I want you to join our delegation in Paris and
    go out among the friendly peoples of the earth to share with them the
    excitement and thrills of your experience.â€
       Astronauts White and McDivitt then returned to the White House
    where provisions had been made for them and their families to re-

    out giving it any propulsion, it will stay with the satellite and simply
    blow it up. For a bomb from a satellite to be directed to a point on
    earth, it must be propelled not only with a lot of rocket power but also
    with exceedingly fine guidance. In principle, this can be done from a
    satellite or from the moon or even from the planet Pluto; but the cost
    and complexity is enormously greater than that of an equally effective
    ICBM buried deep in the earth itself.â€       (Reporter, 6/17/65, 14)
  In what he termed â€œComing of Age in Houston,â€ William Hines wrote in
    the Washington Evening Star of â€œa new, mature outlook on the part
    of NASA.â€ He said: â€œThere was a conscious effort to deglamorize (but
    not depersonalize) the [Gemini 41 astronauts, and to focus attention
    on the mission rather than on celebrities who would subsequently tell
    their stories in Life. The decision not to give the spacecraft a name
    and to use the radio call sign â€˜Gemini 4â€™ was a step in this direction.
       â€œThe determination of NASA to rid itself of what has been called
    the â€˜Hollywood syndromeâ€™ and handle space flights as transcendental
    news events instead of tawdry theatrical productions did not come
    easily, or without prodding from the outside. But once the decision
    had been made not to try any longer to fool all the people all the time,
    a new era in public understanding of space dawned.â€ (Hines, Wash.

June 18: WAF Titan 111-c, launched from the Eastern Test Range, became
    the most powerful rocket known to have been lofted and the first
    liquid-fuel spacecraft to be lifted from its pad with solid-fuel rockets.
    Two 120-in.-dia., 86-ft.-long solid strap-on boosters generated a peak
    thrust of 2.647 million lbs.       sec. after ignition to propel the liquid-
    fuel core vehicle to an altitude of 24 mi. Less than two minutes after
    lift-off, the boosters were jettisoned by firing of 16 small rockets. The
    liquid-fuel engines of the 127-ft., three-stage core vehicle then fired a
    474,000-lb. thrust burst that injected the vehicleâ€™s third stage (tran-
    stage) with 29,285433. lead ballast and instrument payload into an orbit
    with apogee, 116.2 mi. (187 km.) ; perigee, 110.4 mi. (177.7 km.) ;
    period, 88.1 min; inclination to the equator, 32.175â€. This was the
    heaviest payload ever orbited ; insertion velocity was 25,584 fps.
       The solid-fuel motors, made by United Technology Center, were
     formed in 10-ft.-dia. segments stacked inside metal casings. Adding
    two segments to each of the two five-segment boosters used would per-
    mit Titan 111-c to put 32,000 lbs. into orbit. Payload could be in-
     creased to 40,000 lbs, using 13-ft.-dia. segments of another type already
    test-fired by UTC. Liquid stages used nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozene
     50 ( a 50/50 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydra-
     zine) as the oxidizer and fuel; the propellants ignited hypergolically.
    A series of twelve Titan 111-c tests was projected.
                                                                      Saturn I,
       Most powerful rocket previously launched was NASAâ€™s
    which produced 1.5 million lbs. thrust. The most powerful known

June 26: NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced at a press con-
     ference during the 23rd annual Hampton County (S.C.) Watermelon
     Festival that the Gemini V manned space flight would be an eight-day
298             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   mission-the time required to fly to the moon, explore its surface, and
   return to earth. Webb also disclosed that NASA would announce next
   week the selection of six scientist astronauts.
       Speaking at â€œMendel Rivers Dayâ€ ceremony, Webb pointed out that
   Congressman Mendel Rivers, Chairman of the House Armed Services
   Committee, â€œhas steadily supported the Nationâ€™s effort to build
   strength in space.â€ Webb also said: â€œThoughtful students of national
   power and its uses are increasingly aware that Americaâ€™s security as
   well as her leadership of the Free World, depends directly upon our
   progress in mastering and using space.
       â€œThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration cooperates
   closely with the Department of Defense, to ensure that the technological
   progress we make in developing the peaceful uses of space will be drawn
   upon as needed to help keep the peace-in space and on earth.
       â€œAs you can readily understand, the development of military space
   systems follows those basic research fields which provide the scientific
    understanding and technological capability to make such systems
    possible. It is NASAâ€™s   job, as the space research and development
    agency, to provide this basic knowledge and know-how.â€

JWW 26: 20th anniversary of the United Nations celebrated in San Francisco.
    President Lyndon B. Johnson said in an address to the General Assem-
    bly: â€œThe movement of history is glacial. On two decades of experi-
    ence none can presume to speak with certainty of the destiny of manâ€™s
    affairs. But this we do know and this we believe: Futility and failure
    are not the truths of this Organization brought into being here 20
    years ago.
       â€œWhere historically man has moved fitfully from war toward war,
    in these last two decades man has moved steadily away from war as
    either an instrument of national policy or a means of international
    decision. . . .
        â€œThe promise of the future lies in what science, the ever more
    productive industrial machine, the ever more productive, fertile and
     usable lands, the computer, the miracle drug and the man in space
    all spread before us. The promise of the future lies in what the
     religions and the philosophies, the cultures and the wisdoms of 5,000
    years of civilization have finally distilled and confined to us-the
    promise of abundant life and the brotherhood of man.â€ (Text, NYT,

June 29: NASA successfully conducted an Apollo boilerplate pad abort test
    at White Sands Missile Range to check the launch escape system.
    The test simulated an abort from ground level, using the Apollo launch
    escape system for propulsion. This type of abort would be necessary
    in an actual mission if serious trouble developed with the Saturn launch
    vehicle just before or during ignition of the Saturn en,â€˜uines.

    by the iaunch escape rocketâ€™s i55,OOO 1Es. of thrust, tra.:e!ed 5,KE ft.
    above the range. Eleven sec. after ignition was signaled from the
    blockhouse, canards deployed near the top of the escape motor, caus-
    ing the spacecraft to pitch aerodynamically to a blunt-end-forward
    position. Three seconds later, the tower jettison motor ignited, re-
    moving the tower and boost protective cover from the spacecraft. The
    forward (apex) heat shield was jettisoned .4 sec. later to uncover the
    parachute containers. Dual drogue parachutes were deployed by mor-
    tars from the upper deck two seconds after the LES was jettisoned.
    They slowed the spacecraftâ€™s descent, then disreefed to stabilize the
    module in a blunt-end-forward position. When the drogue parachutes
    were jettisoned, three pilot chutes were deployed to extract the three
    main chutes from their containers. The main parachutes were de-
    ployed in reefed condition, then disreefed to lower the spacecraft to
    a gentle landing about one mile from the launch site. The flight se-

June 30: Strongly urging greater emphasis on U S . aeronautics and avia-
    tion than now exists, Sen. A. S. (Mike) Monroney (D-Okla.), Chair-
    man of Senate Aviation Sub-committee, addressed Air Force Associa-
    tion in Dallas, Tex.
        â€œI am afraid some people, and I mean people of high stature and
    great influence, seem bent on relegating aeronautics to a secondary
    position. This I think is a crucial mistake. In aeronautics we stand
    on the threshold of a boundless upsurge which may well dwarf what
    has been achieved by aviation over the past 61 years.
        â€œAlso, the economic productivity of aeronautics makes dollars . . .
     and sense. It means money in the bank, or rather gold in Fort Knox.
    On the other hand, I donâ€™t know of any scheme . . . and I doubt
     that one will emerge within this century . . . for fighting the balance
     of payments deficit in outer space.
         â€œThere simply are no dollars floating around between here and the
     moon. For the time being, outer space commerce just doesnâ€™t seem to
     be in the cards. And as long as this is the situation, I donâ€™t think
     we should banish aeronautics to the back seat . . . or have a NASA
     budget which is better than O percent spacecraft and less than 2 per-
                                     S
     cent aircraft. And this in spite of the fact that NASA and it5 fore-
     runner, NACA, were ostensibly founded to serve aeronautics !
         â€œI am not saying this to downgrade space, but to suggest that we
     strike a balance based on how the national interest and economy are
     served best. . . . This widening disparity between NASAâ€™s      space and
     aeronautical efforts . . . this wall flower treatment of the airplane
     . . . is a reckless gamble, economically, politically and militarily, that
     will come back to haunt us in the future. My criticism, by the way,
     is not directed at the level of competence in that agency but at the lack
      of programming of aeronautical goals and the failure to mobilize this

During June: Interviewed in Data, NASA Associate Administrator for Ad-
    vanced Research and Technology Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff dis-
    cussed basic research in the NASA program:
       â€œThe term basic is employed for two reasons. The basic research
    program involves elements which undergird everything we d o in aero-
    nautics and space. Such areas as materials, fluid physics, electro-
    physics and applied mathematics form a common base for all of our
    work. In addition, most of this program is carried on at a funda-
    mental level, that is, at the atomic and molecular level. If we select,
    for example, the field of materials we can observe that nearly every-
    thing we do in atmospheric and space flight is limited in some way by
    materials. . . .â€
       Asked about the role of industry in NASAâ€™s   advanced research and
    technology program, Dr. Bisplinghoff said:
       â€œAbout 7.5 per cent of the OART research and development budget
    is spent outside the NASA organization. This money goes to university
    and research institutes and to industrial contractors capable of carry-
    ing out the advanced work making up this program.â€ (Data, 6/65,

  Harold B. Finger, Manager of NASA-AEC Space Nuclear Propulsion Office,
    discussed nuclear-rocket technology in Astronautics & Aeronautics:
       â€œThe recent reactor test experience shows that nuclear rockets can
    be made available to furnish thrust at high specific impulse for many
    possible post-Apollo missions. Whatever direction the future space
    program may take-whether toward extensive manned lunar explora-
    tion, unmanned solar-system exploration. or manned planetary ex-
    ploration-the performance advantages of nuclear rockets will be avail-
    able, valuable, and, certainly for the latter mission, necessary.
    Through this program the country will have the options it must have
    in selecting future missions. For the manned planetary missions,
    which they can perform for all planetary opportunities, nuclear rock-
    ets offer such substantial spacecraft weight reductions, and associated
    savings in cost, that no less-efficient form of spacecraft propulsion could
    be seriously considered. . . .â€ ( A M , 6/65, 34-35)

During June: A decade of nuclear-rocket research at Los Alamos Scientific
    Laboratory was described in Astronautics & Aeronautics by Roderick
    W. Spence and Franklin P. Durham, both of LASL. The 10-yr. effort
    reached new levels of attainment in 1964-65, with successful tests of
    the K ~ w ~ - B - and NRX-A2 reactors, and initial strides in the more
                      &
    advanced Phoebus reactor program. â€œThe entire operations of both
    Kiwi-B-4.E and N R X - ~ 2
                             gave very close to the desired results and met
    or exceeded all of the test objectives.
        â€œ. . . the past decade of experience has given us confidence that
    nuclear-rocket engines can be built and that they will prove to give
    good performance with high reliability.â€ ( A&A, 6/65, 42-46)
  W. Y. Jordan, Jr., R. J. Harris, and D. R. Saxon, all of MSFC, said in
    Astronautics & Aeronautics article that clustering of nuclear rocket
    systems up to 10,000 mw. of power had been studied. These studies
    indicated the concept showed sufficient promise to warrant more de-
    tailed design studies, and these studies had been initiated. They
    stated that a â€œmodular nuclear vehicle system concept, which offers a
     flexible multipurpose space-transportation capability, now appears
    possible through development of only one basic propulsion system and
     vehicle stage. . . .â€ (A&A, 6/65, 48-52)
  A. 0. Tischler, Director of Chemical Propulsion, Office of Advanced Re-
     search and Technology, NASA Hq.. said in Astronautics & Aeronautics
     article that the time was rapidly approaching â€œwhen space will no
     longer be something we throw darts into, but rather an environment
     in which working propulsion systems maneuver and transport space-
     craft payloads, eventually bringing them back to Earth for reuse. . . .
         â€œPresent space systems lag the launch vehicles in both development
     status and sophistication. But we can expect considerable performance
     improvement by the use of more-sophisticated space propulsion sys-
     tems. Moreover, ground facilities that simulate the space environ-
     ment are becoming available. With these to examine new concepts in
     depth, we can anticipate greater and more certain progress in space-
     craft propulsion technology in the future. . . .â€ (A&A, 6/65, 60-62)

July 1 : NASA and the Brazilian Space Commission ( C N A E ) signed an agree-
     ment in SGo JosC dos Campos, Brazil, providing for a cooperative
     project for studying hemispheric weather patterns by launching mete-
     orological sounding rockets from Brazil. Project would be part of the
     Inter-American Experimental Meteorological Sounding Rocket Net-
    work (EXAMETNET).
        Under the terms of the agreement, Brazil would transport the rock-

July 1: Gen. William F. McKee (USAF, Ret.) was sworn in as Federal

    opment of a supersonic transport (Sst). Mr. Johnson had approved
     five recommendations of the Presidentâ€™s Advisory Committee on Super-
     sonic Transport: â€œThose five recommendations . . . are: first, the

     FAA Administrator be authorized to enter into contracts with the en-
    gine manufacturers to construct and test over the next 18 months dem-
     onstrator engines to prove the basic features of the engines; and five,
     and finally-and very importantly-that     the Congress be requested to

     appropriation of $140 million.â€
        Ira C. Eaker commented in the Sun Antonio Express: â€œWhen McKee
     succeeds in his SST mission, as I believe he will, any citizen will be
     able to buy a $50 ticket for a flight from Washington to Los Angeles
     in 55 minutes, or purchase for $55 air passage from New York to
     Paris in one hour. Of course, there will be cynics who will ask: â€˜Who
     wants to fly to Paris in an hour?â€™ The answer is: Most of the people
    who want to go to Paris.
        â€œThere is one predictable human trait. People will always go for the
     fastest transport. Not long after man got on a train, he took his
     freight out of the covered wagons and off the oxcarts forever. When
     people took up with automobiles, they soon put their produce, their
    pigs and their poultry on trucks.
        â€œThere is also some algebraic or arithmetic relation between the
     speed of travel and the number of people who travel. About 10 times
     as many people fly the Atlantic now in five hours as crossed when the
    trip took five days. No doubt 10 times more people will cross the
     ocean when they can do it in an hour.â€ (White House Release;

     tary of defense explained his plans for the development of a supersonic
     airplane that would be the fastest of any in the world, making mach
     2.5 to 2.7, or about 1,800 miles per hour. The cost of developing this
     plane will be between 2 and 2.5 billion dollars, and when developed,
     the planes will probably cost 20 to 25 million each.
         â€œ. . . if we succeed in the development of this plane any airline that
     agrees to use them will have to be largely subsidized both for the
     purchase of the plane, which will have a limited life, and likewise for
     its operation. Consequently, I feel towards this project like I do
     about the shot to the moon-a fine advertising scheme, but not worth

July 2: TIROS x meteorological satellite was launched from Eastern Test
      range by a Thrust-Augmented Delta booster into a near-perfect

      perigee, 458 mi. (737 km.) ; period, 100.6 min.; inclination to the
      equator, 81.4â€. The spacecraft at first was spinning too fast for pic-
      ture-taking because of inability to command activation of an automatic
      slowdown device. A more intense ground signal sent during the sec-
      ond orbit activated the device, slowing the satelliteâ€™s spin rate from
      138 rpm to about 13 rpm.
         TIROS x would photograph the hurricane-breeding area between 70â€

   PEGASUS 11 meteoroid detection satellite, orbited May 25 from Ken-

     though the number of penetrations varied slightly from earlier predic-
     tions, â€œthe figures follow closely our statistical computations based on
     results from PEGASUS I and EXPLORERS XVI and XXIII. Continued
     successful operation of PEGASUS 11 will give us a good base for use by
     spacecraft designers in predicting the frequency and size of meteoroids
     which constitute a hazard to space flight.â€ Ames referred to a new
     capacitor fusing arrangement which would enable project engineers to
     disconnect a single malfunctioning capacitor while leaving other capa-
     citors in the same group of panels working. If a malfunction serious
     enough to warrant disconnection of the entire panel group occurred,
     this could be done by ground command. 36 capacitors on PEGASUS 11

     awarded to the University to initiate development and construction of
     the intermediate-size planetary telescope with fused-quartz optical sys-
     tem and coudk spectrograph. The University would assume costs for
     buildings, utilities, and supporting services. (NASA Release 65-220;

     use.â€ The rockets were said t o have the capability for use as armed
     missiles. (Reuters, Wash. Post, 7/2/65)
   Statistics on intercontinental ballistic missiles were given by Robert
      R. Brunn in an article in the Christian Science Monitor: â€œIn the Soviet
      Union 270 to 300 intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMS) are *in
      place. Underground and overseas the United States has more than
      1,300.
         â€œWithin five years the Soviets may have emplaced 500 to 600 of
      these great birds with nuclear warheads. But by then the American
      missile arsenal may have the destructive power of 3,000 1965-type
      ICBMS.â€
        A multiple warhead for the Minuteman had been developed, Brunn
     said, which could triple the effectiveness of this missile : â€œApproaching
     enemy territory, it could separate into three warheads, each with its
     own guidance system. It would be steered to the target and report if
     it was going to miss or hit.â€ (Brunn, CSM, 7/2/65, 9)
July 3: U S . Bureau oi Mines said its scientists and engineers had begun

     NASA. The idea was not to mine the moon and planets for materials
     usable on earth but rather to develop means of exploiting celestial
     bodies for resources explorers could use to build bases or travel
     farther into space. The Bureau said that, because of its nearness, the

July 3 : Dr. N. M. Sissakian of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said in an
     article in Krasnaya Zvezda that the attention of Soviet biomedical re-
     searchers had been increasingly drawn to the complex effects of com-
     binations of spaceflight factors. They were interested in the stability
     of cells and organisms to very low temperatures, and the effect of
     artificial cooling of animals on their ability to withstand oxygen de-
     privation, acceleration, radiation, and other factors. The ability of
     algae and lower animals to survive a vacuum was of interest to
     exobiologists, as was the ability of certain chemical compounds to
     screen out harmful effects of ultraviolet irradiation. As part of the
     continuing effort to simulate conditions existing on other planets and
     study their effects, soil infusoria were found able to adapt to the wide

         Answering the charge that station ownership and operation should

     the operational date of the global system would be needlessly delayed

  Rep. Burt L. Talcott (R-Calif.) inserted in the Congressional Record a
     letter from E. J. Stecker, president of Holex, Inc., and an exhibitor at

     sians made us look like idiots and we cooperated so beautifully that it
     almost looked as though our public relations program was being di-
     rected by the Kremlin. . . .
        â€œI walked through the aircraft park where the Russian and Ameri-
     can exhibits were practically side by side. The Russian aircraft were
     exclusively commercial, the American almost 100 percent military.
     Think of the irony of the situation. . . .
          There was a long line waiting to enter the . . . space exhibit of
        6
        â€˜


     the U.S.S.R. . . . inside was a full scale model of the Vostok space
     capsule and its rocket motor suspended from the ceiling, what ap-
     peared to be an operational Vostok in a glass case and Mr. Gagarin,
     Russiaâ€™s first man in space, who shook my hand . . . and gave me a
     Vostok lapel pin. This was easily the most popular exhibit at the
     show and I would estimate that 70 percent of the attendees had Vostok
     pins and were wearing them. . . .
        â€œThe Russians then flew in their great misshapen 750-passenger
     transport aircraft which really impressed the public. I examined it
     and as a pilot and engineer of many years standing, I feel it economi-
     cally and militarily foolish, but the publicity value w a s tremendous.

        â€œThen there Mas the announcement of the proposed U.S.S.R. SST
     transport which looks like a retouched Concorde. This also hit all of
     the front pages.
        â€œIn short, the Russians stole the show with an obsolete space capsule
     much inferior to our Mercury, an artistâ€™s sketch of a supersonic trans-
     port and an overgrown, awkward monstrosity of an airplane. But
     they could do it because everything they did was aimed at and shown
     to the general public. . . .
         â€œWhen White, McDivitt, and the Vice President finally arrived, it
     was a triumphant tour surrounded by Secret Service, press, public
     relations and photographers and the great mass of the unwashed pub-
     lic including the exhibitors were generally ignored and forgotten. . . .
         â€œThere were a few good points. James Webb, Administrator of the
     NASA, visited the U S . exhibitors. He came unheralded and alone and
      had time to stop and talk for a few minutes without the aid of 50
     photographers. In this, Jim was unique among the U S . officials and
      should be commended. The USAF Thunderbirds and the U S . Navy
      Blue Angels put on fantastic flying exhibitions on Thursday
      evening. But it occurred around 7 : 3 0 p.m. when most of the public
     had departed.
         â€œThe point is this: The Russians appealed to the people; we ignored
      the people and appealed to the press. As a result, the Russians only
      lost the front pages once and that was when we made them through the
      unfortunate crash of our 2-58.â€™, ( C R , 7/6/65, A3555-6)
J d y 6: President Johnsonâ€™s ordering 16 mo. of additional research on the
      supersonic airliner ISst) program was assessed as a calculated risk by
      Robert J. Serling in Washington Post. The President was betting that
      the extra year and a half of development work would produce a plane
      so far superior to the British-French Concorde that the Concordeâ€™s far
      earlier introduction Mould mean little in terms of sales, he said.
         Serling pointed out that while advance orders for a purely paper
      Sst had outnumbered those of the under-construction Concorde by
      more than 2 to 1. the U S . lead Mas built on the airlinesâ€™ belief that
       (1) U.S.â€™s plane Mould be far superior and ( 2 ) it would not come
      along too far behind the Concorde. However, present plans were for
      flight-testing the Concorde in 1966; the Soviet Union had announced
      it would have a supersonic airliner operational even before the Con-
      corde. An inservice U S . Sst was not likely before 1974 or 1975.

    two-day Gemini VI flight.
        Astronauts Frank Borinan (Maj., USAF) and James Love11 (Lcdr.,

    municate with a ground station via laser beam during their 14-day
    mission planned for early 1966. The laser-a beam of intense light-
    can transmit voices or other messages. Ground station at White
    Sands, N. Mex., aiming by radar, would fire the first laser signal at
    Gemini 7 as it passed overhead. The Gemini 7 crew aould attempt to

  The radar set that would guide Gemini astronauts on rendezvous mis-
    sions in space, beginning with the August 19 Gemini v flight, was
    demonstrated by Westinghouse Corp.-working under an $18 million
                  with    NASA--at    Friendship    International    Airport,
    contrart
    Baltimore. Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper (Maj., USAF) and Charles
    Conrad (Lcdr., USN) would carry a self-contained Rendezvous Evalua-
    tion Pod (Rep) into orbit on the back end of their spacecraft. An
    Agena rendezvous radar transponder and flashing beacons would be
    packaged in the Rep along with batteries and antenna. Midway
    through the second revolution, at 2 hrs. 25 min. after liftoff, command
    pilot Cooper would yaw the Gemini 5 spacecraft 90" to the right. Ex-
    plosive charges would eject the Rep from its canister northward at 5
    fps. Gemini 5 would then maneuver away from the Rep to attain a
    position six miles below and 14 mi. behind the Rep. Subsequent
    phase adjustment would place Gemini 5 in a co-elliptical orbit-that is,
    the spacecraft would be at constant altitude below the Rep but reduc-
    ing the trailing distance. since the spacecraft in its lowest orbit would
    be traveling faster than the Rep.
        Range and range-rate data would be displayed to the Gemini 5 crew
    by the rendezvous radar system. The radar system would continuous-
    ly compute distance and angles from the spacecraft to the Pod, and
    calculate the maneuvers necessary to effect rendezvous.
        At five hours and 36 min. after liftoff, if the mission went as
    planned, Gemini 5 should be closing in on the Rep just north of the
    Carnarvon, Australia, tracking station. Gemini 5 would not physical-
    ly dock with Rep; the experiment would simply provide training for

   Tass released a picture of what was described as a working model of an
     orbiting space station. Six hermetically sealed compartments
     branched out from a central stem. The compartments included a con-
     trol desk, a laboratory, a garden, an orientation system, radar section,
     and a heliostation with a system for carrying on conversation with
     incoming spaceships. (Tass, AP, Wash. Post, 7/8/65, D5)
   M. I. Kiselev and E. B. Galitskaya had worked out a method of control-
     ling spaceships by means of solar pressure. They proposed a system
     of reflecting black and white blades which would work like a propeller
     or a â€œsolar rotary mill.â€ By regulating the inclination of the blades,
     one could obtain a torsional moment and change its direction and
     deceleration. Under conditions of weightlessness, the large size of the
     blades needed to provide the required torsional moment did not
     present any difficulties, and the blades would eliminate the need for
      additional energy sources for maneuvering in space. (Kazdkhstans-

   Photos of the rim of the terrestrial globe and of the twilight aur-
     eole taken by VOSTOK VI revealed two turbid layers in the stratosphere,
     Prof. Georgiy Rozenberg was reported in National Zeitung as saying at
      a space physics conference. The two layers contained relatively dense
     water-and-ice-covered particles at heights of 11,500 and 19,500 m.
      (37,950 and 64,350 ft.). Prof. Rozenberg assumed that sulphuric ox-
      ide emitted by volcanoes played an important role in the formation of
     the layers. He concluded that the colored luminescense following ma-
     jor volcanic outbreaks was related to this phenomenon. (National

   Consensus of W. German observers at the International Air Show (June
      11-20), as reported in Der Spiegel, was that the Soviet aircraft were
      obvious copies of Western models, but with inferior workmanship (of-
     ten hand-made details) and instrumentation : the Ilyushin-62 was a
     poor copy of the British vc-lo; the Tupolev-134 was a hybird of the
     French Caravelle and British BAC 111; the Antonov-24B was obviously
      copied from the Dutch â€œFriendshipâ€ and the British â€œHandley Page
      Heraldâ€; the navigational instrument used on the Tu-134 was the
     American World War II Eyeball Mark One; the design model of the

         Army would be responsible for earth communications facilities used
     with the Syncom satellites except for two shipboard terminals owned
     and operated by USN. Army's Strategic Communications Command
     would continue to man and operate all ground terminals.
         SYNCOM 11-launched    by NASA July 26, 1963-would be maintained
     at a position between 60' and 80" east longitude; SYNCOM III-
     launched by NASA Aug. 19, 1964-would be positioned between 170'
     and 174" east longitude. Both satellites were in orbit at 22,300-mi.

July 8: Referring to a French rocket launching site, comparable to Kennedy
    Space Center, that would be operating in French Guiana by 1968,
    Pierre J. Huss said in the Netu York Journal American: â€œFrench ex-

  MSFC Director Dr. Wernher von Eraun, speaking before the Inter-
    national Christian Leadership World Conference in Seattle, said the
    two dominant forces shaping the course of human events in our revolu-
    tionary age were science and religion. And, Dr. von Braun said, â€œit
    is depressing to witness a growing misconception that these two power-
    ful forces are not compatible.â€ On the contrary: science was trying
    to harness the forces of nature around man, while through religion
    man sought to control the forces of nature within.
        Dr. von Braun said science and scientists had been blamed for the
    desperate dilemma today, because science had utterly failed to provide
    a practical answer on how to handle the powerful forces it had
    unleashed. He said the blame for the wrongful use of force could not
    be pinned on science: â€œScience, all by itself, has no moral
    dimension. The same drug that heals when taken in moderation will
    kill when taken in excess. Only when a society accepts and applies a
    scientific advance do we add a moral dimension to it.â€ (Marshall

    being made now.
        Breakthroughs being made in development of more powerful rockets,

July 1 1 : New York Times editorial on July 14 MARINER IV flyby of Mars
     said: â€œOn Wednesday, if all goes well, one of the epoch-making experi-
     ments in the history of science will take place as MARINER IV comes
     within 6,000 miles of Mars and takes pictures for transmission back to
     earth. Not since Galileo first trained his telescope on the moon has
     there been such a prospect for a quantum leap in manâ€™s knowledge of
     a nearby world.
        â€œWhatever the results of the picture-taking experiment, the accom-
     plishments of MARINER IV are already historic. Launched last Nov.
     28, it has traversed a preassigned course for more than seven
     months. During this time it has flown roughly 350,000,000 mi. while
     communicating back to earth new scientific data as well as a steady
     flow of information on its flight and its internal condition. This per-
     formance far exceeds all similar earlier feats.
        â€œFor comparison we may note that MARINER II-iustly         famed for
     its flight past Venus in 1962-needed to fly only three and a half
     months and 180 million miles to reach its objective. And while
     MARINER II sets a record signalling to earth from a distance of 53.9
     million miles away, MARINER IV has recently been transmitting from the

     U.S. News and World Report reviewing the 20th anniversary of the
     exploding of the first atomic device in New Mexico on July 16, 1945,
     said a dozen countries had the potential to â€œjoin the present five-
     member nuclear club.â€ Japan, India, West Germany, Sweden, Italy,
     Canada, and Israel were capable of producing an atomic bomb soon;
     Spain, Brazil, Yugloslavia, Egypt, and Switzerland had the scientific

  Reviewing developments in the TFX aircraft program-now          designated
     F-111, Richard Elliott wrote in Barronâ€™s: â€œSince it was launched in
     1963, the TFX program has cost roughly $900 million. Another $700
     million has been earmarked for it in fiscal 1966. If the Pentagon
     buys as many F-111â€™s as it now plans, the price tag through the early
     1970â€™s will run to at least $8 billion. . . . (Elliott, Barronâ€™s,

July 13: NASA invited scientists to propose, by August 15, the various
     experiments to be included in a continuing Voyager program of ex-
     ploration of the planets. The Mars Voyager program would begin
     with a test flight in 1969 followed by an orbiter-lander flight in 1971
     with other flights following in 1973, 1975, and beyond. The program
     would also include missions now under consideration for flights to
     Venus and other planets. The experiments to be included in the 1971
     mission of the landing capsule would be subject to strict sterilization
     requirements. In following programs, there would be considerable
     latitude in the choice of experiments. (NASA Release 65-230)

  President Johnson, asked during a White House news conference if he
     could give a status report on USAFâ€™S Manned Orbiting Laboratory,
     said: â€œNo, I am not in a position to make a statement on that at this

  JPL Director Dr. William Pickering held up some fuzzy photographs of
      patches of the moon during a JPL press conference and said this was
      the best quality to be expected from the MARINER IV television

     system. The pictures should be better than any ever obtained from
    earth if the system operated as planned, he said. Each of the
     MARINER IV pictures would consist of 200 rows of 200 dots. Each dot
     would be sent as a number ranging from 0 to 63, designating the
     darkness of the dot. Reconstruction of the picture would be done by
     a computer at JPL. Because the first views would scan the planet
     obliquely, it might not be until the third image that one was received
     showing any obvious surface features. This, according to Dr. Picker-
     ing, might mean that no pictures would be displayed publicly until
     July 16. (Sullivan, NYT, 7/15/65, 1)
July 13: Rains forced Princeton Univ. scientists to postpone launching from

   ComSatCorp had filed applications with FCC for construction of two new
     earth stations and related facilities, and expansion of a third existing

  The rash of reports on strange visitations to earth received comment
      from Walter Sullivan in the New York Times: â€œWhether or not [flying
      saucer enthusiasts] are aware of it, this is the time when space probes
      would be arriving from Mars, if inhabitants of.that planet were en-
      gaged in a similar effort [to the MARINER IV Mars flyby]. The earth

     counter equipment. Obeling the command 12 min. later-the time it
     took the signal to reach the spacecraft across 134,000,000 mi.-
     MARINER IVâ€™S scan platform with TV cameras and two Mars sensors
     began searching for the planet; the tape recorder began a 10-hr. warm-
     UP.
         By 1 : l O p.m., the spacecraftâ€™s sensors had found the proper angle
     from nhich to photograph Mars. On orders from JPL, the Johannes-
     burg tracking station ordered the camera and its light sensor to stop
     the scan at 7/10 of a degree of the optimum aiming point.
         Throughout the day, the spacecraft continued transmitting scientific
      and engineering information via the telemetry system.
         At 7:50 p.m., the Mars probe made its first â€œsightingâ€ contact with
     the planet. The telemetry system then shifted and began sending only
     information from the scientific experiments.
         At 8:20 p.m. EDT, the first light from Mars struck the light sensor
      aligned with the camera and the 25-min. picture-taking sequence be-
      gan. 21 frames were exposed and recorded on magnetic tape to be
      telemetered to earth over a 10-day period. Transmission of each pic-
      ture would require 8 hrs. 25 min.
         Near the end of the fly-by. signals received at Goldstone tracking
      station had indicated a malfunction in the tape system. Telemetry
      received after the pass, ho\z ever, showed no indication that trouble had
      occurred.
         At 10:12, MARINER IV flew behind Mars, remained obscured for 53
      min., and re-emerged beyond the planet, its transmitter beaming radio
      signals thrcugh the Martian atmosphere. From this occultation ex-
      periment, scientists might be able to gauge the depth, thickness, and
      component gases of Marsâ€™ atmosphere by measuring how much these
      signals wâ€™ere bent and their speeds changed.
         Dr. William H. Pickering, J P L Director, told a news conference that
      signals indicated all instruments on the spacecraft had performed prop-

f d y 14: A 44-day test of NAS4 Goddard Space Flight Centerâ€™s Space Envir-
      onment Simulator (Ses) had just ended, GSFC announced. In this
      project, the early performance of a scientific spacecraft in orbit around
      the earth was compared to the performance of a sister craft â€œorbitedâ€
      inside the Ses : the UK-D scientific spacecraft-backup model for ARIEL
                    launched successfully into earth orbit by U.K. March 27,

      1964-was â€œflownâ€ inside the Ses; flight plan for UK-D followed gener-
      al flight plan of initial flight days of ARIEL 11.
         Preliminary data indicated operation of the Ses was good through-
      out the test period. The spacecraft inside the simulator even experi-
      enced the same minor malfunction its sister spacecraft had experienced
      in orbit. (GSFC Release G17-65)
   Speaking before the Senate Commerce Committee in support of his bill
      calling for a three-year feasibility study of this countryâ€™s adopting the
      metric system, Sen. Claiborne Pel1 (D-R.I.) said: â€œShould Canada

  Commenting on the U S . need for a Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol),
     Lt. Gen. Ira C. Eaker (USAF, Ret.) said i n the Sun Antonio Express:
     â€œThe nearly simultaneous launch of NASAâ€™s       Gemini and Air Forceâ€™s
    Titan III-c caused some commentators to suggest that there is compe-
     tition and rivairy in the space effort. investigation convinces me that
     there is complete collaboration and accord between NASA and the mili-
     tary in the space program.
        â€œThere is now little reason to doubt that NASA will succeed with
     Apollo, the Moon mission. Our continued leadership in the explora-
     tion of the peaceful uses of space seems assured.
        â€œIt is now time to survey where we stand in the military implica-
     tions and dangers from space. . . .
        â€œThe first step in a needed military space program, which the Air
     Force earnestly and urgently proposes. is a manned orbiting laborato-
     ry ( M O L ) . It is visualized as an experimental space station in low
     orbit to determine what man can profitably do in space.
        â€œThe anti-MOL advocates have suggested that the fall-out from the
     NASA space program will provide all the building blocks to produce
     military space vehicles quickly when the need is more clearly
     evident. Fall-out from the automobile industry did not provide the
     Patton tank. It was necessary to cut and try, build and test many
     experimental tanks over a period of 25 years.
        â€œBuilding blocks from civil air transports did not produce the B-52
     bomber. We had to build and test 51 earlier bomber models. Effec-
    tive space weapons will never come solely from the fall-out from the
    NASA program.

               is said to be held up until the Air Force can precisely define
       â€œMOL
     and defend a military mission which MOL can be certain to
     accomplish. To require anyone to visualize and indicate definitely
     and in detail now, all that man may ultimately do in space, would be
     like having asked the Wright brothers in 1910 to lay down the
     specifications for a supersonic transport.â€ (Eaker, Sun Antonio Ex-

July 15: The first close-up picture of Mars transmitted by NASAâ€™s     MARINER
     IV in an eight-hour broadcast over a distance of 134 million mi. clear-
     ly showed the edge of the planet. Transmitted to earth as a series of
     5 million radio signals representing zeroes and ones, the picture was
     received at the Madrid and Johannesburg tracking stations and relayed
     to JPL. A JPL computer reconstructed the digits to produce images
     consisting of a series of dots of varying darkness. With transmission
     at 8.3 dots a second, 8% hrs. were required to receive the photograph.
        The photo sequence began when the bright edge, or limb, of Mars
     was seen by a light sensor which triggered MARINER 19s magnetic
     tape recorder. Initial information came from an experimental device
     called a â€œclugeâ€ which built up a rough pattern of the photo on a
     monitor screen as it was relayed from the tracking stations to
             Taken at a low angle with an oblique view, the first photograph
     JL
      P.
     did not show the detail expected in later photographs.
        At a news conference at JPL, Dr. J. A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa,
     said that during its Mars flyby, MARINER IV had discovered with a
     variety of detectors that Mars had little or no magnetic field and,
     therefore, no radiation belts. This would indicate that the planet
     lacks a liquid core and thus differs basically from earth. Lack of a
     metallic core, liquid or solid, would be evidence that the planet never
     went through the churning internal processes that gave the earth its
     layered structure. Mars would not have continents formed of light-
     weight rocks and ocean basins underlain with basaltic rock as found
     on earth.
        W. M. Alexander, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, expIained that
     there was no evidence of a belt or unusual concentration of cosmic
     dust around the planet, nor, pointed out Dr. H. S. Bridge, MIT, was
     there any evidence of a shock wave caused by solar wind flowing
     across the planet. The solar wind was the steady outflow of thin, hot,
     high-velocity gas from the sun.
         Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of JPL, when questioned by
     newsmen on the possibility of higher life existing on Mars, pointed out
     that the absence of a magnetic field indicated the planetâ€™s atmosphere
     was hit with all types of radiation and the existence of life would de-
     pend on how deep the atmosphere was and the extent of radiation that
     reached the surface. Asked if he were discouraged about the possibil-
     ity of finding life on the planet, Dr. Pickering replied: â€œNO, I have
     always felt we will find some sort of life on Mars.â€
         Dr. Pickering pointed out that one explanation for the reddish hue
      of Mars might be the presence of limonite, an iron oxide. This would
     suggest that iron was uniformly spread through the planet rather than
      being largely concentrated in the core, as on earth. (Transcript; Sul-

  Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, NASA, said
     in an address at the First World Exhibition of Transport and Com-
     munications in Munich: â€œIt is my personal opinion, shared by some
     colleagues, that space flight will logically follow the pattern of histori-
     cal development which has characterized the transportation industry.
     That is, the exploitation of the system is an outgrowth of its invention.
         â€œThis pattern is vividly demonstrated by the popular American leg-
     end that Henry Ford invented the automobile, when in fact the auto-
     mobile is not really an American invention at all. For one thing, it
     was not invented by any one man, but by a host of inventors-most of
     them Europeans.
         â€œHowever, Henry Ford did initiate the exploitation of this invention
     as a means of transportation for almost every family in America.
     Ford was a man of great inventive genius who strove to mass produce
     a highly reliable automobile at low unit cost. So Ford took advantage
     of this once-novel invention, the automobile, by developing to a high
     degree the arts of mass production with interchangeable parts, line
     assembiy, and finaiiy conveyor assembiy; and thus he ushered in a
     new age of public transportation,
         â€œThe automobile also serves as an excellent example that even the
      farsighted and visionary inventor often cannot visualize the ultimate
      utilization of his invention by the public, For the modern automobile
     is a combination of many inventions-the wheel, the pneumatic tire
     which in turn depended upon the discovery of vulcanized rubber, the
      internal combustion engine and gasoline--to name a few. To illus-
      trate an extreme case, I seriously doubt if the inventor of the wheel
      could visualize its use in such a supernatural machine as the
      automobile! In the more recent past, Benjamin Silliman, Jr., a bril-
      liant American petrochemist of the late-nineteenth century, considered
      gasoline a useless and dangerous byproduct of his process for refining
      lamp kerosene.
         â€œThe thing to remember is that the automotive industry did not
      spring from public demand. It came about because there were inven-
      tors who braved ridicule and worse and because others were quick to
      seize upon their creations. There was no expressed requirement for
      the airplane, nor for the trans-Atlantic air travel opened up by Charles
      Lindbergh. The novel products of inventive minds become the every-
     day products of our society. The full impact of these products is
      unpredictable at the time of their invention.

      â€œThe American scientist, Robert Goddard, who created the first liq-
   uid-fueled rockets in the United States, remarked that â€˜Every vision is
   a joke until the first man accomplishes it.â€™
      â€œThe men who dreamed up and worked out methods of efficient
   transportation unwittingly opened up broad new vistas, and touched
   off the growth of tremendous production and service industries. They
   showed the way to expedite the movement of people and goods, and
   they also accelerated the exchange of ideas and customs and thus pro-
   moted understanding and cooperation.
      â€œRobert Goddard in America, like Hermann Oberth in Europe, were
   scorned and laughed at in their time. But while we are meeting here,
   men are preparing more journeys into the limitless areas beyond
   Earthâ€˜s atmosphere, working with much the same theories and tech-
   niques proposed by Oberth and Goddard.â€ (Text)
Jdy 15: â€œOne absolute certainty is that if the atomic bomb had not gone
   off at Alamogordo 20 years ago tomorrow, the spacecraft Mariner 4
   would not have flown past Mars yesterday,â€ wrote William Hines in
   the Washington Evening Star. He continued: â€œSpace and the atom
   are more closely interrelated than most people realize. We are in a
   space race today because-and only because-big rockets were devel-
   oped by the East and West starting about 15 years ago. . . . Solely
   to carry atomic (and later hydrogen) warheads. There would have
   been no space race without big rockets because the staggering develop-
   ment costs for space applications alone could never have been justified.
      â€œThe â€˜aerospace businessâ€™ of the non-atomic â€™~Oâ€™S, then, would have
   been â€˜airplane businessâ€™ pure and simple-and          airplanes would be
   much different than they are today. There would be no â€˜atomic en-
   ergy industry,â€™ of course-and       these two differences would have a
   measurable economic impact. Probably a million jobs nationwide de-
   pend either directly or indirectly on space and the atom.
      â€œEqually obviously, two vast bureaucracies dedicated to â€˜runningâ€™
   space and the atom would not exist. The Atomic Energy Commission
   has about 7,300 employes and the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration about 33,000. Together they â€˜ownâ€™ something like $18
   billion worth of property.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 7/15/65)
  A contract for about $60 million would be signed by NASA Goddard
   Space Flight Center with Republic Aviation Corp. for Phase 11 devel-

   type; work would also include final development and design, checkout,
   experiment integration, and launch support services. The Phase I

   The successful use in modern surgery of plasma probes developed for the
     U.S. program by High Temperature Instruments Corp. under contract
     to NASA Lewis Research Center was reported by Dr. Walter T. Olson,
     Assistant Director for Public Affairs at LRC. The temperature-sensing

      treating Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, a malady involving control centers in the
     brain. The surgical probe, through which low-temperature liquid ni-
     trogen flows, is used to destroy parts of the brain by freezing without
      affecting adjacent tissue. It also permits the neurosurgeon to probe at
      an intermediate temperature ; once located, the selected brain tissues

     Daily: â€œI do not doubt that with good fortune, the trip [to the moon]
     will be made during this decade, which to me means during the
     1960â€™s. Replying to a question about the future use of solid fuel
     rockets, Dr. Welsh said: â€œI certainly see n o reason to doubt that the
     use of solids will continue to increase. Without attempting to predict
     specific dates or missions, I believe large solid motor technology will
     be a very valuable element in our growing national space
     competence. . . .â€ On post-Apollo missions: â€œ. . . Under present
     circumstances, it would seem that our program will include extended
     exploration of the moon after the first trip, provided conditions are
     found to be favorable to such exploration. Also, we should be expect-
     ed to develop a growing capability in earth-orbiting space stations and
     make an increasing effort in planetary exploration. I do not rate
     these major objectives one against the other because I believe the
     national space program will in time include all three of the broad
     missions I have mentioned.â€ Dr. Welsh said that he hoped the US.
     would be able to â€œmaintain space expenditures at a figure above 1
     percent of our Gross National Product.â€ ( M / S Daily, 7/26/65)

  20th anniversary of the first atomic device, at Los Alamos, N. Mex., the
     beginning of the so-called â€œatomic age.â€ Since then, atomic devices
     had been exploded by the U.S.S.R. beginning in 1949, Britain in 1952,
     France in 1960, and Red China in 1964. Thermonuclear devices had
     been demonstrated by the U S . in 1952, U.S.S.R. in 1953, and Britain
     in 1957. Now Federal spending for the peaceful uses of atomic en-
     ergy had drawn abreast of spending for nuclear weapons for the first
     time since the first atomic bomb. Commenting on this fact, Evert
     Clark wrote in the New York Times: â€œEven in the Atomic Energy
    Commission there is little tendency to view this as a triumph for peace
     over preparations for the possibility of war.
        â€œIt is rather that military needs have been largely taken care of, SO
    that they demand less money.â€ (EPH; Clark, NYT, 7/17/65,6)
  A commercial model of the military C - - 5 ~ subsonic jet was being consid-
    ered by Pan American World Airways to provide cheap air transpor-

    230 ft. or more from nose to tail, weigh over 700,000 Ibs., and carry a
    payload of over 250,000 lbs.; four jet engines would propel it at 550
    mph. The passenger version would hold between 700 and 1,000
    people. The jet bus could cut cargo rates 50% or more and cut fares
    20 to 25%. Problems would arise, however, in that present airport
    runways might not be able to sustain the great weight and new proce-
    dures would have to be developed to handle the increased
    traffic. (Cooke, V S J , 7/16/65,1,8)

July 17: Two more MARINER IV close-up shots of Mars were released by
             The first three photographs showed an almost unbroken strip
     NASA.
     of terrain more than 600 mi. long. They revealed features down to
     two miles in length, including several crater-like objects, a kidney-
     shaped depression 20-30 mi. in width, and ridges and depressions
     similar to those on the moon. None of them showed straight-line
     features that might have been taken by earth-based observers to be
     canals. Except for the suggestion of an arid, wind-swept, desert-like
     terrain, the pictures did not bear directly on the question of life on the
     planet.
        During a press conference held at JPL, Dr. William H. Pickering,

July 18: MARINER IVâ€™S experimental solar-vane aiming system was expected
     to operate successfully for three and one half years in space, wrote
     Walter Sullivan in the New York Times. The vanes should keep the
     spacecraft aimed at the sun whose light shining on the vehicleâ€™s four-
     wing solar panels would generate electric power. Acting on pressure
     of sunlight and the high-velocity solar wind, the vanes would correct
     tendencies to drift off course.
        The basic attitude control system of MARINER IV consisted of 12
     jets, at the tips of the solar panels, which squirted cold compressed
     nitrogen. The purpose of the solar vanes was to conserve the nitrogen
     and thereby prolong the vehicleâ€™s serviceable lifetime. (Sullivan,
     NYT, 7/19/65,31)
  Editorial comment on the successful transmission to earth of pictures of
     Mars taken by MARINER IV: â€œThere is something absolutely staggering
     about the idea of a piece of machinery from this countryâ€™s workshops
     finding its way to Mars and then pausing on schedule to make picture
     signals which bounce back here 12 minutes later.
        â€œSuch a feat cheers up the most confirmed pessimist. After all, if
     man has the genius to reach back and forth into the universe, surely
     he will discover a way for peoples, nations and ideologies to live and
     survive together back here on this insignificant little planet.â€ ( Wush.
     Post, 7/18/65)
        â€œThough all its findings are not yet in, it is already clear that Mar-
     iner 4â€™s historic journey to Mars is the most successful and most im-
     portant experiment man has yet conducted in space, as well as one of
     the most brilliant engineering and scientific achievements of all time.
        â€œThe triumph scored by MARINER 4 in this first successful attempt at
     the exploration of Mars emphasizes a point suggested by the earlier
     achievements of instrumented probes, notably the Ranger photographic
     voyages to the moon. That point is that a great deal of scientific
     information about earthâ€™s nearest neighbors in the solar system can be
     obtained relatively cheaply and without risk to human life by utilizing
     fully the potentialities of existing instruments. Cameras and other
     research devices can undoubtedly be placed in orbit about or landed
     softly on the surfaces of the moon and nearby planets. And intensive
     exploitation of the capabilities of unmanned rockets can make far safer
     the ultimate dispatch of man into far distant space.â€ ( N Y T ,

  â€œSoviet propaganda needs in the wake of Mariner 4â€™s flight to Mars

     rockets-one putting five small satellites into orbit and the second
      orbiting the heaviest man-made object yet put into space-seems         to
     Western observers to be a transparent Soviet effort to counteract the

      propaganda defeat Moscow suffered as a result of Mariner 4â€™s historic

J d y 18: Observers in Moscow believed that the Soviet Union would shortly
      launch a gigantic spacecraft with as many as four to six people
      aboard, said an article in Polandâ€™s Trybura Ludu. The spacecraft

      orbit by the booster which launched PROTON I. The latter, according
      to the correspondent, probably used solid fuel. The correspondent
      speculated that the spacecraft would remain in orbit one week and that

   that during the flight the astronauts would try to sight a USN Polaris
   missile to be launched from the East Coast and an unidentified missile
   to be launched from the West Coast. It was not disclosed at what
   point during the mission either of the launches would occur. In addi-

        Also on the program would be an attempt to rendezvous with a
    Rendezvous Evaluation Pod (Rep) which would be ejected from the
    spacecraft and would drift to a distance of about 60 mi. from the
    spacecraft. The radar equipment onboard would then assist in per-
    forming maneuvers to achieve rendezvous with the Pod, although actu-
    al contact was not planned. Cooper said that backup system for
     reentry would not be used again because the thrust fuel would be used
    in the rendezvous experiment. No extravehicular activity would be
    performed during this mission.

     giving to the discipline a perspective it could never achieve as long as
     geophysics was confined to a single body of the solar system.
        â€œSimilarly, the space program is giving a new dimension to
     astronomy. The ability to observe above the filtering distorting at-

        (6
           It is, indeed, interesting to observe that one of the impacts of space
     efforts on physics, geophysics, and astronomy has been to draw the
     three disciplines together more closely than they have been drawn to-

July 25: â€œShould the MOL blueprint as envisioned by the Air Forceâ€™s Sys-

     station as a new technique for charting ship movements on all the
     oceans of the world,â€ wrote Frank Macomber in the Sun Diego
     Union. Macomber envisioned â€œtwo Navy astronauts . . . spinning

  MARINER IV finished transmitting its 21 photographs of Mars and sent
     about 10 percent of a 22nd picture before its tape ran out. The later
     pictures were eagerly awaited by JPL scientists because they should

July 26: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator, said during a
     recent interview that the next immediate step beyond the initial Apollo
     lunar landings was to extend the usefulness of both spacecraft and

     the Gemini Project Office at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, told
      reporters. The Gemini capsule could circle the far side of the moon-
     240,000 mi. from earth-and then return to its home planet, a round
     trip of about six days.
        Kleinknecht said if the proposal were accepted, a Titan 111-c rocket
     equipped with two upper stages called â€œtranstagesâ€ would place one of
     the transtages in orbit. A Titan 11 would send the Gemini craft after
     the transtage and the two would be docked in orbit. Gemini then
     would use the transtage propulsion system and its maneuverability for
     the lunar voyage.
        The feasibility was being studied by NASA; the Martin Co., systems
     manager for Titan 111-c; and Aerojet-General, which builds the
     transtage. â€œWe are always studying possible future missions for Gem-
     ini,â€ Kleinknecht added. (Benedict, N.O. Times-Picayune, 7/26/65)

July 26-29: Second annual meeting of the AIM was held in San
     Francisco. Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of the Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory, opened the meeting with a signal from MARINER IV soar-
     ing through space 144 million mi. from earth. Received at the Joe
     hannesburg tracking station, the signal was relayed to San Francisco
     from JPL in Pasadena. Speeches at AIAA:
        President of Lockheed Aircraft Corp., Daniel J. Haughton, speaking
     on â€œYour Role in the New Environment,â€ said: â€œAmerican aircraft
     products have dominated world markets for decades. Today iit !east
     90 percent of the airline jets flown in the free world are built in the
     United States. Aircraft exports, both military and civilian, are $1.2
     billion a year. Imports, on the other hand, are almost negligible-
     $90 million last year.
        â€œBut now something new has been added-and that is more thrust
     toward cooperative programs. . . .
        â€œCooperative programs are increasing. Only last May Secretary of
     Defense McNamara proposed a common market for military
     hardware. If successful, it will help integrate the total NATO market,
     including the U.S., even more closely, and will also permit foreign
     firms to sell selectively in the American defense market.
        â€œThe total effect of these developments means, for US. manufac-
     turers, more competition, more cooperative programs, and a more
                         .
     flexible approach . . but I do not believe this means we must abdi-
     cate our technological leadership. I think, on the contrary, that we
     must strengthen it. One of my colleagues suggests w should add a

July 26: WAFâ€™S Titan 111-c rocket could match the Soviet Unionâ€™s most
    powerful booster pound for pound in launching heavy-weight satellites
    into orbit, according to William G. Purdy, General Manager, Launch
    Vehicles, Martin Co. â€œEngineering analysis of Titan 111-Câ€™S perform-
    ance on its maiden flight of June [18] shows that a payload of nearly
    27,000 pounds could have been orbited. In the past, Titan III-Câ€™S
     maximum payload has been computed at 25,000 Ibs.â€ Mr. Purdy said
     that the Soviet Unionâ€™s best was the 26,840-Ib. PROTON I satellite

        NASA Science Advisory Committee was considering a proposal by
     radio astronomers to create a 10-mi.-dia. antenna array to permit a
     â€œlookâ€ into the past with radio energy, disclosed Bernard M. Oliver,
    Vice President of a Palo Alto electronics firm. He estimated that
     1,000 antennas, each perhaps 10-ft.-dia., spread out over the area of a
     10-mi. circle, would provide the resolution of signal intake necessary
     for the kind of radio observation he was suggesting. Intake of all the
     antennas would be focused at a single laboratory. There the radio
     energy would be converted to sound energy and then into light to
    provide photographic images equivalent to optical images now taken of
     the moon. Oliver said: â€œWe quite strongly believe that such an ex-
    ploration tool can provide the maximum amount of information relat-
    ing to the origins of the universe, to the life cycle, and to the destiny of
    the universe, and, in a sense, to the destiny of the human race as a
                       Trib.,

        Missions to Jupiter could be conducted by 1969, suggested Eugene
    Lally, Space-General Corp. engineer, in a paper presented to the AIAA
     outlining a program of six missions to the planet Jupiter, beginning
     with a fly-by in 1969 and culminating with a Jovian orbit in the
     mid-1980â€™s. A Jupiter mission would take about two years. Lally
     postulated that payload weights ranging from a 650-lb. payload to a
     12,400-lb. orbiter payload could be easily handled by boosters ranging
     from Atlas-Centaur with an added kick stage, through the Saturn V
     which would be used to place a man on the moon. Lally speculated
     that an instrumented probe would be able to obtain information on the
     constitution of the core and surface layers, the atmosphere, nature of
     the largest of the planetâ€™s spots, topography, constitution of meteoroids
     in its vicinity and the presence of small satellites not yet discovered
     with telescopes. Lallyâ€™s probe would contain experiments to measure
     the atmosphere, magnetic fields, and gravitational fields; to conduct
     infrared and microwave examinations of the surface; and to provide
     pictures similar to those taken of Mars by MARINER IV. (Space-Gen-
     era1 Corp. Release)
        An Electro-Optical Systems ( EOS) bombardment ion engine had suc-
     cessfully operated for more than 2,610 hrs. in vacuum chamber condi-
     tions and, as a result of that extended run, â€œlifetimes in excess of
     10,000 hours can now be calculated for the tiny engine under condi-
     tions of space flight,â€ Gordon Sohl, Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., told

determine â€œif the ion engine with 100 pounds of cesium fuel is equiva-
 lent in thrust to a conventional chemical rocket carrying a ton of
propellant.â€ ( EOS Release)
    Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Ad-
vanced Research and Technology, presented the third annual Theodore
von K I r m i n lecture. Dr. Bisplinghoff discussed advances in air trans-
port, such as V/Stol aircraft and the hypersonic transport. He point-
ed out that within 20 yrs. an estimated 130 million persons (about
50% of the US. population) would be living in three main metropoli-
tan areas and that there would be an increasing demand for â€œair
buses.â€ Dr, Bisplinghoff suggested that the hydrogen-fueled hyperson-
ic transport could be used as a cheap transport, or as an earth-to-orbit
aircraft. He said that the hypersonic transport would carry pas-
sengers halfway around the earth nonstop at speeds up to 8,000 mph,
but there was one problem area: . . . â€œWhere the airplane threatens to
overpower the pilot with characteristics which make the airplane
unflyable by human systems.â€ Dr. Bisplinghoff called for increased
research for operational experience with the scramjet (supersonic com-
bustion ramjet) engine as a prelude to developing the hypersonic
transports.
    In a press conference preceding his lecture, Dr. Bisplinghoff predict-
ed â€œanother revolutionâ€ for personal aircraft in the form of highly
simplified controls similar to those in automobiles. He also urged
quick Government action to begin the acquisition of a followon hyper-
sonic rcsenrch aircraft to siicceed the X-15 and run the flight profile
out to mach 10 to 12. (NASA Release 65-247; Text, M / S Daiiy,

   NASA Electronics Research Center Director Dr. Winston E. Kock dis-
cussed ERC in address. During FY 1965, he said, ERC â€œawarded 33
contracts totaling almost $2 million. The organizations to whom these
                                                                     ...
contracts were awarded are spread widely throughout the country.
   â€œThe average value of the 33 contracts was $59,000, the largest
being $285,000. These contracts were almost all in fairly basic re-
search fields, ranging from integrated circuits and thin film space-
charge limited triodes, through research in millimeter and submilli-
meter waves, optical wave-guides and optical components, to
space-borne memory organizations, laser gyros and fluid storage and
control devices. . . .7,
   He discussed ERC personnel: â€œWe have grown from a group of 65 at
our inception last year [Sept. 11 to a total of 244. As we are still in
the formative stages, our scientific and engineering personnel now total
only 92 out of the 244, but when we have reached our full strength of
2100, we expect that our staff will be about equally divided between
                                                                       .â€

         â€œThere is nothing hostile or aggressive in the military space pro-

      gram expressly devoted to peaceful purposes,â€™â€™ said Dr. Albert C. Hall,
      Deputy Director (Space) of Defense Research and Engineering. He
      continued: â€œIt is likely that military interest will remain focused pri-
      marily on near-earth missions, out to synchronous orbit, certainly
      through 1975. We expect to continue our very large and vigorous
      unmanned military space program which is performing very important
      functions. The need for these programs will not diminish since they
      are by far the most efficient and cheapest way of performing specified
      tasks. With a steadily increasing experience and know-how in
      manned space flight, we may expect that spacecraft will acquire char-
      acteristics permitting rendezvous, station-keeping, docking, and
      transfer of man and material. We will likely acquire the means of
      sustaining military men in space for the periods of time we
      require. Booster capacities are not likely to limit the applications, but
      the booster and payload costs will continue to do so.â€ (Text)
         In AIAA session on the â€œHistory of Rocket Research Airplanes,â€
      John Stack, former NACA-NASA designer, pointed out how little was
      known about transonic and supersonic flight in 1943, when X-1 was
      conceived. Walter C. Williams, Dr. Raymond Bisplinghoff, and
      Walter T. Bonney, among other speakers, also stressed the key role of
      engineer test pilots in the success of the X-1, b558, X-2, and X-15
      programs. Session was chaired by Robert Perry of RAND Corporation,
      who traced the history of rocket-powered aircraft. (EPH; RAND
      P-3154)
         DeMarquis D. Wyatt, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Pro-
      graming, told the meeting: â€œAny discussion of the NASA space program
      for the next 10 years must be given and received with a grain of
      salt. Reconstruct in your minds the situation 10 years ago and evalu-
      ate the validity of any discussion at that time of the NACA program for
      the period 1955-1965. Such a discussion would not have even men-
      tioned space in any serious fashion. A paper delivered in 1960 that
      attempted to outline the NASA program for 1960-1970 would have
      widely missed the mark in the prediction of todayâ€™s realities. One
      can, therefore, conclude that one of the major management problems
      of the national space program is the lack of an adequate crystal ball
      for forecasting the future.
         â€œIn the 6% years of its existence NASA has carried out a vigorous
      program of space activities designed to yield:
        66
           ( a ) a description and scientific understanding of the space environ-
      ment; ( b ) the development of a broadly based national capability and
      capacity for manned and unmanned operations in space, and (c) the
      development of practical uses of space.
                                                                         351
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

        â€œDecisions will have to be made with an appreciation of, and indeed
     the shaping of, our whole national attitude toward space in relation to
     our other national requirements and interests. Far too many future
     studies within and without the government are predicated on the as-
     sumption that the national investment in space research and technolo-
     gy will at least grow at the rate of the Gross National Product. This
     has not been true for the past several years and does not afford a
     necessarily sound planning assumption for the future. Our total fed-
     eral budget has leveled off in spite of the great increase in the national
     product in recent years. If this trend holds, then marked increases in
     space expenditures can only come about through decreases in other
     federal spending. Such an assumption would indeed be a slender reed
     upon which to prognosticate the future.â€ (Text)

  Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator ior Maiiiied
     Space Flight, speaking at the Annual Convention of the Ameri-
     can Trial Lawyers Association in Miami Beach, said: â€œI would
     like first to comment on what appears to be a general misconception
     about the overall purposes of the Apollo program. Many people seem
     to believe that a landing on the moon, ahead of the Soviets, is the
     paramount objective. This is not so. The principal goal is to make
     the United States first in space by the end of this decade, and to make
     this pre-eminence unmistakably clear to the world.
        â€œWhy . . . is it so vital that the United States be pre-eminent in
     space? There are many reasons that can be cited, and they fall gen-
     erally into two major categories-the imperative reasons and the ancil-
     lary, or spin-off benefits. It is imperative, in the Cold War arena,
     that the United States be first for reasons of national security, national
    pride of achievement, and the international prestige. The ancil-
    lary . . . reasons include the benefits of scientific discovery; the
     stimulation of economic and social progress; technological advance-
     ment, including the civilian application and utilization of the products
     of space-oriented research; and the compelling urge of man to explore
     and to discover.â€ (Text)
  Edward Z. Gray, Director of NASAâ€™s         Advanced Manned Missions Pro-
    gram, in an interview with Missile Space Daily, said that the logi-

352              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

     station, about the same size as a crew module on a planetary flight
     which would be            continuously deployed      and periodically
     supplied.â€ He added, however, that such a station was â€œbeyond the FY
     â€™68 budget.â€
        Gray said that meanwhile NASA would continue its study program on
     planetary flight. Propulsion was the limiting factor, he explained;
     other problems such as power, life support, and communications were
     expected to evolve satisfactorily by the late 1970â€™s. He foresaw the
     possibility of a manned flyby mission around Mars by the mid-1970â€™s.
        â€œDevelopment of a new launch vehicle is probable in another four
     or five years,â€ he said, â€œand a reusable system is a â€˜good bet.â€™ Large
     solids will also be a candidate and could be competitive with the best
      of the others until the reusable vehicle comes along.â€ Even then,
      Gray saw a division of labor in which solids would handle payloads in
     the 1-to-5-million-lb.class and reusable vehicles would concentrate on
     20,000-to-50,000-lb. payloads. Reusable solids were also under
     consideration. ( M / S Daily, 7/27/65)

Iuly 29: Dr. Robert B. Leighton, Cal Tech professor, summarized the re-
     sults of the MARINER IV mission to President Johnson in a White
     House ceremony during which the remaining photos transmitted by
     the spacecraft were presented to the President and the Nation. Dr.
     Leighton said: â€œManâ€™s first close-up look at Mars has revealed the
     scientifically startling fact that at least part of its surface is covered
                            .
     with largecraters. . .
        â€œThe existence of Martian craters is demonstrated beyond question ;
     their meaning and significance is, of course, a matter of
     interpretation. The seventy craters clearly distinguishable on Mariner
     photos Nos. 5 through 15, range in diameter from three to 75
     miles. It seems likely that smaller craters exist, and there also may be
     still larger ones than those photographed, since the Mariner pho-
     tographs, in total, sampled only about one percent of the Martian sur-
     face.
                                                                      355
             ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   â€œThe observed craters have rims rising a few hundred feet above the
surrounding surface and depths of a few thousand feet below the
rims. Crater walls so far measured seem to slope at angles up to
about 10 degrees.
   â€œThe number of large craters per unit area on the Martian surface is
closely comparable to the densely cratered upland areas of the Moon.â€
   Dr. Leighton said that no earth-like features were recognized and
that clouds â€œwere not identified and the flight path did not cross either
polar cap.â€
   Some of the fundamental inferences drawn from the MARINER IV
photos were:
   â€œ1. In terms of its evolutionary history, Mars is more Moon-like
than Earth-like. Nonetheless, because it has an atmosphere, Mars may
shed much light on early phases of Earthâ€˜s history.
   â€œ2. Reasoning by analogy with the Moon, much of the heavily cra-
tered surface of Mars must be very ancient--perhaps two to five bil-
lion years old.
   â€œ3. The remarkable state of preservation of such an ancient surface
leads us to the inference that no atmosphere significantly denser than
the present very thin one has characterized the planet since that sur-
face was formed. Similarly, it is difficult to believe that free water in
quantities sufficient to form streams or to fill oceans could have existed
anywhere on Mars since that time. The presence of such amounts of
water (and consequent atmosphere) would have caused severe erosion
over the entire surface.
   â€œ4. The principal topographic features of Mars photographed by
Mariner have not been produced by stress and deformation originating
within the planet, in distinction to the case of the Earth. Earth is
internally dynamic giving rise to mountains, continents, and other
such features, while evidently Mars has iong been inactive. The !a&
of internal activity is also consistent with the absence of a significant
magnetic field on Mars as was determined by the Mariner magnetom-
eter experiment.
   â€œ5. As we had anticipated, Mariner photos neither demonstrate nor
preclude the possible existence of life on Mars. The search for a
fossil record does appear less promising if Martian oceans never
existed. On the other hand, if the Martian surface is truly in its
primitive form, the surface may prove to be the best-perhaps the only
-place in the solar system still preserving clues to original organic
development, traces of which have long since disappeared from Earth.â€
   Dr. Leighton noted that â€œone of the most difficult problems associat-
ed with the Mariner photographic mission to Mars was the wide illu-
mination rangeâ€ that was encountered. Assisting Dr. Leighton in his
presentation were: Prof. Bruce C. Murray, Cal Tech; Prof. Robert P.
Sharp, Cal Tech; Richard K. Sloan, JPL; and J. Denton Allen,
JPL. President Johnson said he was a bit relieved that MARINERâ€™S
photographs â€œdidnâ€™t show more signs of life out there.â€ He described
the Mars pictures as â€œawe-inspiringâ€ and said that â€œthe flight of Mar-
iner 4 will stand as one of the great advances of manâ€™s quest to extend
the horizons of human knowledge.â€™â€™

July 29: During MARINER IV press conference at NASA Hq., NASA Adminis-
    trator James E. Webb, in response to a question about the possibility
     of â€œanother Mariner mission in the relatively near future,â€ replied:
     â€œWe had decided some time ago not to fly another one of these mis-
     sions with the equipment we used on MARINER IV but to concentrate
     on much more important work that we can do with advanced equip-
     ment.
        â€˜â€˜So I should say that itâ€™s highly unlikely that we would revive con-
     sideration of another flight.â€
        Mr. Webb said that the MARINER IV flight, including the MARINER
     111 attempt that failed, â€œcost over $100 million.â€ He continued: â€œDr.
     Pickering and his group with the American industrial companies
    proved that we could move out from the earth and get to the planet
     and do what we intended to do. . . .
        â€œSecond, the scientific experimenters worked in close harmony, and
     the relationship between the experimenters and the people responsible
     for making the flight get to its destination and bring the data back was
     I think a very outstanding achievement and also is a part of the learn-
     ing process in the space program.
        â€œLastly, it certainly is very important, as we have emphasized in the
     manned spaceflight program, to gain some knowledge, even though it
     is not full and complete, at as early a stage as possible, because we
     have planned a broad-based program over a ten-year period. But we
     also have the capability of change and modification in the
     program. And this gives us a good deal of information that in my
     view will have a strong bearing on the decisions to be made in the
     1967 budget.â€
        Mr. Webb said that he did not see â€œvery much difference between
     our Capability and their [Soviet] capability at this time but that we
     are both moving into a period when we will be able to select certain
     options for further emphasis and development.â€
         It was revealed that the results of the MARINER IV mission would be
     published in Science.
        Participating in the press conference with Mr. Webb were: Dr. Wil-
     liam H. Pickering, Director, J P L ; Edgar M. Cortright, Deputy Asso-

   Rep. Charles McC. Mathias (R-Md.) , advocating increased research

     Presidential report thereon: â€œThe science of weather modification is
     still in its infancy, but it is a very active youth. Public and private
     efforts in this field have expanded greatly in the past decade. Several
     Federal agencies, primarily the Department of Commerce, the National
     Science Foundation, NASA, and the Departments of Interior and De-

            Before committing this country to such a massive and sustained
      effort, we should know where we stand now. A comprehensive Presi-

July 30: PEGASUS 111 meteoroid detection satellite was launched into orbit
     from Eastern Test Range, with a Saturn I booster-last(SA-10)      in a
     series of ten launch vehicle test flights. Initial orbital data:
     apogee, 336 mi. (541.9 km.); perigee, 324, mi. (522.6 b.);
     period, 95.5 min.; inclination, 28.9â€™. Main assignment of the 3,200-

     frequency of meteoroids in near-earth environment, for use in the de-
    sign of future manned and unmanned spacecraft. Eight of its detach-
     able panels carried 352 thermal surface samples collected from the
     aerospace industry. If NASA should program an astronaut-PEGASUS

     gram was the clustering of several large rocket engines: the power
     plant in the first stage of the Saturn I was a cluster of eight H-1
     engines each with 188,000 lbs. of thrust to give this stage 1,504,000
     lbs. of thrust. The first four flight tests (SA-1 through SA^) were
     with dummy upper stages; beginning with SA-5, both stages (+I and
              were â€œliveâ€; and the last three Saturn 1â€™s each orbited a

9 A prototype experimental life-support system enclosed in a simulated

     space cabin was placed on a ship in San Diego for delivery to NASA
    Langley Research Center. Designed and constructed by the Convair
     Div. of General Dynamics Corp., the system was intended for use in a
     research program to enlarge the scope of life-support technology.
    Within the device were subsystems to: (1) extract oxygen from
     the carbon dioxide exhaled by the occupants; (2) convert waste liq-
    uids and humidity condensates to drinking water; (3) provide control
     of internal temperature and humidity; (4) allow storage and handling
     of a freeze-dried food supply for four test subjects for 90 days at a
     time; (5) remove from the cabin atmosphere all contaminating vapors
     which might be generated; and (6) provide personal hygiene facilities.

  Commenting on the success of MARINER IV, a New York Times editorial
     said: â€œA whole host of new sciences is being born-extraterres-
     trial geology most obviously among them. By learning more about
     Mars-even a lifeless Mars-men will undersiand betier the o:igis a!
     the solar system. And, by being able to compare the red planet in
     greater detail with this earth, new understanding will evolve of why
     there is life here and, apparently, none there. The exploration of the
    planets has begun and more than one generation will be required to
     finish that task. But, so long as men stand on this puny globe and
     gaze wonderingly at the lights in the sky, they will remember that the
     first successful pioneer was named Mariner 4.â€ (NYT, 7/30/65,

During July: The support of science in the US. was discussed by Dael
    Wolfle in the Scientific American:
       â€œFrom 1953 until 1960 about 8 percent of the Nationâ€™s research and
    development budget was devoted to basic research. The percentage
    has been rising since 1960, reaching almost 12 percent in 1965. As
    for the Federal Governmentâ€™s funds, in 1953, less than 7 percent went
    for basic research. The figure has been rising since 1960, to about 11
    percent in 1965. The universities are relatively much more prominent
    in basic research than in the total research and development effort,
    being responsible for almost half of all basic research. In contrast the
    industrial laboratories, which dominate in development activity, con-
    duct only about a fourth of the basic research.â€ ( C R , 7/14/65,

 Prospects for US.-European industrial cooperation in space were dis-
    cussed in Air Force and Space Digest by Elmer P. Wheaton, Vice
    President of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. Wheaton offered four
    â€œguiding principlesâ€ for any program of US.-European industrial
    effort:
       â€œThe program to be jointly undertaken should avoid unnecessary
    duplication of an existing program. . . .
       â€œThe project or program should contribute to a better understand-
    ing of the space environment. . . .
       â€œThe program must provide a logical extension of our current space
                     .
    technology. . .
       â€œThe program must not require such a substantial increase of
     knowledge in either the space environment or the space technology
    that it involves a high risk of failure. . . .â€
       Wheaton suggested : scientific areas that could be usefully investigat-
     ed by Europe; advanced programs for â€œmore distant European ex-
    plorationâ€; and satelIites that could be profitably developed by Europe
    -notably, applications satellites. In such company-to-company coop-
     eration, contribution of the U S . companies should be chiefly in space
     systems management. (AF Mag., 7/65, 53-57)
  European contributions to international space communications were
    recommended by Dalimil Kybal, Senior Consulting Scientist, Lockheed

    Digest :
       â€œContrary to the views of those Europeans who tend to think of
    European and American space communications systems as separate
    entities, existing international agreements clearly call for a global
    system. Europe, as it develops space technology skills, ought to concen-
    trate on developing next-generation satellites as replacements for exist-

  Soviet aircraft designer Oleg K. Antonov provided technical and per-

During July: Paul Tillich, Protestant theologian, commenting upon the
    â€œPacem in Terrisâ€ of Pope John XXIII, wrote: â€œA . . . genuine hope
    for peace is the technical union of mankind by the conquest of space.
    Of course, nearness can intensify hostility; and the fact that the first
    manifestations of the technical oneness of the world were two world
    wars proves this possibility. But nearness can also have the opposite
    effect. It can change the image of the other as strange and dangerous;
    it can reduce self-affirmation and effect openness for other possibilities
    of human existence and-particularly as in the encounter of religions-
    of other possibilities of genuine faith.â€ (Tillich, â€œThe Limits of

  Alternate methods for re-establishing communications with MARINER IV
    on its next closest approach to earth around Sept. 4, 1967, were being
    considered by Mariner project planners at Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
    Aviation Week and Space Technology reported: ( 1 ) attempted re-
    acquisition beginning in early February 1967, making use of the
    spacecraft's high-gain directional antenna to obtain data from the
    spacecraft for up to 10 mo.; (2) reliance solely on MARINER IV'S low-
    gain antenna for transmission, permitting two-way communications
    for four to six weeks around September 1967. In the 10-mo. plan,
    reacquisition would be initiated when the spacecraft was about 135
    million mi. from earth. Due to relative sun-earth positions in February
     1967, the angle at which the high-gain directional antenna would be
    permanently fixed would enable it t o be aimed at the earth by having
     MARINER IV roll about its longitudinal axis, which would be pointed at
    the sun. The 100-kw. transmitter at Goldstone tracking station would
     send the necessary commands to MARINER IV. In the latter plan, use of
    the 210-ft. antenna, expected to become operational at Goldstone in
     January 1966, could extend reception of intelligible telemetry signals
     to as long as six weeks, compared with four using the standard 85-ft.
     dishes of the Deep Space Network.
        W. A. Collier, assistant Mariner project manager at JPL, told
     Aviation Week that MARINER IV would be of particular scientific interest
     in 1967. First, there were no other interplanetary probes being sent
     away from the sun at that period. Second, when MARINER IV passed
     within 6,000 mi. of Mars July 14, the gravitational pull of the planet
    had tilted the plane of the spacecraft out of the plane of the ecliptic.
     MARINER IV, 5.3 million mi. above the ecliptic in September 1967,
     would give scientists their first chance to compare interplanetary find-
     ings outside this plane with those obtained in it.
        Preliminary estimates were that the 10-mo. plan would cost between
     $5 million and $15 million, while the four-to-six-week project would
     cost less than $1 million.
        MARINER IV, launched Nov. 28,1964, was in solar orbit with a period
     of 567.11 days, perihelion of 103.1 million mi., and aphelion of 146.2

    have been forgotten, let me quote from our highest policy level. In
     1962, President Johnson, then Vice President and the Chairman of the
     National Aeronautics and Space Council, stated: â€˜The United States
     does not have a division between peaceful and non-peaceful objectives
     for space but rather has space missions to help keep the peace and space
     missions to improve our ability to live well in peace. . . .â€™
                                                                           367
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

       â€œIn 1964, as President, he said: â€˜Our space program, in both its
    civil and military aspects, is peaceful in purpose and practice. . . .â€™
       â€œI . . . am not saying that space cannot be used for purposes of
    aggression . . . no nation should bury itself in sands of complacency
    and thereby neglect to develop the technological and military strength
    so necessary for deterring potential aggressors. The maintenance of
    such strength in no respect conflicts with the policy of peace. In fact,
    the more competent we are to prevent surprise, to discover aggressive
    maneuvers, and to intercept hostile weapons in any medium, the better
    chance we have of living in peace. . . .
       â€œWhen I state, therefore, that our entire national space program
    is peaceful, I mean that we have no aggressive intent, that we seek
    no domination over other peoples, and that we are eager to share the
    benefits of space exploration with all mankind.â€ (Text)
August 4: NASA selected three firms to design the Apollo Lunar Surface Ex-
    periments Packages ( Alsep) under separate and concurrent $500,000,
    six-month, fixed-price contracts. The firms were Bendix Systems Div.,
    Bendix Corp. ; Space-General Corp. ; and TRW Systems Group, Thomp-
    son-Ramo-Wooldridge, Inc. Packages would contain scientific in-
    struments to measure the moonâ€™s structure and surface characteristics,
    atmosphere, heat flow, solar wind, radiation, and micrometeorite im-
    pacts. They would be carried to the moon on the initial Apollo space-

  In an article in the Orlando Evening Star, Barry Goldwater said: â€œDe-
    fense Secretary Robert McNamara has indicated that space weapons are
    too costly, as though any dollar cost is too high for the security of 190
    million Americans and a billion allies and friends. The only major
    space-military program McNamara has permitted to stay alive is the
    Manned Orbital Laboratory, and he has so slowed and limited this
    that its orbit is apparently toward nothing but bureaucratic extinction.
       â€œWe have deployed one or. two so-called â€˜satellite killers,â€™ but they are
    a pitiful particle of what really is needed.
       â€œPictures of Mars are fine. So is a trip to the moon. But the first
    job of any administration is to secure the nation against its enemies.

          We will not remain the most powerful nation on earth for long if
    we do not reverse the suicidal Johnson-McNamara refusal to let US arm

  â€œAbsence of proper space laws may lead to dangerous conflicts and com-
    plications not only in this sphere of manâ€™s activities but also in purely
    terrestrial affairs,â€™â€™ said Genadii Zhukov, scientific secretary of the
    Soviet Space Law Commission in an interview with Krmnaya Zvezda.
    The resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 13,
     1963, had confirmed that outer space was open to all states. However,
    he stressed, the resolution made special reservations about the imper-
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965
368
    missibility of using sputniks for war propaganda and for inciting
    enmity between peoples : â€œAll states must refrain from potentially
    harmful experiments in outer space or any other steps liable to interfere
    with the peaceful use of such space by other countries.â€
       Zhukov noted that in connection with the prospects of creating
    permanent orbital stations, the need would arise to determine their legal
    status, as well as conditions of their use by other countries. As human
    beings made further inroads into outer space, the problem of deter-
    mining the legal status of stations and settlements on the moon and on
    other celestial bodies, the conditions for tapping their natural re-
    sources, would become important. He added: â€œSpace law must also
    guarantee protection of other living worlds if such are discovered on
    distant planets.â€ (Tass, 8/4/65)
August 4-5: Some 300 representatives of industry, NASA, and other agencies

August 1 1 : NASA Atlas-Centaur 6 launched a dummy Surveyor spacecraft
     along a simulated lunar trajectory in the fourth successful vehicle
     flight of six made to date. The Atlas booster operated as planned;
     Centaur ignited, burning for 7 min. 12 sec., and injected the dummy
     Surveyor spacecraft into a highly elliptical simulated lunar transfer
     orbit with apogee, 509,829 mi. (820,824 km.); perigee, 105 mi.

  Photographs of Mars returned by NASA MARINER IV showed surface

    shown on photograph No. 11 as a rift valley. This surface feature
    occurred at the same location on Mars where some astronomers claimed
    to have seen canals. Burgess said the photograph revealed that the
    escarpments passed through the rim of a large lOO-mi.-wide Martian
    crater, indicating that this particular rift valley appeared after the
    formation of the crater. ( L A . Times, 8/16/65)
August 15: ZOND 111â€™slunar photography mission was announced by Tass:
    bb
       Automatic station Zond 3 is continuing its flight along a heliocentric
               .
    orbit. . . Photography of the moon began on July 20, 36 hrs. after
    launch, at M24 hrs., Moscow time, when the automatic station was at
    a distance of 11,600 km. from the lunar surface, and was concluded at
    0532 hrs. at a distance of about 10,000 km. After the lunar flyby
    the station is continuing its motion in a heliocentric orbit, becoming
    increasingly more distant from the earth and the sun. Image trans-
    mission began in accordance with the program of July 29 at a distance
    of 2.2 million km., when the angular size of the earth was small
    enough for the precise tuning of the on-board parabolic antenna to-
    wards the earth. Zond 3 for the first time photographed a part of the
    moon that cannot be seen from the earth and which was not included
    in the photos made by the Soviet interplanetary station in October 1959.
    At the moment photography began the phase of the moon visible from

   tion, when the relief formations cast distinct shadows. The images
   from Zond 3 are sent with a clarity of 1,100 lines. When photograph-
   ing from a distance of the order of 10,000 km., images of a lunar sur-
   face area of about 5 million square km. are possible. The quality of the

   further testing of the radio line the transmission of photographs of the
   far side of the moon from the station will continue during subsequent
   communications sessions, right up to the greatest distance from the

    the available equipment-and consequently the quality of the result-
    was primitive by present standards. Six years ago the marvel was
    that this feat could be accomplished at all. Now, in the wake of the
    photographic knowledge of :he z g m and of Mars obtained by this

 Comparing LUNA 111 [LUNIK 1111 and ZOND 111, H. Pfaffe said in an article
   in East Germanyâ€™s Berliner Zeitung: â€œOwing to its trajectory, Zond 3
   was able to photograph the moon under favorable illumination condi-
   tions for one hour and eight minutes. Luna 3 was able to photograph
   only 40 minutes. Zond 3â€™s trajectory was so chosen that the probe
   assumed a planetary orbit around the sun. Luna 3, on the other hand,
    assumed an elliptical orbit with the earth as one focal point. While
    Luna 3 transmitted its photos of the moon from distances of 400,000
   km. and 40,000 km., Zond 3 began to transmit from a distance of 2,200,-
    OOO km. This and the fact that the new photos were on a 1,100-line
    basis indicated the advances made in the Soviet radio and photographic
    systems.â€ (Pfaffe, Berliner Zeitung, 8/15/65, 3)

August 16: Robert Hotz commented in an Aviation Week and Space Tech-
    nology editorial: â€œThe summer of 1965 seems destined to appear in
    space history as a period of formidable success in extending the
    horizons of manâ€™s efforts to explore his universe. The two spectacular
    achievements of Mariner 4 and Gemini 4 have been interspersed with
    several other milestones in space technology as the summer unfolded.
        â€œEven after all the millions of words that have been poured out in
    describing the amazing feats of the Mariner 4 spacecraft, it is difficult
    to comprehend the full magnitude of its achievements. The 228-day
    voyage of Mariner 4 across 135 million mi. to the vicinity of Mars,
    and its transmission of the first relatively close-up pictures of that
    planet back across the void to earth, probably will rank as the most
    spectacular feat of space exploration in the first decade since Sputnik 1.
        â€œMore than any other space flight since the first manned space
    mission by Vostok 1, this successful reconnaissance of Mars has
    demonstrated the infinite possibilities that lie ahead in obtaining
    a truly scientific grasp of the universe around us. The evidence that
    was provided by the Mariner 4 photographs was a scientific discovery
    of the first magnitude and certainly showed the limitations of earth-
    based astronomy. But perhaps its real significance lies in the
    demonstration that a complex spacecraft can voyage, communicate,
    and function over the vast reaches of space under human control
    and command from earth. . . .
        â€œThere is little doubt that the U S . space program would not be
     operating at its present pace or scope without the early, humiliating
    prod of the Soviet Unionâ€™s pioneering in this field. However, the
     results now being produced from the U S . program are proving so
     useful in such a variety of applications that there should be little
     doubt that it is worth pursuing for its own goals, even without the
     stimulus of international competition. It may well be that when
    historians write of the space age they will point to the summer of 1965
     as the time when the U S . effort finally reached maturity and began
     breaking its own new ground, in contrast to the earlier era of stern-
     chasing the Soviets.â€ (Hotz, An. Wk.,8/16/65, 21)
  NASA was seeking buyers for rocket launches, and the improved Delta,
     incorporated into the launch package, might prove most economical,
     William S. Beller reported in Missiles and Rockets. Cost o launching
                                                                     f
     the Delta, either to low-earth orbit or into interplanetary space, would
     be the same. Cost to send a package to the moon would be $16,000/
     lb.; on a Mars flyby, $21,000/lb.
         Bellerâ€™s article continued: â€œIt is ironic that the fabulously successful
     series of Delta rockets is based on much of the hardware and concepts
     used in the presumed failure called Vanguard. In 1959, the Air
     Force took the upper two Vanguard stages, mounted them on Thor,
     and called the combination Thor-Able. NASA then made minor
     modifications in the vehicleâ€™s coast attitude-control system and put
                                                                         381

    in a new auto-pilot control system; but the basic Thor-Able shell was
    used. This was the Delta that failed in its first firing i n 1960 with an
    Echo satellite payload. The subsequent Deltas orbited their payloads in
    22 successive launchings.
       â€œThe Vanguard program, too, besides giving birth to Delta was
    probably one of the most economical buys of the U S . space program.
    Originally budgeted for a total cost of $20 million, Vanguard ended
    up costing $105 million, which was paid not only for development of

  AFSC announced development of an ultrasonic corrosion detector which
    could inspect aircraft fuel tanks quickly and accurately. The corrosion
    detector, mounted on a trailer, would be guided under the wing of a
    parked aircraft and raised until it touched the underside of the wing;
    ultrasonic sound waves would be bounced against the skin of the air-

    assembly area at Kennedy Space Center, NASA, to the launching
    site three arid a hail miles away, had beeii crippled by repezted fii!we
    of roller bearings. Eight tractor trucks equipped with treads and
    rollers like those of a bulldozer would propel the crawler. It was the
    bearings in 88 rollers that had caused the problem. Tests of the
    $6-million vehicle, manufactured by Marion Power Shovel Co., had

  The New York Times commented on the success of the U.S.S.R. ZOND JII
     mission: â€œLike the Ranger and Mariner feats before it, Zond 3 has

     tained by using instruments alone, a technique much cheaper and
     less hazardous than sending men to the moon or the planets. There
     is every reason to suppose that a United States satellite could have
     gotten similar photographs of the other side of the moon even earlier
     than Zond 3 had a sustained effort to this end been made.
        â€œThe restraining element has been the limititions imposed on this
     countryâ€™s exploration of space with instrument-carrying rockets by the
     overriding priority given to the enormously expensive Apollo project
     for landing a man on the moon by 1970. The Soviet propaganda and
     prestige gains that will result from the current accomplishment rep-
     resent one of the costs of the decision to put so much emphasis upon
     a manned voyage to the moon.â€ ( N Y T , 8/17/65, 30)

       Leonard Jaffe. Director of NASA Communication and Navigation Pro-
    grams, told the Conference that recent announcement that DODâ€™S naviga-
    tion satellite system was operational demonstrated the great potential
    of artificial earth satellites for providing position determinations to the
    maritime industry. He said NASA had under study a number of tech-
    niques, different from those employed in the DOD system, by which
    satellites located in medium or synchronous orbits could provide posi-
    tion fixes to ships and aircraft. Techniques whereby the craftâ€™s posi-
    tion would be determined at ground computer stations might make
    the satellite system attractive to U S . industry, he said.
       For the future Jaffe foresaw the combination of a position deter-
   mination method and a communications system integrated into a
   single satellite to provide capability of aiding in air traffic control. He
    said : â€œAccurate position data and reliable communications readily
    available to air traffic controllers by use of satellites may provide the
    answer to the acute problem of safely reducing the present separation
    standard of aircraft flying across the crowded Atlantic Ocean region.
    Similar data supplied to a maritime regulatory agency may provide
    a means for preventing marine collisions.â€ (Text)
August 18-20: Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, AFSC Commander, participating
    in a panel discussion on the â€œSocial Implications of Space Explora-
    tion,â€ said: â€œ. . . there are two ways of looking at space. The first
    way is simply as a place-as the vast expanse which is an extension of
    the earthâ€˜s atmosphere in every direction, and which can serve as an
    operational environment. There is much we need to discover about
    this region, but it is already clear that space adds a new dimension
    to our thinking about naticnal security.
       â€œSpace has at least four unique characteristics which offer ad-
    vantages for military operations. These are : first, extremely high
    altitudes which offer line of sight to large areas of the earthâ€™s surface;
    second, very high speeds; third, almost infinite flight duration; and
    fourth, highly predictable flight paths.
       â€œThese recognized advantages have led to the development of a num-
    ber of space systems which provide support to military land, sea, and
    air operations. These include satellite systems for communications,
    weather, and navigation. The capabilities they provide are either
    unique or represent a distinct improvement over other means of
    accomplishing the same task . . .
       â€œOn the other hand, the advantages of space are frequently offset
    by several disadvantages. The first of these is the cost of launching
    payloads into space. Presently this amounts to about $1000 a pound
                                                                          385

    in low earth orbit, although it is estimated that the Titan 111 will reduce
    this figure to about $500 a pound, and we foresee methods of reducing
    the cost to the neighborhood of $100 a pound. The second is the
    requirement for extremely high reliability-the need to build satellites
    that will operate for long periods without maintenance and repair.
    Third is the absence of a demonstrated method of returning from space
    to a controlled landing at a specified point. And fourth is the environ-
    ment of space itself-the       problems associated with hard vacuum,
    temperature extremes, and intense radiation.
        â€œThe need to overcome these disadvantages leads to consideration of
    the second way in which space may be regarded-not merely as a place,
    but as a primary focus for manâ€™s scientific and technological efforts
    in the years ahead. The success of these efforts will determine the
    practical use that can be made of space for a variety of purposes,
    including military purposes.â€™â€™ (Text)

    berg AFB, and tracked and photographed it; they sighted a huge
    checkerboard design laid out on the ground near Laredo, Tex., and
    reported direction in the which arrows in the center of the blocks were
    pointed.
August 21-29: On Aug. 25, the astronauts saw, tracked, and photographed
    another Minuteman ICBM fired from Vandenberg AFB and identified a
    rocket sled test on Holloman AFB. At request of U.S. Weather Bureau,
    they attempted to photograph the eye of tropical storm Doreen about
    200 mi. south of Hawaii.
       During the flight, the astronauts both remained in good spirits. Six-
    teen of the planned seventeen experiments were conducted. Despite
    the heavy work schedule, Cooper and Conrad each slept about five hours
    a day. The astronauts ate about 2,000 calories of food a day, less
    than the 2,900 calories prescribed for the mission, and each drank
    six pounds of water daily.
       Aug. 27 saw problems with the steady accumulation of water in the
    fuel cell, which threatened to exceed water-storage capacity; faulty
    attitude and maneuvering thrusters; and the boiling off of hydrogen
    gas which caused the spacecraft to roll.
       On Aug. 28, the fuel cell and the left thruster were functioning well.
    Conrad reported seeing â€œa carrier and a destroyer steaming right into
    Jacksonvilleâ€; it was actually a tug pulling a large barge.
       On Aug. 29 Cooper and Conrad talked via radio with Astronaut M.
    Scott Carpenter (Cdr., U S N ) , in Sealab 11 on the floor of the Pacific
    off La Jolla, Calif. Approach of Hurri-cane Betsy from the coast .of
    South America forced NASA officials to order GEMINI v to land one
    revc!ution e d y . Two mnre of GEMINI vâ€™s thrusters froze, but there
    was still sufficient steering power to correct minor variations.
       To begin reentry, the astronauts fired four braking rockets as the
    spacecraft passed 700 mi. north of Hawaii. Reentry was normal.
    GEMINI v splashed down into the Atlantic at 8:56 a.m. EDT, 600 mi.
    east of Jacksonville-90 mi. off target. A human error in computing
    the elapsed time of flight caused the target error. Assisted from the
    capsule by Navy frogmen 45 min. after splashdown, the astronauts
    were taken by helicopter to U.S.S. Lake Champlain for medical de-

  An article in Human Events expressed fear that Russian military space
    capability surpassed that of the US.: â€œ. . . Four times in the past
    2 months, Red Star ( a newspaper published by the Defense Ministry)
    has trumpeted the claim that Russia now has orbital space rockets with
    the capacity of wiping any aggressor off the face of the earth.
       â€œThere is no doubt at all about the intended identity of the aggressor
    and among American scientists back home there is little doubt about
    the weapon.
       â€œThere is little doubt because the United States spent 7 years and
    $10 million between 1958-65 to plan the nuclear-powered space orbit-
    ing system called Project Orion. We have high-ranking scientists who
    believe the Russians have copied or adapted Orion, which has been
    declassified since October, 1964. The Russians might easily have
    cracked the secrecy before that.
       â€œIt is a first generation vehicular system that is capable of carrying
    8 men and 100 tons of payload to Mars and back. It is a jet-propelled
    engine or engines powered by a nuclear reactor which, in effect, bombs
    a shield at the rear of the vehicle and drives it forward. The usual
    limitations of temperature do not affect this vehicle because the hot
    debris of the explosions makes only a momentary contact with the
    shield. The limitations of using full nuclear power are also absent

August 22: New York Times commented on the malfunction of the fuel
    cell in the GEMINI v spacecraft launched August 21 : â€œPast manned space
    flights have gone so well in most respects that yesterdayâ€™s tension-filled
    hours were a shock and a surprise. It has all seemed too easy to the
    millions of television viewers who have observed previous man-in-space
    experiments. It was natural to assume that once Gemini 5 was so
    successfully launched, all would once again go more or less as planned.
    But those intimately involved with these efforts have known all along
    of the numerous possibilities of trouble. They were not greatly sur-
    prised that one of those possibilities for major difficulty-in this case
    a malfunction of the fuel cell on Gemini 5-turned into reality.
        â€œThere will undoubtedly be future emergencies in space. Yester-
    dayâ€™s events are a sobering reminder that the effort to reach the moon
    during this decade is straining the limits of available technology, and
    that serious risks are being taken. These hazards are also faced, of
    course, by the Soviet manned space program. The brave men both
    countries are sending into space would be the prime beneficiaries of
    full Soviet-American cooperation that would pool both countriesâ€™
    knowledge and experience to minimize the dangers inherent in these
    pioneering efforts.â€ ( N Y T , 8/22/65, 10E)

  Dispatch to Moscow from Tassâ€™ New York correspondent, Leonid
    Ponomarev: â€œThe flight of the US. spaceship Gemini-5 . . . pro-
   ceeded normally for only two hours, although the flight program was
    calculated for eight days.
       â€œThe main reason [was] that a new system for providing electric
   power. . . was being used in the Gemini-5 spacecraft for the first
          .
   time. . .
       â€œIt is a noteworthy fact that the new system for providing electrical
   power has never once been tested in spaceflight conditions. From the
   test stands on earth, the installation was put directly into working
   conditions in space.
       66
          There are several reasons that explain this haste and a certain
   degree of risk. The program chiefs were given the task of â€˜catching
   up with the Soviet Unionâ€™ at any price regarding the length of flight
   in space. However, the present power of U.S. rockets and the size of
   the astronautsâ€™ capsule are utterly inadequate for lifting and storing
   reliably tested battery-powered electrical power installations, which
   would weigh more than the new system. U S . scientists were compelled
   to rapidly create a system, new in principle, in order to provide power
   for the Gemini-5 spacecraft for eight days so that it could fulfill its
   tasks.â€ (Tass, 8/22/65

August 23: It was too early to set a realistic date for manâ€™s landing on the
   moon, Mstislav V. Keldysh, President of the Soviet Academy of Sci-
    ences, said during a Moscow press conference devoted to the ZOND 111
   mission. He explained: â€œ. . . we have . . . learned quite a lot about
   the surface of the moon. Yet this does not seem to be a great deal . . .
   where the choice of a landing spot is concerned. . . . Our knowledge
    of the soil of the moon is still somewhat contradictory, and I think it
    is much too early to start looking for a future landing site . . .â€
       Yuri Khodarev, engineer in the Soviet space program, revealed that
    ZOND 111 had used photographic film instead of magnetic film to record
    pictures for later playback on earth command. The mission had been
    essentially a test in which the spacecraft would continue to play back
    the moon pictures repeatedly at increasingly greater distances up to
    â€œhundreds of millions of kilometers,â€ Khodarev said, adding, â€œwe
    have created a new, compact photo television system intended for
    photographing and transmission of images of planets under conditions
    of prolonged space flight.â€ The wide-angle camera lens had a 106.4-
   mm. focal length at a relative aperture of 1:s. A 25-mm. film was used
    with exposures of 1/100th and 1/300th of a second. Describing the
    ZOND 111 television system, Khodarev said ZOND 111 had taken 25 photos
    of the far side of the moon in little more than an hour. Only one com-
    mand had been given from earth-to          start taking the photographs.
    All remaining operations occurred automatically.
       The ZOND 111 photographs confirmed earlier conclusions concerning
    the scarcity of dark depressions on the moonâ€™s reverse side, but also
    revealed sea-like formations up to 500 km. (310.5 mi.) across and
    about as long as the maria. These formations differed structurally
    from the maria and lacked their characteristic dark color. The north-
    ern part of the side of the moon was occupied by a bright elevation
    pitted with craters. Concentration of craters throughout the reverse
    side of the moon was high.
       Soviet astronomer Alla Masevich said the moon photographs were
    as good as those taken of the visible side from earth-based observa-
    tories: â€œThey show beautiful half-tone transitions, reflecting the char-
    acter of detailed surface relief.â€
       Alexander A. Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory, at-
   tributed the observed difference between the moonâ€™s visible side and its
    reverse side to geological rather than astronomical factors. He noted
   the appearance on Zond photographs of chains of craters along elon-
   gated fracture lines which he attributed to volcanic activity.
      Prof. Keldysh noted that the trajectory of ZOND 111 had passed far
   from the planets but said that â€œthe experience we gained in launching
   this probe into remote space will be used in subsequent launchings to
   photograph the planets.â€ He said the U.S.S.R. had already begun
   preparations to achieve a soft lunar landing. Experiments aboard the
   spacecraft were for study of magnetic fields, solar wind, low-frequency
    radio emission of the galaxy, micrometeors, cosmic rays, and the in-

August 24: Dr. Donald F. Hornig, science adviser to President Johnson,

  Soviet claim that the GEMINI v spaceflight was undertaken with â€œhaste

     bit embarrassed at the moment. It has given a big play to a story
     by Leonid Ponomariov [sic], its New York correspondent. The story
     has charged that American space officials have been ordered by the
    Johnson administration to â€™beat the Soviet Union at any price with
     regard to the duration of orbital flight.â€™
        â€. . . our country may indeed be forging ahead. But nothing
     could be more ridiculous than Ponomariovâ€™s [sic] studied suggestion
     that Gemini 5 has been put into orbit in a slapdash manner, with
     callous disregard for the safety of the astronauts aboard, just to steal
     a space scene from the Soviets. The fuel system and everything else
     aboard the Cooper-Conrad vehicle are not whimsical improvisations.
     That has been made dramatically clear by the way in which Geminiâ€™s
     initial power failure has been eliminated with help from ground
     control, by the craftâ€™s built-in means of self-correction.

  The New York Times editorialized: â€œ. . . The care that has marked
     every phase of the [Gemini V] flight thus far provides assurance
    that the decision on whether to call the capsule back to earth before
    that time will be based solely on the best judgment of the scientific
    team as to whether any element of needless risk would be involved in
    keeping the astronauts aloft. Their safety must, of course, take
    precedence over the fact that the eight-day goal is the most important

     for a round trip to the moon. If Colonel Cooper and Commander
     Conrad can function effectively in a state of weightlessness for that

August 25: President Johnson announced he had approved DOD develop-
    ment of a Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol) at a cost of $1.5 billion.
    At a White House news conference, the President said: â€œThis program
    will bring us new knowledge about what man is able to do in space.
    It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of America.    It
    will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned
    and unmanned space flight and it will make it possible to perform very
    new and rewarding experiments with that technology and equip-
    ment. . . .
        â€œUnmanned flights to test launching, recovery and other basic parts
    of the system will begin late next year or early 1967. The initial
    unmanned launch of a fully equipped laboratory is scheduled for
    1968. This will be followed later that year by the first of five flights
    with two-man crews.
        â€œThe Air Force has selected the Douglas Aircraft Company to design
     and to build the spacecraft in which the crew of the laboratory will
    live and operate. The General Electric Company will plan and develop
    the space experiments.
        â€œThe Titan 3C booster will launch the laboratory into space and a â€˜
    modified version of the NAS4 Gemini capsule will be the vehicle in
    which the astronauts return to earth.â€
        President Johnson emphasized that the U S . would â€œlive up to our
     agreement not to orbit weapons of mass destruction and we will continue
    to hold to all nations, including the Soviet Union, the hand of
     cooperation in the exciting vears of space exploration which lie ahead
    for all of us. . . .â€ He directed NASA Administrator James E. Webb

  OSC-c was launched from Eastern Test Range, with a Delta booster,
    fell into the south Atlantic Ocean after failing to achieve orbit.
    First two stages of the launch vehicle performed perfectly: fol-
    lowing second stage cutoff and an approximate 7-min. coast period,
    small rockets mounted on a table between the second and third stage
    ignited and spun the table up to 120 rpm; second stage separated, but
    the third stage ignited about 514 sec. prematurely, was not properly
     aimed, and did not attain orbital speed.
        OSO-c was third in a series of eight orbiting solar observatories
     planned by NASA. First two satellites were launched from Kennedy
     Space Center, NASA, March 7 , 1962, and February 3, 1965. OSO-c
     I had provided more than 2,000 hrs. of scientific information during its
     lifetime; oso 11 was still operating. The Orbiting Solar Observatory

  DOD would initiate a demonstration program of a high-performance
     cryogenic engine in FY 1966, which could provide up to 50% payload
     increase in the future, Dr. Harold Brown, Director of DOD Research
     and Engineering, told a closed session of the Senate Aeronautical and
     Space Sciences Committee. Brown said that the program, which would
     be closely coordinated with NASA, would provide the design data
     necessary to initiate n high-performance engine development program
     in the future.
        Dr. Brown suggested that the 1975-1985 time period might include
     operational reusable spacecraft, possibly growing out of an Mol pro-
     gram requirement for data return or logistic resupply. He foresaw an
     evolution of â€œreentry spacecraft shapes which will provide greater
     flexibility of operations, enjoy higher reusability, and possess close to
     the same volumetric efficiency of current reentry spacecraft. These
     high performance maneuverable reentry spacecraft should be capable
     of performing missions calling for fast tactical response and greater

   Distinction between â€œorbitâ€ and â€œrevolution7â€™ was discussed by John
     A. Osmundsen in a New York Times article: â€œAn orbit is simply the
     completion of a circuit in space.
        â€œA revolution, on the other hand, is two consecutive passages of
     a satellite over a particular meridian on earth. . . .
        â€œThe switch in terminology from orbits to revolutions was desirable
     for practical reasons involving ground tracking, ground-to-satellite
     communications and the execution of satellite experiments geared
     to terrestrial features, such as volcanoes and clouds.
        â€œIt is important to make the distinction between orbits and revolu-
     tions . . . because a satellite moving east completes an orbit in less
     time than it takes to complete a revolution. Hence, it will make fewer
     revolutions than orbits.â€ (Osmundsen, NYT, 8/26/65, C17)
  Plans for the exploration of Mars called for an engineering test shot
     in 1969 and an unmanned landing in 1971, Robert F. Fellows,

     scheduled for 1973 and 1975; larger capsules-up          to three tons-
     were expected t o land in the early 1980â€™s. Fellows said that the 1971
     mission would require two pieces of hardware: an orbiter that would
     circle Mars for up to 50 yrs. and a capsule that would be lowered to the
     surface of the planet. The orbiter would have a scientific payload up
                                                                          399

    would penetrate the thin Martian atmosphere protected by a heat shield
    and, after landing, deploy its instruments, take soil samples, and relay
    the data to earth. Fellows confirmed that the interplanetary mission
    after Mars would be to Venus, with Jupiter next. (AP, Wash. Post,

    United States Air Force has been demanding orbiting laboratories for
    years. The reason is essentially defensive. Such space laboratories
    could have the capacity to intercept and destroy enemy satellites.
    Their value for surveillance is obvious. As President Johnson said,
     they will provide â€˜new knowledge about what man is able to do in spaceâ€™
     and â€˜will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of the nation.â€™
        â€œThe MOLâ€™S however, will naturally be capable of offense as well as
     defense. It was therefore significant that President Johnson should
     have taken the opportunity to couple his announcement with a new
     peaceful gesture toward Moscow for cooperation in the space pro-
     gram. . . .,â€™ ( N Y T , 8/26/65, 30M)
  The Wall Street Journal, commenting on President Johnsonâ€™s decision to
     develop Manned Orbital Laboratory, wrote : â€œThe President didnâ€™t
     enumerate the MOL experiments, but there is little doubt they would
     involve such possible missions as :

     â€œOnce again we are asked to silently acquiesce to a questionable mili-

     superiority in ICBMâ€™s. . .

     Soviet scientists stand a much greater likelihood of acceptance if
     coupled with an offer of diplomatically exploring the possibility of
     not constructing such armaments?

  Policy shift reflected in Administration approval of the Manned Orbiting

       â€œ. . . President [Johnson] has not committed the Nation to a long-
    term Air Force manned space flight effort. But what he has done is

  Washington Post editorial comment on President Johnsonâ€™s assignment
    of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project to the Air Force:
        â€œ. . . Anxiety arises out of the Air Force commitment to total
    secrecy in its space operations. . . . [NASA] has pursued a brilliantly
    successful open public information policy. It has made every Ameri-
    can a participant in its exciting conquest of space, aroused the naiiurd
    interest in the whole world of science, stirred the youth of the country
    to enthusiasm and stimulated national pride. The Vandenberg Air
    Force Base which will become a major site for MOL launching has op-
    erated under a veil of secrecy. . . .
        â€œThe Pentagon has not yet devised a policy for informing the public
    on the man-in-space MOL project. If it continues the Vandenberg
    policies of the past, the country is going to know very little about MOL.
    Such secrecy is bound to arouse international suspicions and alarms,
    particularly since the flights will be over Soviet territory. Either this
    is primarily a project in the peaceful penetration of space that requires
    little secrecy; or it is a secret military project that cannot be recon-

August 28: Prof. Robert H. Dicke of Princeton Univ. suggested in the
    Astronomical Journal that a way to map the sunâ€™s shape as a test of
    Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity would be to use measurements of the
    orbit of the asteroid Icarus as it passed within 4 million mi. of earth
    on June 15, 1968. Two peculiarities would make Icarus, discovered
402              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

   in 1949, valuable for such an experiment: (1) Icarus was the only
   body in the solar system known to pass inside the orbit of Mercury;
    and ( 2 ) Icarusâ€™ orbit was highly inclined to that of the other planets.
    Dr. Dicke proposed that measurements be taken when the planet cut
    across the plane of the earthâ€™s orbit. If the two measured points
    changed with each close passage to the sun, then the sun would be
    known to be less than a perfect sphere. And, the amount by which
    it was not truly spherical would be known precisely.
        If the sunâ€™s radius at the equator exceeded its polar radius by as
    little as 0.005%, the distortion of the sunâ€™s gravitational field that this
    would cause would be enough to account for 10% of the predicted
    effect on Mercuryâ€™s orbit. But the general theory of relativity had
    already accounted for the peculiarities in Mercuryâ€™s orbit. Therefore,
    if the distortion were found, the theory must be incorrect. In other
    words, said Dr. Dicke, gravitational attraction of one body for another
    must be accounted foi, not by relativity, but by some other mechanism.

August 29: President Johnson commented on the success of the GEMIN; v
    flight during a news conference at his Texas ranch: â€œThis is a mo-
    ment of great achievement, not only for astronauts Gordon Cooper
    and Charles Conrad, but for those whose hopes have ridden with
    Gemini 5.
        â€œI am so happy that Mr. Webb and Mr. Seamans, who had so much
    to do directing this very successful venture, are here to share with us
    the pride we all feel today, And I deeply regret that our late, beloved
    President Kennedy, under whose leadership all of this work was so
    carefully planned and thought out, canâ€™t be here to enjoy the fruits
    and success of his planning and his forethought.
        â€œThe successful completion of the eight-day, 3-million mile flight of
    the Gemini 5 proves, I think, not only manâ€™s capacity for endurance in
    space, but it proves that man is in space to stay.
        (6
           We can be, and we are enormously proud of every member of our
    space team. That means all the scientists, and the technicians, and
    the controllers, and the trackers-to everyone who contributed in any
    way. As President of this country, I want, this afternoon, to extend
    the thanks of the entire nation for a job well done. To Gordon Cooper
    and Charles Conrad, and to their wonderful families, I want to simply
    repeat again: we are all very deeply proud of you.
                                                                       4.03

      â€œThe difficulties and disappointments of this flight have served to
   increase our appreciation, respect and trust for the skill and ability of
                                all their posts of duty. We can face the
   all the men involved-at
   challenges and opportunities with far greater confidence and certainty
   -and this is an unmistakable gain.
      â€œOnly seven years ago we were neither first nor second in s p a c e
   we were not in space at all. Today the capacity of this country for
   leadership in this realm is no longer in valid question or dispute.
   Openly, proudly, we are proceeding on our course willing always to
   share our knowledge, our gains with all mankind. I would repeat and
   renew this countryâ€™s invitation to all nations to join together to make
   this adventure a joint adventure.
      â€œThis globe seems smaller today than ever before.
      â€œSomehow the problems which yesterday seemed large and ominous
   and insoluble today appear less foreboding. As man increases his
   knowledge of the heavens, why should he fear the unknown on earth?
   As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer
   to his neighbor?
      â€œAs we push ever more deeply into the universe-probing its secrets
    and discovering its way-we      must also learn to cooperate across the
    frontiers that divide earthâ€™s surface.
       â€œNo national sovereignty rules in outer space. Those who venture
   there go as envoys of the human race. Their quest must be for all
   mankind-and what they find belongs to all mankind. That is the
   basis of the program of which astronauts Cooper and Conrad are a
   part. . . .
       â€œThis flight of Gemini 5 was a journey of peace by men of peace.
   Its successful conclusion is a noble moment for mankind-and a fitting
    opportunity for us to renew our pledge to continue our search for a
   world in which peace reigns and justice prevails.
       â€œTO demonstrate the earnestness of that pledge, and to express our
    commitment to the peaceful uses of space exploration, I intend to ask
    as many of our astronauts as possible-when their schedule and pro-
                       visit various capitals of the world. Some, I hope,
    gram permit-to
    will be able to journey abroad soon.
       â€œGemini is but the beginning. We resolve to have many more such
   journeys-in space and on earth-until man at last is at peace with
   himself.â€ (Transcript, Pres. Doc., 9/6/65, 170-72)

August 29: Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) , chairman of Subcommittee on
    Manned Space Flight of the House Committee on Science and Astro-
    nautics, said at MSC that NASAâ€™s 1967 budget would be limited to
                                        FY
    about the same level as the FY 1966 budget ($5.3 billion) because of
    military expenses in Viet Nam. He said NASA would like â€œ$200 million
    or $300 million moreâ€ for FY 1967. â€œWith the war in Viet Nam, I
    doubt thereâ€™ll be more money for NASA. And NASA needs more money
    than it is getting now to use its team with top efficiency.â€ (Houston

August 30: GEMINI v astronauts Cooper and Conrad flew to Kennedy Space
    Center, NASA, following a night onboard the aircraft carrier Lake
    Champlain. Upon their arrival, Florida Governor Haydon Burns pre-

    mission. Intensive medical examinations begun on the carrier were
    continued on Merritt Island. (Toth, Wash. Post, 8/31/65; Clark,

  The appropriateness of President Johnsonâ€™s comments on the achieve-
    ments of Astronauts Cooper and Conrad during the GEMINI v space-
    flight was discussed editorially in the New York Times: â€œHe did not
    gloat over the evident Soviet discomfiture at the United States forging
    ahead in the space race. Nor did he follow the repeated Soviet practice
    of claiming that a particular achievement in the cosmos somehow
    â€˜provedâ€™ the superiority of one political system over another. Instead,
    he appealed to all nations to join together for the conquest of space,
    an arena in which cooperation could help ease world tensions.
        â€œ. . . the Presidentâ€™s statement . . . should help to dispel . . .
    fears. He has made clearer than ever that this country sincerely wants
    full cooperation in space. If Gemini 5â€™s flight helps to bring that
    objective closer, its immediate political contribution will rival its
    enormous gains for science and for technology.â€ ( N Y T , 8/30/65,

August 31 : â€œI certainly have seen nothing in the eight-day data that would
    lead me to be worried about a 14-day flight,â€ Dr. Charles A. Berry,
    chief physician for the astronauts, told reporters at a news briefing
    in Cocoa Beach. He said that the GEMINI v astronauts were in good
    physical condition and were returning to normal as quickly as had
    the pilots of the four-day Gemini GT-4 flight in June. Changes in
    such indicators as the heart rate and blood pressure characteristics
    seemed to reflect adaptation to the weightless space environment and,
    later, to the stress of returning to normal gravity of earth, Dr. Berry
    explained. Heart rates became lower in space and rose above normal
    on returning to earth. At first, on return to earth, blood pressure did
    not respond as promptly as normal to tilt-table tests designed to show
    how well the circulatory system copes with sudden changes from hori-
    zontal to neariy-verticai posture.
        Cooper and Conrad lost about 7% and 8Vl lbs. respectively, but had
    gained most of it back. This loss might have been a response to the
    space environment but was believed to be partly water loss after re-
    entry while waiting in the sun to be rescued, Berry said. Both
    seemed to be less tired than their predecessors. (Schmeck, NYT,
    9/1/65, 1, 15)
 The world applauded the success of the GEMINI v mission: many leaders
    in Western Europe sent congratulatory cables to President John-
    son, and newspapers in Great Britain, Malaysia, India, and
    Japan were among those giving the flight front-page coverage. The
    Soviet Union televised pictures of the astronauts and broadcast news
    reports of their landing. Only a few dissenting voices were heard-
    among them the Cuban newspaper Revolucion which described the
    flight as â€œcosmic espionage.â€ Communist China remained silent.

  President Johnson approved the following policy on the promotion and
     decoration of astronauts:
        â€œ1. Each military astronaut will receive a one grade promotion as a
     direct result of the first successful space flight, but not beyond the
     grade of colonel in the Air Force and Marine Corps or captain in the
     Navy. Promotions to general officer rank will be accomplished through
     usual military selection board process.
        â€œ2. Each Gemini astronaut will be awarded the NASA Medal for EX-
     ceptional Service (or Cluster) after completion of a successful space
     flight. The NASA Medal for Distinguished Service, the highest award
     which can be given by that agency, will be awarded for exceptional
     accomplishments in the Gemini program, including but not limited to
     accomplishments in actual flight.
        â€œ3. Military decorations associated with space flights, such as
     awards for exceptional heroism or other distinguished service, will be
                                                                        407

       â€œIn space research, development and exploration, the identity be.
    comes . . . more imperative. Aerospace companies go many routes
    attempting to achieve that goal. Leading aerospace companies, for
    example, developed a â€˜Zero Defectsâ€™ program aimed at reminding, re-

 Experts had observed that some plants had a n unusual ability to
    adapt to the most severe physical conditions, repnrted Aoiatsiya i

    with very small amounts of it, had been exposed to argon or
    nitrogen atmospheres, and had been exposed to extreme cold in ex-
    periments which tested the effects of a simulated Martian climate on
    plant growth. It had been found that the cucumber, a heat-sensitive
    variety of plant, could withstand an argon atmosphere and frost;
    lettuce, tomatoes, beans, turnips, and other plants had been grown in
    compartments supplied with extremely small amounts of oxygen. This
    led to the speculation that not only lichens but small shrubs might be
    indigenous to Mars and that there may in fact be a rich and varied
    Martian flora. (Aviatsiya i Kosmonavtika, 8/65, 96)

  Data were summarized from NIMBUS I meteorological satellite, which had
    provided first high-resolution. nighttime, cloud-cover pictures and
    cloud-top temperatures taken from a satellite. Circular 575-mi.-al-
     titude orbit had been planned for the 830-lb. spacecraft; but short burn
     of the Agena stage-resulting when about 100 Ibs. of fuel which
     should have been loaded on board the Agena had escaped through a
     faulty valve prior to launch-had injected NIMBUS I into an elliptical
     orbit. Launch was made Aug. 28, 1964.
        Results from Hrir (High Resolution Infrared Radiometer) data had
     demonstrated : ( 1) feasibility of complete nighttime surveillance of
     surface and land features on a global scale; (2) detailed vertical
     structure of intertropical convergence zone and formation of tropical
     storms and of frontal zones; ( 3 ) capability to detect temperature
     gradients over earthâ€™s surface under clear skies; (4) applicability of

   Fuel cells used in the GEMINI v mission August 21-29 were being
     developed by General Electric Co. for commercial use, Dr. Arthur M.
     Bueche, GE vice president for research and development, told a news
     conference in New York City. The first models, expected to be ready
     next year, would provide only 12 watts [GEMINI v cells provided 2,000
     watts] but could power remote television cameras and other com-
     munications equipment. Larger units might soon provide emergency
     power to homes, Dr. Bueche said. ( N Y T , 9/2/65,38C)
   Man can withstand spaceflights as long as 30 days without suffering
     serious biological damage, L/Col. Edward C. Knoblock, director of the
     Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and member of the medical
      debriefing team for Project Mercury flights, told the annual convention
            the    American    Association          Clinical   Chemists    in
                                              of
     of
     Chicago. Although GEMINI v relayed signals on the rate of breathing,
      body temperature, heart heat, and perspiration, the more sophisticated
     equipment needed to reflect the astronautsâ€™ body chemistry would be
      available on the proposed 14-day flight of a larger manned orbital
     laboratory. (Powers, Chic. Trib., 9/2/65)
  â€œThe Pentagon has surprised almost everyone with its promptness
     in applying the first squeeze of censorship and news manage-
     ment to its new manned orbiting laboratory ( M O L ) program,â€
      wrote William Hines in the Washington Evening Star. â€œMost people
      assumed that soon after the military got a manned role in space, it
      would start classifying it, but few could have foreseen the rapidity
      with which restrictions came. The elapsed time from President John-
      sonâ€™s announcement of the start of MOL at his press conference last
      week to the Pentagonâ€™s first fumbling bit on news management was
      exactly 2 hours. . . .

         â€œThe Defense Department is not the only traducer of a free news
     flow. The space agency gives news management the old college try
    every time a manned spacecraft goes up.
         â€œOf all the significant news locations in a Gemini flight, the only
     one not covered by the combined news media . . . is the most impor-
     tant one of all, the mission control center at Houston.

            But neither camera nor tape recorder nor pen-and-paper reporter
     is allowed in the nonsecret room at any time during a
     flight. . . . This is not to suggest that there has been any coverup to
     date. In the course of missions, [Christopher] Kraft gives regular,
     full, and apparently frank accounts of flight activities and opens him-
    self to detailed questioning. So do his associates. A mission com-
    mentary of less consistent accuracy and authenticity is broadcast.
         â€œBut whether or not there has been suppression to date is not the
     point. All flights so far have ended happily, and nothing succeeds
     like success. There has been no reason for a coverup.
         â€œThe point is that the opportunity for news management definitely
     exists in mission control-and it is an axiom of political science that
     where opportunity exists, there are always people waiting to seize
     it.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 9/1/65)

September 2 : Commenting on American contributions to space science,
    N. M. Sissakian, Soviet biochemist, wrote in Prauda: â€œSoviet scientists
    note with satisfaction the considerable contribution of American sci-
     ence to the study and opening up of cosmic space, which specifically
    manifested itself in a series of flights of cosmonauts in one-seater and
    two-seater ships. Most essential results were obtained by the Ameri-
                                                                             .

        â€œ. . . The flight of G . Cooper and C. Conrad was additional proof
     that the state of weightlessness during the minimum time required for
     a flight to the moon and back does not cause essential physiological
     changes in the human organisms and has no noticeable influence on
     his ability to work.
        â€œOf great interest in the cosmic flight of man from the biological
     viewpoint is the study of such problems as the functional state of the
     cardiovascular system, the water-salt exchange, and the vestibular ap-
     paratus.
        â€œAboard the ship Gemini 5 a number of physiological
     experiments . . . were performed. The method tested on the Cosmo-
     naut C. Conrad of inflated cuffs around the extremities, which were
     intended to maintain the necessary functional vigor of the cardiovascu-
     lar system, merits attention. . . .
        â€œThe flight of Gemini 5 is a great success for U S . scientists. The
     Soviet scientists sincerely congratulate Cosmonauts G. Cooper and C.
     Conrad on the successful conclusion of their flight, giving due credit to
     their courage and endurance. They transmit to the scientists and the
    entire personnel which prepared and carried out the flight their con-

     up of the cosmos.â€ (Prauda, 9/2/65)
  Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., had demon-
     strated during their August 21-29 GEMINI v flight that a manned
     weather satellite could become a valuable part of Weather Bu-
     reau forecasting, Howard Simons reported in the Washington Post.
     U S . weather forecasters needed information on tropical storm
     Doreen moving through the Pacific. Cooper and Conrad observed the
     storm and fixed its position, acquiring the information earlier than
     TIROS x meteorological satellite and more precisely than a ship 150 mi.

  Refined data on Martian atmosphere's density, ionization, and com-
     position, based on analysis of radio signals from MARINER IV dur-
     ing its occultation experiment, were reported by scientists at Ameri-
     can Geophysical Union meeting held at Southern Methodist Univ., Dal-
     las, Tex. Martian atmosphere was now thought to be much thinner
     than previously believed: it now seemed that air pressure at Martian
     surface was only about one-5,OOOth that of earth. Theory that Mar-
     tian atmosphere was more dense at heights of 25 mi. or more above
     the surface than earth's at comparable elevations was not upheld; ob-
     servations reported today indicated Martian atmosphere was thinner
     than earth's at all elevations. Temperature was about -250' at loca-
     tion of maximum ionization in Martian atmosphere (78-mi. altitude,
     about one-fourth the expected height). In earth's ionosphere, tem-
     perature is higher than 2,200' F. Atmospheric composition that
     would account for the MARINER IV observations, the scientists said,
     would be largely carbon dioxide. (Earth-based observations of Mars
     had shown the presence of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere.) Only
     scant amount of carbon dioxide is present in earth's nitrogen-oxygen
     atmosphere. The scientists making this report were Dr. A. J. Kliore

  Paraglider, in its first successful manned free flight, demonstrated it
     could guide a spacecraft to preselected landing site. Test pilot Donald
     F. McCusker landed a Gemini-type test craft at Edwards AFB, following
     a four-and-one-half-minute flight suspended beneath the wing. He put
     the previously-inflated paraglider and simulated spacecraft through a
     series of turn and pitch maneuvers enroute to his landing, after being
     towed aloft by helicopter and dropped at approximate 8,000-ft. alti-
     tude.
        In actual spacecraft recovery, the paraglider would be stored in a
     ten-cubic-foot canister onboard the spacecraft. After reentry when the
     vehicle would be slowed by the earth's atmosphere and parachute dro-
     gue, the paraglider would be deployed to its full size-31 ft. long with
    a 31-ft. span-using       an onboard nitrogen supply. The astronaut
     would control his glide through an onboard flight-control system.

September 3: Speculation that the earth might briefly have had another

     of fireball showers, was reported in Science. Discovery of a 47-mi..
     long string of craters and meteorites extending northeast to southwest
     in northcentral Argentina led scientists to propose that the rare mete-
     orites, consisting of almost pure iron, might be remnants of a single
     object which had orbited inside the Roche Limit, been torn apart by the
     gravity of the earth, and fallen from orbit. Perigee of the hypotheti-

  Washington Post discussed the role of a manned orbiting laboratory
      (MOL) in arms control: â€œThe primary mission of MOL, a canvass
     of Washington officials makes clear, is without a doubt to have
     man supplement the machine as a shutterbug spy in the sky. Hence
     man will advance the sensationally successful camera work of the un-
     manned Samos series of photo reconnaissance satellites now producing
     thousands of pictures of the Soviet Union and Communist China.

               ...
      the^^^
         â€œHere is what the Air Force believes . . . men will be able to do:.
         â€œThey can use their judgment on what to photograph. They can be
      selective on when and where to aim not only one camera but a series
      of cameras including new and experimental photographic equipment.
      They can shoot accurately through a hole in clouds. And they can
      maintain and repair equipment that may have become inoperative. . . .
         â€œHow . . . will MOL contribute to arms control?
         â€œThe thesis is that the two major nuclear powers are deterred not
      only by the nuclear weapons they possess but by what each knows-
      and how fast it knows-about what goes on, in a military sense, in the
      otherâ€™s country. It is hoped that MOL will immensely add to that
      American capability in relation not only to the Soviet Union, but to
      China and, indeed, the whole world.
         â€œIndeed, it is not inconceivable that these developments could lead
      to manned synchronous satellites, able to hover over Russia and the
      United States ready to flash instant word on missile firings, rocket
      tests, nuclear explosions, mass troop movements or other important
      military activities.
         â€œThe logic of this, from the arms controllersâ€™ viewpoint, is that all
      this could lead to a formal worldwide inspection agreement-peace-

September 5: Significance of supersonic transport development was dis-

        â€œThe 1,450-mile-per-hour Concorde is due to be ready for service in
     1971 while the present schedule would have a U S . SST flying by 1974.

  William Hines commented on the economy of low bidding in an article
     in the Washington Evening Star: â€œThe lowest bidder still produces
     hardware for Uncle Samâ€™s space effort, and this arrangement does not
      always prove the most economical in either time or money. A glaring
     example has developed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where
     Americaâ€™s moonport is rapidly nearing completion.
         â€œThe lowest bidder has built two huge tank-like vehicles called
      â€˜crawler-transportersâ€™ there, at a saving of almost $3 million below a
      competitive bidderâ€™s price. The only trouble is that the crawlers will
      not do the job they were designed for, which is to carry a Saturn V
      moon rocket on a mobile launching tower some three miles from an
      assembly building to where the rocket will actually blast.
         â€œTrouble has been traced to some tapered roller bearings. . . .
         â€œThere seems to be nothing wrong with the bearings, which are
      produced by the biggest and best known manufacturer of such
      items. The fault apparently lies in incorrect design assumptions
      which result in overloads sometimes being imposed on the bearings,
      causing them to fail.
         â€œSince the design-offered by the contractor, Marion Power Shovel
      Co.-was     approved by NASA technical experts, the government will
     probably have to pay for the redesign necessary to make the crawler
      work. These redesign costs could well wipe out the difference between
      Marionâ€™s bid and the higher proposal of Bucyrus-Erie, another large
      builder of heavy mobile equipment. . . .
         â€œAs it turns out, the false economy of low bidding in this instance
      may cause the United States to miss its stated goal in space: men on
      the moon in the â€™60s. Entirely aside from whether this is a worth-

        â€œPerhaps the most serious problem . . . stems apparently from an

    the nine planets of our solar system it became evident that we have
    neglected to formally name our own planet. At least this is the only
    conclusion one can come to when itâ€™s noted that we capitalize the
    names of all the planets except our own. Webster, himself, insists on
    using a lower case â€˜eâ€™ for earth while dignifying tiny Mercury with a
    capital. Even the minor planets such as Eros carry formal names.
        â€œThe neglect is even more conspicuous in the instance of our own
    natural satellite. While the moons of other planets have exotic names
    such as Phobos we refer to ours in the generic and, consequently, with

        â€œI suggest we either start capitalizing Earth and Moon or else ask
    the American Society of Newspaper Editors to convene an internation-

  The possible implications of President Johnsonâ€™s decision to de-
    velop a manned orbiting laboratory were discussed by Raymond
     Senter in The New Republic:
        â€œPresident Johnsonâ€™s decision to allow the Air Force to build and
     launch five manned orbital laboratories (MOL), at a cost of $1.5 bil-
     lion or more, is likely to increase tensions between the US and the USSR
     and to spark a similar military space program by the Russians. If so,
     the Air Force will certainly urge further escalation of its own military
     space program, raising the specter that space will become a fantasti-
     cally expensive battlefield of the future. . . .
        â€œIt is, however, possible that MOL will demonstrate the feasibility of
     a few American and Soviet spacemen in their respective spacecraft
     operating a continuous space watch. If it does, and if both nations
     exercise restraint, it could have a stabilizing effect, as have our mutual
     unmanned reconnaissance satellites. If man can be an efficient ob;
     server in orbit for extended periods, the time may come when the US.
     should invite the United Nations to maintain a continuous space pa-
     trol, with a multi-national crew, to warn of any impending or surprise
     attack.â€ (Senter, The New Republic, 9/11/65,9)

        â€œGemini V also demonstrated the capability of man to withstand
    prolonged periods of weightlessness. The adaptability of the human
    body was indicated by the performance of the astronauts. For exam-
     ple, their heartbeat rates gradually dropped to a level significantly
     lower than their preflight normal rates, but by the fourth day, adapted
     to the weightless condition and leveled off. Upon return to Earth, the
     heartbeat rates were slightly higher than normal, as expected, but re-

     the Gemini 5 flight when it became apparent that Astronauts Cooper
     and Conrad would surpass the world space flight endurance record set
     by Soviet Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky in June 1963. Tass . . .

  Harry Schwartz discussed the â€œNew Arms Race in Spaceâ€ in the

     at a time when the Soviet Union was publicly attacking Gemini 5 as
     primarily a venture in military espionage. Just why the President
     chose precisely that time to supply the Russian propagandists with
     supporting ammunition is still a puzzle.
         â€œMoreover, by underlining the potential military significance of
     space, the President may have finally ended any last lingering hope
     that there might be a joint Soviet-American program for sending a
     man to the moon or to some more distant objective in the solar system.
         â€œMost serious is the indication that the Soviet Union and its allies
      have interpreted the M.O.L. decision as the American signal for an
      arms race in space.

    be on science and applications experiments.
        â€œThe foundation for any long-range and broad national space pro-
     gram is a strong manned Earth-orbital program. For example, the
     approach to future manned planetary missions will depend not only on
     what is learned from unmanned missions such as Mariner and

         Soviet Cosmonaut Pave1 Belyayev reported at the IAF congress that
      the exit of cosmonauts into space from orbital stations to relieve the
      crews and perform work in space would be made only through air
      locks, making it possible to avoid dehermetization of the
      spacecraft. Belyayev said visual acuity of astronauts was lessened by
      from 2 6 3 0 % during spaceflight. Sensitivity of the eye to color was
      also affected. Drop of 50% occurred in the case of green and purple.
          Cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov described in his report the functioning
       of the self-contained life-support system he wore in open space. He
       was able to regulate the atmosphere in his spacesuit, maintaining with-
       in it an excess pressure of $3.4 atmospheres or 0.27 at-
       mospheres. When he stepped out of VOSKHOD 11, Leonov said, the
       excess pressure in the spacesuit was g.4 atmospheres and before
       reentry into the spacecraft, he said: â€œI once more set the pressure back
      to $3.27 atmospheres.â€ Data obtained, he summed up, permitted the
      conclusion that stepping out into open space does not cause serious
      specific changes in psychophysiological functions.
         Of the future of the Soviet space program, he said: â€œIn time there

         A voyage in a seven-man spacecraft, past Venus to land on Mars,
      was proposed by Robert L. Sohn of the Space Technology Laboratories
       in a paper at the 16th Congress of the International Astronautical
       Federation in Athens. Sohn said the flight could be conducted in the
       1980â€™s using launching equipment and spacecraft already in develop-
       ment, including Saturn launch vehicles and modified Apollo
       spacecraft. He further claimed that the billion-mile, 400-day trip
        would cost about $20 billion. A 400,000-lb. craft would be assembled
                                                                         431

        Soviet Professor Savenko reported to the congress about the study
     of primary cosmic rays by PROTON I, launched July 16, 1965. Vol-
     ume of information radioed back to earth was 60 million units
     daily. Equipment was sensitive to particles of energy of â€œbillions and
    more of electron volts which makes it possible for the station to ex-
     plore the depth of matter.â€ Design of the ionization calorimeter in
     PROTON I permitted improved methods of research, Professor Savenko
     said. Information relayed from PROTON I processed so far showed
     that distribution of cosmic ray particles of very high energies differed
     from picture obtained by indirect measurements. (Tass, 9/17/65)

September 13: Reporting on the Lunar International Laboratory, under
     consideration by the International Astronautical Federation meeting in
     Athens, William Hines, in the Washington Evening Star, said the case
     for Lil had been outlined this way:
        â€œ1. A spaceship is horribly expensive; it costs $l5,ooc! =ow to bnost
     one pound of instruments to the moon, and will cost $180,000 a man
     hour to sustain scientists in space in the 1970s.
        â€œ2. The precedent exists for international scientific efforts: nuclear
     physicists already are discussing a trillion-volt atom smasher of which
     the world needs only one.
        â€œ3. The concept of international science has been accepted by the
     United Nations since 1946. . . .
        â€œ4. While the Russians have not taken an official stand, Sedov and
     others last year openly discussed Soviet studies on moon construction.
        â€œ[C. Stark] Draper [Director of MIT Instrumentation Laborato-
     ry] . . . has called for a computer center on the moon to collect data
     there and pass it on to earthly campuses and laboratories with infor-
     mation literally unavailable here. The Lil program has not yet
     reached the cost effectiveness and design stages yet, but at the rate the
     Apollo program to land men on the moon by 1970 is going, backers
     say only 10 to 20 years is needed. A curbstone opinion is that $20
     billion to $30 billion . . . comparable to the Apollo costs-would han-
     dle the construction and start of Lil operations.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve.

September 14: In a White House ceremony, President Johnson conferred
     Exceptional Service Medals on GEMINI v Astronauts L. Gordon
     Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., and Dr. Charles Berry, chief surgeon
     for the astronauts. The President announced that military promotions
     for the astronauts would be submitted to the Senate
     immediately. (Richard, Push. Post, 9/15/65, A3)
        Following the ceremony, Vice President Hubert Humphrey accom-
     panied the astronauts, their families, and Dr. Berry to the National
     Academy of Sciences. Humphrey told the Academy: â€œThe achieve-
                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965
432
      ments of our astronauts are not just the achievements of two
      men. They are the achievements of family, country and of a so-
      ciety. . . .
         â€œThis is the best example of cooperation between Government and
      industry, between public and private, that I know in this nation, and
      might I add, that it is an example that should be emulated by many
      others in many other endeavors in this country.
         â€œBut our space program . . . is more than national. It would be
      well enough if it were only national, but it is more than that. It is
      truly international. And I want . . . to stress our space programâ€™s
      potential as an arm of our foreign policy, of our international rela-
      tions, and particularly of our peace policy, because this Government
      has but one objective in the world: a just, honorable and enduring
      peace. . . .â€
         Astronaut Cooper summarized some of the things that man could do
      in space:
          â€œ. . . we again showed that man can do a great deal of geological
       observations while in space. . . . I think it is very significant that
      although you pass across some [geological formations] rather rapidly
      you still are able to . . . observe them and you are very capable of
       photographing them in great detail.
          â€œ. . . man is very capable of doing oceanographic obser-
       vations. We have noted that you can detect a great deal of de-
       tail as to the depths of water, as to the currents of running water, and
       even to wind patterns that run on the waters, the wave patterns caused
       by the wind.
          â€œ. . . man could do a great deal of weather observations, both in
       real time and photographically. And we . . . were able to pinpoint
       one tropical storm in between some of the planned observations, and
      apparently that was very accurate pinpointing of its position.
          â€œWe determined in o u r discussions later with the Weather Bureau
       people, that for future use . . . we could get much greater accuracy
      even on pinpointing these by the use of our platform combination and
       taking angles to a great deal more accuracy, rather than just estima-
       tions of the angular distance and locations.
          â€œWe found that you could do a great deal of visual observations of
       the phenomena around the earth . . . we picked up ship wakes, sever-
       al hundred miles away of . . . the contrast of the white wake against
       the blue background in very clear weather areas. . . .â€
          Conrad revealed that photographs taken during the GEMINI v mission
       at the request of the Mexican government, had located volcanoes in
       Mexico that â€œthe Mexicans didnâ€˜t know they had. . . .â€ He also said:
       â€œI think a system that has been left out and nobody has talked about is
       our environmental control system, which performed in a most out-
       standing manner for eight days. We had probably the nicest, freshest
       air that anybody could want to breathe, and we had an unusual first in
       the space business: most environmental control systems had been load-
       ed down and pilot after pilot came back and said they were too warm,
       and we fought and fought it, and at McDonnell, to have a little change
       made because of some of the problems of heat exchange between the
       inlet and outlet pipes. It turned out that we were too cold.
                                                                        433
                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

        â€œWith two tubes running, we were probably the first ones to shut
    the cabin heat exchanger down and run everything as hot as we could
    get i t in there. We were just right. And the thing that most sur-
    prised us on opening the hatch on landing, we couldnâ€˜t tell the
    difference between inside and out, and that is a monumental job for
    that small system.â€
        Dr. Berry concluded the program by presenting a review of the
    medical data received from the GEMINI v mission.
        The astronautsâ€™ party then proceeded to the Capitol where Vice
    President Humphrey presented them to the Senate and then to the
    House. Cooper told the House: â€œWe set out with our prime objective
    on Gemini 5 to fly 8 days. We were to fly this 8 days primarily to
    show that man, with all the various equipment on board, and the
    machines, could safely and very functionally do this 8-day mission
                                                                        .
    with no adverse effects. We were entirely successful in this. . .â€
    Conrad explained: â€œGemini 5 was a significant advance in the
    whole program in that we flew the first all-out spacecraft. We
    would not have been able to go without the fuel cells for 8 days. This
    was the first time they were flown. We had the first radars from
    which we got some very excellent data to enable the G T - ~to continue
     with their present rendezvous plans. It was the first time that the
    cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen had been run
    that long in space. . . .â€
        Dr. Berry told the Senate: â€œWe are conducting a program such as
    this [Gemini program] . . . to make man a vital part of such a re-
    search effort and to show the facility that man has to gain scientific
    information using vehicles such as we are able to build in this
    country. . . .
        â€œI think I can report, so far as information has been obtained in
    this country to date and at the moment, that we are the only ones who
    have that sort of information for the duration of which we are
     speaking. We can confidently say that man has been able to perform
    very well up to 4 days in a weightless state earlier, and on this mission
     8 days in a weightless state. He has then been able to re-adapt back
    to a 1-G environment. We have living proof of that.â€ (Texts; CR,

   Suggestion that synthesis of life should be a national goal by Dr. Charles

      total national scientific enterprise or could it be fitted in only by cut-
      ting back on other sectors, particularly the very expensive programs in
      space or particle physics? Would mankind benefit more if the funds
      needed for this project were devoted instead to less exotic but perhaps
      more vital needs of ending the pollution of the air we breathe and the
      water we hope to drink? The verdict on Dr. Priceâ€™s proposal is by no
      means immediately obvious.
         â€œThe most unfortunate result that could come from Dr. Priceâ€™s
      suggestion would be the mounting of a new international competition,
      a â€˜life raceâ€™ that would produce the same tension and needless duplica-
      tion that the space race has produced. Men of many nations have
      contributed to the progress that makes it possible now to consider the

September 19: Progress report in Pravda on ZOND 111: â€œSoviet automatic
     space station Zond 3 launched July 18, 1965, continued its orbital
    flight gradually moving farther away from the sun. On September 15,
     the space station was 12.5 million kilometers away from the
     earth. During this period 75 radio-communication sessions were held
     with the station. During these sessions, photos of the far side of the
     moon, comprehensive telemetric data on the physical processes in in-
     terplanetary space, and data on the stationâ€™s instruments and systems
     were transmitted to earth. To check the systems that make it possible
     to change flight direction, the flight trajectory of Zond 3 was success-
     fully corrected on September 16 for experimental purposes. The as-
     troorientation system, which automatically orients on the sun and the
     star Canopus, turned the station into the specific position commanded
     from the earth and has maintained this orientation with great
     accuracy. Then the correcting engine was switched on and changed
     the flight speed of the station 50 meters per second at an angle of 45â€
     with respect to the direction to the earth. Radio control sessions with
     the station confirmed that the correction maneuver had been executed

  U S . policy decision to conduct space operations in an atmosphere of
     maximum public exposure received editorial comment from Robert
     Hotz in Aviation Week and Space Technology: â€œThe course of space

     that of the Soviets. It has projected an international aura of leader-
     ship and achievement that has permitted the whole world to share in
     US. space projects, both scientifically and emotionally. It has also
     applied a steady and increasing pressure on the Soviets to abandon
     their super-secrecy. . . .
        â€œThere is little doubt that the leadership in space technology passed
     to the US. during the course of last summer. But who, outside a
     small internal bloc of techno-politicians, would have realized this
     under a blanket of supersecrecy?â€ (Hotz, Av. Wk., 9/20/65,21)

September 21: In advance excerpts of his book, Waging Peace, 1956-1961,
     President Dwight D. Eisenhower related his â€œreactions to Sputnik and
     the Gaither Reportâ€ in October and November 1957. President Eisen-
     hower reviewed a meeting on October 8, 1957, with his principal mili-
     tary and scientific advisers. The late Deputy Secretary of Defense
     Donald A. Quarles reported: â€œThere is no doubt that the Army Red-
     stone could have orbited a satellite a year or more earlier. . . .â€
    Quarles reviewed the reasons for the separation of the IGY Vanguard
     satellite from the ballistic missile programs, saying: â€œThe Russians have
    done us a good turn, unintentionally, in establishing the concept of
    international space,â€ a principle confirmed by the orbiting of Sputnik
     over the air space of country after country. â€œLate that same morning,â€
    President Eisenhower wrote, â€œI directed Secretary of Defense Charles
    Wilson to have the Army prepare its Redstone at once as a backup for
    the Navy Vanguard.â€
        Of SPUTNIK 11, which orbited â€œLaikaâ€ on November 3, 1957, Presi-
     dent Eisenhower said it did not arouse American public opinion be-
     cause people â€œseemed to resent the sending a dog to certain death-a
     resentment that the Soviet propagandists tried to assuage a few days
     later by announcing that they had put poison in the last of Laikaâ€™s
     rations. . . .
        â€œThe public, however, became bewildered and upset when word got
     out that a far from optimistic secret report had been made to me in
    the National Security Council . . . called â€˜the Gaither Report.
        â€œThis was a period of anxiety. Sputnik had revealed the psy-
     dioiogicii! w!nerabi!itj. =f CUT peop!e. The Cnmmunists were steadily
    fomenting trouble and rattling sabers; our economy was sputtering
    somewhat, and the ceaseless and usually healthy self-criticism in which
     we of the United States indulge had brought a measure of
    self-doubt. Added to this was the failure of our first satellite launch-
     ing attempt [Vanguard] in the full glare of publicity and the alleged
    missile â€˜gapsâ€™ which political observers claimed they had detect-
    ed . . .
        â€œThe Soviet satellites,â€ President Eisenhower said, â€œwere a genuine
    technological triumph, and this was exceeded by their propaganda
    value. To uninformed persons in the world, Soviet success in one
    area led to the belief that Soviet communism was surging ahead in all
    types of activity.â€ (Wash. Post, 9/21/65, Al, A19)

  President Johnson signed into law the High-speed Ground Transporta-

             . . In recent decades, we have achieved technological miracles in
         â€˜b.

     our transportation. But there is one great exception.
         â€œWe have airplanes which fly three times faster than sound. We
     have television cameras that are orbiting Mars. But we have the same
     tired and inadequate mass transportation between our towns and cities
     that we had 30 years ago.
         â€œToday . . . an astronaut can orbit the earth faster than a man on
     the ground can get from New York to Washington. Yet, the same
     science and technology which gave us our airplanes and our space
     probes, I believe, could also give us better and faster and more eco-
     nomical transportation on the ground. And a lot of us need it more
     on the ground than we need it orbiting the earth. . . .
         â€œThe High-speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 really gives
     us, for the first time in history, a coordinated program for improving
     the transportation system that we have today, and making it a better
     servant to our people. . . .â€ (Text, Pres. Doc., 10/4/65,329-30)

     scribing the capability as a â€œplatformâ€ that could support whatever
     mission the Nation wanted, he cited the present indecision over the
    mission that should be undertaken after the lunar landing. Given the
     dihculty of obtaining a consensus from the American public and gov-

       â€œWe are creating new national resourcelof lasting value in these
    facilities; in the industrial and managerial capabilities w are develop-
                                                               e
    ing; and in the growing number of scientists and engineers who are
    learning about space and space technology.
       â€œWe are filling the pipelines of hardware and knowledge, and, as
    measured by the financial resources required, weâ€™re about halfway to-
    ward our first manned lunar mission in mid-1965.
       â€œWe are accumulating, in space, the basic scientific knowledge about
    the earth, the solar system, the universe, and about man himself.
       â€œWe are bringing benefits not only to the United States but to all
    the world through the use of space and space technology. . . .
       â€œWe are providing a much-needed stimulus to the energies and crea-
    tivity of people everywhere. . . .
       â€œWe are bringing about increased economic activity. , . .
       â€œAnd we are making certain . . . that the realm of space now open-

       â€œThe Military Implications of Spaceâ€ were discussed for the Gover-
    norâ€™s Conference by Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, AFSC Commander:
    â€œOur military efforts in space can be placed into three broad cate-
    gories: first, the development of space systems to support military mis-
    sions on earth; second, the development of defensive measures against
    possible enemy actions in space; and third, the conduct of experimen-
    tation and of programs aimed at pushing technology forward. . . .â€
       Schriever noted two examples of unmanned satellite systems: (1)
    the Nuclear Detection Program consisting of six Vela satellites gather-
    ing information on radiation backgrounds in far space and defining an
    operational nuclear detection system; and (2) communications satel-
    !ita. He reven!ed that ~n i~itiz!I(%D system to satisfy military com-
    municationsâ€™ requirements had been authorized by DOD for launch ear-
    ly next year and would include up to 23 satellites orbiting earth at
    random spacing at about 21,000-mi. altitude. The satellites would be
    launched in clusters of eight from three Titan IIIC boosters and then
    would be positioned along an orbital path. An advanced system was
    also planned in which expected life of each satellite would be increased
    from one and a half years to between three and five years.
       In the advancement of space technology he listed several major pro-
    grams : manned orbiting laboratory, space cabin experiments, develop-
    ment of cryogenic rocket engines, development of the scramjet, devel-
    opment of a spacecraft capable of maneuvering during reentry, and the
    Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Program (Start).

  Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
     Flight, discussed the national space program in address before the
     Hartford Rotary Club, Hartford, Conn. Looking toward the future,
    he said:
        â€œThe Gemini and Apollo-Saturn programs are providing this
     country with a broad base of technological, managerial, and resources
     capability which makes feasible a wide spectrum of space missions
     beyond the first lunar landings. This capability can be exploited in a
     wide range of earth orbital, lunar orbital, and lunar surface mis-
             .
     sions. . .
        â€œOver 90 percent of the Apollo program is directly applicable to our
     earth orbital capability. Many interesting ideas are under considera-
     tion on how to use this extended earth orbit capability to yield great
    benefits to mankind in his daily life on earth, and to conduct much
     significant scientific research.
        â€œWe are also studying the use of modified Apollo vehicles for mis-
     sions both in orbit about the moon and for exploration of the moonâ€™s
     surface. In lunar orbit, we can do mapping, surveying, and explora-
     tion of the moon. On the moon, we can conduct detailed exploration
     of the surface environment and the moonâ€™s overall properties. We are
     also looking at the moon as a base for astronomical and for biological
     studies.

  Dr. Willard Libby, UCLA, recommended development of a nuclear space-
    ship in his address before the Aerospace Instrumentation Symposium
    in Los Angeles: â€œThe only possible way of reaching into the deep
    reaches of space is by accelerating to incredible speeds, speeds that go
    far beyond those which we have obtained so far in the space program,
    and it is completely clear that the only way of reaching these speeds is
    by using atomic energy.â€ Libby specifically recommended considera-
    tion of a reactor complex capable of supplying 10,000 megawatts of
    power to an engine with a designed thrust of 15,000-20,000 lbs. Such
    a spaceship would cost billions of dollars and be a decade in the
    building, but â€œwith it we could expect literally to explore the Solar
    System,â€ Libby said. He noted that Project Orion-the use of atomic
    explosions to propel massive space platforms-might be useful for de-
    livering freight tc the moon, hut the shock of the explosions would
    pose difficulties for manned spaceflight. He was pleased with the suc-
    cess of the Rover-Phoebus thermally-heated atomic engines and felt
    they might be used to propel ships and run a ferry service to a moon
    base. (Text)
       In a press conference, Dr. Libby urged a program to put more
    science into space exploration because â€œthe dominant factor so far in
    the manned space program has Seen :hc drive $0 establish good engi-
    neering technology.â€ He suggested: ( 1 ) NASA establish a six-man
    scientific task force to live and work for a year with training astro-
    nauts ; (2) close cooperation between scientific research at outstanding
    universities, engineering efforts at aerospace industries, and NASA facil-
    ities; and (3) a mutually-happy â€œmarriageâ€ between space and educa-
    tion to attract and inspire students. (M&R, 10/11/65,23)
       JPL Director Dr. William H. Pickering told the Symposium that
    adaptive instrumentation was an important requirement for future un-
    manned interplanetary missions. In view of the increasing number of
    instruments on interplanetary spacecraft, more effort should be concen-
    trated on the onboard data handling and command system, he
    suggested. This might transmit data only when meaningful changes
    were recorded by sensors. Also, the data system should monitor the
    performance of instruments and take corrective action should a failure
    occur. (Pay, M&R, 10/11/65,36)

        â€œ3. We will develop a family of useful manned earth-orbiting sta-
    tions, growing from relatively small orbiting laboratories to large mul-
    ti-manned permanent stations. Regular ferry service will transfer per-
    sonnel and supplies to and from such spacecraft.
        â€œ4. Global communications via satellites will become a fact in the
    very near future and, will be followed by direct broadcast of both voice
    and TV by satellite to home receivers throughout large sections of the
    world.
        â€œ5. Orbiting spacecraft will increase annually in numbers, in size,
    and in sophistication. Through such activity we will greatly increase
    our knowledge about the earth as well as about the heavens.
        â€œ6. We can expect a marriage of the major features of both aero-
    nautics and astronautics . . . lifting bodies and winged spacecraft
    with maneuverable reentry ability will be launched into near and dis-
    tant space by means of recoverable and re-usable launch
    vehicles. Drastic reduction in the mileage cost of space travel will
    result.
        â€œ7. Spaceports for the coming and going of spacecraft will be built
     in a number of parts of this country as well as elsewhere.
        â€œ8. Improved propulsion-faster,     more powerful rockets using nu-
     clear as well as chemical energy-will       characterize space transpor-

      by Rep. Joseph E. Karthâ€™s (D-Minn.) Space Science and Applications
      Subcommittee. Karth committee summarized the most serious rea-
      sons for Surveyorâ€™s delay: l ) the failure to do adequate preliminary
      work; 2 ) a series of major modifications; 3) inadequate staffing by
      JPL in the first three years; 4) too rapid expansion of personnel at a
      later date; 5) poor management on the part of Hughes; 6 ) a resist-
      ance on the part of Hughes to making management changes; 7) an
      improperly conducted testing program by Hughes; 8 ) management
      weaknesses in NASA; and 9) a lack of vigorous centralized control by
      NASA.
        To describe the magnitude of the Surveyor problems, the Congres-
      sional investigators highlighted a NASA press release of January 1961,
      which outlined Project Surveyor as costing about $50 million, consist-
    ing of seven spacecraft, each weighing 2,500 lbs., capable of placing
    over 200 Ibs. of scientific payload on the lunar surface, with launches
    scheduled during the 1963-66 time period. The Subcommittee then
    noted that the first launch had been delayed about two and a half
    years, payload capability had been reduced to only a TV camera on the
    first four spacecraft and only 114 lbs. on the next three operational
    models, with total costs so far of nearly $350 million for the spacecraft
    R&D alone. The investigation concluded that the responsibility for
    the Surveyor situation could be found in the inadequate preparation
    for the project, the performance of JPL, the performance of Hughes
    Aircraft, and the performance of NASA Headquarters. â€œA serious mis-
    takeâ€ was made at the very beginning of the Surveyor project when
     insufficient preliminary work was done to identify serious technical
    problems, judge feasibility, consider alternatives, and more accurately
    estimate costs. The investigation concludvd further that this was â€œthe
    inevitable result of a poorly defined project.â€ (House Rpt.)
October 8: Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were planning to establish a
    Nordic chain of detector stations to register underground atomic blasts.
    Sweden and Norway would each construct at least one detector station
    and join their stations; Denmark would build a large station in
    Greenland. Swedish experts believed that the new U.S. detector sta-
     tion in Montana together with the Nordic chain would make detections
     100per cent certain. (Fleisher, Wash. Post, 10/9/65, A18)
  Until man can duplicate responsibility-societyâ€™s basic ingredient-in
     test tubes and mathematical equations, he should not attempt to dupli-
    cate himself in a laboratory, asserted Dr. Johannes M. Burgers.
    Speaking at the Symposium on Fluid Dynamics and Plasma, Bur-
    gers recommended a 50-yr. moratorium of artificial-life experiments
     because â€œour society is not ready for it. . . . Too many groups
     would take it out of the hands of science and make unholy use of
     it. . . . Wait until the educational level of man is higher. Wait un-

  U.S. would make the first lunar landing because the â€œSaturn 5

  Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator, addressed sym-
    posium on universities and Federal science policies held during
     meeting of National Academy of Sciences, in Seattle. He discussed
    the role of universities in space exploration and specified NASA-univer-
     sity relationships: (1) direct project support by means of research
     contracts to universities; ( 2 ) provision of new facilities, including
     those to encourage interdisciplinary groups for research in the interest
    of both the university and NASA; and (3) training support, including
     program to turn out 1,000 Ph.D.â€™s annually. He then turned to evolu-
     tion of the universityâ€™s future role:
        â€œIt is not expected that the university will become the primary ac-
     tion agency for solving the economic and social problems of our so-
     ciety or for setting basic social objectives, but it must have a promi.
     nent voice and influence. The university should, I think, aspire to
     intellectual leadership, to observe and analyze, to apply the power of
     the human mindTthat faculty which distinguishes man from animal,
     to establish a rational basis for policy and action. The direct attack
     must be undertaken by other institutions, mainly, by political
     agencies. We are now witnessing the evolution of government agen-
     cies, particularly those of the Federal government,, to meet social needs
     by direct action in all fields from economics and public health to
     science and technology. A beginning is being made in the mobiliza-
     tion and integratiop of the total available resources to attack the most
     complex social problems. â€œ. . I. I believe that . . . the traditional
     values of pursuit of excellence, freedom of inquiry, preservation of cre-
     ativity, and the support of the unconventional new ideas, particularly
     those of young scientists, . . . may not only be preserved but may even
     be strengthened within the larger framework of increased scope which
                                                                        469

    can provide a sounder human motivation, bring allocation of increased
    resources, provide a satisfaction of great accomplishment in terms of
    human goals, and a sense of a community of interest with all
    mankind. If you will take the time to discover what is now going on
    in the exploration of space, you will find a free association of individ-
    uals, each with complete freedom of individual choice, in the largest
    and most challenging venture of man, the search for knowledge of his
    environment, and the application of this knowledge to his benefit. In
    this group of several hundred thousand people you will find innumera-
    ble examples of the pursuit of excellence from the renewed pride of the
    workman in his handicraft, to the intellectual effort of the scientist to
    analyze and observe. You will find mainly ,young men, unafraid of
    large problems or rapid change. You will find the unconventional

October 11-13: The AIAAâ€™S Fourth Manned Space Flight Meeting was held
    in St. Louis.
       William B. Taylor, Director of NASA Apollo Applications Office, out-
    lined some long-range goals of Saturn/Apollo: â€œBy 1980, it seems
    likely there will be a vigorous program for manned exploration of the
    near planets, probably based on a new generation of space vehicles
    capable of flights for durations of 2 to 3 years with crews consisting of
    6 to 8 men. Although by 1980 it is not likely that men will have
    landed on Mars, it is possible that a Mars flyby or manned orbiting
    mission will be imminent if not already accomplished.
       CC
        On the moon by 1980, there may be in operation one or more
    multi-manned research observatories, conducting astronomical and
    geophysical operations on a year-round basis. These observatories
    may also be home base for mobile lunar explorations, using
    self-sufficient surface vehicles.
       â€œIn earth orbit by 1980 there may be one or more multi-manned,
    orbiting space stations, functioning as research laboratories for the
    advancement of human knowledge and increase of living stand-
    ards. In addition to these permanent space stations, there could
     be a variety of smaller earth orbiting spacecraft, operated by private
     industry or government agencies in much the way aircraft operate
    today, to carry out such applications as long term weather forecasting
     and control; surveys of water resources, crops, forests and ocean cur-
     rents; continuous, wide-band worldwide communications; air, sea and
     space navigation, and traffic control.
       â€œThese, then are some of the longer range objectives of the 1970â€™s
     and 1980â€™s which we feel can be achieved with the wide base of space

          Undiscovered biological rhythms in man could prevent his visiting
      other planets, reported biologist Eugene Spangler, TRW Systems. â€œThe
      consequences of the removal [of man from earth] are in many respects
      unknown. The solution may not come except by means of gradual ac-
      cretions in the total time that man spends in space together with careful
      monitoring of his reactions as that time is increased. But it seems nec-
      essary to come to further grips with the problem insofar as possible be-
      fore prolonged space flight is attempted. The goals must be first to
      define the problem in two steps: (1) what specific correlations exist be-
      tween the life processes of man and the variations in his geophysical
      environment? and (2) what are the results of substantial alteration of
      that environment on these correlations?â€
          Spangler noted that all of the known human rhythmic cycles could
      be interrupted without apparent harm, yet even the adjustment to a
      rapid change of several time zones after a jet flight could involve
      unpleasant recycling of the bodyâ€™s â€œbiological clock.â€ (Text)
          Suits of armor might be worn by astronauts on long lunar explora-
      tions, reported Richard S. Johnston, James V. Correale, and Matthew
       I. Radnofsky, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. The suits must be re-
      liable, mobile, leak-resistant, and have lightweight construction and
      high durability for repeated wear. Two models of a metal spacesuit
       had met these requirements and been delivered to MSC for further
      testing, they said.
          Spacesuits for the Apollo mission, which would involve relatively
       brief lunar walks, would be of fabric and consist of several layers,
       starting with water-cooled underwear, followed by pressure layers to
      hold the suitâ€™s atmosphere, and finally an â€œovercoatâ€ of fabric. (Text)

      Cosmonauts Col. Pave1 I. Belyayev and L/Col. Aleksey A. Leonov at

       space exploration: â€œIt is all part of manâ€™s wanting to know what the
       hell heâ€™s doing in his environment.
          â€œThe American people are just about what they claim they are-a
       people very fascinated with their environment, and when they can find
       another way to explore their environment they are very willing within
       reason to put their resources where their interest is.
          â€œThey will do that so long as they are getting return on their

October 12: At a background briefing at NASA Hq. on Advanced Chemical
    Propulsion, Adelbert 0. Tischler, Director, Chemical Propulsion Div.,
     NASA Office of Advanced Research and Technology, revealed that NASA
     would probably be â€œconfined to the Saturn IB and V for the next
     decade.â€ A maneuvering vehicle would be developed sometime
     around 1970 but would not be available for manned use until
     1975. Tischler said that an ion propulsion system would never be
     applicable for deep manned space flight because of â€œits abhorrent
     thrust-to-weight ratio . . . it is going to take a long time to accelerate
     the vehicle out of Earth orbit to arrive then later at the planetary
                                                                       .â€
     orbit, and to decelerate in the planetary orbit, and vice versa. . .
        Ion propulsion systems would be suitable for unmanned missions,
     however, because unmanned systems generally were small and ion sys-
     tems were small; also, time was not a factor. In addition, they might
     be practicable as auxiliary devices for midcourse corrections â€˜on
    manned interplanetary trips.
        After agreeing that present planning limited the application of nu-
     clear systems to interplanetary trips, Tischler said: â€œThere has been,
     during the last two years, a real marked decline of interest . . . about
     exploring Venus. I donâ€™t think that is a correct viewpoint at all. I
     think there is a great deal . . . to learn about Venus.
        â€œWe shouldnâ€™t eliminate the possibility of some other planets. We
     could easily . . . visit the asteroid belt. There are some good-sized
     asteroids. Ceres is one of them. We could ultimately . . . land on
     the Moon of Jupiter with such a system. I doubt if we will undertake
     a landing on Jupiter until we know how to fight gravity. . . .
        â€œAll of these possibilities exist. In fact, I would even mention Mars
     has a couple of moons that we might use to land on in preference to

     Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr. (Cdr., USN), said: â€œI cannot imagine a
     more appropriate time to honor a space explorer than on the anniver-
     sary of the day back in 1492 when an Italian explorer named Chris-
     topher Columbus first set eyes on the New World and made a similar
     enormous contribution to history.â€ (NYT, 10/13/65,47)

October 12: USA-USAF project to test plastic covering for assault airlift air-
    strips had been completed at Ft. Campbell, Ky. Armed Forces News
    Service spokesman said the plastic covering, held in place by special
    anchoring pins, might prove a practical, all-weather landing-zone

  USAF Athena missile fired from Green River, Utah, impacted on target at
    White Sands Missile Range, N. Mex. It was the 25th successful firing
    in 30 attempts of a 78-shot series to study how warheads behaved
    during reentry. (AP, Wash. Post, 10/13/65, A19)
 Tass announced conclusion of U.S.S.R. launchings in the Pacific Ocean
    basin of new types of rockets carrying space objects. â€œThe flights
    of the rockets and the functioning of all their stages proceeded nor-
    mally. The mockups of the last but one stage of the carrier rockets
    reached the water surface in the present area with high precision,â€ the
    announcement said. The test areaqO-n.mi.-dia. circle centering on
    37â€™39â€˜ N and 173â€™25â€™ E-was          now free for navigation and aircraft

  $10-million seismometer post was dedicated in Billings, Mont., at cere-
    monies attended by more than 60 scientists from 30 nations who would
    tour the 525 seismometer sites in Montana. President Johnson, in
    Washington, D.C., said: â€œThis new Department of Defense installation,
    the first of its kind, will help detect and identify earthquakes. It
    brings us closer to the day when science can distinguish with certainty
    between underground nuclear explosions and other forms of seismic
    disturbances.â€ Scientific data would be made available to the world,
    Johnson added. (AP, NYT, 10/14/65,3)

October 13: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking at the dedica-
    tion of the Space Science Laboratory at Univ. of Chicago, said: â€œThe
    space effort is really a research and development competition-a
    competition for technological pre-eminence, which demands and
    creates the quest for excellence. . . . Should we fall behind in the
    area of space technology, we would jeopardize our ability to progress,
    on earth as well as in space. At stake is the technological balance of
    power in the world. . . .
        â€œThe influence of our technological progress and prowess is and has
     been the deciding factor in keeping the peace; technological and
    scientific capabilities constitute a basic source of national power. Pre-
    eminence in the field is an instrument in international relations, and
    influences our dealings with other nations involving peace and freedom
    in the world. . . .
       66
         By mastering the restrained but decisive use of the power that
     modern science and technology give us, we are providing the Nation
     with the capability to achieve greater cooperation toward a world con-
    sistent with the ideals we seek for others as well as ourselves. . . .â€

             still assumed that life on Mars was possible, Dr. Norman H.
       NASA
    Horowitz, JPL, said at the dedication. Although photographs relayed
    by MARINER IV had indicated Mars was extremely cold and lacked
    oxygen and water vapor, some terrestrial organisms might live com-
    fortably in this environment, he said. Horowitz felt that the unex-
    plained seasonal color changes in the dark regions of Mars might
    indicate plant growth. (Kotulak, Chic. Trib.,10/14/65)

     Harold C. Urey, Nobel prize-winning chemist, at a news conference
     during the meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in
     Seattle. Absence of terrestrial matter in lunar soil would indicate that
     the moon originated elsewhere in the solar system, Urey said. (AP,

   Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, addressing 4,000 employees
     and officials of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., warned Grum-
     man to reduce contract proposals sharply if it expected to gain a share
     of future defense contracts. McNamara said Grummanâ€™s proposals for
     construction of a portion of the F-111 fighterâ€™s tail assembly were
     â€œhigher than other competitive sources.
        â€œThere is no question in my mind that you can reduce costs on this
     $1 billion contract. Theyâ€™ve got to come down,â€™â€™ he said. The con-

October 13: Pre-Continent 111, 30-ton sphere in which six men lived and
    worked 330 ft. beneath the sea off the French Riviera for three weeks,
    surfaced after its inhabitants had erected and maintained a mock sea-
    bottom petroleum drilling rig without ever surfacing for air. The
    men would remain in the sphere until Oct. 16 when the atmospheric
    pressure in the capsule was expected to be low enough to permit emer-
    gence without danger. Object of this experiment, conceived by
    Jacques-Yves Cousteau, was to avoid need for frequent decompressions
    by placing workersâ€™ dormitories on the oceanâ€™s floor to allow more
    working time and less transition time per diver. Such a technique
    would permit man to mine minerals and cultivate underwater plants to
    ease the worldâ€™s food shortage problem, Cousteau said. Sealab 11, a
    similar experiment by U S . Navy, was completed Oct. 10. (Reuters,

 Increase in private flying was reported by FAA, with prediction that pilot
    certificates issued during 1965 would exceed the previous high of
    117,902 certificates issued in 1957. During the first six months of

  In answer to the query â€œIs a permanent role waiting in space for mili-
    tary astronauts,â€ Robert Brunn in the Christian Science Monitor quot-
    ed an Air Force official as saying: â€œNo strategy is known for space as
    yet. We canâ€™t use space the way the cowboys and Indians used high
    ground for advantage, nor the way the Air Force in World War II
    climbed to altitude and dove out of the sun.
       â€œSomething with military importance may turn up in the next five
    years. The Air Force doesnâ€™t know what the usefulness of space will
    be. . . .â€ (Brunn, CSM, 10/13/65,14)
October 14: OGO II Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (Ogo-C) was
    launched by NASA from Vandenberg AFB with Thrust-Augmented Thor-
    Agena D booster. Because of a slight malfunction in the launch vehi-

    rameters: apogee, 939 mi. (1,511 km.) ; perigee, 250 mi. (403.1 km.) ;
    period, one hour 45 min.; inclination, 87â€™. Planned orbit had been
    somewhat lower: 575-mi. ( 9 2 5 - b . ) apogee, 207-mi. (333.3-h.) peri-
    gee, one-hour 37-min. period, and 86â€ inclination. Most of the 20
    onboard experiments were not expected to be affected by the malfunc-
    tion; OGO 11â€™s solar panels and instrumented booms deployed as
    planned and the spacecraft achieved three-axis stabilization.

   Saturn V launch vehicle was under consideration by NASA for its
      Voyager program of unmanned planetary exploration, beginning with
     a 1971 Mars mission. NASA had considered developing a Saturn
      IB/Centaur launch vehicle, but the greater thrust of the three-stage
      7.5-million-lb. thrust Saturn V would give more flexibility to planning
      early Voyager missions and would also provide the launch vehicle
     capability at the beginning of the Voyager program necessary for fu-
      ture missions. Saturn V, being developed by MSFC, would undergo its

 Writing about Surveyor lunar probe in the Washington Evening
    Star, William Hines said: â€œSurveyor will give science a view of the
    moon that will be different not just in degree but in kind. A â€˜softâ€™
    landing, with the spacecraft braked by automatic rockets, should enable
    scientists to learn-rather than infer-much about the lunar surface.
       â€œEven the first Surveyor . . . should tell a lot and this one will lack
    most of the cleverly designed scientific instruments of later
    probes. Equipped with television, the initial Surveyor may settle
    many points of contention over surface conditions . , .
       â€œAssuming success with Surveyor 1, scientists are hoping that its
    findings wonâ€™t evoke a repetition of the short-sighted clamor for â€˜econ-
    omyâ€™ that followed the successful flight of Ranger 7 in July
    1964 . . . owing to the mistaken impression that when youâ€™ve seen
    one moon picture youâ€™ve seen them all.
       LLT~  suggest that photographic and physical evidence obtained by

October 17: In an original report on communications satellites, Soviet
    Prof. M. Kaplanov said: â€œThe transmitter on the Molniya 1 Comsat
    had a power of 40 watts, i.e. 10 times that of the Early Bird. In this
    regard, the Soviet scientists and engineers have solved the most com-
    plex technical problems in the development of a sputnik equipped with
    onboard antennas oriented on the Earth with a strong power system
    assuring a supply to the transmitter throughout the entire communica-
    tion session.
       â€œThe development of a wideband space transmitter of 40 watts
    power operating continuously is an innovation in world technolo-
    gy. This distinguishing feature of the Molniya-1 Comsat permits a
    considerable simplification of the onground equipment and a great
    reduction in the cost of its construction and operation. Evidently the
    great complexity of servicing and the inadequate reliability of the
     [ComSatCorp] equipment compelled France, England and West Ger-
    many to organize the alternate operating of their ground receiving
    points of space communication. Each of these points operates only
    one week out of three, the second week it is in reserve, and the third is
    spent in repair work. We note that the Soviet onground facilities for
    space communication in Moscow and Vladivostok have been operating
    daily since the launching of the Molniya-1. This is quite important
    for a satellite communication system, since upon the operating cost
    there depends greatly its ability to compete with other means of com-
    munication.â€ (Zzvestia, 10,/17/16, 5, ATSS-T Trans.)
  Boris Yegorov, Soviet physician-cosmonaut, said in interview in Izvestiaâ€™s
     Sunday supplement Nedelya that it was quite possible that in pro-

    of protective-adaptive mechanisms which would safely protect it under
     conditions of weightlessness. At the same time, Yegorov voiced the
     fear that these new changes might persist and not be easily removed
     after return to earth. To aid in re-adaptation to earthâ€™s gravity, he
    said future Soviet cosmonauts would use exercises and drugs. (Tass,

  Evidence that the bright areas of the Martian surface contained iron

    Sagan of Harvard Univ. to the Biophysical Societyâ€™s annual meeting
    in San Francisco. He said reflected light of hydrated iron oxides in
    an earth-bound laboratory matched the sunlight reflected from the
    Martian surface when viewed in the ultraviolet and infrared. Dr.
    Sagan believed that confirmation of the iron-water compounds on
    Martian deserts, which showed up as bright areas to earth astronomers,
    suggested conditions were once right for life to originate on Mars.

  Evaluation of the Soviet space effort should be done in terms of Russian
    rather than US. requirements and considerations, suggested William
    Hines in the Washington Evening Star: â€œTo look at things from the
    Russian angle for a change may provide a new view of the whole space
    race.â€ Hines suggested that the orbits of the Molniya satellites were
    egg-shaped because with 12-hr. periodicity â€œthe Molniya-type satellite
    stays over the homeland about two-thirds of the time and comes back
    at exactly the same time each day.â€ He said that the U.S.S.R. proba-
    bly had no weather satellites â€œbecause it does not need this branch of
    the weathermanâ€™s art.â€ A possible reason that there were no polar-or-
    biting Soviet photographic reconnaissance satellites like the USâ€™S Sa-
    mos was that they were not needed. N o Saturn V-type launch vehicle
    development was evident, Hines concluded, possibly because â€œRussiaâ€™s
    approach to [lunar landing] is not necessarily . . . the same as
    Americaâ€™s. . . . A revealing hint along this line is contained in a
                                       .

  Address by James G. Allen of the Univ. of Colorado before the American
    Astronautical Society on the impact of space exploration was inserted
    in the Congressional Record by Sen. Peter H. Dominick (R-Colo.) :
    â€œThe space revolution of the mid-20th century must be regarded as the
     most significant of all those great revolutions of history which have
     affected the fate of man. By definition, a revolution does produce a
     series of pyramiding effects, one building up on another. But, in the
    last analysis, these effects focus upon, and culminate in, truly
     significant changes in the social and economic relationships which
    shape one society.
        <<
          The space revolution of the mid-twentieth century thus is unique,
     as its course and direction will affect every individual on each of the
     five continents. Moreover, its effects will lie in an entirely new dimen-
     sion-beyond the physical realm of manâ€™s earthly existence and into
     the boundless areas of space itself. The space revolution of our day
     has resulted from the theories, hypotheses and observations of the
     scientists as their conclusions were tested and applied by the ein,â€™

  Editorial by Henry Eyring, Univ. of Utah, in Science: â€œ. . . The crash
     program on the atomic bomb grew out of groundless fears that our
     antagonists would get the atomic bomb first. The vast sums being
     spent at present on a crash program for an early landing on the moon
     have their own somewhat obscure, psychological basis. If the moon
     program is really the most effective means of staving off all-out war,
     expensive as it is, it is still a bargain. On the other hand, the attempts
     which are sometimes made to sell the moon program on its scientific
     merits alone, in competition with other scientific uses of the money, are
     less convincing. The charitable conclusion is that in public affairs it is
     deemed necessary to oversimplify actual objectives so that the general
     public will best serve its own interests for the wrong reasons. This
     oversolicitude is probably neither necessary nor desirable. . . .â€

October 24: OGO 11, NASA geophysical observatory satellite launched Oct.
    14 at Western Test Range, ceased normal operation about 24 hrs. after
    its attitude control system gas supply was depleted. Gas depletion was
    associated with automatic maneuvers to restabilize OGO XI because one
    or more of its horizon scanners tracked temperature gradients (possi-

     by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, warned
      against uncontrolled exploitation of science that â€œmay become a

  In a memorandum report to President Johnson on Gemini VI NASA
    Administrator James E. Webb said: â€œThis is to report to you that the
    Titan II booster which we expected to use on October 25 to launch
    Gemini 6, carrying astronauts Schirra and Stafford, is now being re-
    moved from the launching pad. We have examined carefully the
    question of whether this booster could be used for the launching of
    Gemini 7 into a 14-day orbit, and our studies show that the Titan
    booster which we have especially prepared for Gemini 7 is more
    suitable. This is the reason for the change from the booster now on
    the pad to the one especially designed for the Gemini 7 launch.
       â€œAlso, we have examined a number of ways to speed up the accumu-
    lation of the information which the Gemini 6 rendezvous flight was
    designed to give us. We find that it may be possible to take advan-
    tage of the work we have already done in mating the Gemini 6 to its
    booster and to the launching facility and thus save considerable time
    in its re-erection. If we can launch Gemini 7 without serious damage
    to the iaunching pad, there is some possibility that we could imme-
    diately re-erect the Gemini 6 spacecraft and booster and launch it in
    time to rendezvous with Gemini 7 before the 14-day flight comes to an
    end.â€ (Text; Pres. Doc., 11/1/65,734)
  Presidential Press Secretary William D. Moyers announced from the
    Texas White House that the U S . would launch Gemini 6 and Gemini 7
    about 10 days apart and have them rendezvous in space. The double
    launching would probably take place in January with tile two space-
    craft scheduled to maneuver within a few feet of each other but with-
    out touching. Astronauts Walter M. Schirra (Capt., USN) and Thom-
    as P. Stafford (Maj., USAF) would be in Gemini 6, whose Oct. 25
    mission was canceled after an Agena vehicle with which they were to
    dock exploded in space. In Gemini 7, set for a 14-day orbital jour-
    ney, would be Astronauts Frank Borman (Maj., USAF) and James Lo-
    vel1 (Lcdr., U S N ) . (Pomfret, NYT, 10/29/65, 1; Chapman, Wush.

  Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, said
    in a telephone interview with the New York Times that the proposal to
    fly the Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 spacecraft on a dual flight originally
    had been made by Walter F. Burka and John F. Yardley of McDonnell
    Aircraft Corp., the spacecraftâ€™s manufacturer. This might permit ren-
    dezvous, but no docking, earlier than if NASA waited for the Agena
    malfunction to be found and corrected. If the launching pad, the
    Titan booster, and Gemini 6 could not be made ready in time to catch
    the Gemini 7 in orbit, â€œwe would not have lost anything but the try-
    ing,â€™, Dr. Gilruth said. As for the risk of having two manned space-
    craft flying a few feet apart, â€œThatâ€™s no more dangerous than two
    fighters up there flying with each other,â€ he added. (Clark, NYT,

October 28: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National
    Aeronautics and Space Council, said in an address to the American
    Ordnance Association: â€œ. . . In the case of the most recently an-
    nounced space project, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, we again
    have an example of a highly valuable exchange of technology and
    experience by two operating agencies of the Government. In this in-
    stance, NASAâ€™s   considerable success in manned space flight and in the
    development of spacecraft will assist the Air Force substantially in
    carrying out the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project. Such intera-
    gency cooperation will tend to improve rather than impair the peaceful
    image which this country has established.
       â€œSince I have mentioned the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, it is
    worth pausing right now to challenge forthrightly those who have as-
    serted or intimated that it has something to do with a weapons
    race. We expect misinterpretations of that sort to come from un-
    friendly countries and sometimes from ignorant domestic critics. How-
    ever, I was disappointed to find that a few otherwise well informed
    publications and invididuals have asserted that the MOL is a weapons
    carrier and a project contrary to our peaceful progress in space.
       â€œI assert as positively as I can that the MOL is not a weapons
    system, is not a means by which aggressive actions can be perpetrated,
    and is in r way in conflict with the established peaceful policies,
                 w
    objectives, or methods of the United States. Rather, it is a program
    that will increase our knowledge of manâ€™s usefulness in space and will
    relate that ability to our national defense.â€ (Text)
  Months-long breathing of pure oxygen at the pressure used in Gemini
    spacecraft might damage the lungs and interfere with blood cell maqu-
    facture in the body, reported Col. Harold V. Ellingson (USAF) at a
    meeting of the American College of Preventive Medicine in
    Chicago. For that reason, he said, pure oxygen would not be used in
    Air Force manned orbiting laboratories in which astronauts would
    remain in space 3&90 days. Instead a mixture of oxygen and helium
    was being considered. Colonel Ellingson, Commander of the Air
    Force School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, emphasized he was
    not referring to brief orbital trips such as the Gemini flights, but to
    missions of one to three months duration. (Lewis, Wash. Post,

    cooler than 1,500â€™ F, reported Dr. Bruce T. Ulrich of Cal Tech at a
    meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago. Since between
     70% and 80% of them lay along the Milky Way, it was theorized that
    they were â€œvery large-probably thousands of times larger than the
    sun, very distant, and quite rare.â€
       The new telescope was novel in several ways: its concave mirror was
    of an epoxy plastic coated with aluminum; the mirror rocked back and
    forth at 20 cps, so that light from an infrared source in the sky would
    sweep across detectors of lead sulphide and silicon; the detectors, kept
    at -320â€™ F, were sensitive enough to detect the slight increase in the
    infrared as the arm of the telescope swept past one of these objects.

    attention, later lunar travel will lose its novelty.
       â€œAs for Mars, how many popular songs have been written about
    it? . . . More fundamental is the question, â€˜How many people know

    buyer. it was actually a partnership with all of                    its
    problems. Significant influences on this partnership in recent years
    had included: the demand on industry for faster rates of technical
    advance ; the increased complexity and technical difficulty of major
    programs with consequent delays and cost overruns; the decreasing
    volume of production woik and increasing volume of research and
    development contracts ; the steady increase in the requirements for
    technical and program management personnel; the requirement for
    Government to better define its objectives and requirements; the em-
    phasis in the procuring agencies on increasing competition at all
    stages, including research and development; changes in contracting
    methods which offered more incentives but imposed more risk on con-
    tractors ; and necessary increases in Government controls on configura-
    tion, quality, and on financial data in multiple contract, large and

During October: JPL Director William H. Pickering, describing MARINER
    IVâ€™S Mars mission in Astronautics and Aeronautics, wrote : â€œThis mis-
    sion has proven to be of immense scientific and engineering
    importance. New scientific information is now available on regions of
    the solar system never before penetrated with instruments. Observa-
    tions from the vicinity of Mars suggest entirely new concepts about the
    nature of that planet. Spacecraft performance has shown our ability
    to design and construct a remotely operated device of astonishing
    complexity. Its continued operation establishes a standard of reliabil-
    ity seldom, if ever, attained. Even maintaining two-way communica-
    tions over distances exceeding 100-million mi. remarkably demon-
    strates advances in communication technology which were not thought
    possible a decade ago.
        â€œThe design concepts underlying Mariner date back to 1959 when
    the Jet Propulsion Laboratory began the Vega program. In 1960,
    Vega was modified to become Ranger. The Mariner series took its
    present form in 1961, when a mission to Venus was planned for the

  â€œIt seems clear that preeminence in aeronautics and space in the future
     will certainly demand a continuous evolvement of new technology,â€ Dr.
     Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Special Assistant to the NASA Administrator,
     said in Air Force and Space Digest.
        â€œThe consequences of not having done our homework prior to un-
     dertaking a system development to meet an explicit requirement are
     overruns in cost and time. These costs in resources are often so high
     that the means must be found to evolve new technology in advance of
     requirements. One would conclude from this that the formulation of
     a responsible requirement demands an underlying body of technology.
        â€œOne of the most important purposes served by the creation of tech-
     nologies is to provide options in the selection of new requirements or
     missions. The existence of several technical options is fundamental to
     sound planning. Because of the many important implications of space
     activities, policy planners will require that they be given options. It
     therefore seems desirable that the development of a new branch of
     technology be directed toward a related class of requirements or mis-

During October: Dr. Walter Dornberger, Vice President for Research of
    Bell Aerosystems Co., former chief of German V-2 missile program, and
    father of the Dyna-Soar concept, was interviewed on the eve of his
    retirement from Bell by Claude Witze in Air Force and Space Digest.
    Witze said:â€œ. . . [Although Dornberger is] the outstanding pioneer in
    the development of ballistic rockets, he feels strongly that we have erred
    in relying on this single vehicle, with its inherent limitations.â€ He
    quoted Dr. Dornberger :
            . . . our whole approach to space is no good, if we really want to
       <â€˜ c

    think of space as an operational area.
                                                            We must get away
       â€œ â€˜We must use a completely different approach.

    from this launching from pads, which costs millions and billions of
    dollars, to the more conventional way of taking off from a runway.â€™ â€
       Witze continued: â€œHe predicts that after we have gone to the moon
    we will start over again. Project Apollo cannot be turned back, he
    says, but the next time â€˜we must create an environment in space that
    can be used by men, not only for research but for commercial and
    military purposes.â€™
       â€œThis environment he is talking about is a permanent space station,
    one that will never come back into the atmosphere. This will require
    a logistics system-a recoverable, reusable space transporter to carry
    people and supplies back and forth to space. The Dyna-Soar was a
    crude but necessary step in this direction, replaced today by the con-
    cept of the aerospace plane. . . .
       â€œThe Dornberger thesis is that a manned station in near space is as
    practical as a military base on Okinawa, a laboratory at the South
    Pole, or an aircraft parts and maintenance depot in
    Chateauroux. Once established, all that is needed is a logistics system
    to keep it going. From such a space station, expeditions can be sent
    to the moon, or many other places in space, with engines that give a
    thrust of only 20,000 pounds, instead of the millions of pounds re-
    quired on one-way booster trips. . . .,â€™
       Quoting Dr. Dornberger: â€œ â€˜It took mankind hundreds of years to

November 1 : The rendezvous of Geminis 6 and 7 had been scheduled tenta-
    tively for the eighth day of Gemini 7â€™s 14-day endurance flight, re-
    vealed Command Pilot Frank Borman (L/Col., USAF) at a n e w ~con-
     ference held by Gemini VIIâ€™S prime and backup astronaut crews at
     MSC. Gemini 7 would act as a passive target vehicle, but would ex-
     pend fuel to circularize its 108-mi.-perigee orbit to 161-mi.-perigee
     orbit and to maneuver into range of Gemini 6â€™s radar, if necessary.
     Borman said there would be no Eva on Gemini VII because the crew
     would be wearing new lightweight spacesuits unsuitable for work in
     the vacuum of space; he was unaware of any plans for Eva on
     Gemini VI. During ten days of the mission, the Gemini VII crew would
     fly in USAF-issue longjohn underwear. Pilot James Love11 (Cdr., U S N )
     said that training for Gemini VII had emphasized stowage reviews be-
     cause of the serious stowage problems encountered by Astronauts
     Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., on their eight-day GEMINI v
     flight August 19. (Transcript; Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 11/2/65, A3)
  FAA became the first civilian Government agency to recover the entire

  U S . experts believed that Russia might attempt to launch a multimanned
    spacecraft on a 15-day mission as her next manned space effort, re-
    ported William J. Normyle in Aviation Week and Space TechnoZogy.
    Based on recent conversation with Soviet scientists, U S . specialists
    felt that there was complete confidence in the Voskhod environmental-
    control system which had been qualified for 30-day missions, Normyle
    explained. They also believed that the Soviets were prepared to at-
    tempt a rendezvous mission more ambitious than Gemini 6. (Normyle,

    Coughlin said: â€œ. . . the really amazing thing is that what the Karth
    report calls the â€˜stormy 4%-year historyâ€™ of the project has not been
    stormier. Given a limited budget to accomplish the impossible, any-
    one will have difficulties. . . .
       â€œThe Karth report, in fact, acknowledges this when it states: â€˜In

    on the Vanguard program, the demands for Rangerâ€™s Cancellation, and
    the timorous whimpering that tried to suppress the Mercury program

  The Interim Communications Satellite Committee ( I C S C ) , on behalf of
    the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat) ,
    approved a communications satellite system to provide services for
    NASAâ€™s Project Apollo and for other commercial users. The system,
    which would provide the first commercial comsat service to the Pacific
    area and supplement services across the Atlantic as part of the Intelsat
    system, would include four satellites: two in synchronous orbit at
    about 22,300-mi. altitudes, one over the Pacific, the other over the
    Atlantic; and two in reserve. Larger and more versatile than EARLY
    BIRD I comsat providing commercial service over the Atlantic, these
    satellites would weigh 150 lbs. compared to EARLY BIRD 1â€™s 85 lbs.

    encountered in manned planetary exploration, Dr. Welsh noted that
    for manned Mars travel â€œweâ€™ll need reliability for at least 400 days
    contrasted with more immediate goals of 14 to 30 days; weâ€™ll need
    electrical â€˜on boardâ€™ power measured in kilowatts instead of todayâ€™s

    instead of the current capability of 8 bits per second; and there is a
    still debatable possibility that we will need laser beam pointing ac-
    curacy several magnitudes better than what we now have. In com-
    ponents, we shall require new or improved concepts such as self-heal-
    ing, self-checking, and accurate failure prediction to give the greatly
    increased reliability required. . . .â€ (Text)

    He said science had been the prime beneficiary of skills developed for
    using satellites and space probes as scientific tools: â€œThe vitality of
    space science has been its close association with various disciplines of

November 4 : The impact of a meteorite might have begun life on earth,
    Dr. Brian Mason, U S . National Museum, told the annual meeting o         f
    the Geochemical Society of America in Kansas City. Scientists had
    speculated that the presence of organic compounds-substances con-
    taining carbon and nitrogen-in meteorites indicated that life exists,
    or had once existed, elsewhere in the universe. Mason noted that such
    compounds could be made without life, but added: â€œI believe . . . they
    may be a forerunner of life. A falling meteorite may be the way life
    got started.â€ Mason said that most meteorites appeared to come from
    the asteroid belt which orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
    This belt might be a planet that never collected to become a single
    body, he suggested. Dr. Mason was conducting research on the
    chemical differences a man-earth environment had imposed on meteor-

  Final test in North American Aviation Space and Information Systems
     Div.â€™s seven-month paraglider operational test program was success-

     beneath an inflated paraglider was towed to 9,000- to 10,000-ft. altitudes
     and released for free flights that averaged four and one half to five
    minutes. The test program, in which 12 consecutive successful flights

November 5: Man might be able to change the orbit of asteroid Icarus and
    make it an orbiting earth station, suggested Soviet scientist K. Stan-
    yukovich in an interview published by Economichesky Gazetta. Icarus
    has almost a one-mile diameter and weighs over six billion tons; every
    19 yrs. it gasses within 4 million mi. of earth. â€œThere is a great de-
    mand for a natural moon of Icarusâ€™ size,â€ Stanyukovich said, where
    man could build scientific observatories and warehouses to store fuel
    for spaceships departing on interplanetary trips. He doubted that it
    could be captured on its next approach in 1968, but foresaw a possibil-
    ity for 1987. (Burke, L. A. Times, 11/6/65)
  Five lunar and Martian experts applied geological methods to inter-
    preting Mars and the moon at the Geological Society of America
    Symposium in Kansas City. They found similarities between Mars
    and the moon: both bodies were subjected to slow erosion from
    showers of micrometeoroids from space; there was no evidence of sur-
    face water on either. Dr. Robert P. Sharp, Caltech, said that Martian
    craters were three-and-one-half times more numerous than on the lunar
    maria, but not as numerous as on the moonâ€™s uplands. He believed
    the p!anet hac! an extremely thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, tem-
    peratures ranging from 35â€ C to -100â€ C and no liquid water. Dr.
    Eugene Shoemaker, U S . Geological Survey, related experiments on
    earth with features on the moon in effort to explain why the moon was
    being eroded. A nuclear explosion in Nevada, for example, created
    a meteorcrater-like hole, resulting in hundreds of secondary impact
    craters. â€œI think the surface is a fluffy material, about one meter
    Ll. : 1
         -
    LIIICK, resting on the iioor of smaii craters,â€ he said.   â€œThe bulk ef
    matter is moved by the impact of small micrometeoroids. Probably
    a good deal of the material is melted and the melt may fly off into
    space.â€ Bruce C. Murray, Caltech, said that physical observations by
    studying emissions and radiation showed the moon emits light and other
    wave lengths in the same way that â€œfine, loose powder does.â€ He be-
    lieved the outer one-half millimeter is covered with dust. Infrared
    heat samplings showed variations indicating a heterogenous type of
    rock near the surface. Dr. E. C. T. Chao, U S . Geological Survey,
    discussed tektites-small, dark, glass, button-shaped objects, which he
    believed had been formed by meteoric impact, presumably on the moon,
    and had splashed off to fall on earth. Harold Masursky, US. Geolo-
    gical Survey, showed a geological map of the moon with the ages of
    various areas in different colors. He said the Survey had mapped
    three million square miles in the potential landing areas on the
    equatorial belt. He found five different â€œepisodes of movementâ€ on
    the surface. (McCoy, Kansas City Times, 11/6/65)
November 6: EXPLORER XXIX Geodetic Explorer satellite (Geos A ) was suc-
    cessfully launched by NASA from ETR by a Improved Thrust-Augmented
    Delta with a new enlarged second-stage fuel tank to provide longer
    engine burn. Because the guidance system did not shut down the
    second stage at the desired time, the achieved orbit had the following
    parameters: apogee, 1,412.4 mi. (2,274 km.) ; perigee, 695.6 mi.

      (1,118.1 km.); period, 120 min.; inclination, 59". Planned orbit had
      called for apogee of 920 mi.
         The 385-1b. satellite, designed acd built by Johns Hopkins Univ.
      Applied Physics Laboratory, contained five geodetic instrumentation
      systems to provide simultapeous measurements necessary for a more
      precise model of the earth's gravitational field and to map a world
      coordinate system relating points on or near the surface to the com-
      mon center of the mass: ( 1) four flabhing light beacons to be photo-
      graphed against the background of stars to define the arc of orbit
      and angular data; ( 2 ) corner cube quartz reflectors to pinpoint the
      satellite's position by reflecting laser beams; (3) three radio trans-
      mitters for Doppler-shift determination of the precise orbit; (4) radio
      range transponder to fix the positions of the satellite and interrogating
      ground stations; and (5) range and range-rate transponder to deter-
      mine the changing range and radial velocity of the satellite. Simul-
      taneous operation of the five independent and diverse geodetic-tracking
      systems would permit cross-checking and evaluation of the different
      techniques and was expected to enhance the accuracy of each system.
      Other objectives of the Geos program were: (1) to map with a high
      degree of mathematical exactness the structure of the earth's irregular
      gravitational field; and (2) to compare and 'corfelate results from
      different instrumented techniques employed simultaneously so as to
      assure greater accuracy and reliability.
         Critical to optimum use of the radio and optical beacons on EX-
      PLORER XXIX was the gravity-gradient attitude stabilization system to
                                                                        509

    him and the Vice President and saying that I thought they needed a
    scientist or any engineer. â€˜No,â€™ President Kennedy said, â€˜the issues
    involved in the development of space are policy issues-of       great na-

  Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey said in address before American
    Nuclear Society-Atomic Industrial Forum in Washington, D.C. :
       â€œIf anyone doubts the impact that science and technology have had
    on society, in just the past 20 years, he need look only at the new
    industries employing many thousands of people which have come into
    existence during that time-industries based solely on the evolution of
    new products and services. These i n c l u d e a n d I mention only a few
    -television, the computer, the jet engine and nuclear energy.
       â€œSome of these industries have sprung from the application of a
    single invention or chain of scientific thoughts.
       â€œDuring these past 20 years, too, we have seen in the United States
    the creation of a constructive partnership unknown in our previous
    history-a partnership of government, university, management, labor,
    science and citizen-a partnership devoted to maximum development of
    science and technology not for the narrow interest of any single group,
    but for the common good.
          To witness the space launchings at Cape Kennedy, as I have, is to see
       6<


    this partnership in action. . . .â€
       Turning to the peaceful uses of atomic energy, he said:
       â€œAs chairman of the National. Aeronautics and Space Council, I am
    particularly concerned with the atomâ€™s work in space.
       66

       â€œWe all know that the nuclear going in space wonâ€™t be easy. . . Yet
    I am confident that the technical problems are resolvable and the in-
    vestments warranted. . . .â€ Dr. Welsh delivered a warning to â€œspace

   Second, we hope to extend the benefits of modern computer technology
   throughout the world-by       utilizing the computer to prepare weather
   analyses and forecasts routinely for the entire globe. And third, we
   hope to develop an international communications network for the timely

  â€œWeâ€™ll be lucky if we have nuclear propulsion around 1980,â€ and electric

    Electronics Engineers, at Brevard Engineering College, Patrick AFB,
    ma. A pioneer in electric propulsion and advanced nuclear rocket
    studies, Evvard believed such concepts should not be considered for
    Mars missions of under 100 flights per year. Only frequent flights
    would increase the need for higher specific impulse and would justify
    the expense, he said.
       Meanwhile, he predicted, chemical rockets of less than 500 sec. spe-
    cific impulse would lift men to Mars, not by direct ascent but through a
    succession of parking orbits and assembly of hardware in space.

     the Administration to decide on what goals it wanted to set for the
     period after landing astronauts on the moon. The U.S. must use the
     tremendous space capability it had carefully built up since SPUTNIK I,
     he said, â€œor see its value erode. If we do not use what we have
     created, continued expansion o the Soviet program will likely lead
                                      f
     to future Soviet missions that will have the impact of Sputnik I.â€

   Discussing long-term plans of the nuclear rocket program, Dr. Harold B.
     Finger, Manager, AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, said he
     foresaw development of a nuclear rocket engine having a thrust of
     200,000 lbs. to 250,000 lbs., using reactors designed for 4,000 to 5,000
     megawatts, and capable of direct-flight lunar landing missions ; deep
     space unmanned space missions; and manned planetary missions. He
     said development of such an engine would utilize the technology already
     available and being developed through the Kiwi, Nerva, and Phoebus
     reactor programs. (AEC Release, 11/17/65)

  Hughes Tool Co. announced it had obtained $297,000 Army contract to
    provide a helicopter that could convert in flight to a 400-mph airplane.
    It would lift by means of a single helicopter rotor with a large tri-
    angular hub. After reaching a horizontal speed of about 150 mph, the
    rotor would be stopped in such a position that the hub could then
    serve as the wing of a craft that would assume a delta-wing shape.
    The rotor would also be used in landing. When operating as a heli-
    copter, the turbine engine would drive hot gases through the rotor hub
    to the rotor tips, and the rotor would be powered like a fireworks
    pinwheel. This would eliminate gearboxes and shafting. Hughes
    had tested the principle in flight with the experimental XV-9A re-
    search aircraft. (UPI, NYT, 11/18/65, 95)

  The growing debate about what the next step in manned spaceflight
    should be was roughly divided into three schools, according to Howard
    Simons in the Washington Post: (1) a negative â€œLetâ€™s do nothing at
     all after landing men on the moonâ€ school; (2) a â€œwild-space-yonderâ€
     school wanting to try everything; and (3) a â€œschool of thought that
     would make do with what we are now developing through modification
     and imagination before taking expensive new steps into the heavens.â€
    He said the latter view would mean using Saturn IBS and Vs to launch
     modified Apollo spacecraft on largely scientific space ventures, pos-
     sibly as early as 1968. (Simons, Wash. Post, 11/28/65)

        The Honorable Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme
    Court, speaking at the White House Conference, said: â€œWe live at a
   time when the whole world is being made over socially, economically,
    scientifically and even intellectually. Our era has witnessed such
    dramatic achievements as flight faster than sound, the splitting of the
    atom, miracle drugs, and manned satellites hurling through space.
    Rapid and turbulent changes in the scientific, economic, and social
    fields, almost too numerous to name, daily defy evaluation on the basis
    of prior standards and experience. Vistas of endless space have opened
    as manâ€™s horizons have widened to encompass the universe. At a pace
    beyond dreaming the whole pattern of our existence is being reshaped.
    To ensure that these changes work for the benefit of mankind, law
    must be developed rapidiy enough in the world community to cope
    with the problems they raise and to harness their potential for peaceful
    and productive ends.â€ (Text)

    other services â€œlag behind the speed, number and varietyâ€ of aircraft
    on Latin American routes, as they do throughout the world. (Text)
November 29: Second Orbiting Solar Observatory ( O S O 11) , after exceed-

    three key conclusions: (1) military and space research is a costly and
    inefficient way of spurring technological advance for the civilian econ-
    omy; (2) although there is some direct civilian application of new
    products and techniques developed for the military, the amount is lim-
    ited and is shrinking; (3) while a massive military-space program like
    that of the US. may indirectly stimulate innovation by civilians, some
    of the same results could probably be obtained more cheaply by direct
    government aid to nondefense research and development. The study
    implied there were better ways for Europeâ€™s industry to catch up. The
    report also stated the U S . and the Soviet Union were putting about
    the same effort into research, and Western Europe was not f a r
    behind. In terms of manpower involved, US. total was over 1 mil-
    lion; European, about 500,000; Soviet, 1.5 million. In international
    earnings of patents and licenses, the U S . was ahead. (Nossiter,

December 2 : NASA launched an Aerobee 150 sounding rocket from White
     Sands Missile Range to peak altitude of 115 mi. (185 km.). Objec-
    tives were to photograph the solar disc and to measure solar
    flux. Parachuted payload was recovered without observable damage;
    development of film was in process. (NASA Rpt. SRL)
  Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator since 1958, died
    of cancer at age 67. He was a former Director of the National
    Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a former Associate Director of
                                                                         or-
    the National Bureau of Standards, and-for       forty-five years-an
     dained minister in the Methodist Church.
       An internationally renowned scientist-engineer who once said he and
    the airplane grew up together, he was recognized for his leadership in
    the development of aeronautics and astronautics. He generally was
     regarded as the man who guided the United States into the space
     age. Dr. Dryden served the U S . Government with distinction since
     1918 in science and technology, as an administrator, and more recent-
    ly as a skilled diplomat in negotiating international agreements for
    cooperative efforts in the peaceful exploration of space. The recipient
    of many awards and honors, Dr. Dryden was especially known for his
    scientific contributions to fluid mechanics and boundarylayer phenom-
    ena.
       At Johnson City, Tex., President Johnson said that the death of Dr.
     Dryden â€œis a deep personal loss and a reason for national
    sorrow. . . . No soldier ever performed his duty with more bravery
    and no statesman ever charted new courses with more dedication than
    Hugh Dryden. Whenever the first American space man sets foot on
                                                                        535

    Dryden was one of those who gave him knowledge and illumination.â€
        From Great Falls, Mont., Vice President Humphrey, Chairman of
    the NASC, said: â€œThe death of Dr. Hugh Dryden is a sad loss to all of
     us, and especially to those of us who have been guided by his wisdom,
    experience, and great common sense in planning the nationâ€™s space
    program.
        â€œWe shall miss him sorely as we plot our course for the decade
     ahead. So much of what this nation has been able to do in aeronau-
    tics and space over the past 40 years we owe to the creative science
     and the confident, skillful leadership of this great public servant. I
    know of no finer example of modern man in all his versatility than Dr.
     Hugh Dryden, whose vision, courage, and lifetime of service have
                                                 .
    helped to lead the way into the Space Age. . .â€
        NASA Administrator James E. Webb said: â€œDr. Hugh L. Dryden was
     a man of his time--of the air age, of the nuclear age, of the space age,
     with all the implications of modern science and technology for the
     accomplishments of his time. He was also a man for all times because
    his courage in undertaking the conquest of air and space, his scientific,
    engineering, and administrative competence and his qualities of hu-
     manity and leadership mark him as one of the truly great men who
    have contributed over the years to these fields. He will be sorely
    missed in NASA, in the nation and, indeed, in many nations.â€
        Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronau-
     tics and Space Council, said: â€œThe country has lost one of its greatest
    scientists and one of its most dedicated citizens. The country will
    have to continue with â€˜its space and aeronautics programs without him
    -but will not be able to carry on as well without his inspiring leader-

December 2: Physicist and author Dr. Ralph E. Lapp said at Central Con-
    necticut State College that the space budget would decline from $5 bil-
    lion to about $2 billion by 1970 unless new space projects were pro-
    posed and approved soon. He was pessimistic about the possibilities
    of finding worthwhile proposals among those now being considered by
    NASA and suggested that ( 1 ) Presidential science adviser Donald
    Hornig issue a report which would be â€œan accounting and a forecastâ€
    of the possibilities in space, and (2) the National Academy of Sciences
    poll its 700 members for their views on how Federal funds for research
    and development should be allocated for space and other projects.
    Lapp said â€œnear-earthâ€ projects such as manned earth stations offered
    some posibilities, but not enough to fill the gap which would soon ap-
    pear in the aeronautics and space industry. (Garwood, Wash. Post,

  Need for creation of a â€œBuck Rogers rescue squadâ€ with trained men
     and equipment to give aid on short notice to spacemen stranded or
     stricken in orbit was discussed by William Hines in the Washington
    Evening Star. Hines said a persuasive case had been made by Mi-
    chael Stoiko of the Martin Co.: â€œStoiko estimated that in the next 20
     years there will be about 280 manned space flights involving about 800
    men. Half of each-men            and flights-will   be American, half
     Russian. Total flight time will be about 2.4 million man hours, com-
    pared with the world-wide total of about 1,200 man hours to date.â€
        Stoiko projected â€œa 62 percent probability of at least seven emer-
     gency situations involving 22 men in the next 20 years; a 58 percent
    probability of two or three emergencies in the coming decade.â€
        Hines said that now â€œastronauts stranded in orbit would have no
     hope of rescue and only a melancholy choice between two fatal alterna-
     tives: to sweat it out until the oxygen finally was gone, or to make a
     quick end of it by explosively decompressing both spacecraft and
     suit.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 12/2/65)
  Sir Francis Vallat, acting director of McGill Univ.â€™s Institute of Air

      89-min. period; and 28.9â€™ inclination. Immediately after spacecraft
      separation, GEMINI VII turned blunt end forward and began station-
      keeping on Titan 11â€™s second stage at distances from 20 ft. to 50 mi.
      for 17 min. Several hours later Borman made the first of a series of
      course corrections to position GEMINI VII for the scheduled rendez-
      vous with Gemini VI by firing the thruster rockets 1% min. to raise the
      apogee from 100 mi. to 138 mi. Apparent loss of pressure in space-
      craftâ€™s fuel cells during flightâ€™s early stages was later determined to be
      faulty indicator light.
         On Dec. 5, the astronauts encountered difficulties at first in sighting
      the rectangular panels displayed near Laredo, Tex., but later they suc-
      cessfully identified the patterns of panels and rovided evidence that
                                                      0
      their visual acuity was not degraded over the 14- ay period.
         On Dec. 6, Lovell removed his 16-lb. spacesuit, becoming first U.S.
      astronaut to fly in undergarment. The astronauts visually tracked Po-
      laris A-3 missile fired from uss Benjamin Franklin, submerged nu-
      clear submarine off Cape Kennedy, and successfully tested onboard
      radar receiving unit needed for rendezvous.
          On Dec. 7, Borman fired thruster rockets to achieve a higher orbit
      for rendezvous attempt: apogee, 197 mi. (301.7 km.) ; perigee, 145 mi.
       (233.8 km.) .
          On Dec. 8, clouds over New Mexico caused astronauts to cancel
      scheduled experiment to communicate with ground by laser beam.
          On Dec. 9, Borman executed a posigrade maneuver to circularize
      GEMINI VIIâ€™S orbit, firing thruster rockets one minute 18 sec. to raise
      perigee to 185.8 mi. (299.7 km.) ; 43 min. later, he fired braking
      thrusters 15 sec. to lower apogee to 188.3 mi. (103.7 km.) and provide
       a proper target orbit for Gemini 6. Dr. Berry recommended that Bor-
       man apply ointment to ease the nasal dryness caused by the lOO%O-oxy-
       gen atmosphere of his spacesuit.
          On Dec. 10, when temperatures in GEMINI VIIâ€™S cabin rose to 85â€â€™
       Flight Director Christopher Kraft ordered Lovell to put on his space-
       suit to permit Borman to remove his. One astronaut was to wear his
       spacesuit at all times during the mission. Dr. Berry recommended
       that Lovell apply antihistamine ointment to ease nasal dryness.
          On Dec. 11, laser experiment was conducted with partial success:
       the Hawaiian ground station received signals from the spacecraft when
       Lovell locked his hand-held laser onto the ground-based one, but con-
       tact was not precise or strong enough to carry a human voice.
          On Dec. 12, the astronauts tried again to establish ground laser
       communications over White Sands Missile Range, but were able to
       pick up only two quick flashes from the ground beacon.
          On Dec. 13, when GEMINI VIIâ€™S fuel cell warning light flashed on,
       the astronauts flushed excess water from the system by forcing in addi-
       tional oxygen borrowed from the cabinâ€™s oxygen supply, thereby cor-
       recting the difficulty. A taperecorder malfunction prevented the
       spacecraft from supplying automatic data on performance of its sys-
       tems between tracking stations.
          On Dec. 14, Borman observed reentry of a Minuteman missile fired
       from Vandenberg AFB to Eniwetok-first time a missile reentry had
       been sighted by an astronaut. Both GEMINI VII astronauts were be-
                                                                       539

    ginning to feel the strain of their ten days in space: â€œJim and I are
    beginning to notice the days seem to be lengthening a little,â€ Borman
    said. â€œWeâ€™re getting a little crummy.â€
       On Dec. 15, GEMINI VII and GEMINI VI achieved their historic
    rendezvous in orbit (see Dec. 15-16).
       On Dec. 16, a report from GEMINI VII Astronauts Borman and
    Lovell that three of the six fuel cell stacks were not operating aroused
    apprehension that the flight might end prematurely.
       Next day GEMINI VIIâ€™S fuel cells began to function satisfactorily,
    thereby assuring a full-duration mission. Astronauts Borman and Lo-
    vel1 checked out all their spacecraftâ€™s systems and received reentry
    instructions.
       On Dec. 18, GEMINI VII began a normal reentry when its four
    retrorockets fired automatically in correct sequence above the Pacific
    southeast of the Philippines. After a controlled reentry to the prede-
    termined landing point, the spacecraft splashed down in the Atlantic at
    9% a.m. EST, 700 mi. southwest of Bermuda-only 7.6 mi. from
    target. The astronauts, after their record-breaking 330-hr. 35-min.
    spaceflight, were assisted from the capsule by Navy frogmen and taken
    to the carrier Wasp for medical debriefing. (NASA Release 65-362;

December 7: Soviet spacecraft LUNA VIII impacted on the moon. Indica-
    tions were that it was destroyed instead of making a soft
    landing. Tass reported that â€œthe systems of the station were function-
    ing normally at all stages of the landing except the final touchdown.â€
       Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank radiotelescope track-
    ing station, said: â€œThe recordings of the final stages of Luna 8 made
    at Jodrell Bank indicate that a minor fault probably developed ap-
    proximately four minutes before touchdown. The retrorockets did not
    have full effect and the probe probably made a hard rather than a
    crash landing, but nevertheless sufficient to put the instruments out of
    action. It seems clear the Russians narrowly missed complete
    success. . . . They have probably obtained a great deal of new infor-
    mation which will enable them to correct the remaining minor
    faults. . . .â€ (Tass, 12/7/65; Balt. Sun, 12/8/65)

  Soviet Premier Aleksey Kosygin was asked in an interview at the Krem-
    lin by New York Times associate editor James Reston if expenditures
    for space exploration were questioned by Soviet government
    officials. He replied:-â€œI would say that man will always go on seeking
    a solution to the problems of the universe. There will always be
    funds that will be set aside to resolve the problems relating to the
    world and the universe; this is all to the good, if itâ€™s purely
                   .
    scientific. . .  We. donâ€™t have any contradiction in the Soviet Union
    between appropriations for space research and for the needs of the
    population. The funds appropriated are relatively small compared
    with the funds serving the needs of the population on education and
    such. They are negligible on the over-all expenditure. Space ex-
    penses do not detract from the needs of the population.â€
       Asked if the U.S.S.R. wanted to go forward with peaceful space
    arrangements, Kosygin said: â€œWe have expressed our view on
    this. We are in favor of peaceful, not military, uses of outer
    space. Now, to insure that peaceful research in space does not place
    too much of a burden on us, states might reduce military expenditures
    and channel the funds into peaceful space explorations.â€
       Reston queried: â€œYou have made great progress in space with the
    use of the most sophisticated and complicated computers and other
    modern science, yet your speech on Sept. 27 was highly critical of the
    lag in the use of modern science in Soviet industry. Why this dis-
    crepancy ?â€ Kosygin replied : â€œI donâ€™t understand your distinction
    between space and economic and industrial development. We judge
    our economy as a whole-we include all spheres. It is true that not
    everything is going satisfactorily in science and technology. Not
    everywhere are the most advanced methods being used. We are now
    taking all possible measures and we shall remedy this situation. For

  Designs for an aircraft with speed potential of 17,500 mph were being
     studied by both USAF and NASA, reported the Washington Daily

     and the hypersonic Ramjet by NASA, the aircraft could reach about
     180,000-ft. altitude with the Ramjet engine and then be boosted into
     space by a small auxiliary hydrogen rocket motor. Above 180,000 ft.
     there would not be enough oxygen to support the Ramjet engineâ€™s
     combustion. The aircraft would fire retrorockets to reenter the atmos-

    auts Walter Schirra and Thomas Stafford and the flight directors of
    NASA. With the world watching, they acted with remarkable courage
    in the face of danger and potential disaster. Their eager desire and
    determination to try again proves once more that men are the real
    heroes-and the essential factor-in space exploration.â€ (Pres. DOC.,

  Soviet Cosmonauts Konstantin P. Feoktistov and Lt. Boris B. Yegorov,
    two of three crew members in the 24-hr. spaceflight of VOSKHOD I,
    launched Oct. 12, 1964., had experienced space sickness during the
    flight, Tass reported. They felt nausea while in the state of weight-
    lessness and imagined themselves to be suspended in strange
    positions. The disorders, Tass said, stemmed from specific irritations
    to the vestibular organs and were related to the duration of training
    and what Tass called the cosmonautsâ€™ â€œsensitivity to imponderability.â€

  Radio Prague disclosed that at a November meeting in Moscow of So-
    viet-bloc countries the U.S.S.R. had agreed to launch Communist na-

    research. Countries involved were preparing research programs
    which would be announced in 1966. (NYIâ€™,12/12/65,141)
  Sigvard Eklund, general director of the International Atomic Energy
    Agency, told Tass that Soviet Union had a new type of nuclear reactor
    that could be used as a power station in space. He said the Romashka
     (Daisy) reactor provided electricity â€œon the basis of direct conversion
    of heat given out by a chain reaction from nuclear fission,â€ and that
    such a source could â€œfeed scientific instruments on sputniks or satel-
    lites.â€ (Wash. Post, 12/12/65, A28)
  Analysts of the 1966 budget of the U.S.S.R. had suggested that the 9.9%

    stalled at the Baltimore Martin Co. plant and was not removed due to
    â€œhuman error.â€ The Martin Co., makers of the Titan 11 booster for
    Gemini spacecraft, could lose a $15,000 bonus because of the launch

       Airport would provide a number of special advantages: ( 1 ) aircraft
     would have an infinitely long runway; (2) airport would require only
     % the acreage needed for an equivalent conventional airport; (3)

December 15-16;GEMINI VI, piloted by Walter Schirra, Jr. (Capt., USN),
    command pilot, and Thomas P. Stafford (Maj., USAF), pilot, was suc-
    cessfully launched from ETR with two-stage Titan 11 booster on NASAâ€™s
     fifth manned spaceflight in the Gemini series and first rendezvous
    mission. It achieved an elliptical orbit: apogee, 161 mi. (259.7 km.) ;
    perigee, 100 mi. (161.1 km.) ; inclination, 28.9â€™ ; period, 88.7
    min. Toward the end of the first revolution, GEMINI VI was trailing
    GEMINI VII by 1,200 mi. (1,935 km.) . Schirra began series of posi-
    grade maneuvers in preparation for rendezvous in the fourth revolu-
    tion by firing thruster rockets 18 sec. to shorten the distance between
    the two spacecraft to 730 mi. (1,177 km.) . Schirra fired rear thruster
    rockets 77 sec. during the second revolution and GEMINI VI drew
    within 300 mi. (483 km.) of GEMINI VII; 30 min. iater he fired
    another brief burn to move GEMINI VI 7/1000ths of a degree south to
    the same plane as GEMINI VII. With the spacecraft 431 mi. (695
    km.) apart, Schirra fired the thrusters one second to shift GEMINI VI
    into a somewhat higher orbit-the only maneuver not prearranged by
    the flight plan. To shorten the 230-mi. (371-km.) distance between
    the two spacacrsfi as GXIX v: entered its third revolution. Schirra
    fired his thrusters 53 sec. to shift into near-circular orbit: apogee, 170
    mi. (274 km.) ; perigee, 165.5 mi. (267 km.); inclination,
    89.9â€™. Schirra initiated terminal phase of the rendezvous maneuver
    with a 32 fps posigrade burn as GEMINI VI entered its fourth revolution.
    GEMINI VI and VI1 were then flying nose to nose about 25,000 ft.
    apart. Schirra applied a posigrade velocity of 43 fps and GEMINI VI
    approached within six feet-later         determined to be one foot-of
    GEMINI VII. VI then performed an in-plane fly-around maneuver
    around VII, and later VII maneuvered beside VI. Flight plans had
    specified four hours of station keeping, but the two Geminis flew in
    formation, keeping within 20 to 100 ft. of each other, for 5 hrs., 19
    min., during which time the astronauts photographed each othersâ€™
    crafts, sighted a fire in Madagascar, and conversed. All crewmen
    took turns in the formation flying activities, to obtain rendezvous ma-
    neuvering experience. After 15 hrs., 19 min., Schirra fired GEMINI
    VIâ€™S thruster rockets to separate the two spacecraft about 15 mi. for
    drifting flight during the sleep period.
        On Dec. 16, GEMINI VI Astronaut Schirra reported to Mission Con-

  Editorial commentary in Washington Post on GEMINI VII-VI flight:
    â€œOn the crowded globe beneath the soaring astronauts men were still
    fighting each other, cursing each other, starving each other and mal-
    treating each other. Not yet have mortals risen above manâ€™s inhu-
    manity to man. Not yet have they surmounted the emotions that set
    at naught the generations of light and learning. Not yet are they wise
    enough to govern their passions. But hope soars aloft with the
    astronauts. The creatures who can do this, the beings who can defy
    gravity, disregard distance, conquer space, circumnavigate the planet

 In conversations with West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard,
    President Johnson announced he would send a commission to
    Europe early in 1966 to consult with nations wishing to join the U.S.
    in â€œa major endeavorâ€ in space exploration. The group would be
    headed by NASA Administrator James E. Webb. The President said:
        . . . we would like to discuss with you-and others-an even more
     66


     ambitious plan to permit us to do together what we cannot do so well
     alone. Examples would be two projects which stand high on the space
     agenda. Both are very demanding and complex. One would be a
    probe to the sun, and another a probe to Jupiter. To cooperate on
                                                                             561

 At NASA Industry Briefing on Computer Procurement, held at Hq., NASA
    briefed representatives of 14 leading companies in the automatic data
    processing industry on NASAâ€™s          present and future plans and policies for
    the procurement of large-scale computing systems. William Rieke,
    NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Industry Affairs, pointed out
    that NASAâ€™s principal purpose in future Adp procurements would be to
    increase competition throughout the computer industry. Citing the
    growing concern in recent years over expanding Adp inventories and
    increasing dollar expenditures for computers throughout Government,
    Rieke outlined a three-point plan to improve the exchange of informa-
    tion between NASA and the computer industry: (1) NASA would hold
    annual industry briefings to inform computer firms of its long-range
    plans, problems, needs for improved system technology, and projected
    procurements with the first to be held next May; ( 2 ) individual com-
    puter manufacturers would be given an opportunity to conduct annual
    briefing for NASAâ€™s          personnel to inform NASA of their plans, prob-
    lems, and developments; (3) in connection with large or unusual Adp
    procurements with restrictive requirements, NASA would hold
    prespecification briefings for interested companies in advance of issu-
    ing requests for proposals.

December 30: ComSatCorp invited design proposals for a multi-purpose
    satellite having at least 20 times the communications capacity of EARLY
    BIRD I. Firms throughout the world were asked to submit pro-
    posals. ComSatCorp said more than one study contract could be
    awarded. Proposed new satellite would make nationwide and interna-
    tional distribution of television feasible, provide a sending and receiv-
    ing capability between ground stations and ships at sea or aircraft in
    flight, provide complete interchangeability from one type of service to
    another within a single satellite, and permit access to these services by
    any number of earth stations. (ComSatCorp Release)
  NASA and USAF announced agreement for extended XB-70 flight research
    beginning next spring in joint project to obtain supersonic operational
    flight information impossible to get in ground facilities. Among the
    items of interest were skin friction, stability and control, drag, bound-
    ary layer flow, air loads, thermal environment, sonic boom, landing,
    and crew workload. (NASA Release 65-393)
December 31: Soviet space probe VENUS 11, launched Nov. 12, would pass
    â€œat the prescribed distanceâ€ from Venus, Tass announced. VENUS
    111, launched Nov. 16, had been corrected in flight â€œin order to bring
    it closer to Venus,â€ the announcement added. Telemetered data
    showed that conditions aboard both probes were normal; scientific
    instrumentation was functioning normally. VENUS 11 was 15.5-million
    km. (9.6-million mi.) from earth; VENUS 111 was 14.3 million km.
     (8.9 million mi.) away. (Tass, 12/31/65)
  Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to fly in space, said in an inter-
    view with Krasnaya Zvezda that an increasing number of professions
    would take part in future spaceflights. He noted that pilots, en-
    gineers, a scientist, and a doctor had already flown in Soviet
    spacecraft. Gagarin described recent American spaceflights as â€œa ma-
     jor achievement,â€ but said it would be a simplification to interpret
     U S . accomplishments as â€œfirst steps on an unexplored way.â€ He said
     Soviet spacecraft VOSTOK 111 and VOSTOK IV had flown in formation
    in August 1962. (AP, Wash. Eve. Star, 12/31/65, A2)
  U S . and Yugoslavia would exchange visits and information under a
    new, non-Governmental agreement reached between the U S . National
    Academy of Sciences and the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences. Under
    the terms of a memorandum of understanding, scientists of both coun-
     tries would be able to take advantage of short- and long-term visits to
    lecture, conduct seminars, or carry out laboratory research. Money
     for the exchange program would come from the U S . National Science
    Foundation. (Wash. Post, 12/1/65, A3)
  In a report of shareholders for fall 1965, ComSatCorp said it had rea-
    lized revenues of $966,000 from the operation of EARLY BIRD I cover-
    ing a period from June 28, when the satellite began commercial service
    between North America and Europe, through Sept. 30. As of Sept.
    30, the Corporationâ€™s total cash and temporary cash investments
    amounted to $187,767,000. (ComSatCorp Release)

During December: NASA Flight Research Center had completed analysis of
    flight handling characteristics of six representative light private air-
    craft currently manufactured in the U S . Aircraft flown in the study
    were considered a good cross-section of this type of aircraft and in-
    cluded high- and low-wing and single- and twin-engine configurations.
    Report would be published as a technical note in spring 1966. ( A v .

  Snap-1OA     nuclear ground test system, designated Flight System-3
    (FS-3) and a flight-qualified copy of the SNAPSHOT I orbital test sys-
    tem, had operated continually since January 22, 1965, exceeding by
    four months the previous record for continuous power operation of
    any known reactor. By the time of the SNAPSHOT I launch (April 3 ) ,
    FS-3 had accumulated more than 70 days of operating time. Con-
    tinuing to operate throughout the remainder of the year, the system
    operated satisfactorily but with a gradual degradation in power
    output. (Atomic Energy Programs, 1965, 151-152)
  The Council of the NAS announced that a statement had been placed in
    the Minutes of the Council as a memorial t o the late Dr. Hugh L.
    Dryden :
        â€œAlthough the service and devotion of Hugh L. Dryden to the Na-
    tional Academy of Sciences, where he was ten years Home Secretary,
    twelve years our colleague in the Council, and twenty-one years a
    member of the Section of Engineering, â€™nave in our tiitit: raielji been
    equalled and certainly not surpassed, they represent only a portion of
    his service and devotion to several national institutions closely linked
    to the welfare of our people. . . . In achieving so much for his
    country and its institutions, he gave of himself without thought of
    self. He was deeply admired and loved by all who came in associa-
    tion with him. The sorrow felt at his passing by all members of the
    Academy is accompanied by an enduring pride in honoring his memo-
    ry..â€ ( NAS-NRC-NAE News Report, 12/65)
  In his book Galaxies, Nuclei, and Quasars British scientist Fred Hoyle
    declared that on the basis of new evidence the â€œsteady-stateâ€ theory of
                     which he had been a leading proponent since 1948-
    cosmology-of
    was now untenable. He discussed his new theory, a variation of the
    oscillating-universe concept. (Science, 12/24/65,1708\
  NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ended 1965 with 7,522 employees
    earning in excess of $82.8 million-about    700 of whom were located
    in contractor plants throughout the US. There were some 4,280 con-
    tractor employees working at MSFCâ€™S Redstone Arsenal complex with
    estimated earnings of $43 million bringing the Centerâ€™s direct and in-
    direct payroll for 1965 (combined Civil Service and contractor) to
    about $125.8 million. An estimated 10,000 other contractor workers
    were employed by contractors in Huntsville in connection with MSFC
    programs. ( MSFC Release 65-313)
  Principal source of advanced technology in the U S . had been and would
    remain the aerospace industry, postulated an article in
    Aerospace. Only in its programs were technical goals high enough
    and national requirements urgent enough to move forward in major
    steps. As these steps were completed and technical goals achieved, the
    entire economy fell heir to the new technology. Key goals in defense
    and space programs were listed as: (1) lowering costs; (2) improv-
570              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

    ing the efficiency of motors, generators, and all other energy conver-
    sion devices and processes; (3)improving design, that is, reducing the
    weight and increasing the strength of all machines, by either improved
    knowledge of the machine or by using lighter, stronger materials; (4)
    improving the accuracies to which machines could be controlled; (5)
    improving reliability ; 16) improving communications between men,
    between men and machines, and between machines. (Aerospace,
    Winter 1965)
During 1965: In 1965, NASA attempted 28 missions with 23 successes, a
    score of 82% mission success. Two spacecraft were launched on a
    single booster. NASA attempted 30 launches of space boosters and had
    26 successes, a score of 87% launch vehicle success.
        Of the 92 payloads orbited by the US., NASA orbited 25-five of
    which were two-manned spacecraft and four were escape-mission
    probes. U.S.S.R. orbited 64 payloads: of which one was a manned
    spacecraft and seven were escape-mission probes. France entered the
    space age with two satellites. one orbited by France herself (A-I) and
    one by the U S . (FR-I 1 .
        Most spectacular of NASAâ€™s    space missions were the real-time recep-
    tion of close-up lunar photographs by RANGER IX, first U S . extravehi-
     cular activity by GEMINI IV Astronaut White, manâ€™s first close look at
     Mars (including 21 photographs) by MARINER IV, and manned ren-
     dezvous to within one foot by GEMINI VI and VII. The Gemini pro-
    gram began 1965 with GT-2 unmanned suborbital flight; this was
     followed by four two-man orbital flights which logged more than 1,300
     manhours in space. GEMINI v and VII, long-duration missions (8
     and 14 days respectively) proved man can withstand extended condi-
     tions of spaceflight and validated plans for manned Apollo lunar
     flights. At the yearâ€™s end Gemini spaceflights had set for the U S .
     more than 10 records, among them the record for total manhours in
     space: 1,354hrs., 38 min., vs. U.S.S.R.â€™s 507 hrs., 16 min.
        1965 was a year of extensive ground tests of the Apollo spacecraft
     and the Saturn launch vehicles. There were static firings of engines
     for the various Saturn IB and Saturn V stages, highlighted by
     full-duration firing of all three Saturn V stages. Saturn I program
    ended with a record of 1 successes out of 10 attempts, its three 1965
                                  0
    launches orbiting Pegasus meteoroid detection satellites. Fire 11 pro-
     vided valuable data for Apollo on reentry from simulated lunar trajec-
     tory.
        In lunar and planetary achievement, RANGERS VIII and IX provided
     more than 13,000 lunar surface photographs and brought that project
     to a close. Atlas-Centaur AC-6 launched a dummy Surveyor on a
     simulated lunar transfer orbit and proved itself capable of operational
     Surveyor missions. NASA stepped up its interplanetary research with
     PIONEER VI, first of four projected interplanetary satellites.
        TIROS IX became the first weather satellite to provide close to 100%
     coverage of the earth daily, and TIROS x was the first in a series of
     interim operational satellites for the, US. Weather Bureau. Five Ex-
     plorer scientific satellites, os0 11, Canadaâ€™s ALOUETTE 11, and Franceâ€™s
                                                                        571

    FR-I were orbited. NASA orbited SECOR v for the U.S. Army, SGLRAD
    IX (EXPLORER XXX) for the U S . Navy, and EARLY BIRD I communica-
    tions satellite for the Communications Satellite Corporation. NASA
    turned over SYNCOMS 11 and 111 to DOD for operational use at the
    completion of their R R ~ D
                              function.
       The five NASA mission failures: vehicle test of Atlas-Centaur AC-5;
    test of Apollo launch escape system on a Little Joe 11 booster; failure
    of OGO 11, which did return good (but incomplete) experiment data;
    failure to orbit a third Orbiting Solar Observatory; and failure of
    Gemini 6 because Agena Target Vehicle did not achieve orbit.
       In 39 successful launches, DOD orbited 67 satellites. I n addition,
    there were four unsuccessful DOD space launches, losing five
    payloads. Decision was made that DOD proceed with the Manned Or-
    biting Laboratory, and launches were begun of the powerful Titan
    111-cwhich would eventually orbit the Mol.
       Highlighting the U.S.S.R.'s busy space year was man's first extra-ve-
    hicular space activity, by VOSKHOD 11's Cosmonaut Leonov. Soviet
    lunar exploration intensified, with apparent soft-landing attempts by
    LUNAS v through VIII, as well as photographs of the moon's hidden
    side by interplanetary probe ZOND III. U.S.S.R. launched VENUS 11
    and 111 on the long flight toward the planet Venus. (Western experts
    speculated that COSMOS LX was an unsuccessful lunar soft-landing at-

During 1965: Some NASA research highlights of 1965:
       NASA launched 191 scientific sounding rockets to obtain a variety of
    scientific data and about i 0 i o r advailcad research acd techr?n!-
    ogy. By the end of the year, the three x-15 research aircraft had
    made 156 flights, 32 of them in 1965. Tests proceeded of the
    modified X-15 (No. 2 ) , expected to exceed 5,000-mph flight
    speed. NASA supported the National supersonic transport program
    and evaluated wind tunnel models of the two proposed Sst
    designs. NASA continued using USAF XB-70 aircraft for research in
    flight problems of Sst and large supersonic aircraft in general. Feasi-
    bility studies of adapting V/Stol concepts to commercial transportation
    and wind-tunnel studies of several V/Stol designs continued. As part
    of research toward efficient design of hypersonic aircraft, comparative
    performance and heat transfer measurements were obtained on a varie-
    ty of aircraft wings, bodies, and wing-body combinations. Ramjet
    engine research was in the engine design concept phase. NASA devel-
    oped and tested a new near-field theory useful in predicting sonic
    boom characteristics of Sst configurations during transonic climb-out.
    Flight research of M-1 lifting body was advanced, and construction
    of HL-10 lifting body was being completed.
       Solid propulsion technology was advanced with static-firing of the
    260-in. solid-fuel rocket motor. In nuclear rocket technology, three
    Nerva reactor experiments were completed and the new Phoebus ad-
    vanced graphite reactor test program was begun. The success of a
572              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1965

      2,600-hr. ion engine test provided evidence that life-times of 10,000
      hrs. for electric rocket thrusters may be within reach. Among high-
    lights in electronics and control was reentry communications experi-
    ment on GEMINI 111 demonstrating feasibility of water injection to
    overcome communications blackout during reentry. ( U.S. Aeron. &
    Space Act., 1965, 25-38; OSSA & OART S.Rkt. Proj. Off.; NASA Release
    65-368)
During 1965: About 90%, of NASAâ€™s     budget was going to contractors to pay
    for work being done by nearly 400,000 people of about 20,000 prime
    and subcontractors. In the university program, NBSA was doing husi-
    ness with about 200 universities in every state on space-related projects
    at the yearâ€™s end. NASAâ€™srequirement to transfer its technology to
    other sectors of the economy had developed into an information system
    with more than 200,000 technical documents abstracted, indexed, and
    filed in a computer-based nationwide system. (NASA      Release 65-368)
  NASAâ€™s â€™65 top 100 contractors, according to the net value of direct
          FY
    awards, were headed by North American-Downey ($1,099,448,000),
    Boeing-New Orleans ($305,988,000) , Grumman-Bethpage ($267,226,-
    c@o), Douglas-Santa Monica ($251,668,000) , GE-Huntsville ($181,472,-

     ($111,148,000), and RCA-Princeton ($106,552,000). Total NASA pro-
    curements for the year totaled $5,187,000:000 with the top 100 firms
    accounting for $4,141,434,000 of that amount. (NASA Ann. Procure-
    ment Rpt. FY 1965)
  Some highlights of the year in physics: Planet Mars has no substantial
    magnetic field, according to scientific experiments by MARINER IV Mars
    probe. Because of this, Martian life-forms would have to be able to
    withstand intense radiation, but possibility of Martian life was not ruled
    out. MARINER IV also reported Marsâ€™ atmosphere was too thin to
    readily support parachute or glider-type descents for soft landings
    on the planet.
        Comet Ikeya-Seki, the brightest comet to enter the solar system this
    century, was discovered Sept. 18 and subsequently studied from the
    ground, airplanes, and rockets. The comet passed within 300,000 mi.
     of the sun and made a hairpin turn Oct. 21, when it broke into three
    pieces.
       Results of NASAâ€™s  testing of public reaction to sonic booms, begun in
     1961, showed that no serious psychological or physiological effects
    result from sonic booms. Commercial use of the supersonic transport,
    to begin in early 1970â€™s, was expected to create sonic booms that, when
    Sstâ€™s come into full use in the US., would be heard by everyone about
    once a day.
        On the subject of antimatter. two items: Swedish physicist Hannes
    Alfven theorized such cosmic phenomena as quasi-stellar radio sources
     (â€œquasarsâ€), radio stars, and supernovae may be powered by matter-
     antimatter annihilations ; and, antideutrons were produced in the labo-
    ratory by scientists of Columbia Univ.
       Unwanted noise from a BTL horn-reflector antenna being used in
    comsat research may have been radiation from the birth of the
    universe. This interpretation was based on the â€œbig bangâ€ theory of
                                                                        573

    the universeâ€™s formation and was propounded by a group of Princeton
    Univ. scientists.
       Decision was believed near on which of the three principal models
    of the universe was correct-the steady-state, expanding, or oscillating
    universe theory. Results in astronomy based on red-shifts of â€œblue-
    galaxiesâ€™â€™ (discovered in 1965) and quasars hinted at an oscillating
    universe. ( AIP News, 12/22/65)
During 1965: Among highlights in the US. communications satellite pro-
    gram were : initiation of commercial comsat operations, with EARLY
    BIRD I in synchronous orbit over the Atlantic; initiation of a syn-
    chronous-orbit comsat program to furnish communications for Project
    Apollo and for expanded commercial service; and growth of the In-
    ternational Telecommunications Satellite Consortium to 48 member
    nations, representing every continent. Communications Satellite Corp.
    represented the U S . and served as manager for the consortium. (Com-
    SatCorp Release)
  LRC completed 10 experiments to explore nuclear engine chilldown (cool-
    ing by liquid hydrogen propellant) and to determine the range of
    conditions for which flow oscillations would occur in an engine
    system. An additional 16 runs were conducted to obtain data on the
    â€œbootstrapâ€ starting of a nuclear engine. Results of these tests indi-
    cated that nuclear rocket engines should be able to start smoothly and
    stably over a wide range of startup conditions. (Atomic Energy Pro-

  Nearly 390,000 visitors toured NASA Kennedy Space Center and Cape
    Kennedy. The Space Centerâ€™s doors were first opened to visitors Jan.
    3, 1965. In its first year, the Center was host to visitors from all 50
    states and 57 countries. (NASA Space Sheet, 3/31/66)
  Visitor attendance at the MSFC Space Orientation Center was 202,445, an
    increase of about 37% over 1964. (ivijFi: Historiar.)
  In the last half of the year, USAF doubled its airlift to Southeast Asia,
    mainly Vietnam. In the first six months of 1965 the Military Air
    Transport Service (MATS) airlifted 37,684 tons of cargo and 91,994
    passengers to the area. In the last half, it flew in 58,858 tons of cargo
    and 183,132 passengers.
       USAF flew 10,570 tactical sorties over North Vietnam and 37,940
    over South Vietnam (compared to 764 for 1964) ; VNAF flew an addi-
    tional 23,700 sorties during 1965, mostly over South Vietnam. (Wat-

effort continued to gain momentum. A total of 160 payloads was success-
fully orbited in a total of 102 launches. Thus more than one third of the
payloads was in multiple-payload launches. The US. program was up to
94 payloads in 61 launches in 1965 from 76 payloads in 60 launches in
1964 (DOD: 67 payloads in 39 launches, compared with 53/38; NASA: 27
payloads-counting 2 rendezvous pods ejected from manned Gemini space-
craft-in 22 launches, compared with 23/22). The U.S.S.R. once again
almost doubled its program from a numerical standpoint, with 66 payloads
in 50 launches, compared with 35/30 in 1964. Multiple payload launches
increased: the U S . had 46 payloads on 15 multiple-payload launches; DOD
had 40 payloads on its 12 multi-payload launchings and NASA had 6 on 3;
U.S.S.R. had 23 on 7. Areas of concentration were also obvious: the U.S.
took the absolute lead in manned spaceflight, with five 2-manned Gemini
flights to the one Soviet 2-manned flight. But the Soviets more than dou-
bled the US. deep-space effort, with 5 lunar flights and two planetary
flights to the US. 2 and 1.
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag behind each
flight of the analysis and interpretation of scientific results.

      CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHINGS
   JANUARY 1,1965, THROUGH DECEMBER 31,1965
  This chronology of major          launchings in 1965 is intended to provide
                             NASA
an accurate and ready historical reference, one compiling and verifying
information previously scattered over several sources. It includes launch-
ings of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by
NASA or under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., NASA provided vehicle, launch facili-
ties, tracking facilities, and performed the launch for the French satellite,
      .
FR-1)
    An attempt has been made to classify the performance nf Enth the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for vehicle performance and
                              (S), partially successful (P), and unsuccessful
mission results-successful
 ( U ) . A fourth category, unknown (Unk) , has been provided for payloads
where vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise its
main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since many
of the results cannot be neatiy categorized. Also they igiioie the fact &at
a great deal was learned from shots that may have been classified as unsuc-
cessful.
    A few unique items require separate treatment. Their dates have been
kept in sequence but their history has been relegated to footnotes. Date of
launch is referenced to local time at the launch site.
    Sources used were all open ones, verified where in doubt from the project
offices in NASA Hq. and from the NASA Centers. For further information on
each item, see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chro-
nology as referenced in the index. Prepared January 1966 by Dr. Frank
W.Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian (EPH) .

CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT 1961-1965
   This chronology contains basic information on manned spaceflights by
the United States and the Soviet Union through 1965. The information
was compiled by William D. Putnam, Assistant NASA Historian for Manned
Space Flight. The scope and pace of the manned spaceflight effort has
increased to the extent that a table devoted exclusively to manned flights
seems a useful reference tool.
   By the end of 1965, the United States had conducted 11 manned
spaceflights, nine of these orbital, with a total of 13 different
crewmen. Three of the 13 American astronauts had participated in two
flights. The Soviet Union had conducted eight manned flights, all orbital,
with 11 different crewZen. N o Soviet cosmonaut had yet experienced two
space flights. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft hours in flight had
reached 704 hours, 4 minutes for the United States and 431 hours, 53
minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumulative total manhours in space were
1,354 hours, 14 minutes, and 506 hours, 29 minutes, respectively. The
American lead in this area came from two-man Gemini flights; these in-
creased in length from almost five hours in March 1965 to over 330 hours
for the two-week mission of GEMiNi vii in BecemScr.
   Data on United States flights are the latest available to date within
NASA. Soviet data are unofficial and derived from open sources, relying
heavily on the excellent work done on this subject by Dr. Charles S. Shel-
don 11, professional staff member of the National Aeronautics and Space
Council. Details are always subject to revision as information is refined,
but the major aspects of United States flights have been subject to direct
observation by the interested citizens of the world and scientific findings
have been presented to professional audiences at symposia and in the
professional literature.
   Since specific astronaut-cosmonaut ranks and titles are subject to change
over time, they are omitted from the chronology in the interest of
simplicity. All crew members listed, except Feoktistov and Yegorov of
VOSKHOD I, held military rank. Weight given is the weight of the total
spacecraft as placed in orbit. Maximum altitude is chosen from many
possible measurements because it represents a world record category as
recognized by the Fhdkation ACronautique Internationale.
