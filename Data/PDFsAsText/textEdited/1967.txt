                              Foreword
   The first decade of the Space Age is behind us and now in the hands of the
historians. It was a period of dynamic advance, bringing new appreciations
of our solar. environment and new capabilities to develop and exploit ad-
vancing knowledge and techniques. Since the space challenge of the next dec-
ade is likely to be just as demanding and rewarding as that of the last one,
perhaps we may gain useful perspective by reflecting upon our experiences
even as we contemplate tomorrow.
   Ten years ago our planning for the future required the piecing together
and development of the organization and management as well as disciplinary
and technical capability for space exploration. Today our planning for the
future can be based upon well-established and versatile capabilities in science,
engineering, and administration. Reliable space vehicles are available rang-
ing from small sounding rockets to the Titan I11 and Saturn V class vehicles.
The use of automated techniques in space has been demonstrated by the Mar-
iner, Ranger, Surveyor, Lunar Orbiter, Explorer, Geophysical and Solar
Observatories, Tiros, Nimbus, Syncom, the Applications Technology Satel-
lite, and many others. The capability of man himself to function usefully in
space has been,demonstrated in the successes of Mercury and Gemini and
expands rapidly as Apollo proceeds.
   Ten years ago we could only assert from intuition and prophecy the value
of space experimentation to science. Now we can point to the profound in-
fluence it has had on the geosciences, on astronomy, and is beginning to have
in life sciences. Thanks to our planetary probes, we have known since 1965that
the planet Mars has craters like the Moon. Thanks to our lunar probes, a de-
tailed lunar atlas can be prepared.
   Ten years ago we could only point forward hopefully to space applications
in meteorology, communications, navigation, and geodesy. Today these are
all operational areas. Global weather photographs are received daily even
in some of the most undeveloped areas of the world. Reliable, live TV broad-
casts bring worldwide historic events and Olympic games into our living rooms
routinely and in real time. Ships in all oceans use signals from satellites to
refine their knowledge of their position; soon aircraft will be doing the same.
Specially instrumented satellites and probes are daily filling in details on the
momentous geophysical discoveries of Van Allen and others.
   Ten years ago there was serious question as to whether there would be
enough skilled manpower or public interest to carry out a sustained program
of space exploration. Today great teams of competent scientists, engineers,
and managers are engaged in developing our national space and aeronautical
capability and applying its hard-earned technology to the most rewarding ap-
plications for commercial, industrial, social, and military purposes. Un-
paralleled scientific and technological success in our space venture during the
past decade not only vastly increased our skills and resources but also de-
veloped high confidence in our ability to solve other problems in todayâ€™s SO-
 ciety. Problems of national defense, oceanography, earth resources, the cities,

transportation, population, air pollution, and food-these are challenges that
cannot be sidestepped and for which the innovative enthusiasm and know-
how of the space program offers guidance, inspiration, and technique.
   Ten years ago the American space program began by almost doubling its
effort each year for several years; today the program is shrinking and has
been since 1966. Ten years ago mastering space technology was indeed a
major problem. Success was a rare and precious commodity. Today success
is routine and failures are rare. A decade ago the American people were
caught up in a wave of interest in the space venture and in a determined drive
to catch up with the Soviet Unionâ€™s bold initiative in space. Today Americans
can take satisfaction in what our Nation has so far accomplished in space;
they should also know that what has been done is only the merest begin-
ning of what can be done. Of course the values of space research, and indeed
of all research, must be weighed against their contribution to national needs.
In making this judgment it is very important that we fully appreciate the
investment we have made and the nature of the dividends we have earned.
   This useful chronology on Astronautics and Aeronautics, following the
pattern of its predecessor volumes, offers first documentation upon the multi-
tudinous events, people, and circumstances of the last year of the first decade
of the Space Age. All of us note with sadness the tragic loss of Astronauts
Grissom. White, and Chaffee on January 27. They joined the ranks of other
brave explorers like Magellan and Amundsen who also pioneered manâ€™s first
steps into a newly accessible environment. The worldâ€™s shock and grief at
their passing was eloquent testimony to the sense of identification that all
men feel with those few who explore new realms in their behalf. Other events,
though significant, were not so memorable. The first colored pictures of
Earth from the first ApplicationsTechnology Satellite or a new worldâ€™s speed
 record of 4,534 miles per hour by an X-15 rocket aircraft may not be re-
called when one begins to assess the events of 1967. The chronology logs them
for you. The United States launched a total of 87 spacecraft into Earth
orbit or on escape trajectories during 1967. Each one is cataloged here
in the chronology, one measure of the vast sweep of scientific and technical
accomplishment during the year just past. It is at our own peril that we
 forget or ignore what we have already experienced; we will simply have to
 relearn it if we do.
   Today, as we confer a solid â€œwell doneâ€ on the gains of the first decade
 of space exploration and take the first steps into the second decade, we find
 these steps hampered by uncertainty, reservations, and in some quarters even
 dismay. Here again words out of history can offer renewed perspective.
 Speaking a decade ago, before NASA was created and the national space
 commitment was undertaken, a wise statesman of science and technology,
 the late Hugh L. Dryden, observed:
          We must understand that the kind and magnitude of space pro-
       gram that our national interest requires will cost hundreds of mil-
       lions of dollars each year for many years to come. I know that some
      knowledgeable people fear that although we might be willing to
       spend a couple of billions for space technology in 1958, because
       we still remember the humiliation of Sputnik last October, next year
       we will be so preoccupied by color television, or new style cars, or
      the beginning of another national election campaign that weâ€™ll
       be unwilling to pay another yearâ€™s installment on our space con-
       quest bill. For that to happen-well, Iâ€™d just as soon we didnâ€™t
       start.
                                                                           V

                                Preface
   In 1961 the first publication by the one-man NASA Historical Staff was a
well-received chronology-Aeronautics and Astronautics: An American
Chronology of Science and Technology in the Exploration of Space,
1915-1960. The following year a volume covering the year 1961 was pre-
pared by the two-man Historical Staff and published by the House Committee
on Science and Astronautics. Also that year began a practice still existent.
Monthly draft chronologies were distributed for use and comment through-
out NASA and the Government, with the object of providing a timely reference
and revising them for an annual printed edition. The 1962 chronology volume,
considerably enlarged over 1961, was again printed by the House Committee.
From 1963 to the present, NASA has published each annual Astronautics and
Aeronautics chronology volume. As far as is known it is the only substantial,
continuing chronology effort in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics.
The reference value of each volume has increased with the passage of time.
    In 1964 the NASA Historical Staff joined in partnership with the Science
and Technology Division of the Library of Congress to produce the Astro-
nautics and Aeronautics chronology. Funded by NASA, employees of the
Library drafted the monthly chronology segments, validated critical com-
ments, added new items as later documentation became available, prepared
 the revised manuscript for publication, and compiled the intensive index.
 This partnership continues.
    Thus it was that by the end of the first decade of the Space Age the greatest
 share of NASA historical publications had been chronologies. Only a modest
 beginning was made on publishing full-fledged volumes in the NASA Histori-
 cal Series. The second decade of NASA begins with more narrative histories
 in process than chronologies. The reader will find on the inside back cover
 of this volume a complete list of NASA historical publications to date.
    This annual volume remains the product of a number of hands. The entire
 NASA Historical Staff participated in source collection, review, and publica-
 tion. At the Library Mrs. Anne Horton (through August 1967), Charles
 Thibault (from September 6n), Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith, and Mrs. Gay
 Arnelle drafted the monthly texts. Mr. Thibault and Mrs. Brock-Smith revised
 the monthly drafts for annual publication. Mr. Arthur Renstrom prepared
 the index. In the NASA Historical Staff, the general editor was Dr. Frank W.
 Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian. Technical editors were Mrs. Helen
 T. Wells (through July 1967) and Mrs. Carrie Karegeannes. Appendix A,

â€œMajor NASA Launches, 1967,â€ were prepared by Dr. Anderson. Appendix C,
Lâ€˜Abbreviationsof References,â€ was prepared by Mrs. Karegeannes. Creston
Whiting, of NASAâ€™s Information Services Branch, Scientific and Technical
Information Division, kept the process abreast of Russian releases. At the
NASA centers the historians and historical monitors submitted local material
for the chronology. Validation was the work of many busy people throughout
NASA and in other relevant branches of the Federal structure.
  A chronology is but the first step toward history as an intellectual discipline
and even it is never really completed. Comments, additions, and criticisms
are always welcomed.

January 1 : NAS had received over 400 applications for NASA astronaut
     training with one week remaining before Jan. 8 deadline. NAS had been
     asked by NASA to recruit and nominate a group of scientists and engi-
     neers for final selection and training as astronauts â€œto conduct scientific
     experiments in manned orbiting satellites and to observe and investigate
     the lunar surface and circumterrestrial space.â€ Applicants were required
     to be US. citizens no taller than six feet, born after Aug. 1, 1930; have
     a doctorate degree in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering; and
     meet physical requirements for pilot crew members. (NASA Release

January 2: Spanish scientists had submitted to the Spanish government a five-
     year, $10,000,000 space research program, the Chicago Tribune reported.
      According to Comision Nacional de Investigacibn del Espacio ( CONIE)
      President Gen. Rafael Calvo Rodes, primary program objectives would
      be to gather scientific data and gain practical experience in designing
     and launching rockets. During separate, $1,500,000 preparatory program
      which was completed in December 1966, Spain launched her first rocket,
     collected data, conducted preliminary experiments, trained technical per-
      sonnelÂ¶ and prepared permanent launching sites; during next phase,
      Spain would build her own Skua rockets. (Darrah, C Trib, 1/3/67)

 ∞ Aerospace industry must develop new type of management to cope with its
      record $26-billion workload during 1967, Robert Hotz wrote in Aviation
       Week. â€œWhat makes the current management problem so acute is the fact
      that military demands are reaching a peak at the same time that com-
      mercial aviation is soaring on the greatest boom in its history. During
       1965, the aerospace industry actually manufactured slightly more com-
      mercial airframe pounds than military-a historic milestone. The indus-
      try also has under development six new types of airline jet transports for
      which there were no prior military programs and which must be financed
       from privately raised funds. This is another unprecedented task for

    space program, Heather M. David reported in Technology Week.
    Analysis of research reports had indicated that future Soviet missions
    directed toward these objectives would include: (1) orbiting of three
    or four cosmonauts for three weeks; (2) extensive practice of extra-
    vehicular activity and assembly in orbit; (3) orbiting of animals to
    continue studying effects of long-term weightlessness and radiation ;
    and (4) lunar landing of animals for observation. David predicted
    preparations for interplanetary travel would be initiated shortly after
    establishment of permanent lunar colonies. (David, Tech Wk, 1/2/67,

∞ The New York Times called for fuller and more open debate on cost and
    consequences of SST program: â€œThe SSTâ€™s priority is debatable and SO
    is its financing. The industry may be right in asserting that the costs of
    development are so huge that no company can afford to take the risk
    on its own. It points out that the backing of both Britain and France has
    been required to launch the Concorde. But if the combined efforts of
    two countries and their aircraft industries are needed for that much
    less ambitious project, the American SST might be more safely and
    soundly developed if it commanded the combined resources of the entire
    American industry and the Government.
       â€œWhat is at stake is not the commitment to proceed with the SST. That
    decision has been made and cannot-and should not-be reversed. But
    if the SST is to be sound economically as well as technologically, the
    Administration and the industry must be less secretive and indefinite
    about the costs and how they are to be financed. An open debate is
    needed on how to get the most for the taxpayersâ€™ money.â€ (NYT,

January 3: Group of NASA officials, headed by MSFC Director Dr. Wernher
    von Braun, arrived at McMurdo Station in the Antarctic beginning 10-
    day expedition to observe environmental conditions-including tem-
    peratures, isolation factors, and survival techniques-for comparison
    and possible application to problems of space flight. (MSC Roundup;

    Supersonic Transport Development Field Office, had emerged as the
    test pilot most likely to certify the SST, Mitchell Gordon disclosed in the
    W l Street Journal. Tymczyszyn, certifier of both the Boeing 707 and
      al
    the Douglas DC-8 jetliners for US. service, had already spent four years
    familiarizing himself with SST operation, and had logged more than 1,000
    hrs in SST simulators. (Gordon, WSJ, 1/3/67,1)
  ∞Philadelphia Inquirer praised success of U.S.S.R.â€™s Luna XI11 and urged
    that U.S. continue its intensive lunar-landing program : â€œSpace treaty
    or no space treaty, the competitive moon race goes on and even though
    nobody really likes the idea, the US. has to try to do better than the
    SovietUnionâ€™sLuna13. . . .
       â€œNo one can guess for certain what strategic role it [the moon] might
                .
    play if . . the Soviet Union were to make technological advances that
    would enable it to deny the use of space to the rest of the world.
       â€œLuna 13 has chalked up a meaningful achievement for the Russian
    space program. Americans should not be tempted to underrate it.â€ (P

         â€œIt is a mistake to think of the space program only in terms of the

      and transmit radio signals back to earth was discussed by Jesse L.
      Mitchell, Director of Physics and Astronomy Programs. Spacecraft
      would determine electron density in solar atmosphere by measuring
      time it took signals to travel from spacecraft back to earth. NASA was
      also considering a plan to launch a satellite toward Jupiter, then use
      Jupiterâ€™s magnetic field to push the spacecraft toward other planets and
      eventually hurl it into space 1-10 trillion miles away.
         Oran W. Nicks, Director of Lunar and Planetary Programs, out-
      lined plans for unmanned missions to Mars and Venus, beginning
      with a small instrumented probe scheduled for launch in June 1967.
      In the 1971 Mars and 1972 Venus missions, teams of two spacecraft
      would be launched by a modified Saturn V booster. One spacecraft
      would penetrate planetâ€™s atmosphere ; take measurements as it sped
      toward planetâ€™s surface; and flash data to the second spacecraft-
      programed to fly past the planet-before crashlanding. Data would
      be transmitted to earth by the flyby spacecraft. Missions would pave
      the way for later spacecraft with improved equipment-possibly in-
      cluding TV cameras-to softland on the planets.
         Thumb-sized desert mice fitted with tiny radio transmitters and telem-
      etry equipment which could broadcast mouseâ€™s temperature up to six
      months were being conditioned for future space flight, Dr. Orr E. Reyn-
      olds, Director of Bioscience Programs, disclosed. â€œAstromouseYy-which
      ate only sunflower seeds and never drank water-might be orbited
      with three astronauts in Apollo spacecraft. Others might be launched
      into interplanetary space in a Pioneer study of biological specimens
      outside earthâ€˜s gravitational field.
         Plans for a multi-purpose satellite that would combine the functions
      of many unmanned spacecraft currently in orbit were revealed by Dr.
      Morris Tepper, Deputy Director of Space Applications and Director of
      Meteorology. Developed under unified space applications program,
      satellite would carry equipment to observe weather conditions ; relay
      communications to distant earth stations ; provide navigation traffic
      control for ships and aircraft; and compile data on earthâ€˜s natural
      resources.
         No mention of unmanned scientific lunar probes was made during the
      briefing. When asked later in an interview whether he thought interest in
      unmanned exploration of the moon would diminish after astronauts
      landed, Dr. Newel1 replied: â€œNot at all.â€ Although astronauts would
      dominate lunar exploration, unmanned Surveyor spacecraft would prob-
      ably land in unsafe areas, and Lunar Orbiter photography missions
      would continue for mapping. Discussion of unmanned lunar missions
      had been omitted because â€œwe wanted to tell about the newer of new
      things in our thinking.â€ (Transcript; Hines, W Star, 1/8/67, A16)

      Dept., emphasized the need to establish an adequate balance between
      â€œdirectly beneficialâ€ and â€œremedialâ€ technologies. As air and water
      pollution, land damage from mining, soil erosion, and other problems
      become acute, man must give more thought to remedial actions for

     servatory announced observation of what was apparently the greatest
     explosion ever recorded by man. Explosion occurred in quasar 3C-445
     many million or billions of years ago, and caused it to increase in bril-
     liance 20-fold in a matter of weeks or months.
         Cal Techâ€™s Dr. Maarten Schmidt told conference of a new quasar,
     PIGS 0237-23, that appeared to be farther from earth than any other
     reported to date. PKS 0237-23, receding at 80% the speed of light, was
     most remarkable, however, because it displayed two â€œred s h i f t s â€ 4 i s -
     placement toward red end of the light spectrum as objects speed away.
     If both shifts were indicators of velocity, it would mean that part of

    linked to a starlike object. Finding of second source, located in Constel-

    objects represented a new type of celestial phenomenon, perhaps related
    to the manner in which stars are formed.
        Princeton Univ. physicist Dr. Robert H. Dicke revealed an observa-

    Dicke told the conference that his experiments showed the sun to be flat-
    tened at the poles and that the oblateness was sufficient to explain a
    significant portion of Mercuryâ€™s orbital behavior, without recourse to
    relativity. It was the precise conformity of Mercuryâ€™s orbit to Dr. Ein-
    steinâ€™s predictions that was the chief pillar of his theory. â€œIt wouldnâ€™t

∞President Johnson submitted his FY 1968 Budget Request to Congress.
     Total space budget recommended was $7.242 billion. Of this sum, NASA
     would receive $5.050 billion; DOD, $1.998 billion; AEC, $151.6 million;
     ESSA, $34.8 million; US. Geological Survey, $4.8 million; Agricultural
     Research Service, $.4 million; and NSF, $2.8 million.
        NASA FY 1968 budget would keep Project Apollo on schedule and
     provide major hardware funding for several new programs: (1) $454.7
     million for Apollo Applications (AA) ; (2) $71.5 million for Voyager;
      (3) $68.9 million for Mariner to provide for Mariner/Mars 1971 pro-
     gram; (4) $2 million for five Sunblazer missions to study solar corona;
      (5) $35.5 million for Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) to provide
     new configuration with large directable antenna; and (6) $2.3 million
     for Voice Broadcast Satellite. Funding for aeronautics research almost
     doubled from $35.9 million in M 1967 to $66.8 million with most of
     increase attributable to increased study of X-15 and XFL-70 aircraft,
     hypersonic ramjet, aircraft noise reduction, delta X-15 aircraft, and SST.
     Programs terminated or deferred by FY 1968 budget included Jupiter

    opment. $t10-$1OO million were placed in Presidentâ€™s Contingency Fund
    pending decision on development of Nerva nuclear propulsion system.
        Major portions of DODâ€™S space budget would be spent on: (1) Manned
    Orbiting Laboratory ( ~ 0 ~ ) - $ 4 3 0million; (2) Titan 111-C launch
    vehicle; and (3) military comsats. Most of ESSAâ€™S funds would support

    nation will need to do in 1970 and beyond.
        â€œI believe it is a balanced program that makes the best use of the
    resources that we have created since 1958. I believe it includes those
    items that enable the Congress and the country to clearly see and judge
    the issues which are basic to our future in space.
        â€œI believe it assumes success. That is, that it is a minimum budget for
    the work that is required and does not provide for losses of stages or
     for unexpected catastrophes such as are always a possibility in this
    program.
       â€œ. .. finally, I believe that this budget indicates that we have proven
     in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that the space

    tems. Webb observed that most modern military aircraft could not be
    readily redesigned into economical commercial systems: â€œWhen unit
    costs were low and interaction between the elements of the design were
    small, a manufacturer could afford a substantial element of uncertainty

∞Orbiting satellites could survive Van Allen radiation belts 10 to 100 times

    longer than originally estimated if their outer shells were shaped like
    spheres, Dr. Charles Mack, MIT Lincoln Lab, suggested at AIAAâ€™S Aero-
    space Sciences Meeting in New York. Basing his prediction on res1113
    from new MIT-developed technique to simulate Van Allen belts, Dr. Mack
    said that radiation would always strike the surface of a sphere at wide
    angles, improving the chances of scattering and thereby decreasing the
    amount of absorption. Ideal spacecraft would be 10-ft-dia sphere with
    instrumentation in the core, Dr. Mack said. Most current satellites were
    smaller and carried instruments near surface. New York Times writer
    John Wilford reported that GSFC planned to have MIT-type simulator in

    He said plans were to form an â€œembryonic space stationâ€ in 1968-69
    by clustering four AA payloads launched with Uprated Saturn I boosters.
    First mission would be launch of manned spacecraft, followed several
    days later by launch of spent S-IVB stage converted into a workshop.
    After two spacecraft had docked, crew would enter workshop through
    an airlock. They would prepare workshop for storage and return to
    earth in their spacecraft 28 days later. In three to six months, second
    manned capsule would be launched on 56-day mission to deliver re-

    and Appropriations Committees, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara
    made a determined attempt both to persuade Congress not to insist
    on a U.S. antimissile defense and to dissuade the U.S.S.R. from
    continuing her efforts to deploy such a system. McNamara said U.S.
    and Soviet nuclear missiles were so effective that neither country could
    hope to protect itself against the other in time of war, and an increase
    in defensive capability by one power could easily be offset by an increase
    in the offensivecapability of the other.

   the history of the U.S. space program, occurred at 6:31 p.m. EST at KSCâ€™S

   press conference Jan. 28: â€œThe facts briefly are: at 6:31 p.m. (EST)
   the observers heard a report which originated from one of the crewmen
                                                    .
   that there was a fire aboard the spacecraft . .â€ At T-10 and holding
   in the countdown, observers saw a â€œflash fireâ€ break out inside the
   spacecraft, penetrate its shell, and surround its exterior with smoke.
   Rescue workers rushed to the pad area but could not open the hatch
   for five minutes. Phillips said astronautsâ€™ only hope of escape would
   have to open hatch manually with a crank tool. He refused to speculate
   on how long accident would delay the Apollo program or on source

   of the fire but admitted that â€œif there is an ignition source
    oxygen this, of course, has flash-fire potential.â€ His statement that space-
   craft was operating on internal power when fire broke out was cor-
   rected Feb. 3 by NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans:
   â€œThe fuel cells in the service module were not in use, and the so-called
   internal power was being supplied by batteries having the same char-
    acteristics as the fuel cells but located external to the spacecraft.â€
        NASA immediately appointed a board of inquiry (see Jan. 28) and
    announced that all data had been impounded pending its formal in-
   vestigation. Unmanned Apollo flights would proceed on schedule, but
    manned flights were postponed until boardâ€™s inquiry was completed.

      Wernher von Braun and more than a score of prominent US. scientists
      and engineers were making optimistic forecasts of future US. space
      achievements. Insufficient money and lack of nuclear rockets could
      present serious problems, yet most space experts foresaw the following
      major possibilities for the next few decades: (1)Early 1970s: extended
      lunar exploration by astronauts; earth orbital flights of three monthsâ€™
      duration to determine effects of prolonged weightlessness. (2) Mid-
      1970s: landing of unmanned spacecraft on Mars to search for signs of
      life; launching of first civilian space station; operation of satellite
      systems to aid civilian ship and aircraft navigation and to survey
      earthâ€˜s natural resources; development of improved comsats; use
      of meteorological satellites to produce accurate long-range global
      weather forecasts. (3) Late 1970s: first flight of six-man spacecraft,
      circling Mars and returning to earth in 600 days; orbiting of giant
      astronomical telescope above earthâ€˜s atmosphere; establishment of
       semipermanent base on moon. (4) Mid-1980s: landing of men on
      Mars for 10-20 days of exploration. (5) The 1990s: launching of
       unmanned probes to Jupiter, Saturn, and perhaps other planets; longer-

        certain older stars within the framework of the â€œbig bangâ€ theory of the
        universe. If -the exploding fireball from which the universe was formed
        had been packed with neutrinos, these particles would have interacted

     valleys, is so heavily eroded that wind alone cannot account for it. It
     is possible that ground is soaked with liquid water even though air of
     Mars is too thin and dry to produce rain; (2) new observations seem
     to confirm that air of Mars contains methane or methane-based gases,
     presence of which is difâ‚¬icult to explain unless they are generated by
     living organisms; and (3) evidence that carbon dioxide is predomi-
     nant component of Martian atmosphere implies that oxygen is being
     continuously injected into air. Most likely source of oxygen is plant life

     swing of the pendulum toward the possibility of life on Mars, a wide
     disparity of views on the nature of the Martian environment was pre-

     total of 20,756 hrs had been accumulated testing the use of 100%oxygen
     in NASA-sponsored spacecraft and spacesuit evaluation programs.
     Before Jan. 27 accident, three fires had occurred in pure-oxygen ground
     simulators: in all cases fires had been traced to electrical systems not
     used in spacecraft and crew members had recovered from burns. NASA
     witnesses recounted long history of precautions to avoid spacecraft fires,
     including insulation, circuit design and circuit protection for electrical
     wires, and fire-testing of over 400 materials. NASA Deputy Administrator
     Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., suggested that exact source of ignition might
     never be pinpointed: â€œIt is therefore possible that we may fly the Apollo
     without having been able to establish the cause of the fire. Even in that
     case, I believe that the care and skill with which the board and pro-
     gram office are conducting their investigations and review will provide

     was considerably greater than was recognized when the procedures for
     the conduct of the test were established. Our experience with pure
     oxygen atmosphere included not only the successful Mercury and Gemini

      they were not arranged as to provide barriers to the spread of a fire.
                       ...
      Tests conducted        since the accident have shown that an oxygen fire
      in the capsule will spread along the surface of Velcro and along the edges
       of nylon netting much faster than through the material itself. (3) Sol-

         Dr. Seamans said in his report that an â€œelectrical malfunctionâ€ was
      regarded as â€œmost likely source of ignitionâ€ of the fire but the â€œPOS-
      sibility exists that no single source will ever be pinpointed.â€ Board was
      still considering chemical reactions in onboard materials, spontaneous
      combustion of certain materials, and possible electrical phenomena. Evi-
      dence indicated fire had had three distinct phases: originating in left
      side of spacecraft, it had burned several seconds unnoticed, then spread
      becoming more intense and causing cabin pressure to rise rapidly as
      atmosphere became heated. Fifteen seconds after crew first reported fire,
      cabin ruptured. During second phase, gases and flames flowed past as-
      tronautsâ€™ couches and through hole moving from left to right. With
      cabinâ€™s oxygen quickly reduced by rush of flames and gas outside, fire
      continued as localized flame, smoking heavily, in third phase. D . Sea-
                                                                         r
      mans said Board noted: â€œThe experience in flight and in tests prior to
      the accident had suggested that the probability of a spacecraft fire was
      low. Continued alertness to the possibility of fire had become dulled by
      previous ground experience and six years of successful manned mis-
              .
      sions. . . Potential ignition sources inside the spacecraft had been
      treated so as to be considered safe; neither the crews nor the test and
      development personnel felt the risk of spacecraft fire to be high. . . .â€
      Dr. Seamans emphasized that Board did not recommend changing pure
      oxygen system or planned cabin pressure for space flight, but did urge
      that â€œtrade-offs between one- and two-gas atmospheres be re-evalu-
            ..   . [and] pressurized oxygen no longer be used in prelaunch
      ated

 ∞ NASAâ€™s  previous approach to preventing spacecraft fires by â€œpreventing their
     ignitionâ€ had been inadequate, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate
     Administrator for Manned Space Flight, testified at open hearing held
     by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences on Jan. 27
     Apollo tragedy. Also present were NASA Administrator James E. Webb,
      NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Dr. Charles
      A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and Operations. NASAâ€™s
      future approach would seek to: (1) minimize possibility of ignition,
      recognizmg â€œthat this possibility will always existâ€; ( 2 ) limit chance of
      fireâ€™s propagating once it has started; and (3) minimize consequences of
      fire to crew. Dr. Mueller outlined an extensive program of testing, re-
      design, and procedural changes, which included escape hatch for Apollo
      spacecraft that could be opened in two seconds; search for new, less
      flammable materials for cabin interior and spacesuits; and revised
      emergency procedures. All improvements and changes would be in-
      corporated into an advanced version-Black 11-of Apollo spacecraft.
      No more Block I spacecraft like Apollo 204 would be used for manned
      space flights. Dr. Mueller said no estimate of fireâ€™s eventual cost in time
      or money would be made until completion of Apollo 204 Review Boardâ€™s
      investigation, but he indicated that it would be at least 8 to 10 months
      before next manned Apollo flight. Dr. Mueller testified that launch
      rehearsal during which fire had occurred had not been classified as
      â€œhazardousâ€ because seven years of experience with Mercury and Gemini
      programs had never indicated such tests were particularly dangerous.
     Even if the test had been categorized as hazardous, he said, it would
      have still taken 90 sec for crew to open the double hatch and complete

    their egress. Crew died within 20 sec after detection of fire. Webb
    added that tbe handle for equalizing pressure, necessary precondition
    to opening hatch, had not been actuated. Dr. Berry said carbon mon-
    oxide had asphyxiated astronauts. He confirmed that bodies had had
    â€œsome thermal burns of second and third degreeâ€ but â€œnot of suilicient
    magnitude to cause death.â€ Dr. Berry warned that â€œwe are never going
    to be able to completely eliminate the risk of fire as long as oxygen is
    available.â€ Dr. Mueller said â€œan atmosphere which will support life will
    also support combustion. Therefore the first answer . . . must be fire pre-
    vention in terms of strict control of both potential ignition sources and
    cornbustible materials.â€ During the questioning session, Sen. Walter F.
    Mondale (D-Minn.) inquired about a 1965 report by Apollo Program
    Manager M/G Samuel Phillips (LEAF). Dr. Mueller said that he did
    cc
      not recall such a report,â€ and when asked to supply a copy, Webb said
    NASA would try and identify the specific report and would make it avail-
    able to the Comptroller General â€œunder any request that the Committee

       Webb announced that NASA had established Voyager program manage-
    ment responsibilities â€œdesigned to make the best possible utilization
    of the proved capabilitiesâ€ of JPL â€œand of our field centers and labora-
    tories.â€ Voyager program, since 1 9 a under NASA Hq. Division of Lunar
    and Planetary Programs, would become a separate division in OSSA with
    Oran W. Nicks as Director and Donald P. Hearth, Deputy Director.
    JPL would be responsible for surface laboratory, tracking, and mission
    operations systems; MSFC, for orbiting spacecraft and Saturn V launch
    vehicle systems; and LaRC, for landing capsule bus system.
        Discussing the NASA program, Webb said: â€˜â€˜I should be very clear
    on the subject of risks. In moving ahead to utilize the resources made
    available to us, we have had to take technical risks in the development
    of our equipment and in establishing our schedules. These have included
    risks that a particular design or line of development would not succeed
    in meeting the specifications; risks that schedules might not be met;
    and that we could not recover from a serious setback because we did not
    have parallel or back-up developments. But we have not knowingly
     accepted a higher level of risks in order to meet our manned flight
     schedules. In our specifications, trade-off studies, test criteria, or
    mission plans, we have taken no risks to the lives or safety of the astro-
     nauts that we could find a way to avoid.â€
        Webb urged that decisions on Voyager and AA programs and on
     Nerva I1 be made this year to avoid acceleration of the â€œdispersal of
     the know-how that we have built up in government, industry, and uni-
     versities that has already begun. ...â€
        Questioned by Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.) on whether US. or
     U.S.S.R. led in space technology, Webb replied that U.S.S.R. would be
     ahead in large spacecraft until â€œwe get the NERVA as a third stage for
     the Saturn V which will roughly double the capability of the Saturn V
     for Earth-escape missions.â€ While U.S.S.R. may lead in planetary
     exploration, he said, US. was superior in â€œthe very sophisticated use of
     microminiaturization and many new techniques of handling data.â€

     respiratory problems for astronauts, but additional research was neces-
     sary to ensure against respiratory problems that could arise from pro-
     longed weightlessness and an artificial environment, NRC Space Science
     Board study concluded. Only serious effects of weightlessness on respira-
     tory system anticipated were possibility that astronauts might inhale
     dust and other solid particles floating in the spacecraft and that muscles
     controlling the lungs might weaken because work was easier in weight-
     less environment. Areas recommended for further study included : tolera-
     tion limits for carbon dioxide in case spacecraftâ€™s absorption system mal-
     functioned; problems of infection during long missions; possibility of
     intentionally filling astronautsâ€™ lungs with a liquid to prevent collapse
     of blood vessels and tissues during acceleration greater than 15 g; and
     basic medical training and use of drugs for self-medication by crew
     during weightlessness. Committee also recommended efforts to improve
     methods to detect and extinguish spacecraft fires, and suggested that a

   the loss of life; it was not to be expected that s p a c s t h e most perilous

   the only thing to do is to carry on. The Apollo program necessarily will
   mark time until the true cause of the spacecraft disaster is located and
   corrected. It is conceivable that the delay could cause the Dec. 31,1969,
   deadline to be missed. It is entirely possible that the Russians may get

    Space travel is fraught with dangers in every test, every maneuver, every
   piece of equipment, but we became complacent about them because of
   our successes. NASAâ€™s    record of dealing with the press up to now has
   been pretty good and if it hasnâ€™t already developed a â€˜disaster planâ€™ for
    such accidents it soon will. News media have learned that nothing in the

       Some press reaction to the accident later became increasingly critical
    O f NASA:
       Washington Evening Star: â€œThe implication of the NASA story was
    that no fire extinguishing apparatus or quick escape mechanism-
    neither of which was present on the Apollo l - c o u l d have saved the
    men. The implication of the truth is that if the spacecraft had been
    equipped with a means of blowing open the hatch, Grissom, White and
    Chaffee might have had a chance. NASAâ€™s  motive in attempting to distort
    the truth may have been to protect the families of the astronauts from
    undue mental anguish. But it also served the function of protecting NASA

    the press, Congress and the public.â€ (W Star, 2/9/67)
       New York Times: â€˜The most basic issue . . . is not, as NASA has

    on NASA FY 1968 authorization bill before House Committee on Science
    and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Tech-
    nology. U.S. space program was entering a period when NASA would
  . utilize existing capabilities, Dr. A d a m said, and it was therefore par-
    ticularly important for OART to â€œemphasize new technology so that
    new systems will be available for the next major thrust in aeronautics
    and space.â€ He mentioned highlights of the program to develop new
    technology: (1) Nerva nuclear rocket engine; (2) experimental re-
    search related to hypersonic propulsion; (3) advanced cryogenic
    engine; (4) improved life-support systems; and ( 5 ) increased effort
    in electronics problems because â€œelectronics systems may well be the
    limiting factor in our future exploration.â€
        Dr. Eggers noted that R&D budget request in aeronautics for FY 1968
    nearly doubled that for 1967 and said the expansion reflected â€œrec-
     ognition of the rapidly growing importance of air transportation and
    the need for increased R&D to provide required advances in the asso-
    ciated technology. Aeronautics is already the order of a $24 billion a
     year industry and it is netting the nation better than $1 billion per
     annum in favorable balance of payments. Accordingly, our proposed
     major strengthening of aeronautics R&D will be to the great commer-

    the development of technology for high-resolution, 60- to 120-in space
    telescopes for optical astronomy, communications, and other potential
    applications was a major OART effort. â€œSuccess in this research will
    provide the capability to study celestial objects which cannot be viewed
    from the ground because of atmospheric attenuation and will provide
    vastly improved resolution over that attainable through the earthâ€˜s
     atmosphere.â€

     of large mirrors in space were almost insurmountable with conventional
     fabrication and alignment, unique approaches were being studied. One
    was 24-in-dia, three-segment mirror feasibility model in which distortion
    sensor, located in front of primary mirror, determined which segments
     were out of alignment and to what degree. Electronic circuitry then proc-
    essed and used the alignment data to realign mirror surface segments
    with actuators located behind each segment.

      standards set in 1964 by COSPAR and agreed to by both US. and
      U.S.S.R. â€œIn effect the [COSPAR] resolution requires that less than one
      viable microorganism be contained in each 10,000 spacecraft intended
       for planetary entry. Attainment of such a goal demands heroic measures,
       and current US. directives call for dry-beat sterilization of the completely
      assembled lander stage.â€ The authors asserted that COSPAR require-
      ments were based on the outdated assumption that terrestrial micro-
       organisms could thrive on other planets, particularly Mars; present
       knowledge, however, indicated that Mars is so dry, lacking in oxygen,

    of earth organisms would be unlikely. They suggested that COSPAR-
    recommended constraints â€œcould be substantially relaxed without com-
    promising to any significant degree the biological condition of Mars.â€
       Second article, by Dr. Bruce C. Murray, Gal Tech, Merton E. Davies,
    RAND Corp., and Dr. Philip K. Eckman, JPL, said US. policy should
    concentrate on seeing that â€œUS. contribution to plantary contamination
    will remain significantly less than the Soviet contributionsâ€ thereby
    reducing â€œsignificantly the cost and time required to carry out serious
    scientific investigations of the surfaces of Venus and Mars.â€ The authors
    suggested that U.S.S.R. had already hit both Mars and Venus with space-
    craft not sterilized in accordance with COSPAR standards. Any require-
    ment for US. to apply more stringent restrictions â€œis illogical in that
    . . . the US. would be asked to increase greatly the cost and complexity
    of its planetary program without achieving any significant reduction in
    the probability of actual contamination.â€ (Science, 3/24/67, 1501-10)

   ∞US. Government would receive in royalties more than the estimated $1.3
    billion it was contributing to SST development, ATA President Stuart G.
    Tipton told the Aero Club of Washington (D.C.) : â€œThe government
  
    investment is to be paid back with the 300th delivery. The manufacturer
    will thus pay royalties of 4.3 to 6.7 million dollars for each aircraft
     delivered. . . . Since these royalties are to continue for a 15-year period,
    they will go on well beyond the 300th delivery, and this phase of royalty
    payment will produce a return on the government investment comparable
    to levels normally received by industry.â€ (Text)

During March: Aerospace praised NASAâ€™s      contributions to U.S. aeronautical
    research : â€œSince the United States started sending experimental vehicles
    beyond Earthâ€™s atmosphere nine years ago aeronautical research has
    been overshadowed by space exploration as far as the annual budgets of
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are concerned. . . .
    But dollar comparisons fail to tell the whole story. For its space work,
    NASA has had to build from scratch a variety of expensive ground facili-
    ties and equipment and to make heavy outlays for complex, nonreusable
    flight hardware. NASAâ€™s   aeronautical teams spend little on flight equip-
    ment and what they do buy is reusable; furthermore, they operate from
    facilities for the most part built and paid for prior to the Space Age.

    practices had caused many parts and materials intended for spacecraft
    use to lose their identity, Baron told Hines in an interview. â€œAs a result
    there was probably a bundle of stuff [in Apollo] that they donâ€™t have

    occasion, NAA had installed a substandard part with deliberate subter-
    fuge, without the knowledge of NASA. Truth about the part could easily
    be concealed because NASA had no quality-control men of its own in re-
    ceiving warehouse, Baron said. He was particularly critical of deviation
    from test procedures: â€œWhen you deviate on your small components, and
    you deviate on all of them, and you put these in one system and you run
    a systems test and you deviate again, youâ€™ve ended up with a system
    that really isnâ€™t worthwhile.â€

April 9 : Most probable cause of Jan. 27 flash fire in which Astronauts Virgil
      I. Grissom, Edward H. White 11, and Roger B. ChafFee died was a spark-
      ing short circuit in worn, defective, or poorly insulated wire, Apollo
     204 Review Board concluded in its final report. Copies of report were
      distributed simultaneously to NASA Administrator James E. Webb,
     congressional committees, and the press. Board was unable to pinpoint
     exact ignition source, but identified conditions which led to the disaster :
      (1) a sealed cabin, pressurized with an oxygen atmosphere; (2) an
      extensive distribution of combustible materials in the cabin; (3) vul-
      nerable wiring carrying spacecraft power; (4) inadequate provisions for
      the crew to escape; and (5) inadequate provisions for rescue or medical
      assistance. Having identified these conditions, the Board addressed
      itself to the question of â€œhow these conditions came to exist. Careful
                                     ..  . leads . . . to the conclusion that in
      consideration of this question
      its devotion to the many difficult problems of space travel, the Apollo
      team failed to give adequate attention to certain mundane but equally
      vital questions of crew safety.

        â€œThe boardâ€™s investigation revealed many deficiencies in design and
    engineering, manufacture and quality control. When these deficiencies
    are corrected the over-all reliability of the Apollo program will be
    increased greatly.â€
        Board offered a total of 21 recommendations, including: (1) an â€œin-
    depthâ€ review of the entire Apollo life-support system; (2) an investi-
    gation of effective ways to control and extinguish spacecraft fires; (3)
    severe restriction and control of amount and location of combustible
    materials inside spacecraft; (4) reduction of time required for crew
    to egress and simplification of escape operations; (5) continuous mon-
    itoring of safety o all test operations to assure adequacy of emergency
                        f

    tests to establish fire safety of reconfigured command module. Board
    emphasized that its report was not intended as a criticism of NASAâ€™s

    a wire that could have later initiated the blaze. Under stern questioning
    by subcommittee members, however, Dr. McCarthy admitted that this

    ing to minimize fire hazard, Dr. McCarthy pointed out that NAA had
    concentrated on eliminating possible ignition sources while it turned

    law treaty-under consideration in Senate since Feb. 7-might be costly:
    â€œSince the risks of Soviet deception are so great, it seems unwise to have
                                                                    ...
    accepted the Russian-proposed no-inspection honor system.             Since
    there is no provision for a check on space activity, the Soviet Union could
    push ahead with a variety of secret military programs in space while
    publicly attacking the right of the U.S. to an American military defense
                        ..
    program in space. . Since the U.S. is an open society, any U.S. space
    defense program would be known. Since the Soviet society is closed,
    Moscow might well be able to keep its programs secret.
       â€œThe loose way in which this space treaty was written was due in part
    to the Administrationâ€™s eagerness to get a treaty in hand. But that loose-
    ness could lead the U.S. into a trap.â€ (Crornley, W News, 4/11/67, 12)
April 11-13: Witnesses testifying before Senate Commerce Committee ex-
     pressed conflicting views on proposed Corporation for Public Television.
       Ford Foundation consultant Fred W. Friendly said he would oppose
    any long-range design that relied on Treasury Dept. appropriations to
    produce news and public affairs programming because such funds would
    be subject to annual review by Congress. Instead, he suggested, news
     and public affairs should be underwritten from private funds-preferably
    out of savings from a non-profit comsat system that would employ income
     from commercial programs to help meet educational televisionâ€™s
    overhead.
        Dr. James R. Killian, Jr., chairman of Carnegie Commission on
    Educational Television, urged revision of the proposed legislation so
     that the Corporation would have continuing responsibility for program
    selection to ensure freedom â€œfrom the centralization and rigidity of a
     network systemâ€ and to protect autonomy of local stations.
        NET President John R. White argued that the Corporationâ€™srole should
     be limited to matters of â€œhigh policyâ€ and that operational activities,
     including the choice of programs to be carried on a network, should
    be subcontracted to other entities. The Corporation, he said, would not
     be able to make informed decisions until the programs had been sub-
     mitted for national distribution. (Gould, NYT, 4/12/67, 79; 4/13/67,

    64 hr 59 min flight and began transmitting the first of 5,487 detailed
    television pictures to JPL Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
        Landing sequence began when Surveyor 111 shifted its normal cruis-
    ing attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar (later
    ejected), main retromotor burned and slowed spacecraft to about 250
    mph. Vernier engines, which were to have slowed spacecraft to about
    3 mph, failed to cut off at 14 f t above lunar surface as planned, and the
    620-lb spacecraft made three separate landings-covering distance of
    33 ft-before engines shut off 37 sec after initial touchdown.

        First pictures transmitted were unclear because of sunâ€™s brightness,
     but later photos were excellent. They revealed that spacecraft was rest-
     ing in a depression or small crater with 5â€ slope-which was expected
     to hinder photography of lunar horizon-and showed impressions made
     by footpads during multiple landing. Shortly after touchdown a telem-
     etry malfunction falsely indicated major drain on power system, but
     photos confirmed that spacecraftâ€™s batteries were intact and undamaged.
        In addition to photographic equipment, including two additional
     mirrors to expand cameraâ€™s field of view, spacecraft also carried a
     shovel-like surface sampler which would scoop soil, move debris, and
     strike lunar rock with an expandable arm operated by radio signals
     from earth. On April 21-22 sampler began bearing strength tests and
     excavation of trenches up to six inches deep. On April 23-24, cooled
     by two-hour lunar eclipse, Surveyor 1 1took 118 excellent color photos

    sand and a bearing strength of about six pounds per square inch-firm
    enough to support Apollo spacecraft. Cal Tech professor and advisor
    to JPL on soil mechanics Dr. Ronald F. Scott explained: â€œThe surface

    and it behaves in perhaps a disappointingly ordinary way. The area
    presents no hazardous conditions and looks good for a landing site.

    conserve battery strength throughout two-week lunar night.
       Performance of Surveyor IZZ, with equipment identical to Surveyor
    Z and Surveyor ZZ except for soil sampler and two additional mirrors,
    was near flawless, and expected lifetime was indefinite. Surveyor Z was

     decision was made to change plans that would have kept the hatch open
     until the crew had been better trained on emergency procedures. Officials
     decided that hatch could be locked and emergency escape practice con-

April 23-24: U.S.S.R. successfully launched Soyuz Z spacecraft with Vladimir

     failed to reenter properly and crash-landed, killing Cosmonaut Komarov.
         Launched April 23 from Baikonur by a â€œpowerful new carrier rocket,â€
    Soyuz Z entered initial orbit â€œclose to the estimated one,â€ Tass an-
     nounced with unprecedented speed, only one hour 20 min after launch.
     Orbital parameters: apogee, 224 km (139 mi) ; perigee, 201 km (125
     m i ) ; period, 88.1 min; inclination, 51.4â€. Onboard equipment was
     cc
        functioning normallyâ€ and Komarov was â€œin good health and feeling
     well.â€ During the flight Tass distributed only a few terse reports in con-
     trast to extensive publicity usually accorded manned missions. Final
     announcement, which followed 11-hr silence, said accident occurred dur-

     spacecraft had been successfully braked with retrorockets for reentry.

     â€œ. . when the main parachute was opened at an altitude of seven kilome-

     resulted in Komarovâ€™s death.â€ Tass did not report whether the cosmo-
     naut had a personal parachute to attempt an escape. Western experts
     believed Soyuz I was tumbling or spinning out of control during re-
     entry: when parachutes were deployed, tumbling caused them to tangle
     among themselves or wrap around spacecraft resulting in crash-land-
     ing. Experts said daculties apparently developed earlier in the flight
     because Komarov tried to reenter during 15th orbit but was unable to
     control his spacecraft.

    lives recently, this distinguished space pioneer died in the cause of
    science and in the eternal spirit of human adventure.â€ -

    di5culties of understanding and putting to use the forces of nature at
    the outer edge of Manâ€™s knowledge of what is possible in this decade
    deeply regret the loss of life represented by the death of Cosmonaut
    Komarov, and extend our sincere sympathy to his family and associates.
    We feel certain that man will achieve great things in space. Some of these
    will determine what the men will be able to do on earth.
       â€œWe also feel that at this dawn of the space age, man has the duty
    to seek cooperation between nations, such as the USSR and the United
    States on a realistic basis.

 ∞ Water might have played an important role in shaping the lunar surface,
    Dr. Harold C. Urey, Univ. of California physicist, told National Academy
    of Sciences. As evidence to support his theory of the former existence
    of â€œlakesâ€ on the lunar surface, Dr. Urey showed spacecraft photos of
    the moonâ€™s surface in which material had filled in depressions as though
    it were free-flowing. He also cited carbon-rich meteorites which seemed
    to be fragments of ancient lake beds. Dr. Urey believed many, if not
    all, the stony meteorites were fragments dislodged from the moon by
    impacting objects such as iron meteorites. As further evidence of water
    action, he noted the presence of meteorites within which numerous
    founded fragments were embedded which appeared to have been shaped
    by frictional effects within flowing material. A body much smaller than
    the moon would not have had sufficient gravity for this flow effect, Dr.
    Urey argued. (Sullivan, NYT, 4/25/67,23)

      using any extraterrestrial profits for the benefit of all men.
        â€œIt will take much time before such an ideal can be reached. But even
     now the more sober spirit evident in Moscow and Washington opens the
      door to greater bilateral cooperation. Both nations have technical
     knowledge in this field that they could exchange to their mutual ad-

May 4: NASA% Lunar Orbiter IV (Lunar Orbiter D) unmanned spacecraft was
    successfully launched by Atlas-Agena D booster from ETR on mission
    to photograph lunar surface [see May %June 11.
       Agena 2nd stage fired to boost 850-lb spacecraft into 100-mi (161-
    km) -altitude parking orbit, reignited after 21-min coast period, injecting
    spacecraft on 89-hr translunar trajectory, and separated. On schedule
    L u w Orbiter IV deployed its four solar panels and two antennas,
    locked its five sensors on the sun, and fixed its star tracker on Canopus.
    At 16:G GMT midcourse maneuver with 53.8-sec engine burn was
    successfully conducted to slow spacecraftâ€™s speed and alter its aim point
    slightly.
       Primary objectives of NASAâ€™s    Lunar Orbiter IV mission, fourth in
    series of five, were (1) to place three-axis stabilized spacecraft into
    high-inclination lunar orbit; (2) to obtain broad systematic photo-
    graphic survey of lunar surface; (3) to improve knowledge of the moon;
    and (4) to provide basis for selecting sites for more detailed scientific
    study by subsequent orbital and landing missions. Full photographic
    flight plan would require mme than 200 camera-pointing maneuvers,
    compared to 50 for Lunar Orbiter 111. Photos would cover more than
    80% of the moonâ€™s front face and more than 90% of the hidden side.
    Spacecraft would also monitor micrometeoroids and radiation intensity
    in the lunar environment, refine definition of moonâ€™s gravitational field,
    and serve as a target for tracking operations by Manned Space Flight
    Network stations. Lunar Orbiter program was managed by LaRc under

    would enable US. to â€œeffectively accomplish the lunar mission in this
    decade.â€ He accepted NAAâ€™S share of responsibility for Jan. 27 Apollo
    fire but urged the Committee to view the deficiencies cited by Apollo 204
    Review Board [see April 93 in the perspective of the standards involved.
     .  ..it must be recognized that in space work the standards are and must

    survey of NAA workmanship summarized in the Phillips Report [see
    April 18 had been conducted during time when these problems were
              1
    reaching their peak. Thus the report did not truly reprepnt overall NAA
    performance â€œbut reflected the fact that the [Apollo] mission criteria
    had been evolving towards their final form.â€ Atwood stressed, however,
    that General Phillipsâ€™ recommendations had been accepted and cor-
    rected to NASAâ€™s â€œgeneral satisfactionâ€ by April 1966.
        To further improve Apollo program progress, Atwood said, he and
    NASA Administrator James E. Webb had reviewed â€œthe overall working
    relationshipâ€ between NAA and NASA. As a result of this review efforts
    would be made to (1) improve coordination of management effective-
    ness and program control; (2) establish clearer and more specific objec-
    tives and measurement techniques for program performance; (3) con-
    duct more periodic surveys and audits of program progress and per-
    formance; and (4) include sharper incentives and penalties in contract
    relationships. Only major changes in Apollo spacecraft would be incor-
    poration of a quick-opening hatch and installation of additional insula-
    tion for interior wiring and tubing. (Hines, W Star, 5/4/67,2; Wilford,

    U.S.S.R. had definitely not lost any men in orbit and probably had not
    lost any men in the space program before the April 24 death of Cos-

May 9: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, Deputy Administrator Dr.
    Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight Dr. George E. Mueller testified on Apollo project reprogramming
    before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. First
    â€œman-ratedâ€ Apollo Block I1 spacecraft would be delivered to KSC in
    late 1967 and -launched three months later with Walter M. Schirra,
    Walter Cunningham, and Donn F. Eisele as prime crew, Webb said.
    Back-up crew would be Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, and Eugene
    A. Cernan. Spacecraft would still have 100%-oxygen atmosphere, but
    use of noncombustible and fire-resistant materials would minimize fire
    hazard, he asserted. â€œWe are confident that the results of the first Block
    1 Apollo flights will justify moving rapidly to follow-on flights, thus
     1
    overcoming some of the effects of the present delay . . . [so that] we
    can carry out this plan within the funds now available for fiscal year
    1967 and in NASAâ€™s    budget for fiscal year 1968.â€ In order to â€œassure
    maximum progressâ€ and reduce pressures on North American Aviation,
    Inc. ( N U ) , prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, NASA was realigning
    its contracting arransements, Webb said. Contracting changes included :
    negotiation of a new strong-incentive contract with NAA for manufacture,
    test, and delivery of standard Block I1 spacecraft; extension of Boeing
    CO.)S  present contract responsibility to include integration of command

   other aerospace companies to provide contractor assistance in Apollo
   systemsmanagement and check-outand test procedures.
      Dr. Seamans described impact of Jan. 27 fire on Apollo schedule
   and budget. Lunar landing before 1970 â€œremains possible,â€ he said.
                 ...
   â€œThe impact          has been to reduce that probability, not eliminate
         .
   it. . . After the first manned Block I1 flight on the uprated Saturn I
   in 1968, we plan three to four manned Saturn V missions . . . [and] in

                            Y
   flammability testing, launch facility modifications, and spacecraft de-
   livery rescheduling-would be absorbed within the total budget plan
   currently before Congress.
              responses to recommendations by Apollo 2044 Review Board
      NASAâ€™s
   were outlined by D . Mueller: (1) bulk combustibles and other flam-
                        r
   mable materials had been replaced with flame-resistant materials, and
   necessary flammables stored in fireproof containers; (2) emergency
   procedures would be reviewed and exercised prior to each hazardous
   operation, and a quick-opening hatch installed for simplified egress
   from capsule; (3) new NASA Office of Flight Safety would be established
   under OMSF to review and evaluate safety provisions and monitor test
   operations; (4) all emergency equipment had been reviewed and addi-
   tions or substitutions-including installation of water fire extinguish-
   ers-made where necessary; ( 5 ) detailed design review of spacecraft
   communications system had been conducted and minor changes made
   to assure reliable operation; (6) full-scale mockup tests had been con-
   ducted to assess fire hazard and problems of gas detection and control;
   and (7) management and organizational changes had been instituted
   to clarify responsibilities and improve coordination between NASA
   centers and contractors.
      In response to questions by Sen. Margaret C. Smith (R-Me.) re-
   garding rating of companies in the 1%1 Apollo spacecraft contract
   competition, Webb said that Martin Co. had been rated first, on the
   basis of its technical proposal, by the source evaluation board. However
   he, Dr. Dryden, and Dr. Seamanwonsidering other factors such as
   lower cost estimate, outstanding company performance record, overall
   capability offered, and experience with X-15 experimental aircraft-
   chose NAA as prime candidate.
      Senator Smith expressed concern that the Committee was not kept
   informed of serious problems revealed in the Phillips Report and asked
   whether NASA followed any guidelines to determine when situations
   should be brought to the attention of the Committee. Webb replied that
   no such guidelines existed and indicated that he thought it unnecessary
   to detail the problems to the Committee since he thought that NASA
   could control them. Several other committee members also expressed
   their desire to be informed of any problems approaching the magnitude
   of those surrounding the Phillips Report. When Sen. Walter F. Mondale
   (D-Minn.) continued to criticize NASAâ€™s    reluctance to make the report
   public, Webb offered to discuss it, in complete context, in executive
   session, and repeated his objection to releasing such evaluations of

      clear favorable balance of air technology was heldby any one nation
      long enough to create world stability. It was, in fact, a predominant
      force in the affairs of men for less than 60 years. Space technology will
      be a dominant force far longer than was the case for those of ocean and
      air. Not limited as was the ship to the water or the airplane to the air, or

∞ Sen. Stephen M. Young (D-Ohio),speakiig on the Senate floor, urged US.
     and U.S.S.R. to cooperate in the exploration of outer space. â€œLet us
     proceed to inquire together seeking to effect a treaty with officials of
     the Soviet Union for the joint exploration of outer space for peaceful
     purposes, including efforts for a joint lunar landing, sharing the cost
     on a 50-50 basis. The tremendous expense would be shared equally by
     our two great nations. Also, if we were no longer engaged in a race with
     the Soviet Union for space achievements, the likelihood of tragedies
     resulting from too much haste-such as both nations have recently wit-
     nessed-would be greatly diminished.
        â€œThis would save the taxpayers of our country at least $1billion next
     year and billions of dollars in future years. Even more important, it
     would be a great advance toward permanentâ€˜peace in the world.â€ (CR,

     (ICSC) -17-member governing body of International Telecommunica-
    tions satellite consortium (INTELSAT) -accepted invitation of Japan
    to meet in Tokyo, May 18-23. Comsatcorp, representing U.S. in INTEL-
    SAT and acting as its manager, announced that international participa-
    tion had expanded from 13 countries in 1964 (when interim agreements
     were opened for signature) to 56 countries that now account for more
    than 95% of worldâ€™s commercial communications. Tokyo meeting would
    be first to be held in Asia, and was second time ICSC had convened away

    launched April 6, 1965, and Atlantic ZZ (INTELSAT 11 series) launched
     March 22, 1967, linking North America and Europe; and Lani Bird IZ
      (INTELSAT 11 series) launched Jan. 11, 1967, linking US. and Hawaii,
     Japan, and Australia. Fabrication had been started in 1966 on advanced
     satellites in INTEISAT m series that would have five times the communica-
     tions capability of Early Bird I. ComSatCorp reported that these latest
     satellites would be launched beginning in 1968 to expand communica-
     tions system to global capability. As to ground facilities, 14 earth sta-
     tions were now operating in countries with more than 40 planned for

     increase in US. tourist spending abroad as well as by a reduction in
     sales of subsonic U.S. aircraft. IDA study was one of four reports com-
     missioned by FAA for $633,000 but withheld pending President John-

        New York Times later commented: T h e very fact that there can be
     no certainty about the sales prospects for the SST or its impact on the bal-
     ance of payments argues for a deliberate and conservative approach in
     financing it. Statements based on hope and supersalesmanship are con-
    siderably less convincing than the hard facts of supersonic economics.

     sions were based on astronomical observations made May 13 from a
     specially fitted NASA-owned Convair 990 jet aircraft which flew at
     37,OOO-ft altitude over Canada. His theory conflicted with one set

     May 26, testihd that advanced missile systems based in space rather
     than on land were being studied. He recalled that DOD had studied,
     until 1964, the â€˜â€˜Bambiâ€ system designed to use satellites to locate and
     destroy enemy missiles shortly after they had been launched. Work
     had been stopped because it was â€œmuch too costly,)) but â€œwe think the
      time is getting ripe again to look at the whole question because the costs
      of putting things in orbit have gone down dramatically, the reliability
      of space engineering has gone up dramatically so that the overall cost

      (1)nuclear submarinesâ€™ ability to remain completely submerged indefi-
      nitely gave them unequaled defense invulnerability ; (2) submarine-

      than toward populated land as land-based missiles do; (3) sea-based
      system would be more effective against enemy missile containing several
      warheads, each capable of maneuvering along different trajectory ; and

    the capsule separation and bus deflection maneuvers were not made
    automatically, even after loss of radio contact.â€™, Porter said authorsâ€™
    conclusion about Mars was also based on insufficient evidence and noted
    that in discussions with â€œhighly placedâ€ Soviet scientists during spring

    likely to be much greater than 980 mi.

    Lovell noted that Zond ZZâ€™s signals were so strong that there should have
    been no difficulty in tracking the probe at Mars encounter; also, miss
    distance of 1,500 km (932 mi) was within the accuracy of Jodrell

August 14: President Johnson, in a message to Congress on communications
     policy, announced that he was appointing a 15-man task force headed by
      Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow to
      formulate â€œa national communications policy.â€ Among questions the
      group would examine were: (1) how soon would a domestic satellite
      system be economically feasible? (2) should a domestic system be
      general purpose or specialized? and (3) should there be more than
      one system? Task forceâ€™s report was due in one year. The President also :
       (1) reaffirmed U S . commitments made in 1962 and 1964 in support of
      the development of a global system of comsats â€œto make modern commu-
      nications available to all nationsâ€; (2) pledged US. support to the con-
      tinuation of the INTELSAT consortium, saying, â€œwe seek no domination
      of satellite communications to the exclusion of any other nation-or
      group of nationsâ€; (3) stated that US. â€œshould take no action in the
      establishment of a domestic [comsat] system which is incompatible with
      our support for a global systemâ€; and (4) urged U.S.S.R. and the na-
      tions of Eastern Europe to join INTELSAT. â€œHere is a rare opportunity to
      join in an activity to bring benefits to all nations and loss to none.â€ He
      suggested there might be an eventual linkage between Soviet Molniya
      system and INTELSAT system.
         The President concluded: â€œHistorians may write that the human race
      survived or faltered because of how well it mastered the technology of
      this age.
         â€œCommunications satellites now permit manâ€™s greatest gifts-sight,
      expression, human thoughts and i d e a e t o travel unfettered to any por-
      tion of our globe. The opportunity is within our grasp. We must be pre-

August 19: Negotiations were being conducted in Washington, D.C., to move
    Canadaâ€™s High Altitude Research Project (HARP) from McGill Univ.
    to Univ. of Vermont, Jay Walz reported in the New Yo& Times. Move
    was a result of Canadaâ€™s decision to cut off funding because it believed

   additional possible craters. Original estimate from unprocessed pictures
    was less than 100. Mars appeared to be about as densely pitted as the
   moon but its craters were smoother because of more effective erosion
   processes. Several photos showed a number of linear features similar
   to lines formed by rifts and faults on the moon. These features were not

   as seen by the human eye and discovered some of these emissions were
   fluctuating on time scales measured in hours or even less. Panel raised
   the possibility that emissions might be from stars in the process of
   formation. They were being transmitted at four closely spaced wave-
   lengths associated with hydroxyl, a molecule formed of a single oxygen
   and hydrogen atom, and were being given off when such molecules shed
   energy. Emissions also appeared to have various properties associated
   with a maser-man-made device in which a radio or light wave is beamed
   through certain atoms whose energy has been raised, enormously ampli-
   fying original wave and, if wave is confined to a single axis, producing
   a beam of extreme intensity. (Sullivan, NYT, 8/26/67,1,10; 8/28/67,

August 29: Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R-Me.) expressed concern on Senate
    floor that the Nationâ€™s space program suffered from a â€œserious lack of
    centralized leadership within the administration. Leadership is needed
    to weigh and decide on the merits of proposed space projects; to coordi-
    nate program requirements and development efforts of civil and defense
    agencies; and to establish long-range national space goals and to seek
    the resources necessary to achieve them.
        â€œI believe that this failure to assert administrative responsibility has
    resulted in the costly and needless development of two families of launch
    vehicles-one for NASA and one for the Department of Defense. Cur-
    rently, NASA and the Department of Defense are each separately under-

    must be made because of our commitments in Vietnam and social strife

    for the executive branch? Is so little consideration and concern given to
    determining the required resource level for space technology programs
    that across-the-board reduction recommended by a legislative committee
    can be accepted so lightly?

    also held this to be true. However, the present lack of responsible action

    a managerial doctrine as extraordinary as the space mission itself.
    Essentially it is a bold extension of the systems-management principle
    first applied in the Pentagon for weapon development. This approach
    means that the Pentagon tries to relate design and procurement plans
    to the weapon systemâ€™s maximum potential, to other weapon systems,
    to cost effectiveness, to foreseeable strategic situations, and to other
    spacial considerations. In NASAâ€™s the â€˜systemâ€™ is usually an exotic

    research objective, like landing a package of instruments on Mars.
     Such an undertaking, of course, requires management consideration
    of costs and engineering feasibility, but NASA also tries to relate it to
    the social, economic, and even political impact the new knowledge may
    have on some of the most basic mysteries of human life. In one sense,
    the system becomes an exercise in applied philosophy. To master such

    photographs tended to confirm prevailing theory held by scientists that
    the big crater had been formed by a great meteoroid crashing into the
    visible side of the moon. Some scientists believed much of the fluid mate-
    rial ejected when the three-mile-deep crater was formed might have
    resulted from the intense heat generated by the meteoroidâ€˜s impact. They
    also suggested that the appearance of the dark halo resulted from the
    manner in which pulverized ejected material had been deposited. Material
    might have traveled outward from the impact point in a â€œbase surgeâ€
    close to the moonâ€™s surface, giving a windswept appearance to the
    terrain. NASA photo afforded scientists first close-up view of the crater
    floor, providing new clues to its origin. Orbiter Vâ€™s high resolution tele-
    photo picture showed fractures, flow markings, and protruding dome-
     like hills with exposed layers. The Tycho region was one of the 36
    areas of high scientific interest on the moon photographed by Lunar

    orbital scientific bases . . . will certainly demand joint efforts of all

     instant that the test specimen is experiencing the 10,000 g shock, every
     part of it behaves as though it weighed 10,000 times its normal weight.
    The bolts supporting a one pound test item have to be good for about

     launched from ETR by a two-stage Thrust-Augmented Improved Delta
     launch vehicle into orbit with 202-mi (326-km) apogee, 187-mi (302-
     km) perigee, 90.8-min period, and 33.5â€ inclination. The 940-lb research
     spacecraft consisted of three main sections : an adapter section which
     would remain in orbit; the reentry vehicle carrying the retrorocket and
     heat shield for reentry into the earthâ€™s atmosphere; and, within the re-
     entry vehicle, the experiment capsule containing the scientific experi-
     ments, life support equipment, parachutes, and radio beacon to aid in
     recovery. Biosatellite II carried 13 experiments to determine effects of
     the space environment on various life processes.
        Performance of the spacecraft was satisfactory except for some diffi-
     culty with completely reliable response to command transmission from
     the ground stations and out-of-spec accelerations during the first few
     orbits. The spacecraftâ€™s temperature, attitude control, and atmospheric

     landed in the ocean near Australia following reentry Feb. 15, but was not
     recovered.
        The most important single question for Biosatellite II wils whether
     the changes produced in organisms by radiation are slowed or hastened
     under weightless conditions. Biosatellite scientists had noted that early
     recovery had resulted in less risk to the experiments than if recovery
     had been delayed beyond the planned three days. Despite the delayed
     launch and early recovery, scientists reported only a small decrease in the
     expected data return from the experiments. Indications were that all
     programmed events in orbit, such as fixation of frog eggs, fixation and

    at 700 miles. NASA envisioned a network of evenly spaced synchronous
    satellites 22,300 miles above the earth. A ground craft could be in touch
    with as many as six of them simultaneously for extremely accurate
    positioning. Mr. Ehrlich said advanced satellites â€œwill contain a position
    determination capability, communications service, weather relay service
    and scientific sensors.â€ He said the Maritime Administration and ad-
    vanced thinkers in the shipping field had been looking to the day of the
    automated ship. â€œThe satellite-derived position information would be
    fed directly into the shipâ€™s computer to keep the ship on a preset path.â€

September 20: In informal remarks at Kennedy Space Center, NASA Admin-
     istrator James E. Webb predicted that congressional cuts in the space
     budget would slow up the launch rate and lead to the phasing out of
    Apollo equipment after man landed on the moon. Webb said that only
     nine of the 15 Saturn V launch vehicles could be launched before 1970,
     instead of 13 planned launchings. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any doubt that
     to absorb this cut for $500 million, after already having absorbed a $600
     million cut back in 1964, means that we will have to slow up the launch
     rate,â€ he stated. The cut had also knocked out any new planetary mis-
     sions before 1975. Space budget cuts would likely mean the elimination
     of the Saturn IB from the middle-term space program, Webb explained
     in a brief press conference. NASA was committed to the purchase of 16
     Saturn IB launch vehicles. Three had been flown; the next one would
     propel the first manned Apollo into earth orbit in mid-1968. NASA
     planned to switch manned flights to the three-stage Saturn V as soon a5
     possible. The first Saturn V flight, an unmanned test, was scheduled f m
     Oct. 19. The Saturn IB had been planned for continued use on flights
     not requiring the huge power of the Saturn V, but Webb said that em-
     phasis inatead would switch to the Air Forceâ€™s Titan IIIM launch vehicle,
     beiig developed for the military Manned Orbiting Laboratory. Webb
     listed several future checkpoints: (1)fewer orders for new Apollo space-
     craft equipment after the moon landing, in such programs as Apollo
     Applications; (2) definition of the next system after ApoUo, which
     could be a 100,000-lb space station, or something bigger, launched

     designated Pacific II-and second of them in the Pacific. Launch was
    from ETR by Thrust-Augmented Delta (DSV-3E) launch vehicle. Satel-
     lite went into transfer orbit over Pacific at approximately 176O east with
    29,056-mi (37,105-km) apogee, 186-mi (299-km) perigee, 658.8-min
     period, and 26.4â€ inclination. Satellite would supplement services of and
     replace current Pacific satellite, Zntelsat II-B (174OE), in event of its
    failure. NASA support nominally would terminate after about three days,
     subsequent to providing backup transfer orbit data and calculations.
     Final orbit and spin axis orientation would be made by ComSatCorp with
     onboard hydrogen peroxide system. Approximately 15 days after
     launch, satellite would be available for commercial use. Satellites could
     handle TV data transmissions, or up to 240 voice channels (480 circuits)
     between â€œfirst classâ€ ground stations such as Andover. Part of satellite

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1967

   At the proposed level of funding, after launch vehicle #216, production
   of the Saturn IB and the earth-orbital portion of the Apollo Applications
   Program would be terminated. Rather than continue to use the Apollo
   system for work in orbit at conclusion of Apollo flights, NASA would
   accept a hiatus in the continuous development of manned space flight,
   deciding on a fresh start for the years ahead. A new study would be
   begun in FY 1968 and FY 1969 on purposes and form of future develop-
   ment of spacecraft and â€œthe national family of large launch vehicles
   that should be available in the 1970â€™s.â€ This â€œbasic change in the
   United States space outlookâ€ would make it â€œclearly prudent to pre-
   serve the physical facilities which have been built and paid for and
   which would be required if a decision is made to construct a large
   solid rocket vehicle.â€ Because the budget level approved by the House
   would prevent beginning work an NERVA 11, development of a flight
   weight engine of the NERVA I class, â€œwith probably from 60,000 to
   75,000 lbs of thrustâ€ would be initiated in FY 1968. Because we would
   have â€œno choiceâ€ but to accept the fact that Voyager cannot be initiated
   in FY 1968, and, in order to preserve â€œa capability for future planetary
   programs,â€™, NASA would propose about $10 million for the â€œlunar and
   planetary program for studies and supporting research in the technology
   of planetary exploration.â€ NASA would propose no changes in the budget
   for the Apollo program but would â€œaccept the legislative history as a
   clear signal that we should proceed with a hard-hitting carefully man-
   aged effort to achieve the objectives of the Apollo program.â€ NASA would
   be able to launch â€œa total of nine Saturn V unmanned and manned
   missions before the end of Calendar Year 1969.â€ A further reduction
   in funding in FY 1968 could only cause â€œcomplete havocâ€ and would
   be a blow to the national aeronautical and space effort from which
   it would be extremely difficult to recover.
      Webb told the subcommittee: â€œIn this situation, we cannot ask,
   as we otherwise would have done, that the Senate restore in full the
   amount reduced by the House. . . . We are here to ask the commit-
   tee that the Senate approve the amounts passed by the House and accepted
   by the President, and to make a clear record in the legislative history
   that will give us the flexibility we will need to permit us to carry
   out the strongest possible program within the amounts made avail-
                   .
   able to us. . . Long leadtimes requiring timely initiation of new pro-
   grams and implying commitment to proceed over a period of years
          ...
   would          make it perfectly clear to all that we cannot somehow
   find a way to carry forward the same program and give the Nation
   the same assurance of a strong position in aeronautics and space with a
   $517 million cut in our budget.â€
      He said he had been in touch with the President in the last 24 hours and
    (6
     he still believes the recommendations he made in January representâ€
   the best budget for the country. But the President also believed his pro-
   posed 10 percent income tax surcharge â€œis more important to press for
   than extra money for the space bill.â€ Webb said he had drastically re-
   shaped the space program to comply with the $4.5 billion fund for this
   year voted by the House and approved by the President. But Subcom-
   mittee Chairman Warren G. Magnuson (D-Wash.) and several senators,
   with major space installations in their states, gave strong indications
   they would plan to restore some of the millions of dollars cut by the

     wrote in the Washington Post under dateline, â€œOct. 4,2007â€: â€œIt is now
     a half century since the first man-made satellite went into orbit around
     the earth, and an opportune time to examine how space technology and
     exploration have contributed to the economic development of the United
     States and to human welfare generally. The effects have been s u b t l e
     none of the early spectacular predictions have come to pass: the planets
    have been explored but not colonized; rockets have become more power-
     ful but rocket transportation has not replaced aircraft and ramjet ve-
     hicles.â€ He cited three major technological changes as a result of space
     program: increased reliance on electronic computer and data processor;
    a managerial revolution which created highly trained technologist-man-
    agers; and increased understanding of natural environment. (Singer,

∞ For the Saturn V program NASA purchased nine S-IVB stages from
    McDonnell Douglas Corp. for $146.5 million, fulfilling requirements
    for currently approved 15 Saturn V and 12 Uprated Saturn I launch
    vehicles. Delivery would begin in April 1968 and end in May 1970.
     Purchase brought total S-IVB contract for both vehicles to $957,-
     182,093.
        McDonnell Douglas also received a $24-million, cost-plus-fixed-fee
    contract extension for S-IVB launch services at KSC, which increased

    governing the activities of states in outer space, on the moon and other
    celestial bodies, forged in the conference room of the United Nations,
    has reaffirmed the principle first stated in the General Assembly that

    tian Science Monitorâ€™s Neal Sanford. Comparing American and Soviet
    space budgets, he expressed belief that U.S.S.R. was spending more
    than twice the US. percentage of gross national product on space.
    â€œTheir [GNP] is less than half of ours. While they are spending about
    the same amount of money that we are on space it is about twice the
     percentage of GNP. They are putting a greater priority on space than we
                                                                            .

    [their] history, so far as launches go,,â€™ he said. â€œI donâ€™t know if they
    are cutting [their budget] back. They are going along at a good rate
     .. . [and] from the progress they are making, we assume they are
    going along at about the same funding.â€ (Sanford, CSM, 10/4/67, 5)
 ∞ News on failures of Soviet manned space flights was â€œat least in part,
    â€˜managedâ€™ by Washington,â€ Julius Epstein, research associate at Hoover
    Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, wrote in Los Angeles Times:
    â€œAccording to reliable information, the CIA submitted a confidential
    document to the White House early this year reporting the deaths of at
    least 1 cosmonauts in addition to that of Komarov. The Washington
            1
    decision not to disclose information on . . . failures was made during
    the last days of the Eisenhower Administration, presumably to protect
    intelligence sources.â€ This decision, he said, was recorded in DOD-NASA
    agreement, Jan. 13,1961. Mr. Epstein asked that the US. give an honest
    accounting of what it knew about Soviet space losses, so that U.S. losses
    could be assessed with proper perspective. (Epstein, LA Times, 10/4/67)
∞ FCCâ€™S concern for future communications facilities in Atlantic basin area
    was expressed in letters to ComSatCorp, A T ~ T ,and international telegraph

∞  Displeasure with NASAâ€™s  administrative officials was voiced by Rep. William
    F. Ryan (D-N.Y.) , member, House Committee on Science and Astro-
    nautics, on floor of the House. â€œNASA continues to evade the serious
    responsibility of candor,â€ said Rep. Ryan while inserting a series of
    documents in Congressional Record, including Feb. 15 letter from MSFC
    Director Wernher von Braun to S. K. Hoffman, NAA Rocketdyne Div.
                   â€œ. .                            .

    president, on
    error, inadequate manufacturing, quality control, or test procedures.â€
       NASA Hq. news conference, called at 5:OO pm same day by NASA Ad-
    ministrator James E. Webb, accompanied by key NASA and industry offi-
    cials, responded to Rep. Ryanâ€™s charges and explained that letter to
    Hoffman had been a case of normal Government-contractor business.
    Webb pointed out that subcommittees of the House Committee on Sci-
    ence and Astronautics were kept informed each month so that emergency
    matters could be brought to their attention.
       Dr. von Braun explained how inspection and quality control pro-
    cedures were continued as rocket engines were processed at contractorâ€™s
    plant and at Government test sites. He stated that NASA-Rocketdyneco-
    ordination on inspection continuity and quality control were applied to
    both the rocket engine as an entity and the rocket engine/launch-vehicle-
    stage complex.
       As trend of news conference discussion turned from quality control to
    Saturn/Apollo weight problems, M/G Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Pro-
    gram Director, said the heavier Lunar Module resulted from fire-hazard-
    type design changes. He stated that LM was now 31,500 lb against a
    32,000-lb control weight. Referring to weight-lifting capability of Saturn
    V, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E.
    Mueller, said lunar payload had increased from 90,000 to 100,OOO lb
    by increasing engine efficiency. Similar improvement was expected in
    LMâ€™S propulsion, which would ease the weight problem. (CR, 10/5/67,

October 5-6: JPL engineers conducted series of exercises with NASAâ€™s  Mariner
    ZY spacecraft (launched Nov. 28, 1964) to demonstrate techniques for
    controlling Mariner Y (launched June 14, 1967) if its startracker were
    to fail during Venus flyby Oct. 19. Mariner IVYafter traveling more than
    1.3-billion mi in solar orbit, successfully responded to commands by
    breaking lock on its unidentified guide star and locking instead on
    Canopus ; breaking lock on Canopus; maintaining stability by turning
    on inertial control gyros for first time since December 1964; and point-
    ing high-gain antenna toward earth and using it-with a 20-db signal
    strength increase at DSN ground stations-for first time since October
    1965. Practice of procedures gave JPL engineers confidence in ability to
    stabilize Mariner V by gyros and to keep it oriented by ground com-
    mand. Spacecraft would remain on inertial control with high-gain
    antenna oriented toward earth until completion of planned second mid-
    course maneuver motor firing and other engineering tests. (NASA Proj

October 6: NASA announced that Ogo ZV Orbiting Geophysical Observatory,
    launched from WTR July 28, had passed its primary test objective of col-
    lecting scientific data while remaining stable in all three axes for more
    than 50 days and was continuing to radio data from 18 of its 20 ex-
    periments. Unexpected oscillation in 60-ft-long experiment boom, ap-
    parently caused by heat from the sun, had been controlled by manually
    operating satelliteâ€™s control system and thus expending less control-
    jet fuel than with automatic control. (NASA Release 67-252)

 ∞ Vexing problem of the direction and period of Venusâ€™ rotation had acquired
    a new dimension in recent ultraviolet photographs, according to an
    article in Science by Bradford A. Smith of the New Mexico State Univ.
    Observatory. Smith recounted the history of 60 yrs of visual and spec-
    troscopic observation of Venus that produced inconclusive evidence.
    Radar observation begun in 1961 by 1967 had produced what was con-
    sidered firm evidence that the solid globe of Venus in 244 days rotated
     once in a direction retrograde to that of its planetary neighbors earth
    and Mars. Recent ultraviolet photos taken at the New Mexico State
    Univ. Observatory with a new 61-cm reflector indicated that ultraviolet
    clouds of the Venusian atmosphere rotated retrograde in five days. This
    large discrepancy between movement of the globe and atmosphere of
    Venus could be explained only by the existence in the Venusian atmos-
    phere of a persistent and widespread planetary wind system blowing at
    more than 180 mph, Smith said. Although earthâ€˜s jet stream reached
     such speeds, it was narrow and zonal, in contrast to the massive system
     that would have to exist on Venus if these observations were correct.

October 7 : New York Times commented on congressional cuts in NASAâ€™s
     1968 budget: â€œThe Senate, ignoring the most obvious of all opportunities
     to cut nonessential spending, has not only matched the $4.5 billion the
     House voted for space excursion but tacked on nearly $100 million more
     to start new programs after the first Americans land on the moon. The
     certainty that another huge space appropriation. will come out of con-
     ference on Capitol Hill adds special interest to the fact that twice
     recently the leading space scientist of the Soviet Union, Prof. Leonid
     Sedov, has publicly stressed the importance of large-scale international

∞In its fourth year of full operation ESRO was entering a more expensive
    and ambitious phase and consequently was encountering financial, polit-
    ical, and organizational difficulties, John Walsh reported in Science.
    ESRO was currently appraising its eight-year program and seeking ways
    to coordinate its activities with ELDO, European Conference on Communi-
    cations Satellites ( GETS), and new European Space Conference. Accord-
    ing to 1962 convention which became effective in 1964, ESRO was to have
    launched 300 sounding rockets and 10-12 satellites within eight years
    under $300-million budget. Although ESRO council was empowered to
    adjust budget authorization in response to major scientific and tech-
    nical developments, it lacked unanimity necessary for change. As a
    result, Walsh noted, scheduled number of satellites-including $170-
    million Large Astronomical Satellite (LAS) -would probably not be
    launched. Expenditures for buildings and equipment for ESROâ€™S new
    four-station satellite tracking, telemetry, and telecommand network, and
    its five main research installations had been particularly heavy. European
    Space Technology Center ( ESTEC) ,for example, responsible for applied
    research and payload development, had a 456-man staff-nearly half
     of total ESRO staff-which was expected to reach 1,000 by the end of
    1967. In addition to financial problems caused by expansion, Walsh
    said, ESRO had to overcome a sensitivity to what national aerospace
    industries would get back in relation to national contributions, differ-
    ences over selection of projects, and lack of unity and coordinated
    effort. Differences of opinion between larger countries such as U.K.,
     Germany, and France, which contributed 23.13%, %.31%, and 20.17%,
    respectively, to ESRO budget, and smaller countries such as Denmark,
    which contributed 2.15%, had to be resolved before a real sense of pur-
    pose could be acquired, Walsh said. â€œESRO until now has been primarily
    an agency providing technical services and support for university scien-
    tists who prepare actual experiments. As experiments grow more com-
    plex, more work .will be done in ESRO labs and by industry,â€ and new
    dimensions would be added to its tasks. (Walsh, Science, 10/13/67,

∞ Christian Science Monitor, commenting on space law treaty which went
     into effect Oct. 10, noted that space exploration had evolved this
     treaty which banned military installations and nuclear weapons from
    moon and planets and which could evolve into space cooperation be-
    tween U.S. and U.S.S.R. Treaty did not halt use of reconnaissance
     satellites but it provided for international inspection of vehicles and
     installations on moon and other bodies. Although there would be no
     right of inspection to see whether satellities were carrying nuclear
    weapons, and vigilance would always be vital in this regard, treaty was
     one more visible proof that Moscow and Washington could make useful
     progress. Space law treaty was agreement, following Antarctic Treaty,
     which could remove installations of war from one more section of man-
     kindâ€™s expanding environment. (CSM, 10/14/67)

October 15: JPL announced development of double vacuum chamber, designed
     by JPLâ€™S James B. Stephens, to simulate extreme effects of interplanetary
     space on spacecraft. Called Molsink (molecular sink of outer space),
     chamber was expected to determine what happened to paint, compo-
     nents, and even microorganisms on spacecraft. The eight-foot-dia cham-
     ber would be capable of capturing 99.97% of all condensable mole-
     cules emanating from test item by freezing the molecules to the walls
     at -400â€™F with super-cold helium gas. Conventional vacuum chambers
     had not been able to pump, or capture, more than half of gas molecules
     flying off test item. Space scientists believed Molsink chamber would
     provide reliable tool to measure and counteract problem of spacecraft
     out-gassing. In testing, long periods would simulate actual flight time
     of spacecraft to planets-four months to Venus, seven months to Mars,
     for example. The chamber was expected to be fully operational early

    in Cosmos series during period from Sept. 17, 1966, through Aug. 8       ,
    1967,when seven were launched, were suggested by Phillip J. Klass in
    Aviation Week: launches evaluated (1)missile defense radars and ICBM
    penetration aids, (2)very-long-range ICBM attacking from south, or (3)
    orbital weapon. Other reasons had been noted-including test of re-
    covery systems for Soyuz manned spacecraft. In all cases, a principal
     object reentered after one orbit and other objects after a day or two.
    Soviets had never mentioned orbital period nor had they explained low
    perigee of 90 mi-an indication spacecraft would remain in space for
    only one orbit or less.

 The five-out-of-five successful missions of $200-million Lunar Orbiter
   project to photograph moon to aid in selecting Surveyor and Apollo
   landing sites and to contribute to scientific knowledge of moon were
   reviewed at NASA Hq. press conference. Photographic data provided
   by Lunar Orbiter I, 11, and 111 and Surveyor Z resulted in selection
   of eight candidate sites. Lunar Orbiter IV provided basis for extending
   cartographic grid system for front-face mapping around to moonâ€™s
   hidden side by photographing eastern limb areas. Lunar Orbiter V
   photographed scientifically interesting areas on moonâ€™s front side, com-
   pleted farside coverage, and provided supplementary photography of
   potential Apollo landing sites.
        Apollo Program Director, M/G Samuel C. Phillips, said that, when
   G<
      approaching on a pretty flat trajectory at about 30 miles from the
                 ..   . details of the topography and the radar return which
   landing site
   is coupled into the automatic control and landing system [must be
   known] .â€ In planning details of approach and landing maneuvers,
   Phillips said that â€œa very great dealâ€ had been learned from Orbiter
   â€œabout the rather unusual light conditions and:the effect of light
   reflections from the lunar surface under various angles.â€
        Harold Masursky, USGS, explained Lunar Orbiter photographs showed
   that â€œapparently the earth and the Moon are very similar in their
   distribution of high and low ground.â€ He hoped that â€œby examination
                         ...
   and comparison of              geologic plot with the selenodetic information
   .   . . [from] the Orbiter series, we will be able to plot the geopotential

   field . and tie it in with geology. . . By studying the Moon we
   know that it has a long, complex geologic history, that many of the
   same kinds of things that happen on the earth happen on the Moon.
   We can now play these two against each other, compare their simulari-
   ties, contfast their differences, and perhapsâ€™be able to arrive at a greater
   understanding of the fundamental processes that affect the earth.â€
        Strange moon features looking like watercourses might be dry-gulch
   arroyos, Harold Spradley said. Because watercourses had originated
   in volcanic craters and carried â€œfluidal materials,â€ volcanoâ€™s output-
   possibly slurry of ash and water-would exist long enough to cut its
   way through dry lunar surface material. Scientists agreed that orthodox
   existence of water on â€œthe airless moonâ€ was improbable.
       Clifford Nelson, LaRC Lunar Orbiter Project Manager, described
                                ..
   results of experiments: â€œ.         density distribution [very nearly homo-
   geneous] in the moon now seems to be resolved . . . center of mass
   of the moon is displaced toward the earth from the center of its geomet-
   rical figure, a situation which would have interesting scientific implica-
   tions as to the stability of the moon and its origin and history.â€ Meteoroid

       NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Homer E. Newel1 stressed overall
   significance of Lunar Orbiter program: â€œBefore the first Lunar Orbiter
   mission this country had never placed spacecraft into orbit about any
   other celestial body other than the earth. In all five . . . missions, the
   spacecraft were not only placed into initial orbits as desired, but then
                                                           ...    set up before-

 ∞ NASAâ€™s Mariner                 v   would fly within 2,5130 mi of planet Venus at 1.34 pm
 
    EDT, Oct. 19, at communications (direct) distance of about 49 million
    mi from earth, NASA announced. Launched from ETR June 14, space-
    craft would have traveled about 217 million mi in its arching trajectory.
    Scientists and engineers hoped their instruments would record precise
     data on planetâ€™s atmosphere, ionosphere, temperatures, and perhaps even
    surface qualities. As Mariner V approached Venus, its scientific in-
    struments would begin measuring planetâ€™s magnetic field, charged
    particles, gases present in upper atmosphere, and radiation levels. Space-
    craftâ€™s flight path would curve behind Venus and would vanish from
    view of tracking stations on earth. Just before spacecraft went behind
    planet (as seen from earth) its radio signals would pass through at-
    mosphere of Venus. Effect of Venusian atmosphere on Mariner Vâ€™S
    radio signals would be measured, thereby providing measure of density
    of planetâ€™s atmosphere. Current scientific theory on density ranged
    from five times earthâ€™s atmosphere to several hundred times. Density
    measurement by occultation was one of prime objectives of spacecraftâ€™s
    flight.
       Since launch of spacecraft, engineering and science subsystems had
    performed as planned. Master timer hadcommanded Canopus cone angle
    update as scheduled on Aug. 24, Sept. 10, Sept. 26, and Oct. 10; timer
    had also commanded spacecraft transmitter to switch to high-gain

    proximately $6 million went to universities, and the third year about
    $14 million . . . [primarily for] solution of immediate problems. . . .â€
    Appraisal of program in 1961 concluded the universities were already
    making significant contribution to the space program, but that with
    the right kind of help they could do more for themselves and for NASA.
    Expansion included support of research, construction of facilities, and
    establishment of graduate fellowships, until program reached peak in
    1966 with 10,600 campus participants. Today, however, need was â€œto
    reduce expenditures for research, to preserve at minimum cost the
    essential strength needed for the future, and to increase the multi-
    disciplinary flux that will magnify the values the nation can derive
    from the activities we can support.â€ To find the best ways of reducing
    the program, he said, NASA had formed a â€œspecial task force to evaluate
    all our relationships with the academic community and to come up
    with specific recommendations as to least harmful methods we can use.
    There is no longer any doubt that NASAâ€™s     university support programs
    will have to be redefined quite drastically in some areas.â€ Since much
    of the program was funded in three one-year steps, this would help

    spread the impact over a longer time period. Ph. D. candidates now
    holding NASA grants would be able to obtain their degrees. Looking to
    the future, Webb urged the universities to think, reorganize, and work
    in interdisciplinary groupings. â€œThe development of a few university
    teams working together across the traditional disciplines, combining
    the best efforts of technology, the social sciences and management oapa-
    bility which they have created and which make them the best available
    source of trusted information in our society can write a new chapter

    solar activity, were provided by two American and two British univer-
    sities, one U.S. Government agency, and one private company. Os0 ZV

∞ U.S.S.R.â€™s Venus Z planetary probe (also designated Venera ZV) entered
                     V
    atmosphere of planet Venus at 12:34 am EDT and ejected instrumented
    capsbuleintended for softlanding on Venus. After aerodynamic braking,
    automatic parachute system provided gradual descent through 15-mi
     dense, hot, windy atmosphere, and capsule made [purported] softlanding
     at 2:08 am EDT. Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of
    Sciences, later presented scientific proof for softlanding [see Oct. 301.
    Launched June 12, the 2,438-133 Venus IV had traveled trajectory of
    more than 210 million mi; 49 million mi would be covered by trans-
    mitted signals from capsule to earth antennas.
       According to Soviet scientists, atmosphere as recorded by instrumented
    capsule had almost whole carbon dioxide composition with about 1.5%
    oxygen and water vapors; no significant traces of nitrogen; and a
    temperature range of 104-536â€ F. Reports indicated no noticeable mag-
    netic field and no radiation belt, but detectable weak hydrogen corona.
     â€œBecause Venus rotates so slowly around its axis [purported to be once
    in BM earth days] half the planet is cold,â€ said Soviet scientist Josif
    Shklovski. Because the other half heated to â€œmonstrous temperature,â€
    he said surface of Venus would appear to be â€œa dry hot desert.â€ He
    noted that temperature extremes would cause constant winds on Venus
    u
      of about 450 mphâ€ [accounting for large amount of drift of capsule
    during descent].
        Moscow news reports from Zzvestia and Tass said: Venus Zvâ€˜s mission
    had been accomplished and instruments had ceased functioning after
     radioing data from softlanding site on heat, pressure, and carbon dioxide
    hostile to most forms of life; mother spacecraft burned in Venusâ€™ atmos-

    advanced planning, he called for its use in determining long-range
    implications of technological progress. If a manager, keeping a program
    open to possible advances in technology, chose improved performance,

        Reviewing history of NACA and NASA, GISS Executive Officer Arthur
    L. Levine noted that forces which accounted for creation of NACA in
    1915 were both different from and far less intense that those behind
    creation of NASA in 1958. NASA played a much more significant role in
    the Nation and in Federal activity in science and technology than NACA,
    he said, and NASAâ€™s leadership was subjected to a wider variety and greater
    intensity of pressures from within Government and from outside interests.
        NASA Historian Eugene M. Emme reviewed historical evolution of
    U.S. aeronautics and astronautics in context of major national poli-
    cies and decisions. Citing effects of World Wars I and 14, the â€œcold
    warâ€ of the 1950â€™s, and launching of Sputnik, he described how they
    helped determine the pace and utilization of technological advances
    and reviewed major U.S. turning points and relevant factors contribut-
    ing toâ€™the Apollo decision. (Program)
        M/G J. D. Caldara (USAF, Ret.) ,President of Flight Safety Foundation,

    underwater, aircraft, and space systems based on recognition, reason-
    ing, and responsibility: â€œThis process [of problem solving] spells out
    the basic building blocks in the structure of the man/machine relation-
            .                     ...
    ships . . involving safety.        If every scientist-engineer accepts his
    rightful responsibility and applies his imagination and experience to

       GSFC engineers F. 0.
    of a worldwide tracking and communications system for manned plane-
    tary missions similar to that used for Apollo. Planetary Manned Space
    Flight Network (PMSFN)-consisting of three 30- to 504t-dia ground
    stations, three 210-ft-dia dish antennas, and three synchronous orbit-
    ing tracking stations (SOTS) -would obviate need for other radar, ships,
    and aircraft. SOTS, they said, while providing continuous communica-
    tions, tracking, and telemetry functions, would be more cost-efficient
    by removing requirement for numerous new tracking stations. (Text;

       Addressing Honors Banquet, usc President Dr. Norman Topping
    stressed need for expanded program to search and disseminate data
    produced in space research. Although such data did reach social prob-
    lems occasionally, â€œthe arrival in the right place at the right time is
    largely a coincidence,â€ he noted. To realize the total potential of modern
    discovery, scientists had to communicate outside their separate, narrow
    fields, find a common language with the layman, and work together

    to â€œfind places for their discoveries within the social, ethical, and moral
    framework of our civilization.â€ (Text)
        Princeton Univ. economics professor Oskar Morgenstern, participat-
    ing in Presidentâ€™s Forum, â€œThe Worth of the Space Program,â€ contended
    that the space effort, as a public investment of natural resources, had
    to be evaluated by comparing its benefits with other ways the resources
    could have been used. Although no basic discoveries as important as
    atomic fission, the transistor, or the laser could be attributed to space
    exploration, he said, US. could still afford a high degree of space
    exploration and could expect discoveries â€œof a magnitude that will
    astonish even this generation which has seen so much and is prepared
    to expect that our knowledge will increase without limit.â€
        Dr. T. Keith Glennan, President of Associated Universities, Inc., and
    first NASA Administrator, submitted that the most important enduring
    contribution of the space endeavor to US. future was education. Progress
    in higher education, he said, had occurred as a result of the compelling
    challenge of space exploration along with NASAâ€™s â€œclear and evident
    desire to assure an adequate flow of highly trained manpower. . . .,,
    Current statistics on NASA investments in higher education were very
    impressive, he noted, but if NASAâ€™s budget were trimmed further its
    support to education would have to be diminished.
        Dr. Willard F. Libby of UCLA predicted that space program would
    LC
       come out to be the best bargain the American people have ever made--
    both for its practical value in technological developments, and for its
    contributions to pure knowledge through science.â€ Space program had
    already contributed to and answered questions about geosciences, inter-
    planetary sciences, astronomy, and chemistry but most consuming ques-
    tion was that of extraterrestrial life in solar system. (Texts)

∞ Overall NASA aeronautics program was undergoing â€œexpansion and change

    to meet the ever growing needsâ€ of air transportation industry and

    told the Aero Club in Washington, D.C.: â€œLess than 1400 direct man.
    years were applied to our aeronautical effort in 1962 and only $15
    million in R&D funding was applied to support their activities. The
    trend has now been clearly reversed and in [FY 19671 twice the man-
    power (27.2 directs) and three times the funding ($45.7 million) were
                         aeronautical program.â€ Although FY 1968 program
    applied to NASAâ€™s
    had not been clarified, NASA planned to increase aeronautical R&D fund-
    ing to $81.4 million, he said.
       Major aeronautical advances in the past had been exploited by DOD,
    he noted, which bore development costs and proved out designs before
    adoption by commercial aviation. Since solutions for many problems
    could no longer rely heavily on precursor military development, NASA
     would continue NASA-mtablished role t o conduct broadly applicable
    basic aeronautical research and solve specific problems with reimburse-
    ment for special costs. In addition, D . Seamans said, NASA would
                                               r
    attempt to reduce aircraft noise by modifying engines on existing air-
    craft, developing quieter engines, and revising operational procedures ;
    cooperate with FAA and industry to solve safety and utility problems of

     Foundation, delivering Granada Lecture in London, warned that com-
    munications satellitesâ€™ promise of international LLcommon      marketâ€ of
    high-quality TV was threatened by commercial and government avarice.
    In US., he said, TV â€œcan make so muchâ€™money doing its worst, it cannot
    afford to do its best.â€ Consequence had been that early promise of
    quality programs had been lost while educational TV, which could fill
    breach, had been â€œunder-funded, undernourished and under-observed.â€
    But even in nations where TV was nationalized, tendency would be for
     governments to seek profits from it to offset other communications defi-
    cits, he said. Thus, he argued, â€œa promising world village, linked by
     satellites,â€ could be turned into â€œan electronic slum,â€ because ambitious
    corporations and separate governments insisted on going their own
    ways, concerned more with earnings, national appetites, and images
    than with what their satellite systems carried. What was required, he
     suggested, was â€œan electronic Magna Chartaâ€ guaranteeing rights of
     public to quality TV. (Friendly, W Post, 10/25/67, D14)

October 25-27: Mariner IV, launched Nov. 28, 1964, responded to a series
    of commands 56 million mi out in space after three years in orbit. On
    Oct. 25, the spacecraft was commanded to switch data rate from 8?43 to
    33% bps (bits per s i x ) ; receive via low-gain antenna; reorient space-
    craft so high-gain antenna pointed directly at earth; change to all-
    engineering data format; and burn midcourse guidance engine for 70
    sec. On Oct. 26, commands were sent to actuate planetary scan sub-
    system and tape recorder. Lines 139 through 199 of picture No. 16 and
    lines 1through 59 of picture No. 17 were played back. Initial indications
    were that photographic data were the same as when first reported July 14,
    1965. On Oct. 27, spacecraft respond6d to commands to test certain
    redundant equipment-such as transmitter and attitude-control appa-

     that these living organisms were dried out, kept in suspended animation
    for years, subjected to extremes of temperature, and then revived no
     worse for wear. According to Hinton, as long as spatial relations of the

∞ NASA announced that research at Ames Research Center indicated a prob-
    ability of meteoroidsâ€™ puncturing spacecraft at about six times greater
    than previous calculations. Tests which simulated meteor entry into
    atmosphere were conducted in AECâ€™s Hypervelocity Planetary Gas Tunnel.
    ARC Director H. Julian Allen and assisting scientists Charles Shepard,
    Howard Stine, and Barrett Baldwin used melting or ablating tests on one
    stony meteorite and on samples of gabbro-common, meteor-like earth
    rock-at simulated speeds up to 35,000 mph. Tunnel tests showed that
    heat of entry into earthâ€™s atmosphere melted rock surface, boiled off
    interior water, and expanded gases occurring in rock. Expansion of
    exterior rock layer by 10 to 1,000 times converted exterior to foam and
    acted as a heat shield. Foam was 2 to 20 times less dense than the un-
    heated rock; depending on entry conditions, foam would or would
    not break off.
       Past experience and theory had suggested that meteors were sand-
    like and would be remains of broken up comets; in addition, studies of
    meteor and comet trajectories had supported current theory that comets
    would be like â€œdirty snowballsâ€ made mostly of ice, frozen ammonia,
    and methane with rock and sand additives.
       Opposed to these beliefs, ARC scientists speculated that many more
    meteors originated in the rocky asteroid belt and that much more solid
    rock would be contained in luminous clouds of comets. ARC could now
    prophesy the need for greater protection on long missions where the
    probability of meteoroid hit would be highest. (NASA Release 67-281)

∞ Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara announced U.S.S.R.â€™s possible
    development of a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System [see Oct. 161.
    While ICBMâ€™s   followed a ballistic trajectory from launch to impact and
    had an apogee of 800 mi, FOBS, he said, was fired into a very low orbit,
    and before first orbit was completed, rocket engine would slow down
    payload and cause it to drop out of orbit-payload then following a
    reentry path like reentry of ICBM. He said that â€œwe suspect [they] are
                                  ...
    pursuing the R&D of a FOBS           [and] it is conceivable that they could
    achieve an initial operational capability during 1968. Because of the
    low altitude of their orbits, some trajectories of a FOBS would avoid detec-
                                           ...
    tion by some early warning radars            [and] impact point cannot be
    determined until ignition of the rocket engine [deboosting payload]-
    roughly three minutes and SO0 miles from the target. And the flight time
    can be as much as 10 minutes shorter than an ICBM.â€
       Accuracy of FOBS would be significantly less than that of ICBM and
    payload a fraction of that of ICBM, according to McNamara. FOBSâ€™ dis-
    advantages had compelled DOD to decide that FOBS â€œwould not
                                               ..

    said: â€œ. . already we are beginning to use operationally over-the-

∞ CNO Adm. Thomas H. Moorer officially denied news reports on F-111B
    program cancellation or drastic change: â€˜â€˜The reports may have origi-
    nated with a manufacturerâ€™s brochure received by the Navy.â€ Brochure
     would have no â€œofficial standing,â€ he said. Earlier in the day ABC and
    Metromedia News reported USN and Congressional sources saying czn-
    cellation was official. In Fort Worth, General Dynamics COT. President
     Frank W. Davis insisted the F-111 was meeting its objectives and even
     exceeding them in some cases.
        Navyâ€™s highest-ranking admirals had recommended cancellation of
    F-111B and recasting of major features in a more economic and agile
    swept-wing fighter, Richard Witkin reported in New Yorlc Times.
     Admiralsâ€™ arguments were listed. Overweight aircraft would perform
     only one of its two planned missions-defense of fleet against air attack.
    Air-to-air and air-to-ground missions would be beyond capability of
     F-lllB, and admirals had been convinced that an aircraft capable
    of all missions could be developed and delivered to the fleet by 1973. To
     arrive at aircraft they wanted, admirals would scrap wings and fuselage
     of F-111B; they would keep proven features, such as TF-30 engines,
    Phoenix air-to-air missiles, advanced radar and electronic gear-new air-
     craft weighing 52,000 Ibs compared with F-111Bâ€™s 75,000 lbs and
     costing $4-6 million compared with $8-10 million. Navyâ€™s limited
     budget could not stand the soaring costs (in the light of technical trou-
     bles delaying F-111Bâ€™s delivery on schedule) , while potential enemyâ€™s
     development of better aircraft calIed for dompetitive U.S. development.
        An aircraft that would keep weight down to 52,000 lbs and exploit
     the swept-wing and engine features of F-111B had been proposed by
     McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. ;
     their promised delivery to the Navy would be less than two years behind
     that for F-111B, which was three years behind schedule, Witkin reported.

 ∞ NASAâ€™s Apollo 4 (AS-501), which would be launched by Saturn V in
   three days, had the power to place astronauts on moon, or telescopes
   in orbit beyond earthâ€™s atmosphere; American capability for major
    strides toward the unknown had arrived when interest in these en-
    deavors had reached a new and understandable low, Albert Sehlstedt,
 Jr., reported in Baltimore Sun. Along with the new era of less than
    major interest in space had come the high-priority problems of the
    Southeast Asia war and the urban riots. Aviation r e e k for Aug. 7
    had said â€œAn era ended for the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
    tration last week when Congress voted a $234,000,000 cut in the agencyâ€™s
    budget authorization for fiscal 1968.â€
       Many people during recent months had looked toward the achieve.
    ment of social as well as scientific goals, reappraisement of both being
    called for by Congress. Because AS-501 would be one of the highest
    achievements in space, the question was no longer whether man could
    reach into space, but â€œ. . . . with what urgency it should be done
    in the light of all the needs on earth.â€ (Sehlstedt, B Sun, 11/7/67, 6)

    color photograph of earth which officials described as excellent in qual-
    ity. The photograph, processed at GSFC, showed entire earthâ€˜s disk and
    details of features as small as two or three miles in size. Ats ZZZ,third of a
    series of five satellites managed by OSSA, carried communication, meteor-

    scan cloud camera obtained color contrast as well as brightness contrast,
    according to chief experimenter Wisconsin Univ.â€™s Dr. Verner E. Suomi.
    He gave this analysis of Ats ZZZâ€™s meteorological operations: â€œFrom a
    time series of pictures such as these the United States has, in effect, given
    South America a means to track their weather far beyond what they are
    able to do by conventional means. In one single photograph, the equa-
    torial cloud-free band which was seen from Ats Z [launched Dec. 6,19661
    pictures in the Pacific is also evident in the Atlantic. These pictures are
    ideal for continuing studies from the heat budget and convective sys-
    tems. The additional meteorological information in a color photograph
    is more subtle, but it is there. Low clouds tend to be bluer than high
    clouds. This has been possible even though adjustments to color balance
    on the ground are still underway. There are suggestions that the muddy
    outflow from the Amazon River in Brazil can be seen. We have not yet
    been able to determine whether or not the Gulf Stream water will be
    visible. Also, we do not have an example of the colors in the Terminator

∞ A restructuring of the Nationâ€™s space program was outlined by NASA Ad-
    ministrator James E. Webb in testimony on proposed NASA FY 1968
    operating plan, before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space
    Sciences. Decisions had reflected fiscal, resources, and time factors. The
    national fiscal situation required minimum expenditures on space for the
    next two years. Primary emphasis on completion of Apollo program and
    other financially important ongoing efforts would be carried out to avoid
    major losses. Decisions on NASAâ€™s space posture for the 1970s would be
    postponed until â€œfiscal year 1969 budget or later.â€ According to Webbâ€™s
    planning, â€œOur allocation of resources in fiscal year 1968 must hold
    open for later decision the most promising future aeronautical and space
    options which our past large investments will support.â€

        Webb presented rather brief outline on present long-range planning
    for lunar and planetary mission hardware. Limited funds could continue
     development of flight-qualified engine for NERVA I and would support
    plans for first Apollo Applications flights in 1970. Two Mars-Mariner
     flights for 1969 would be the â€œlast in present program.â€ Five Mariner
     flights in 1970s, two or more Titan I11 launches in Voyager series in
     1973, and Saturn V flight in 1975 could be considered in FY 1969
    budget. Webb reasoned that NASA could â€œuse the Atlas-Centaur . . . and
     the Titan I11 with transtage, to move out into further planetary opera-
     tions but with very limited expenditures in 1968 andâ€™1969.â€

        Landing sequence began when Surveyor VZ shifted its normal cruising
    attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar, main retro-
    motor slowed spacecraft to 374 mph; retromotor then ejected. Vernier
    engines cut off at 13 ft above lunar surface and spacecraft landed.
        First photos transmitted showed one of spacecraftâ€™s landing pads rest-
    ing on sand-like soil similar to that pictured in previous Surveyor photos.
    Later pictures confirmed that area was rough and pitted with craters;
    they revealed a region strewn with rocks up to two feet in diameter and

    spacecraft to 10-ft altitude before it touched down 8.5 sec later, 8 ft west
    of original resting point. Purpose of translation-first planned change
    of location ever accomplished after conclusion of initial flight-was to
    test lunar surface bearing strength, determine depth of original foot-
    prints made by spacecraft, obtain stero-type effect by comparing photos
    taken of same area from different positions, and study engine erosion
    effects. Post-translation photos showed cratering and scouring effect
    on areas under engines and confirmed that alpha-scattering instrument-
    which had stopped functioning properly after operating successfully for
    43 hrs and providing excellent data on chemical composition of lunar
    soil-had come to rest upside down. Communications with spacecraft
    were halted Nov. 24 to preserve battery power during cold of lunar
    night.

 ∞ In testimony before House Committee on Interstate Commerceâ€™s Trans-
    portation and Aeronautics Subcommittee, Rep. John W. Wydler (R-
    N.Y.) ,member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, urged
    passage of H.R. 3400 to allow Secretary of Transportation to prescribe
    aircraft noise abatement regulations. Rep. Wydler cited complaints from
    churches whose religious services had been interrupted; doctors whose
    patientsâ€™ mental and physical health had been impaired; schools whose
    classes had been disrupted; and individuals whose lives had been in-
    humanly intruded upon by jet aircrah noise. Passage of the bill was
    imperative, he said, because aircraft noise had become â€œsomething that
    dominates the lives of those who have to live with it to the point where
    it actually destroys the way in which they are living.â€
        Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd told Subcommittee that
    DOT was trying to find a solution to the problem, but he admitted his
     disbelief that â€œthere will ever be such a thing as a quiet airplane. Despite
    our far longer experience with the problems of truck noise and railroad
    noise, we have not been able to produce quiet vehicles in those modes of
    transportation.â€ However, he believed that â€œwe will be able, by techno-
    logical and regulatory means, to reduce the impact of aircraft noise ex-
                                                      ..
    posure for the majority of Americans who are . subject to excessive
    noise exposure.â€ He said bill was â€œthe mechanism by which we can assure
    future aircraft are substantially quieter than our present generation [of
    aircraft] .â€ (Transcript)

November 20-21 : Since X-15 No. 3 crash Nov. 15, research missions in
    X-15 No. 1and No. 2 had been suspended by FRC until review of flight
    operating procedures was completed. X-15 No. 1was awaiting captive
    flight checkout under wing of B-52 carrier plane. X-15 No. 2 was under
    repair at North American Rockwell plant following damage to lower
    stub fin on its tail, but was expected to be flying by February 1968.
       Cause of X-15 No. 3 crash was unknown. The pilot, Maj. Michael J.
    Adams, had difficulty with control booster system; X-15 failed to recover
    from a dive from extremely high altitude, the pilot losing control above
    200,000 ft and regaining it briefly at about 80,000 ft.
       Setting unofficial world speed and altitude records, the three X-15s
    had flown 191times; No. 3 having had 65 flights. The aircraft were built
    by North American Rockwell (formerly NAA) under a cooperative pro-

    announced NASA-DOD discussions â€œto consider carefully future national
    requirements for large launch vehicles, including a possible new
    booster of the 100,000-poundin earth orbit class.â€
       Webb stressed the need for planetary exploration utilizing both
    orbiters and landers in a long-term program: â€œWe do not believe that it is
    the policy of the Nation or the intent of Congress that the United
    States abandon the field of planetary exploration.â€ Present program
    still had two Mars-Mariner 1969 flights; continuity depended on NASAâ€™s
    current $143.4-million allocation to lunar and planetary category which
    would serve as basis for reestablishing future programs in FY 1969

   with the need for huge amounts of energy, extremely precise navigation
    to hit target and reentry corridor, and radiation protection that could
    include the intensities generated by solar flares. Lunar explorers would
    require a vehicle designed to operate entirely outside earthâ€™s atmos-
    phere, descend to and ascend from lunar surface, and propel reliably
    while exhibiting â€œrelative sophistication of a throttleable engine.â€
       Man returning from first lunar exploration trip would have accom-
    plished â€œan age-old dream [of visiting] his nearest neighbor in space

      At two-day meeting at Univ. of Chicago sponsored by AEC and the Inter-
      national Atomic Energy Agency, AEC Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg
      said US. nuclear plants currently generated 2.8 million kw of electrical
      power. By 1980, he said, figure would reach 150 million kw and by
      2000,700 million kw.
          President Johnson, stressing significance of the anniversary, said:
      â€œThroughout history, man has struggled to find enough power-enough
      energy-to do his work in the world. He domesticated animals, he sold

      desperate search for energy. . . By learning the secret of the atom, we
      have given mankind, for the first time in history, all the energy he can
      possibly use.â€ Urging acceptance of a nonproliferation treaty, he noted
      that countries with a single reactor, while generating electricity, could
      produce enough plutonium to make dozens of bombs every year. Even
      if their purpose were peaceful, he said, â€œthe fact remains that the secret

  â€œEvaluation of Apollo 4 mission data          continues to confirm initial
    reports that Spacecraft 017 met all flight objectives without problems,â€
    NASA announced. Detailed systems analyses were still in process, but
    evidence to date indicated spacecraft systems operated properly during
    Nov. 9 mission and met all specifications.
        First Service Propulsion System (SPS) burn had occurred as sched-
    uled; second SPS burn, however, was 13 sec longer than planned, because
    of a switchover to ground control after burn was started by onboard
    guidance and navigation system. Although review of the burn was still
    being conducted, NASA had already determined that there had been no
    failure in onboard systems involved. Because of the longer-than-planned
    SPS burn, spacecraftâ€™s reentry velocity was 0.0058% higher than ex-
    pected; actual velocity was 24,913 mph, compared with nominal 24,772
    mph. Increased velocity caused higher Command Module (CM) maxi-
    mum heat rate-620 BTUS per sq ft per sec instead of planned 586 BTUS.
    Maximum rate expected on lunar return was 480 BTUS. Maximum g on
    reentry was 7.3, compared with expected 8.33 g, because of a shallower
    reentry flight-path angle.
        Cabin pressure remained between 5.6 and 5.8 psi during entire mis-
    sion, indicating negligible leakage rate. Cabin air temperature remained
    stable at 60â€ F during orbit and increased to 70â€™ F during reentry.

     ( a simulated lunar module) during launch and boost phase was satis-
    factory. Earth landing system functioned as planned; all parachutes in-
    flated properly, and recovery aids deployed and operated normally.
    Heat shield performance was good; maximum char thickness was 3/a in,
    and charring of crew compartment heat shield was less than expected.
    Fuel cell and cryogenic subsystems functioned normally, with fuel cells
    producing potable sterile water and demonstrating excellent load-shar-
    ing and thermal-control capability. C M and SM reaction-control systems,
    electrical power subsystem, and spacecraft sequential devices operated
    normally, with all functions occurring at scheduled times.
        Guidance and control system and the mission control programmer
    performed properly. Range-to-go at drogue parachute deployment cal-
    culated was 2.2 nm. Comparisons with measured landing point indicated
    better than predicted performance. All communications objectives were
    accomplished. Each MSFN station, Apollo tracking ship Vanguard, and
    at least two of the Apollo/Range Instrumentation Aircraft established
    two-way communications with the spacecraft as planned. (NASA Release

     adequately protected against propagation of an accidental fire, four ma-
     terials which under specific conditions might act as flame propagation
     media were ordered replaced. In addition, beta cloth containers for
     food and flight data would be modified to enclose the stored items com-

    and officially classified the mission a success. Spacecraft was launched
    Oct. 19 to assess the effectiveness of water addition technique in alle-

    blackout period (approximately two thirds of total water-addition time).
    During last one-third of water injection period, no signal recovery was
    observed. NASA concluded that water addition was effective in reducing
    attenuation of the X-band signal down to 130,000-ft altitude and that
    reentry communications problem could be significantly reduced by utili-
    zation of higher transmission frequencies. ( NASA Proj Off)

     Subcommittee on Oceanography, summarized NASAâ€™sactivities in

    tory, were aimed at ascertaining what potential benefits could be gained
     in oceanography through the application of space techniques and
     equipment, he said. Major areas included: (1) investigation of the
     applicability of existing space technology to problems of oceanography ;
      (2) studies of remote sensing of oceanographic phenomena, including
     analysis of data obtainable from space missions not originally conceived
     for oceanographic purposes such as Gemini, Tiros, and Nimbus photos;
     and (3) development and test of remote sensors for viewing and dis-
     crimination of oceanographic phenomena.
        Spacecraft, Dr. Seamans said, â€œwill not supplant surface, subsurface,
     and airborne research and monitoring systems; rather they will supple-
    ment them. The absoIute accuracy, three-dimensional capability, and
     selective resolution of these conventional systems will continue to be
     necessary and must be utilized as a part of the overall system to their best
     advantage. However, Earth-orbiting spacecraft have unique advantages

    craft designed to provide continuing measurements over the solar cycle
    at widely separated points in interplanetary space, was successfully
    launched from ETR by Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta booster into orbit
     around the sun. Orbital parameters: aphelion, 1.0080 astronomical units

     satellite was to collect scientific data on interplanetary phenomena, in-
    cluding magnetic field, plasma, and cosmic ray measurements for two or
     more passages of solar activity. As secondary mission Pioneer VIII
     would: (1)investigate continuously characteristics of the magnetosheath,

∞  Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering,
    discussed importance of defense R&D and problem of choosing among
    new technological developments available. Speaking before the Dallas
    Chapter of the Assn. of the US.Army and the Dallas Council on World
    AfTairs, he noted that over 80% of all the scientists and engineers who
    had ever lived were alive today; scientific and technical manpower had
    increased m%,                                                  of all U.S.
                        compared to 50% for labor force; and
    R&D supported national defense. Current defense R&D funding was
    $8 billion.
       Discussing selection of proposed projects, he described a new tool
    and procedure called the Development Concept Paper, â€œa short, single
                   .                        ...
    document . . [which] requires that            parties agree to a common
    document that states the issues, the assumptions, the alternative courses
    of action available, the pros and cons for each.â€ With this type of
    presentation, he said, the Secretary of Defense could more easily and
    more objectively decide whether to approve or reject a project, and if
    approved, the paper could be transmitted to projectâ€™s implementers
    as a guide. This new tool, he indicated, would be used in future to avoid
    repetition of past inappropriate decisions in which precious resources
    were wasted, such as air-launched Skybolt missile and B-70 aircraft
    which proved too vulnerable after $2 billion had been spent on their
    development; and C5-A subsonic transport aircraft, currently being
    produced for operation in 1969, whose production had been delayed
    since late 1950â€™s pending development of a system to utilize it. From
    such cases, Dr. Foster noted, â€œwe have repeatedly learned that money
    is not enough. That enthusiasm is not enough. That technical innova-
    tion is not enough. We need critical analysis of purposes, missions,
    threats, and requirements. We also need realistic tested advanced alter-
    natives produced by our investment in research. And to gain wise
    management decisions, we must join these together in constructive
    confrontation.â€ (Text)

 ∞Surveyor VZ briefing was held at NASA Hq.
      Dr. Leonard D. Jaffe, JPL Surveyor Project Scientist, said Surveyor VZ
   had discovered or confirmed that: (1) lunar maria were covered pri-
   marily with very fine, 0.001-in-dia particles but also with â€œsome coarse
   particles and rocks up to a yard acrossâ€; (2) particles stuck together
   weakly and were not suspended above lunar surface; (3) radar return
   was from surface and not from subsurface layer; (4) strength of lunar
   maria was three to eight pounds psi at one- to two-inch depth; (5) com-
   position of rock was basic and basaltic with very little meteoritic iron on
   the surface; (6) surface was extremely uniform; and (7) particles were
   cohesive and adhesive, but there was %o need for concernâ€ about
   manned spacecraftâ€™s sinking or being covered by sticky soil in maria
   sites investigated.
      simultaneous operation of Surveyors V.and VI w p l d permit measure-
   ment of moonâ€™s â€œwobbleâ€ or physical libration by obtaining spacecraftâ€™s
   range and range rate, Dr. John A. Oâ€™Keefe, Assistant Chief of GSFCâ€™S
   Laboratory for Theoretical Studies, explained. â€œThe moon has a sort of
   a nose [Sinus Medii, landing site of Sorzeyor V I ] that sticks out in front.
                                                                    .
   The earthâ€™s gravity takes hold of that nose and wiggles it . . back and
   forth as the earth slightly moves either way.â€ Although scientists had a
   fairly good idea of the size of the â€œnoseâ€ and how firmly earth could grab
   it, they did not know how the moon responded to the pull, he said. Re-
   sponse depended on whether lunar mass was concentrated toward the
   center, in which case it would yield easily, or toward the outside, in which
   case moonâ€™s inertia would be much stronger. Dr. Oâ€™Keefe also showed
   Surveyor VI photos of lunar surface lit by sunshine. In one, corona was
   traceable out to a distance of 30 solar radii from the sun-furthest ever
   traced. Another revealed persistence of a line of light after the instant
    of true sunset. Line, which had appeared less clearly in previous Sur-
   veyor photos, he said, could be explained either as a layer of 0.001-in-
   thick particles or as lunar material floating a short distance frcm surface
   because of electrostatic charges.
       Surveyor VZ mission represented â€œthe completion of two major mile-
   stones of lunar surface exploration-the investigation and certification
   of four prime candidates for future manned landings and the scientific
                       ..
   evaluation of four .widely separated regions in the moonâ€™s equatorial
   belts,â€ Surveyor Program Manager Benjamin Milwitzky asserted. To
   maximize the scientific value of the last Surveyor mission in the series,
   NASA had established a group of scientists to study and recommend pos-
   sible landing sites for Surveyor G. As a result of groupâ€™s recommenda-
   tions, NASA had selected Tycho crater, south of the equator, as primary
   target, and Fra Mauro, north of the equator, as an alternate. Highland
   Tycho area was â€œrisky as a landing site,â€ he said, because it was covered
   by ridges, grooves, and rocks, but it would provide scientific data for
   comparison with data from previous lowland maria landing sites. Sur-

∞ In response to FCC inquiry on future communications in Atlantic area-
     currently served by two comsats and four cables-ComSatCorp Presi-

     presented their proposals in separate letters to FCC Chairman Rose1 H.
     Hyde. Hough, advocating a fifth underwater cable, said that although
     AT&T supported the idea of a global comsat system, all of the inter-
     national carriers believed the cable project was â€œthe right way to add
     to our capabilities at this time.â€ The best service, he said, could be
    provided by â€œa balanced, integrated network of both cables and
     satellites.â€
        Charyk charged that the cable would not be economically feasible:
     â€œ. .. when a new cable is laid to carry traffic that could otherwise be
     carried at no extra cost by satellite facilities which must be established
     in any case, the ultimate customer must bear the cable cost as an
     addition to the already committed costs of service.â€ As traffic was
    diverted from comsats to a cable, a greater share of satellite revenue
    requirement would have to be carried by routes not served by the

∞ Univ. of Brussels glaciologist Dr. Edgard E. Picciotto was shipping four
    tons of snow from Plateau Station in Antarctica to Brussels for analyses
    to determine chemistry and rate of fall of microscopic dust particles
    from space. Study, supported by NSF, would be conducted in cooperation
    with Ohio State Univ. and Belgian Atomic Center. Since the Antarctic
    snow was not contaminated by urban air pollution and never melted,
    extraterrestrial dust remained lodged as it fell in â€™ layers of snow.
    Plateau Station area, Dr. Picciotto said, was â€œthe only place on earth

* Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) ,Chairman, House Committee on Science
     and Astronauticsâ€™ Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, in
     interview with Aerospace Management, said: â€œThe Space Program got
     off the ground ten years ago on a surge of apprehension and sensa-
     tionalism. This year it became very clear that public acceptance or
     rejection will be a key factor in shaping the U S objectives in space for
                                                      ..
     the years ahead. Having ushered in the second decade of space explora-
     tion, both NASA and the aerospace industry should now review their
     â€˜ledgersâ€™ to make the best use of their achievements to date, as well as
     learn from the mistakes and false-starts of the past.â€™â€™ He predicted: â€œI
     have no doubts that before this century is over, man will set foot on the
     near planets [although] it seems more reasonable to me to first find out
     more about the other planets by means of automated robots [and] I will
                          ..
     be disappointed if . we donâ€™t couple the great capabilities of the
     Saturn V vehicle with those of a Voyager spacecraft.â€ He added: â€œ O -  HW
     ever, be they the merits of the Voyager concept or the potential benefits
      of Earth Resources Satellites, the public and Congress must be honestly
     convinced of their values if space efforts are to be supported.â€ (Karth,
     Aerospace Management, Fall/Winter 67,5-9)
9 High probability of mission success for Saturn project was born of sound

      engineering judgment built on extensive experience, and supported by
     modern analytical techniques, Special Assistant in Manufacturing Prob-
     lems to MSC Apollo Spacecraft Program Mgr., iformer MSFC Deputy
      Director) Dr. Eberhard F. M. Rees said in interview with Aerospace
     Management. He summarized the factors which had enhanced the proba-
     bility: â€œConsidering that one Saturn V, including the launching costs,
      amounts to over 150 million, it is not hard to see why the test launching
     preceding manned flights must be limited to only a few. What this
      limitation has done then is to stress more than ever before the critical
     need for intensive engineering, almost a compulsive meticulousness in
      manufacturing assembly, quality control, and most extensive testing on
      the ground, such as component qualification testing, and subsystem and
      system testing.â€ (Rees, Aerospace Management, Fallminter 67,
      23-27)        â€˜

0 Managerial and technical challenges of the Mariner project were high-

      lighted by JPL scientist Dan Schneiderman in interview with Aerospace
      Management: â€œWe have tried to recognize and correct our deficiencies,
      to retain the proven practices in the screening and use of reliable hard-
      ware, also to retain the integrity of our experienced manpower re-
      sources.â€ He added: â€œThe basic challenge in planetary exploration is
     that of designing and building autonomous systems that can operate un-
      attended for long periods. This is a quality and reliability challenge,
                                      393

    augmented by cost and weight limitations, plus a launch-window con-
    straint. In the face of these constraints, we can't buy in large quantities,
    nor be extensively experimental. We have instead concentrated on im-
    plementing a tight quality assurance." (Schneiderman, Aerospace Man-
    agement, Fallminter 67'17-21)
  Highlights of AEC'S annual report to Congress for 1967: major systeh test-
    ing for NERVA I and its reactor was planned; post-operation examination
    revealed no life-limitingproblems in ground test unit of SNAP-10Aafter
    operation in simulated space environment for 417 days; Project Gas-
    buggy, first joint industry-government Plowshare experiment, inves-
    tigated use of underground nuclear explosion to increase productivity
    in New Mexico natural gas field; two AEC-instrumented Vela satellites
    for nuclear test detection were launched, raising total now in orbit to
    eight; 25 underground nuclear tests were conducted. (Major Activities in

                     A CHRONICLE FOR 1967
 The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Dr. Frank
W.Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian. Sources included the United Na-
tions Public Registry; the Satellite Situation Report issued by the Operations
Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center; public information releases
of the Department of Defense, NASA, ESSA, and other agencies, as well as those
of the CommunicationsSatellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N.
Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, translations from Tass News
Agency, statements in the Soviet press, and international news servicesâ€™ re-
ports. Data on satellites of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public
Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, government announcements, and
international news servicesâ€™ reports.
   It might be well to call attention to the terms of reference stated or implied
in the title of this tabulation. This is a listing of payloads that have (a)
orbited; (b) as probes, ascended to at least the 4,000-mile altitude that
traditionally has distinguished probes from sounding rockets, etc. ; or (c)
conveyed one or more humans into space, whether orbit was attained or not.
Furthermore, only flights that succeeded-or at least can be shown by tracking
data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe or manned flight-
are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. An
asterisk by the date marks those dates that are one day earlier in this tabula-
tion than in listings which reference to Greenwich Mean Time. A double
asterisk by the date marks those dates of Soviet launches which are a day
later in this compilation that in listings which reference to Greenwich time.
   World space activity in 1967 continued at about the same pace as 1966,
confirming the leveling-off process which has now seen world space activity
at roughly the same level for three years following several years in which
activity approximately doubled each year. There was a slight rise in total
successful launches-127 against 116 inX    d-
                                           nl
                                           %
                                           a
                                           !            a slight rise in total pay-
loads orbited-159 against 143 in 1966, still under the record 160 of 1%5.
The difference between launches and payloads is of course accounted for by
the multiple-payload launches (DOD is the principal user of this system, with
9 multiple launches orbiting a total of 31 payloads and with as many as 8
payloads on one Titan IIIC vehicle; NASA had one multiple launch of two
payloads against none in 1966; the U.S.S.R. again had none).
   Of the 1967world total, the US. launched 55 boosters carrying 87 payloads
 (compared with 92/100 in 1966), the U.S.S.R. launched 67 (compared with
43 in 1%6), followed by France with 2, and Australia, Italy, and US.-U.K.
with 1each. Of the US. total, DOD accounted for 30 launches and 61 payloads

                                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1967

(compared with 42/70 in 1966); 4 of NASAâ€™s total were non-NASA missions-
Znlelsat ZZ-B, Zntekra ZZ-C, Zntekrat ZZ-D, and Ariel ZZZ. The US. and
U.S.S.R. each had one orbital test fight in its manned spaceflight program
(as opposed to the US. 5 Gemini flights in 1966), the Soviet flight-Soyuz
Z-being manned and the pilot being killed in landing. Each of these nations
had one planetary flight. The big difference was in lunar flights: &e U.S.
unmanned lunar exploration program climaxed with 7 flights in 1967 while
the U.S.S.R. had none (compared with the U.S.S.R.â€˜s 5/4 edge in 1966 and
5J2 bulge in 1965).
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag behind each
flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.

    CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHINGS
JANUARY 1, 1967, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1967
  T i chronology of major NASA launchings in 1967 is intended to provide
   hs
an accurate and ready historical reference, one compiling and verifying
information previously scattered over several sources. It includes launchings
of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA
or under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., NASA provided vehicles, launch facilities,
and performed the launches for ComSatCorpâ€™s three INTELSAT II launches
in 1967). NASA sounding rocket launches are published annually by the
Goddard Space Flight Center Historian in Goddard Projects Summary:
Satellites and Sounding Rockets.
   An attempt has been made to classify the performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle performance
and mission results-successful (S),partially successful (P) ,and unsuccess-
       .
ful (V) A fourth category, unknown (Unk) ,has been provided for payloads
where vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise
its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since many
of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact that a
great deal is learned from missions that may have been classified as unsuc-
cessful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Sources used
were all open ones, verified where in doubt from the project offim in NASA
Headquarters and from the NASA Centers. For further information on each
item, see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology
as referenced in the index. Prepared January 1968 by Dr. Frank W. Ander-
                                      .
