   How the voyage of Apollo 11 came to pass after seven years of concerted
national effort will occupy the serious attention of competent historians for
years to come. The moon walk of Astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin was an
important achievement in the progress of man. This dramatic event was
shared on live television by half a billion people around our small planet,
involving the entire globe in a unique common historical event of all man-
kind. New questions concerning the place of man in the universe have been
raised, which should stimulate inquiry into the philosophical aspects of
space travel as well as the scientific, engineering, and organizational aspects.
For such studies it is hoped that this chronology of the space events of the
notable year of 1968 will be of high reference value.
    The year preceding manâ€™s first landing and initial exploration of an ex-
traterrestrial body was also the 11th year since Sputnik became the first
manmade object lofted into earth orbit and the 10th anniversary of the
creation ,of the US. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. For
NASA it witnessed the conclusion of the great leadership of its second Ad-
ministrator, James E. Webb, who organized and carried forward so vigor-
ously Americaâ€™s effort to undertake a manned lunar landing in the decade of
the 1960â€™s. Two historic space flights in the final months of 1968 put the
 work for which he had been responsible to the final test: Apollo 7, the first
manned Apollo flight, and Apollo 8, manâ€™s first trip from earth into orbit
around another celestial body. After an 18-month hiatus in manned space
flight, both flights were carried out flawlessly. Apollo 8â€™s 10-orbit voyage
around the moon at Christmastime by Astronauts Borman, Lovell, and An-
ders and their safe return to â€œthe good earthâ€ was hailed as being in the
historical and scientific tradition of Galileo and Kepler, Columbus and Ma-
gellan, Herschel and Newton, Verne and Tsiolkovsky, the Wright Brothers
 and Lindbergh, Goddard, and Gagarin. With this flight, extraterrestrial
space was opened to manâ€™s exploration.
    Other notable techno-scientific space triumphs were made in 1968, includ-
 ing the launching of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory II, the success-
 ful conclusion of the X-15 rocket research airplane program, and the Soviet
 missions of the rendezvousing Soyuz I11 and unmanned circumlunar flights
 of Zond V and Zond VI. This chronicle for 1968 helps maintain histosical
perspective by including such events in their juxtaposition to other threads
 of history such as the budgetary and policy problems besetting NASA and its
White House and Congressional overseers. The 1968 space program ?as
 carried out in a year of national unrest and turbulence in the United S a e .
                                                                          tts
 Major news events included tragic assassinations and urban riots in the
 United States, widespread campus disorders, the capture of the U.S.S.
 Pueblo by North Korea, continued combat in South Vietnam, war in the
 Middle East, the starving of thousands in Biafra, and a turbulent presiden-
 tial campaign. To many Americans US. successes in space provided much-

needed reassurance that this mighty nation could still accomplish great
things.
   If the engine of modern social change is technology, perhaps this first col-
lation of spacs accomplishments in 1968 will promote greater in-depth un-
derstanding of our complex times. This, in turn, may help generate new SO-
lutions for current and future problems in those complex human areas
which so badly need to progress as rapidly as our science and technology.

                               Preface
   This chronicle covering aeronautical and space events in 1968 is, like its
predecessor volumes, a tentative step in the process of documentation and
writing of history. Admittedly a first skimming, it attempts to sort out the
rising crescendo of events, decisions, and personalities into the sequence of
their happening. It is largely a collection process on available sources rather
than a product of research. Because of the virtual real-time basis on which
it is compiled and written, it must rely heavily on the most immediate and
available sources-newspapers, magazines, press releases, etc.-rather than
on the in-depth documentation that full history requires, It is, in another
sense, a holding action until the full history can be written, while at the
same time providing early reference utility.
   Within these limitations, we make a considerable effort to ensure accu-
racy and comprehensiveness. Our NASA Archives collects the current docu-
mentation. Under an exchange of funds agreement, the Science and Tech-
nology Division of the Library of Congress drafts the monthly segments in
comment edition form. These are edited and augmented by the NASA Histori-
cal Division, published, and circulated â‚¬or comment and use. At the end of
the year the entire manuscript is reworked and augmented by the comments
that have come in and by documentation that has become available since the
comment edition was prepared. The Library also prepares the extensive
index.
   This annual volume is the result of a number of hands. The entire NASA
Historical Division participated in source collection, review, and publica-
tion. At the Library Mr. Charles Thibault (through April 1968), Mrs. Patri-
cia Davis (from May on), Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith, and Miss Shirley
Medley prepared the monthly texts which were circulated throughout NASA
for comments as to completeness and accuracy on NASA items. Mrs. Davis,
Mrs. Brock-Smith, and Mrs. Gay Arnelle then revised the monthly drafts for
annual publication. Mr. Arthur Renstrom prepared the index. In the NASA
Historical Division the general editor was Dr. Frank W.Anderson, Jr., D e p
uty NASA Historian. Technical editor was Mrs. Carrie Karegeannes. Appen-
dix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, 1968,â€ was
prepared by Leonard C. Bruno of the, Library. Appendix B, â€œMajor NASA
Launches, 1968,â€ was prepared by Dr. Anderson. Appendix C, â€œChronology

Whiting of NASAâ€™s    Information Services Branch, Scientific and Technical
Information Division, kept the process abreast of Russian releases. At the
NASA centers the historians and historical monitors submitted local material
for the chronology. Validation was the work of many busy people through-
out NASA and in other relevant branches of the Federal structure.
   A chronology is but the first step toward history as an intellectual disci-
pline and even it is never really completed. Comments, additions, and criti-
cisms are always welcomed.

    veyor Program to analyze lunar surface, was successfully launched
    from ETR by Atlas-Centaur (AC-15) booster on 67-hr lunar intercept
    trajectory. Primary mission for 2,29341 (at launch) spacecraft was to
     softland on the moon and obtain postlanding TV pictures of lunar sur-
     face. As secondary mission spacecraft would determine relative abun-
     dance of chemical elements in lunar soil with alpha-scattering instru-
     ment; manipulate lunar material with surface sampler in view of TV
     camera ; and obtain touchdown dynamics, dermal, and radar reflectiv-
     ity data [see Jan. 9-22]. Surveyor VII-which also carried magnets
     attached to landing pads, mirrors for viewing beneath spacecraft and
     for stereo photography, and seven special dust-detection mirrors-was
     first in Surveyor series to carry both alpha-scattering instrument and
     surface sampler.
        Launch sequence for Surveyor VU was flawless, and spacecraft per-
     formed nominally. First of two scheduled midcourse maneuvers was so
     precise that second correction was not necessary; maneuver directed
     spacecraft toward a point 1.6 mi from center of target area.
        Surveyor VII was seventh in series of seven spacecraft designed to
     prove out design, develop technology of lunar softlanding, obtain post-
     landing TV pictures of lunar surface, and provide basic scientific and
     engineering data in support of Project Apollo. Surveyor program was
     directed by OSSA Lunar and Planetary Programs Div.; project manage-

    spacecraft to softland on moon when it touched down in Tycho crater
    ejecta after 66-hr 35-min flight and began transmitting first of 21,274
    detailed television pictures to JPL Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone,
    Calif.
        Landing sequence began when Surveyor VZZ shifted its normal cruis-
    ing attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar, main ret-
    romotor slowed spacecraft to 3% mph; retromotor then ejected. Ver-
    nier engines cut off at 13 f t above lunar surface and spacecraft landed.
        First photos transmitted showed Surveyor VU was resting in rock-
    strewn area. Later photos consisted of wide and narrow angle surveys,
    panoramas, and special area surveys of spacecraft and landing area, in-
    cluding closeups of rocky debris on rim of Tycho crater and rugged
    landscape with prominences and boulders estimated to be three stories
    high. Stereo pictures were obtained with special mirrors; polarization
    pictures were taken of lunar surface, geologically interesting rocks, and
    earth; and photos of Jupiter and earth were obtained. Camera also
    photographed laser beams directed at spacecraft from Table Mountain,
    Calif., and Kitt Peak, Ariz., observatories, two of six US. stations
    which directed laser beams. Test, first use of light to communicate over
    such great distance, was considered highly significant for future use of
    lasers in communications and measurements in space and on earth and
    was expected to permit distance between points on moqn and on earth
    to be measured with accuracy of six inches. Special surveys of dust-
     detection mirrors showed no accumulation of dust. Footpad magnets did
    not show a significant adherence to particles, but material did accumu-
    late on surface sampler scoop magnet.
        Only flaw in mission occurred Jan. 10 when alpha-scattering instru-
    ment failed to contact lunar surface after command to deploy had been
    issued. Photos revealed that although release squib had fired, instru-
    ment had remained in background count position. Efforts to dislodge it
    by rocking solar panel were unsuccessful. After satisfactory bearing-
    strength data had been obtained, engineers positioned surface â€™sampler
     on top of alpha-scattering instrument, applied downward force, and suc-
    cessfully released instrument without damage. Alpha-scattering instru-
    ment, moved by surface sampler to its initial position over soil, to
     second positionâ€™ over rock, and to third position over one-half-inch-deep

     drag, saving fuel. Scientists said NASA and Boeing Co. were interested
     in new line of SST research. Electrical discharge-up to 30,000 volts in
     tests to date--would  repel molecules of air and remove them from air-
     craftâ€™s path; molecules would then flow smoothly around aircraft in-
     stead of bunching ahead to cause sonic boom. Scientists admitted

   January 22: NASAâ€™s                   Apollo 5 (AS-204) unmanned earth orbital mission,

    delayed for nearly four hours because of ground equipment malfunc-
    tions, was successfully launched from KSC Complex 37 at 5:M pm EST
    in fourth flight of Saturn IB and first flight of 31,700-lb lunar module
     (LM-l), designed to land two astronauts on the moon. Primary d s -
    sion objectives were to verify operation of LM ascent propulsion system
     (APS) ,descent propulsion system (DPS) -including restart-and space-
    craft structures; evaluate LM staging; and evaluate 2nd-stage (S-IVB)
     and instrument-unit (IU) orbital performance.
        Launch phase occurred as planned; S-IVB ignited to insert spacecraft
    into orbit with 138-mi (222-km) apogee, 101-mi (163-km) perigee,
     88.3-min period, and 31.63â€™ inclination; nose cone jettisoned; space-
     craft coasted for 43 min 52 sec; and LM separated from spacecraft LM
     adapter. LM entered orbit with 138-mi (222-km) apogee, 104-mi (167-
     km) perigee, 88.4-min period, and 31.63O inclination. Initial 39-sec DPS
     burn, designed to simulate deceleration for descent to lunar surface,
     was automatically shut down after only 4 sec because of overly con-
     servative computer programming. Ground controllers switched to mini-
     mum requirement sequence, an alternate flight plan with shorter total
     DPS firing time and no provision for lunar landing simulation. Second
     DPS engine firing occurred successfully, with 26-sec burn at 10% thrust
     level and 7 sec at maximum thrust. Third DPS engine firing 32 sec later
     consisted of 26-sec burn at 10% thrust, 2 sec at maximum thrust, and
     ascent stage fire-in-the-hole ( FITH) burn during which the two stages
     separated and APS engine was ignited simultaneously while DPS was
     being shut down, simulating abort during landing phase. Duration of
     initial APS burn during abort staging was 60 sec. APS engine fired sec-
     ond time for 6 min 23 sec until fuel was depleted. At end of 11-hr 10-
     min test period, both stages of the LM were left in orbit eventually to
     reenter and disintegrate.
         Apollo 5 mission, adjudged successful by NASA in spite of premature
     DPS engine shutdown, proved out structural integrity of LM; verified
     in-space operation of DPS and APS; and proved value of contingency
     planning. LM was last major piece of Apollo hardware to have its first
     test in space. Command module ( C M ) had been tested during AS-203
     mission (July 5, 1966) and with service module (SM) on A S 2 0 2
       (Aug. 25, 1966) and Apollo 4 (AS-501) (Nov. 9, 1967). Final deci-

January 29: President Johnson sent message to Congress on F 1969     Y
    budget.
        Praising effectiveness of NASAâ€™s reduction efforts, he noted that
                                        cost
     NASA by utilizing idle, excess, and surplus Government property had
    avoided expenditures of over $22 million for new equipment and facili-
    ties and had saved over $16 million by improving procurement prac-
    tices. However, to meet urgent national needs in other areas, further
    reductions still had to be made. â€œNew obligational authority requested
                 .  . . is about $220 million below the 1968 amount. Ex-
    for [NASA]
     penditures will be $230 million below 1968, $850 million below 1967,
     and over $1.3 billion less than in 1966. This reduction reflects our
     progress beyond the costly research and development phases of the
     manned lunar mission, as well as the immediate need to postpone
     spending for new projects wherever possible.
        â€œBased on a careful examination of priorities, the 1969 budget pro-
     vides increases in some areas to prepare for important advances in fu-
    ture years, while deferring other less urgent, new projects. The produc-
     tion of our large Saturn-class space boosters is continued but at a re-
     duced rate. The development of a nuclear rocket engine to increase the
     capability of our Saturn V launch vehicle is also continued, but at a
     smaller size and thrust than originally planned, to reduce development
     cost.â€
        Planetary exploration would be continued with development of â€œa
     new spacecraft for launch in 1973 to orbit and land on Mars. This
     new Mars mission will cost much less than half the Voyager program
     included in last yearâ€™s budget. Although the scientific result of this
     new mission will be less than that of the Voyager, it will still provide
     extremely valuable data and serve as a building block for planetary ex-
     ploration systems of the future.â€
        Request for DOD, increased â€œto assure that our defense capabilities
     remain equal to any challenge or threat,â€ included funds to: (1) main-
     tain strategic deterrent by converting from Minuteman I1 to Poseidon
     missiles with multiple warheads and modernizing manned bomber force
     with additional F-111B aircraft and improved short-range attack mis-
     siles; (2) proceed with procurement of Sentinel missile defense system
     for defense against possible Communist Chinese threat and revamp air
     defense; (3) augment firepower, mobility, and readiness of general-
     purpose forces by improving air defenses with new fixed-wing aircraft,
     helicopters, and weapon systems; (4) improve airlift-sealift capability

  ∞  President Johnson submitted $186.1-billion FY 1969 budget request to
0
      Congress, including $6.76-billion total space budget. Of this sum, NASA
      would receive $4.37 billion, smallest amount since 1963; DOD space ef-
      forts, $2.216 billion; mc space applications, $143 million; and ESSA
      satellite system, $30.6 million.
         NASA FY 1969 budget, $218 million less than for FY 1968, provided
      for $3.677 billion to be spent for R&D (down $233 million from FY
      1968 and $557 million from FY 1967) ; $ ! million for construction of
                                                  45
      facilities ; and $648 million for administrative operations. Project
      Apollo would be kept on schedule, development of NERVA I would
      be continued, and launch plans would be made for two pioneer flights
      toward Jupiter and one Sunblazer probe. Research on Earth Resources
      Observation Satellite would continue, but development would be
      postponed. OGO program would be phased out after OGO-F. NASAâ€™s
      $2.5-billion Voyager program would be replaced with a $500-million,
      four-mission Mars orbiter project. Although NASAâ€™s          $2.039-billion
      Apollo budget request accounted for 47% of total NASA budget, amount
      for Apollo was $517 million less than for FY 1968, reflecting declining
      expenditures as program neared its completion. Requested $439.6
      million for Apollo Applications (u)program was less than half of
      amount originally sought and necessitated cancellation of planned
      14-day AAP-1A flight. Some $76.9 million-a              $10.1-million in-
      crease over FY 1968-was allotted for NASAâ€™s         aeronautics program,
      with most of increase attributed to additional supporting research
      in subsonic aircraft technology. XB-70 and X-15 research pro-
      grams would be phased out by December 1968. Space science and
      applications were allotted $538.2 million, with 18 major NASA launches
      and 13 non-NAsA launches scheduled for 1968.
         Major portions of DOD space budget would be spent on MOI.-$~OO
      million, compared with $431 million requested for FY 1968.. Some
      $60.4 million was allocated for defense and tactical satellite communi-
      cations programs, and $10.5 million for Vela nuclear test detection sat-
      ellite program.

  ∞  NASA released transcript of Jan. 27 background briefing on NASA FY
      1969 budget, in which Administrator James E. Webb explained how
      Apollo program had been kept close to schedule in spite of severe
      budget cuts. Although budget had been reduced $600-mi&on in 1964,
      NASA had been given great deal of flexibility to reprogram funds. â€œThis
      in effect permitted the driving forward of the program even though

    there were substantial reductions in the plan. I think if you examine all
    of the very large systems development in the country, you will not find
    a one that has kept more on schedule, given more for the money, and
    more nearly realized its goals on time than the Apollo, in spite of the
    fire, in spite of the reductions. The kind of rolling readjustment that we
                         ...
    have had to make             has involved very large problems. And the
    projections we made as to our capability to meet problems of that kind
                                          ..
    have pretty well been borne out. .        The fact is within this short pe-
    riod of time the Saturn V has flown. The heat shield on the Apollo has
    been improved. Service module has been tested. LM has been tested.
    And we have I think moved about as rapidly as any program-cer-
    tainly more rapidly than any program of a comparable complexity.â€
        Webb said NASA and DOD were studying closer cooperation â€œin the
    area of orbiting laboratories,â€ such as MOL and Saturn V Workshop.
    He envisioned production of â€œa basic capability of a rather primitive
    sort, something like an Antarctic base flown on the Saturn V which
    could be used for any national purpose.â€ (Transcript)
∞  In statement on DOD FY 1969 budget released by Senate Armed Services
    Committee, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said DOD was re-
    questing $79 million more for R&D in FY 1969 than in FY 1968 to
    CL
       support more vigorously many scientific fields that show great prom-
    ise and clear relevance to our future security.â€ DOD would continue
    working closely with NASA to ensure maximum interchange of person-
    nel, ideas, technology, and hardware and to avoid wasteful duplication
    of effort in national space program. Under new budget work on MOL
    development would be increased substantially. â€œFY 1969 is expected to
    be a peak year of activity in the MOL program, including the comple-
    tion of a major portion of the structural test programs on flight hard-
    ware, continued fabrication of hardware for the first three flights, de-
    velopmental test firings of the seven-segment solid motors for the Titan
     111-M, and installation of the ground equipment in the launch com-
    plex.â€ (Text)

 ∞  ARC scientists Dr. Gordon W.Hodgson and Dr. Cyril A. Ponnamperuma
      had demonstrated by synthesizing molecules in porphyrin group, of
      which chlorophyll was a member, means by which chlorophyll might
     have first appeared on earth. By subjecting ammonia, methane, and
     water in a simulated primitive atmosphere to continuous lightning
     charges, scientists created new molecular combinations, including
     some tentatively identified as porphyrins. Such a process of chemical
     evolution to form of self-sustaining life probably occurred during bil-
     lion years of earthâ€™s 4.5 billion years. Scientists confirmed synthesis
      with tests, but warned that materials might not be true porphyrins
      but structurally related compounds. (ARC Release 6 8 4 )
 ∞  Shipment of LM-2, second Apollo lunar module, and associated Saturn
      IB launch vehicle to KSC had been postponed pending further eval-
     uation of Apollo 5 mission results [see Jan. 27 and 301. Initial eval-
     uations of first LM flight, Jan. 22-23, had indicated that second
     unmanned flight might not be required to qualify spacecraft for

     missions to the near planets in five attempts. Russia has successfully
    landed an instrumented package on Venus after an estimated 19
    planetary attempts. We have accumulated nearly 2,000 hours of manned
    space flight time, compared with about 530 for the USSR. Our
     astronauts have performed multiple rendezvous and docking opera-
    tions; the Soviets have demonstrated one automatic docking. We have
    logged over 12 hours of extravehicular activity; the USSR shows 20
    minutes.â€
       Dr. wernher yon Braun, MSFC Director, critical of cuts in NASA
    budget, noted: â€œNASA has not been able to plan for post-Apollo projects
    with any degree of certainty. NASA has attempted production of the
    Saturn IB and Saturn V at the rate of two each per year. Frankly,
    this rate is too low to maintain the progress and momentum so pains-
    takingly acquired in the space program over the past decade.
       â€œThe dismantling of the high competence built up over the years
    at JPLand [MSFC] has already begun. Both organizations are already
    losing valuable, highly trained people because of the insecurity and
    the lack of challenging work for them to do. And we face the grim
                                                      ..   . The exploration
    reality of even further reductions and cutbacks.
    of space has proven its worth, and has become deeply ingrained into
    the everyday fabric of our society. . . .â€ Space program would be
    examined closely by Congress, Dr. von Braun said, but â€œNASAâ€™s     record
    of accomplishments and the ability of its management will bear up
    well under the scrutiny. In determining what our space program
    should be during the coming years . . . members of Congress . . .
     [should] give careful consideration to where we are today in space,
    at the end of our first decade, and where we could be ten years from
    now, by building on the accomplishments of the past.â€ (EH; Texts;

 ∞ NASA announced end of Lunar Orbiter project. Lunar Orbiter V , launched
    Aug. 1, 1967, had obeyed spacecraft controllers and crashed on lunar
    surface after 1,200 orbits. Final operation of spacecraft had consisted
    of 18.9-sec burn of velocity control engine at apolune to decrease speed
    by 64 mph for orbit decay. Impact occurred at 2:58.5 am, EST, near
    equator on moonâ€™s western limb. Destruction of Lunar Orbiter V had
    become necessary because its supply of attitude control gas was nearly
    depleted. In concentrating on 36 areas of moonâ€™s face, spacecraft had
    completed coverage necessary for full photographic survey of moonâ€™s
    hidden side, photographing and transmitting 212 telephoto and 212
    wide-angle pictures of lunar surface. Spacecraft had also been used to
    provide tracking target to MSFN stations and for crew training and
   computer program verification.
       Lunar Orbiters I , 11, and IJI had been crashed on Oct. 29, 1966,
    Oct. 11, 1967, and Oct. 9, 1967, as their control gas became exhausted.
    Communications were lost with Lunar Orbiter I V , and it had apparently
   crashed on lunar surface. During Lunar Orbiter project, since first
   launch Aug. 10, 1966, 6,034 orbits of moon had been completed and
   more than 99% of lunar surface had been photographed by orbiting
   cameras to provide data for selection of eight candidate landing sites
   for Apollo project. Lunar Orbiter program was directed by OSSA and
   managed by LaRC. Boeing Co. was prime spacecraft contractor. (NASA

 ∞ Apollo 204 accident was reviewed in Senate Report No. 956, issued
     by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: â€œThe
     thorough investigation by the Apollo 204 Review Board . . . determined
     that the test conditions at the time of the accident were extremely
     hazardous. However, the test was not recognized as being hazardous
     by either NASA or the contractor prior to the accident. The committee
     can only conclude that NASAâ€™s history of successes in testing and
                                      long
     launching space vehicles . . . led to overconfidence and complacency.â€
     Committee recommended that â€œsafety . . . be considered of paramount
     importance in the manned space flight program even at the expense

     complications for specialists who had to name lunar features. In past,
     craters, mountains, rills, and seas on moon had been named for scien-
     tists, mathematicians, and philosophers. In 1647, Johannes Hevelius
     had published Selenogruphicu in Danzig, setting stage for naming
     lunar features. Ground rules were set down in 1932 by International
     Astronomical Union (IAU) , which formed committee of astronomers to
     select names.
        U.S.S.R. had asked 1967 General Assembly of IAU to pass on 153
     more names for features on moonâ€™s hidden side. Levitt recommended
     that names of dead astronauts-both American and Russian-be ac-
     cepted for lunar nomenclature; later, living astronauts could be simi-
     larly honored. Also pioneers in space research-â€œsuch as Goddard, von

∞  Presidentâ€™s authorization request for NASAâ€™s 1969 budget was presented
                                                   FY
      by NASA Administrator James E. Webb to House Committee on Science
      and Astronautics. At $4.37 billion, authorization request was $700
      million below FY 1968 request, almost $500 million less than FY 1968
      authorization, and $200 million below FY 1968 appropriation. Webb
      stated: â€œNASAâ€™S expenditures for FY 1969 will be down $230 million
      from this year, $850 million below last year, and $1.3 billion less than
      in FY 1966. The NASA program has been cut. I hope you will decide
      it has been cut enough and will approve the full amount recommended
      by the President.
          â€œThe FY 1969 request does not meet at all our Nationâ€™s needs in
      aeronautics and space. It is a compromise-one which I fully support-
      between needed work toward advances in aeronautics and space which
                                                                           ...
      we can and should make, and other overriding requirements.
      During this period when we are reducing our effort by one-third the
                                                .
      U.S.S.R. is still increasing its effort. . . In terms of scientific advance
      and in applications of immediate economic use, such as meteorological
      and communications systems, our program has contributed more than
      theirs. But in terms of the use of large launch vehicles and in the rate
      of which future greater capabilities are being developed they are and
       will remain ahead, at our 1969 budget level. The hard fact we now face
       is that just as we have begun to catch up in large-scale booster opera-
            ..    . we are cutting back our program while they continue to
       tions
       advance.â€
          He listed guidelines within â€œnecessary fiscal constraints,â€ which
       determined decisions on FY 1969 program and budget estimates. NASA
      would continue 1968operating plan for Apollo program while using all-
      up test concept for Saturn V and Apollo. Complete success in all remain-
      ing eight Saturn V flights would be needed for manned lunar landing
       by â€œend of 1969.â€ NASA would reduce numbers of Saturn IB and V and
      work out with DOD future requirements for large launch vehicles under
       â€œsharply limitedâ€ launch program. Launch of Saturn I Workshop in
       1970 would be interim step toward Saturn V Workshop and would be
      coordinated with later launch of Apollo Telescope Mount. â€œPractically
       allâ€ programs had been stretched out, and a number of projects would
      be phased out.
          Scope of new starts would be reduced, with NERVA I replacing larger
      NERVA 11 and â€œless costly Mariner class spacecraftâ€ replacing Voyager
      mission. Urgent activities would be expanded in aeronautics and in
      space applications; for example, noise reduction, VTOL and sTOL, air-
      craft for remote measurement of earth resources, and Nimbus D for
      charting atmosphere parameters.
          NASA Centers would be reorganized â€œto retain . . . after reductions
       [in work force] are made, a limited but strong and well-balanced team
      of scientists, engineers, program and project managers.â€

       Webb responded to questions: â€œThere are no signs that the Soviets
    are cutting back as we are. New test and launch facilities are steadily
             ..
    added . and a number of spaceflight systems more advanced than any
    heretofore used are nearing completion.â€ Webb forecast Soviet booster
   with thrust greater than that of Saturn V, resumption of manned space
    flights, and landing of Soviet instrument packages on Mars in 1969 and
    1971. Budget reductions in FY 1968 had compelled revisions, reduc-
    tions, delays and cancellations in NASA programs. â€œWe can conduct
   a viable and useful program at these lower levels, but it will be a sharply
   reduced one.â€
       Despite reductions allowing almost no flexibility to work around
   problems, â€œwe still have the possibility of making the lunar landing
    before 1970.â€ (CR, 2/7/68, H926-7; 2/12/68, E708-9)
 ∞ Testimony on NASAâ€™s 1969 Budget request was presented to House
                          FY
    Committee on Science and Astronautics by three NASA Associate Ad-
   ministrators.
       NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications,
    Dr. John E. Naugle, presented OSSAâ€™S budget for â€œan austere program
   for the immediate future,â€ yet one that would make â€œeffective use in
   the years ahead of the capabilities we have developed in the past
    decadeâ€ and that would advance scientific knowledge and useful appli-
   cations. â€œNew starts are at a minimum,â€ he said, â€œbut if this budget
   request is approved, we can continue the most useful of our on-going
    programs, we can avoid abandoning the field of planetary exploration,
    and we can hold together teams and capabilities to meet future national
   needs. . . . â€ Authorization request for OSSA for 1969 was for $538.2
   million, $14.7 million below FY 1968 operating plan, with â€œthe de-
    crease . . . primarily in the Lunar and Planetary Programs budget,
   reflecting the completion of the initial aubmated phase of lunar ex-
   ploration and cancellation of Voyager.â€ Space applications budget
   request had increased for FY 1969 (to $112.2 million) because of
   LC
      demonstrated value of communications and meteorological programs
    and the potential value of applying space technology on a global basis.â€
       NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology,
   Dr. Mac C. Adams, described OART program as â€œthe key to tomorrowâ€™s
   leadership in aeronautics and space.â€ He explained: â€œ. . . our FY 69
                                             ..
    budget request for the R&D line items . is $336,800,000, up 5.7 per-
   cent over FY 68. The increase is primarily due to increases in effort on
   aircraft technology [up to $10.1 million] and nuclear rockets [up $6
              ..  . Major changes also included more V/STOL research, noise
   million].
   research for subsonic jets, and development of NERVA I nuclear rocket
   engine at thrust level of 75,000 lb.
       NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition
   Gerald M. Truszynski presented FY 1969 budget request of $304.8
   million for R&D and $21.8 million for construction of facilities and
   reported that â€œ50 satellites by the end of 1968â€ would be supported
   by network while â€œsome 16 new missionsâ€ would be launched in FY
    1969. For FY 1969, â€œthe great majority of funds requested will be
   directed toward operating and maintaining present network capability.
   Much of the existing equipment has been operated almost continuously
   for at least eight years and must be refurbished or replaced.â€
       Construction of facilities budget would fund : two 210-ft-dia antennas

February 8: NASA management officials continued to testify on their pro-
                            FY
    grams, within NASAâ€™s 1969 budget request, to House Committee on
    Science and Astronautics.
       NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E.
    Mueller, said OMSFâ€™S $2.815-billion FY 1969 request was lowest request
    since FY 1963, $332.8 million below FY 1968, and â€œalmost $700 million
    below the peak Manned Space Flight budget year, Fiscal Year 1966.â€
    Dr. Mueller included $2.483 billion for RP~D,$18.7 million for construc-
    tion of facilities, and $313 million for administrative operations. Over
    80% of total R&D report was committed to Apollo. â€œThe program of
    Apollo and Apollo Applications Flights, with the development of the
    Saturn V Workshop and the Advanced Missions studies leading to a
    space station of longer duration and greater earth orbital capabilities,
    constitute a minimum effort to continue manned space flight into the
    early 1970s.â€ Dr. Mueller warned against failing â€œto capitalize on the
    investment in the Apollo Programâ€ and said it was â€œeconomically
    prudent to proceed now with the Apollo Program and the definition

    ture of manned space flight.â€
       NASA Associate Administrator for Organization and Management
    Harold B. Finger, citing 27% decrease in procurement for first three
    months of FY 1968 below same period in 1967, predicted 94% of
    procurement dollars going to industry would decrease to less than
    90% by end of FY 1969 as industry-developed systems came into NASA
    for testing and launch. Presenting $10-million Sustaining University
    program budget-equal to 1968 budget but one-third 1967â€™s $30 mil-
    lion-Finger stressed need for university contributions and combining
    universitiesâ€™ â€œdemonstrated competence in physical sciences with their
    social science strengths to deal with the total impact of the nationâ€™s
    aerospace effort.â€ Finger submitted statement of Dr. Richard L. Lesher,
    Assistant Administrator for Technology Utilization, describing pro-
    grams â€œto experimentally test and develop methods for bringing about
    the multiple use of the new knowledge gained as a result of NASA
    activities.â€
       NASA Assistant Administrator for Administration William E. Lilly
    charged $7.8-million increase in FY 1969 administrative operations
    budget request (from $640.4ndion budget for FY 1968) to cost of
    1967 Pay Act and conversion to civil service of certain GSFC support
    services. He cited personnel reduction of 1,704 positions since freeze
    on hiring new employees on Aug. 24, 1967. (Testimony)

∞Space Activities and the National Well-Beingâ€ were discussed in speech
    before Detroitâ€™s Economic Club by Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Asso-
     ciate Administrator for Manned Space Flight. â€œIt is a measure of how
    far we have come in space in 10 years,â€ he said, â€œto consider that, with
    the flight of the Apollo-Saturn V last November, and the flight of the
     lunar module on January 22, we have now successfully flight-tested
    and proven every piece of the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle, the vehicle
                                    .
    the United States will use . , for the exploration of space for years
    to come.â€
        He warned that while US. was decreasing its rate of investment in
    space activities, â€œSoviets are spending 50 per cent more in terms of real
    purchasing power than we are. In percentage of gross national product,
    they are spending 2 or 3 times as much as we are.â€
        He noted that â€œwhen we launched our first satellite, Explorer I, the
    cost was several millions of dollars per pound of payload to get it up in
    orbit. With the Saturn V, we are now able to put payloads into orbit
    for only about $500 per pound. Considering that reduction from mil-
    lions of dollars per pound to hundreds of dollars per pound in orbit
    over a period of only 10 years, one can foresee reducing the cost to $50
    per pound or even $5 per pound for getting into and out of orbit.â€
        Saturn V development should move US. ahead during next year, but
    U.S.S.R. would soon surpass U.S. â€œas the full impact of the resources
    they are putting into their space program at this time becomes evident.
    And I would expect that by 1971 or 1972 we will be significantly be-
    hind them in terms of all of the aspects that we now know will be char-
    acteristic of space flight.â€ (Text)

February 23-24: Results of 13 experiments carried on board Biosatellite II
     (launched Sept. 7 and recovered Sept. 9, 1967) were discussed by sci-
    entists at NASA-NAS symposium in Washington, D.C. Experimenters re-
    ported that radiation in weightless state caused greater damage to plant
    and animal organisms than radiation on earth. Affected most severely
    by weightlessness and radiation were young and actively growing cells
    and tissues and cells with high metabolic activity. Animal cells were
    least affected by weightlessness. Generally, plants had difficulty main-
    taining proper orientation ; some plant structures, mechanisms, and
    biochemical activities were affected.
        Analyses of effects of 45-hr flight on individual experiments, com-
    pared with control group on earth, revealed that pepper plant leaves
    twisted and curled downward and wheat seedling roots grew upward
    and sideways. Radiation experiments showed: wasp nurse cells and
    primitive egg cells slowed activities, allowing time for repair of radia-
    tion damage; two strains of bacteria grew substantially faster and toler-
    ated radiation better, and viruses hosted by these bacteria appeared to
    be less effective in harming bacteria than on earth; twice as many flour
    beetle offspring died, and beetles suffered 50% more of characteristic
    wing defect; tradescantia plant had greater cell death and pollen abor-
    tion; and both adult and larval stages of vinegar gnats suffered greater
    chromosome damage. (NASA Release 68-35)

    plained NASAâ€™s   increased emphasis on aeronautics. Air transportation
    â€œhas grown to dominate the long range transportation systemsâ€ and
    â€œhas created an industry of great importance to the economic strength
    of the nation,â€ showing $850 million in export value in first 10 mo of
    1967, more than any other product, according to Dept. of Commerce.
    NASA planned to direct major effort at providing noise suppression, in-
    creasing aerodynamic and propulsion efficiency and advanced avionics,
    while avoiding â€œmajor new airport complexesâ€ by increasing develop-
    ment efforts for V/STOL aircraft.
        Harper presented FY 1969 aircraft technology budget: $91.3 million
    for R&D, $20.6 million for â€œother NASA support applicable to aeronau-
    tics,â€™, and $54.5 million for administrative operations (AO) (for both
    OART and nOn-OART). He said, â€œA large part of the most fundamental
    aeronautics research is carried out by NASA scientists using NASA

    Finger declared â€œimportance of the university participation in the na-
    tionâ€™s space program is equal to or possibly greater now than in the
    early 1960â€™s,â€ but cited decreases in predoctoral trainee grants to 75 in
    FY 1968 from about 800 in 1967 and over 1,300 in 1966. No new
    funding awards for new university facilities were anticipated for FY
    1968 or FY 1969. Multidisciplinary research had been reduced to
    about one-half 1967 level.
       In Technology Utilization program, Finger believed some of greatest

     VII, which landed on moon Jan. 9, revealed spacecraft could make safe
    landing in highland area with â€œmajor ejecta blanketâ€ (rim of debris
    ejected from center of crater). Data indicated Tycho region of moonâ€™s
    surface contained larger rocks, fewer craters, and thinner debris layer
    than did maria. Fine particles and rocks near Tycho crater had higher
    albedo, or lighter color. Iron content was lower, accounting for lower
    density. In Tycho region, where iron group of elements was less con-
    centrated, reflection of light from moonâ€™s surface was greater than
    from area where iron group elements existed in greater concentration.
    Low iron content was â€œprobably strongest direct evidenceâ€ that moon
    had undergone chemical fractionation, suggesting it â€œhas been hot, has
    been melted at least partially, and has been differentiated into different
    types of rock.â€ (Transcript; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 2/29/68, AS; W News,

    Chairman: â€œ. . the general posture of the programs is good [but] the
    Apollo program, with its inherent complexity, has had and can be ex-
    pected to have a variety of problems. Yet this study identifies the fact
    that confidence in the governmental-industrial team accomplishing this
    work is well placed.â€
       Report found â€œthat the NASA industry team is continuing to effec-
    tively employ its resources in the solution of those problems which cur-
    rently face the program. NASA has indicated that, given the stretchout
    in the Apollo program caused by the Apollo 204 accident, NASA is not
    constrained by total funding for the Apollo program during [FYI
    1968. The continued reduction in total effort in the Apollo program as
    the program passed its peak effort in fiscal year 1967 is beginning to
    cause dislocation in the contractor and NASA center effort to the extent
    that personnel that will be needed during the flight portion of the pro-
    gram may not be available in the event a major flight problem occurs.
    Timely support for the Apollo Applications program and other post-

    nological capability of OGOâ€™S three-axis stabilization system in highly el{
    liptical orbit for extended operations of 135 days or more and to con-
    duct electric-field,gamma-ray, and radioastronomy observations.
       On March 16, second of two 30-ft-long extendable antennas was de-
    ployed to complete post-launch checkout and NASA reported Ogo Y was
    operating satisfactorily. All experiments except one, low-energy elec-
    trons and protons experiment, which had stopped operating March 1         1
    when input power apparently failed, were acquiring data effectively.
    Data provided first observations of hydrogen cloud surrounding earth
     (geocorona), first detailed measurements of electric fields at shock and
    magnetospheric boundaries, and first spark chamber observations of
    gamma rays.
       Ogo V was filth spacecraft in NASAâ€™s   six-mission OGO series, last OGO
    planned for highly eccentric orbit, last spacecraft to be launched by
    Agena launch vehicle, and last to be launched from Complex 13. Agena
    would be replaced by Atlas-Centaur, and Complex 13 would revert to
    USAF. Scientific instrumentation for Ogo Vâ€˜s 24 experiments had been
    provided by six US. universities; four groups from U.K., France, and
    the Netherlands; four Government centers; and two private companies.
    Ogo V joined three other operational OGOs---ogo I (launched Sept. 4,
    1964), Ogo ZZZ (launched June 6, 1966), and Ogo ZY (launched July
    28, 1967)-in providing data for studies of earthâ€™s environment and
    solar-terrestrial interactions during period of maximum solar activity.
    Ogo ZZ, launched Oct. 14, 1965, had been turned off in November
    1967. Of 85 experiments assigned to four missions still operating, 68
    were still obtaining useful data, including 12 for which instrumentation
    was working after 42 mo in space.

    in national value scale because of Vietnam and domestic problems,
    Gen. Schriever said: â€œThe old criteria, national security and national
    prestige, are no longer the only justifications for our space efforts, im-
    portant though they are.â€ If public understood â€œthe practical, dollars
    and cents worth of the program to this country and to the world,â€ they
    would support it. US. was on verge of receiving annual return larger

March 20: MSFC Director Dr. Wernher von Braun, addressing National
    Capital Area Chapter of American Society for Public Administration,
    praised US. space program for â€œunequaled competence and unlimited
    opportunity.â€ After 10 yr in space, he noted, US. had launched 514
    spacecraft into earth orbit and 28 to moon and other planets. â€œThe
    moon has been completely mapped, the composition and texture of its
                                 .

    tronauts, who have a total of almost 2,000 hours in space to their credit
    in the Mercury and Gemini Projects, will begin the third phase of
    manned space flight this year with the first manned launches in Project
    Apollo. These achievements in space, fruits of the advanced science and
    technology of our times, mark the first decade of the Space Age as one
    of the finest periods in American history. And they are forerunners of
    even greatei discoveries and widespread applications to come during
    our second decade in space.â€
       Dr. von Braun credited NASA Administrator James Webbâ€™s direction
    with adaptation of systems approach to space research without which
    â€œwe would never be able to go to the moon.â€ Approach, Dr. von Braun
    believed, could also be tested on river pollution and satellite communi-
    cations. (Text; W Post, 3/21/68, H14)

    physical Environment: Its Study from Space, task force predicted fu-
    ture space platforms would be able to acquire global geophysical data
    on unprecedented scale for environmental disciplines. It recommended
    combination of manned and unmanned space vehicles-rather than ei-
    ther alone-and      warned that orbiting environmental observatories
    might provide data too rapidly for effective use unless data handling
    and display improvements were begun in immediate future. It rated

April 4: NASAâ€™s    Apollo 6 (AS-502) was successfully launched from KSC
    Complex 39A at 7:OO am EST on mission to qualify Saturn V launch
    vehicle for future manned space flights. Primary objectives were to
    demonstrate structural and thermal integrity and compatibility of
    launch vehicle and spacecraft; confirm launch loads and dynamic char-
    acteristics ; demonstrate s-II/S-IC and S-IVB/S-I1 stage separations ;
    verify operation of propulsion (including S-IVB restart) , guidance
    and control (optimum injection) , and electrical systems; evaluate
    performance of emergency detection system (EDS) in closed-loop
    configuration; and demonstrate mission support facilities and oper-
    ations required for launch, mission conduct, and command module
     (CM) recovery.
       Launch vehicle 1st-stage performance was near nominal, but two of
    five 2nd-stage 52 engines shut down prematurely, causing remaining
    2nd-stage engines and 3rd-stage engine to burn longer than planned. As
    result, spacecraft and 3rd stage entered elliptical parking orbit with
    223.1-mi (395.1-km) apogee, 107-mi (172.1-km) perigee, and 89.8-min
    period instead of planned circular orbit of 115-mi (175-km) altitude.
    When 3rd stage failed to reignite on command after two orbits as
    planned, NASA switched to alternate mission, firing service propulsion
    system (SPS) to place spacecraft into trajectory with 13,823-mi
     (22,225.4-km) apogee. Since insufficient propellant remained after ex-
    tended burn, second SPS burn was not attempted and CM reentered at
    22,376 mph, just under planned 25,000-mph rate. Spacecraft splashed
    down 50 mi off target in Pacific 9 hr 50 min after launch and was re-
    covered in good condition by U.S.S. Okinawa. Preliminary assessment

     stage boost, 2nd-stage ignition, and early portion of 2nd-stage powered
     flight. First indications of anomaly were decreasing temperatures on
     main oxidizer valve and its control line on fifth engine and steady de-
     crease in second engineâ€™s yaw actuator pressure. Third stage performed
     satisfactorily through first burn and orbital coast. Although engine and
     stage prestart conditions appeared normal, engine received start signal,
     and valves opened properly, engine did not restart. Initial data sug-
     gested that leak in one of two propellant lines to engineâ€™s augmented
     spark igniter might have caused insufficient or inadequately mixed pro-
     pellant for proper start condition. Investigations were continuing on

      completion of geodetic programs which would permit determination of
      relative positions of any two points on earth with improved accuracy;
      monitoring of sea surface state, evaluation of marine biological re-
      sources, and surface observations of conditions of interest to oceanog-

      in US. space expenditures since 1966: â€œUnder pressure from the war
      in Vietnam, civilian space spending has dropped from $5.9-billion in
      the peak year of 1966 to $4.8-billion this year, and it is expected to
      drop much lower in the fiscal year starting in July. Employment in
      space work at private companies, universities and Government centers
      has declined from 420,000 in 1966 to fewer than 300,000 today, and it
      is still dropping at the rate of 4,000 a month.â€ Signs of decline were
       clearly visible, in â€œghost townsâ€™â€™ that were once test sites, and in re-
      moval of numerous projects from NASAâ€™s post-Apollo plans. Fortunately,
      impact of cutback was softened because NASA had not replaced many
      personnel who ordinarily left agency each year and because personnel
      dismissed were absorbed by growing aircraft industry and expanding
      military space program. But there was a growing feeling â€œthat once as-
      tronauts have landed on the moon, they will have no other place of sig-
      nificance to go for several years because of sharp budget cuts. These
      cuts have trimmed to the bone all preparations for future missions. It is

 ∞ Sen. Margaret C. Smith (R-Me.), ranking member of Senate Committee
     on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, on Senate floor presented General
     Accounting Office review of source selection and award of major
    subcontract by NASA and its prime contractor, Grumman Aircraft Engi-
    neering Corp., for development of landing and rendezvous radar equip-
    ment for Apollo lunar module, compiled at her request. Sen. Smith ex-
    plained that although another electronics firm had expressed interest in
    performing under fixed-price contract, RCA had received contract be-
    cause of agreement between Grumman and RCA â€œbefore the require-
    ments and specifications for the radar components had been defined.â€
    Noting that RCA estimated cost of $23.4 million had now increased to
     about $112 million, she suggested that if Grumman radar subcontract
    was illustrative of how NASA â€œmaintains surveillance over its appro-
     priated funds, it would appear that substantial savings could be real-
     ized merely by strengthening the agencyâ€™s contracting practices.â€™â€™ (NASA

 ∞ NASA Apollo Program Director M/G Samuel 6. Phillips (USAF) told press
     at NASA Hq. briefing that Apollo 6 mission, in spite of anomalies, was
    â€œa safe mission from a crew safety standpointâ€ as demonstrated by
    spacecraftâ€™s recovery in excellent condition after performing an alter-
    nate mission. He cited three substantial technical problems-J-2 en-
    gine failure because of fuel leak, amplitude of oscillations during 1st-
    stage burn (pogo effect), and apparent separation of large piece of
    paint or skin from lunar module adapter during ascent-and one pro-
    cedural problem-premature shutdown of second of two 2nd-stage en-
    gines because of wiring error made by North American Rockwell Corp.
     which was not discovered by NASA in prelaunch tests. He said all could
    be corrected.
        From demonstrations of Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and in-
     formation gained from Apollo 6 Gen. Phillips said he had determined
     â€œthe course of actioh . . . necessary to correct and demonstrate the
                                      .
     correction of the prablems and . . recommended to the Administra-
     tor of NASA that we proceed with preparations for the manned flight of
     205 with the 101 spacecraft which is planned to be the first manned
     flight in Apollo, and . . . a Saturn IB.â€ He also recommended that
     NASA prepare third Saturn V (No. 503) for manned flight in late 1968
     with option to revert to unmanned mission if necessary corrections did
     not meet requirements to ensure crew safety on manned mission. NASA

∞  NASA Administrator James E. Webb urged Senate Committee on Aero-
     nautical and Space Sciences to restore $48.3 million cut by House from
    NASA FY 1969 budget request for nuclear rocket program [see March
     11. Webb stressed importance of proceeding with US. development of
     nuclear rocket propulsion as part of total capability in aeronautics and
    space to (1) meet potential civil or military requirements for space ve-
    hicles and missions, (2) avoid short-sighted cutoffs or constraint on
    promising new technological developments because they had no specific
    justification in advance, (3) prove that US. â€œdoes not intend to limit
    its development of large launch vehicles and payload capabilitiesâ€ to
    Saturn V class, and (4) serve as â€œcentral focus for continuing advance
    in nuclear and other technologies involved.â€
        Responding to questions, Webb cited recent Soviet development of
    fractional orbital bombardment system, automatic docking flights, and
    maneuvering of heavy payloads in orbit as evidence U.S.S.R. was â€œnot
                                           .

 ∞   In statement to Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences,
      Milton Klein, Manager of NASA-AEC Space NucIear Propulsion O5ce,
      summarized progress of nuclear rocket program. Major milestone has
      been achieved with â€œoperation in late 1967 of a single reactor for 60
      minutes at its design power of 1,100 megawatts, a duration capability
      adequate for most missions.â€ Technology phase of NERVA program was
      nearing completion and next step was to develop engine to flight capa-
      bility, funds for which were included in Ey 1969 budget request, he
      said. No action deferring this step could be taken without losing a
      major portion of capability in this field. Nuclear rocket was â€œa focal
      point for pushing forward frontiers of technology . . . [and] only
      major advanced propulsion program in the Nation.â€
          High performance of nuclear rockets had been demonstrated in nine
      consecutive power reactor tests. Solid base of data and underrating had
      been built for development of flight-rated NERVA engine. â€œDevelopment
       of the NERVA engine at this time,â€ Klein stressed, â€œwould capitalize on
      this investment and provide a major fundamental advance in propul-
      sion capability. Its high specific impulse will provide a broad mission
                                                                ..  . inevitably
      versatility for the high-payload, high-energy missions
       included in a viable space program.â€ (Testimony)
  ∞  Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, Director of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory,
 
      testified at Rover Program Hearing of Senate Committee on Aeronauti-
       cal and Space Sciences that, since projectâ€™s basic reactor performance
       goals had been demonstrated along with basic elements of complete
       engine system, major emphasis of Rover Program should shift to devel-
       opment of overall flight engine. LASL would continue to support NERVA
       program chiefly in development and evaluation of improved fuel ele-
       ments and other reactor core components. â€œDeep space has always
       been known to be the true domain of nuclear energy for both power
       and propulsion; it is my belief that the atom will be the work horse
       of near space as well.â€ (Text)

     for our future space needs.â€ Failure to proceed into development phase
     would result in â€œlosses of experienced personnel and cost-increase ef-

     sult in as much as two years delay in having an operational nuclear

        Nuclear vehicle as 3rd stage on Saturn V could significantly improve
     payload and mission versatility, and improved capability could be uti-
     lized â€œto improve mission effectiveness, to increase the mission and
    payload reliability, and to extend the spectrum of potential missions in

     plan, USN would continue tests on F-111B experimental models and
     exploratory work on alternate aircraft, VFX-1, until March 1969 and
     then decide whether to proceed with F-lllB or to cancel program
     after first eight models and develop alternate. If VFX-1 were chosen,
     F-111Bs already produced would provide sophisticated air deâ‚¬ense

    should be seen as the focus for ever increasing United States-Soviet col-
    laboration rather than as the site of an endless series of increasingly ex-
    pensive prestige races. Because our society is open, so much is known
    about our space program that inviting Soviet participation in the non-
    military projects would be unlikely to endanger national security. By
    insisting upon reciprocal privileges we would acquire much additional
    knowledge about their space efforts, thus achieving a net gain for
    United States security. At the same time, we must not intimate that the
    Soviets and ourselves have an exclusive role to play in this area. We
    must constantly reiterate our willingness to collaborate with NATO and
    other Allies in space technology.â€ (Text; UPI, NYT, 4/30/68, 95;

 ∞ â€œThe seven fat years of the space effort are ended, and the seven lean
    years have begun,â€ William Hines wrote in Washington Sunday Star.
    During N s 1962-1968 Congress had granted NASA more than $30 bil-
    lion. In FY 1969 agency would be limited to slightly under $4 billion.
    Transition from fat to lean was â€œcompletely understandable.â€ NASA had
    received favored treatment because it had high-priority goal, but with
    attainment now in sight, NASA was no longer in priority position. â€œBe-
    ginning of the endâ€ came in FY 1967 when funding fell nearly $250
    million from 1966 level. Budget for FY 1968 was down $400 million
    from FY 1967, and cut from FY 1968 to 1969 probably would be close
     to half billion dollars. With current inflation added, NASA â€œwill be
     lucky to have $4 billion,â€ he said. Agency would be operating in 1969
     â€œat an economic level lower than that of six years ago when the moon

  ∞  ARC reported that 90 US. scientists at ARC working group sessions had
      agreed electromagnetic systems would provide best data on moonâ€™s in-
      terior and recommended three techniques, magnetometer systems, ra-
       dio-frequency systems, and radar. Magnetometer systems could meas-
       ure blocking of fluctuating solar magnetic field borne by solar wind
      by using network of emplacements on moonâ€™s surface. Highly conduc-
      tive hot lunar core would cut off field completely, while cold core
      would let most of field pass through. Magnetometer on lunar crawler
      could make similar measurements to find highly conductive masses of
      water, lava, or ore. Radio-frequency probes could make inexpensive
      subsurface surveys through spacecraft radio signals which would pene-
       trate moonâ€™s surface and bounce back to be measured as to wave char-
       acteristics. Wave-change data could help define ore, ice deposits, or
       permafrost. High-frequency radar systems could study lunar surface
       through radar bounced off moon from earth with return signal received
       by earth antennas, or beamed from spacecraft in lunar orbit or from
       lunar crawler at lunar surface, with return signals received by space-

     Subcommittee of House Committee on Government Operations DOD
      would proceed with new phase of Defense Satellite Communicatiops
      System (DSCS) , procuring more than three advanced synchronous sagel-
     lites and developing over six new ground terminals. Funding of satel-
      lites, which would use very narrow-beam steerable antennas illuminat-
      ing 1,000- to 2,000-mi-dia area of earth, would start in FY 1969. DSCS
     satellites would be comparable to Intelsat IV series under consideration
     for commercial service.
         New DOD phase represented technological advance over advanced
      DSCS considered in 1967 but was Less ambitious in cost and size, with
     cost range of $100-200 million, contrasted with earlier $500 million.
      Current system had 25 satellites in orbit and operational, each
      equipped with switch to turn it off after six years in orbit. Number of
      terminals had grown from original two in field and seven transportable
     to worldwide operational system with terminals near Washington, D.C.,
      and in New Jersey, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Guam, Australia,
     Korea, Okinawa, Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, Ethiopia, and
      Western Germany, plus six shipboard terminals.

      cluded procurement of two synchronous Skynet satellites for U.K. as
      part of lnitial Defense Communications Satellite Program (IDCSP) with
      first launch scheduled for mid-1969. Joint efforts were under way to
      ensure operability of US. and U.K. satellites and terminals, and work
      was under way to procure two Skynet satellites for NATO under pro-
      gram similar to that of U.K. First launch was planned for late 1969,

June 24: NASA Administrator James E. Webb testified before Senate Com-
    mittee on Appropriationsâ€™ Subcommittee on Independent Offices that
    NASA was still uncertain as to exact levels at which a number of pro-
    jects could be included in N 1969 operating plan and that at House-
    passed $4.008-billion appropriations level NASAâ€™s aeronautical and
    space activities would have to be sharply curtailed. â€œWe will have to
    reduce and stretch out ongoing programs and eliminate or defer the
    work that would have enabled us to continue the research and
    development . . . looking toward a future resumption of tests and mis-
    sions which will soon grind to a halt.â€ Because of reduced budget,
    Webb said, NASA would have to accept one-year gap in Saturn V pro-
     duction, discontinue production of Saturn IBs, delay initiation of NERVA
    development, either severely limit all proposed planetary orbiter mis-
    sions or eliminate 1971 or 1973 missions, and curtail work toward
    using space systems for direct economic benefits.
       If NASA budget were further reduced under Revenue and Expenditure
    Control Act of 1968, requiring $6-billion reduction in Federal expendi-
    tures in FY 1969, result could be disastrous to goals of national space
    program. Although NASA would do everything possible to fulfill com-
    mitment to Apollo program and would continue on smaller scale pro-
    grams of greatest and most immediate national importance, further
    budget cuts would require complete termination of Saturn production
    and cancellation of production of associated manned spacecraft; elimi-
    nation of Titan-Mars 1973 missions and possible elimination of Mari-
    ner-Mars 1971 missions ; and further delays, curtailments, and cancella-
    tions which might require more harsh steps such as canceling orders
    for hardware already under contract and mothballing entire installa-
    tions. (Testimony; NASA LAR VII/65)

        â€œEvery major power and every nation eager to raise its standard of

       Arthur C. Clark, co-author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, suggested
    that most earth inhabitants could not be very objective about possi-
     bility of extraterrestrial life because they were too â€œgeocentrically
    minded,â€ still considering earth the center of the universe. â€œThe whole
    history of astronomy teaches us to be cautious of any theory purporting
    to show that there is something special about the earth. In their various
    ways, the other planets may have orders of complexity as great as ours.
    Even the moon-which looked a promising candidate for geophysical
    simplicity less than a decade ago-has already begun to unleash ar.
    avalanche of surprises.
        â€œThe discovery that Jupiter is quite warm and has precisely the type
     of atmosphere in which life is believed to have arisen on earth may be
    the prelude to the most significant biological findings of this century.â€˜â€™
    If we discover no trace of extraterrestrial life, he said, â€œeven such a
    negative finding would give us much sounder understanding of the con-
    ditions in which living creatures are likely to evolve-and this in turn
    would clarify our views on the distribution of life in the universe as a

    Dobbins AFB over Georgia countryside at speeds ranging from 143-mph
    takeoff to 230 mph and reaching 10,000-ft altitude. No attempt was
    made to reach maximum speed of 550 mph. C-5, powered by four
    TF-39 turbofan jet engines, each delivering 41,000 lb of thrust, could
    carry 265,000-1b payload over 2,875-mi range or 100,000-lb payload

      Arthur C. Clarkeâ€™s The Promise of Space. Clarke had described
      chronology of Apollo decision as â€œpolitics and astronautics combinedâ€
      and had written: â€œThe verdict of history may well be that the United
       States made the correct decision even if from dubious motives.â€ Dr.
      Jastrow said Clarke â€œseems to betray a point of view that the primary
      purpose of the space program is, or should be, the exploitation of its
      scientif;c potential and the search for knowledge in the space around
      the earth and on the other bodies of the solar system.
         â€œMy own view is that he is mistaken. Spacecraft have yielded
     important scientific discoveries . . . but it seems clear to me that pres-
     ervation of national security, and not scientific research per se, was
     the motivation for the Kennedy proposal. Kennedy acted out of a deep
     gut instinct, shared by the Congress and the American people, that
     the United States had been presented with a major challenge to which
     it must respond effectively or pay a heavy penalty. The decision on the

 ∞ Scientists were pressing NASA to prepare â€œGrand Tourâ€ mission of succes-
    sive unpowered flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to take
    advantage of configuration which occurred once in 179 yr. Alignment
    of planets would permit trip time as low as 8 yr rather than 30. Next
    opportunity would occur during 1975-1981 period, with 1978 and
    1979 regarded as best launch years. Tour was described by Lockheed
    Missiles & Space Go. engineer Brent W. Silver in Journal of Spacecraft
    and Rockets as â€œfeasible and worthwhile.â€ It would be â€œwaste of natural
    resources to pass up this opportunity,â€ he said. Studies indicated
    mission could be mounted with existing technology, but NASA, because
    of budgetary cuts, had yet to authorize it. JPL study had postulated
    nine-year tour including use of electric propulsion for sustained power
    between planets. MIT project, beginning with exploratory Jupiter probes
    in 1972, would cost $80 million annually over 17 yr and would use
    1,000-lb spacecraft launched by Titan 111-C with Centaur upper stage.

    ment â€œwas pioneered and developed in aerospace programs and is
    being increasingly applied as a powerful tool in the management of
    other major enterprises.â€ In NASA most extensive application was in
    Apollo program. Factors unique to manned space flight had contrib-

                        .
    gram, larger in . . lead time, money, organization and technological
    development than any previous program.â€ Special feature was high re-
    liability and safety required. And space program had been executed
    under scrutiny of press, public, Congress, and scientific community.
       Weight and volume budgeting were critical. High cost of flight-test-
    ing space vehicles made maximum ground testing necessary, as well as
    all-up (concurrent rather than sequential) flight testing. Vehicle was as
    complete as practicable for each flight, to obtain maximum information
    from minimum number of flights and provide earliest possible system
    readiness. Open-ended mission concept was used to accomplish as many
    flight objectives per vehicle as consistent with safety and mission suc-
    cess. Review of status throughout mission determined length of mis-
    sion. Redundant, or alternate, means of operation reduced ability of
    single â‚¬ailure to endanger crew or mission. Prime design consideration
    in all manned space flights was safety. (Text; UPI, H C h o n , 7/10/68)

        NASA was â€œvery much in business, and it will stay in business. We
    are accepting the challenge of the time and will continue a hard-hitting,
    technically sound program aimed at the most important objectives of
    the future.â€ But he described cutbacks as well as elements of strength.
     CG
       We are doing all we can to avoid terminating completely such impor-
    tant activities as the unmanned planetary exploratory program, but it is
    not likely that we will be able to proceed with the Titan/Mars 1973
    missions.â€ Saturn I Workshop would be delayed and, â€œfor a number of
    years to come, missions to use the manned space flight capabilities de-
    veloped in the Apollo program will be very limited.â€ Reductions to a
    budget already â€œsharply reduced will have many very serious effects on
    the US. position in aeronautics and space. They are only the most re-
     cent in a series of cutbacks and, in effect, constitute something like
     final ratification of a decision . . . that the United States will not, at
     this time, take the steps necessary to continue the advances of the re-
     cent years.â€
         Outlining NASAâ€™s  program, Webb said two flyby missions to Mars in
     1969 were largely paid for. â€œEven at our reduced levels, I believe we
     can follow the 1969 missions with two orbiter missions in 1971, but
     will probably have to postpone for another year the start of work on
     the two Titan-launched orbiter and lander missions which we had
     hoped to fly in 1973.â€ The 1969 missions â€œwere initiated three or more
     years ago. We are approaching the end of our approved flight pro-
     grams. The number of new projects started each year has sharply dwin-
     dled since 1966 and we will soon see years go by when we will have
     very few flights. We may see a gap of 2 years in our manned flight
     program after the landing on the moon, and a second gap, equally
     long, after the Saturn I Workshop.
         â€œPerhaps the most fundamental decisions ahead lie in the field of
     large launch vehicles. Can we gap the production of Saturn V or will
     we have to terminate it?â€ Question required reexamination of uses of
     Titan I11 and of possible development of new, less costly launch vehi-
     cles.
         â€˜â€˜Especially importantâ€ in this period was continuation of broad pro-

 During July: Ralph Kinney Bennett in Data scored U.S. complacency in
       year which might â€œsee some of the greatest Soviet space spectaculars of
       the decade.â€ In U.S., he said, early glamour of space race had faded
        and NASA projects were neither as ambitious nor as well-funded as they
        once were. In contrast, he noted, U.S.S.R. showed signs of â€œa new spurt
        of activity, new technical accomplishments above our planet, an accel-
        erated assault on the moon and dark rumblings of advanced military
        uses of the threshold of space. The time for a Soviet resurgence could

    â€œTheir position in relation to the rest of the communist world is no

    year on space and half that sum went toward military applications of
    space technology. â€œThere is an American attitude . . of waiting until
    you get burnt before you shed complacency. When Sputnik I burnt us,
    we came back with a vengeance. Now complacency has set in again.

 ∞ Paul G . Thomas discussed â€œEarth-Resource Survey from Space,â€ in Spuce/
    Aeronautics. Program called for: first mapping of earth to ultimate
    scale level of 1:25,000; first mapping of global sea state and surface
    temperature to help shipping, fishing, and weather forecasters; moni-
    toring hydrological cycle to assist watershed planning and prediction
    of botanical responses; measuring plant vigor and impact on supply
     and price of earthâ€˜s food ; measuring geographical surface phenomena
    to permit geologists to home in on mineral deposits and further argu-
    ments in morphology of planet earth. Signatures and their rapid analy-
    sis were major stumbling blocks in program. â€œAlthough there are
    about 50 geological signatures on record and about 100 for agriculture

    and forestry, each represents a one-of-a-kind situation       and, oddly
    enough, there is often more variance within a species than there is be-
    tween species.â€
       As remote sensing concepts emerged, it was â€œapparent that successful
    earth-resource surveillance will not be simply a matter of lashing to-
    gether existing technology into pseudo-systems and hoping for benefits.
    The human effort and development funding needed to fully implement
    a system for earth observation from space will make the lunar landings
    look like a walk to the corner candy store. Thus the shift in emphasis
    to cost/benefit studies, new to the space age, is certainly not without
    foundation. If, on the other hand, an optimized system cannot-or
    should not-be realized, we should be willing to stumble a bit to find
    out.â€ ( S / A , 7/68,46-54)

August 5: U.S.S.R. was expected to make more successful launches than
   US. during 1968 for first time since 1957, with both nations emphasia-
   ing military goals, Howard Benedict of Associated Press wrote. In
    1957, U.S.S.R. had launched two Sputniks, US. had launched none. I n
    1958, US. had launched five to U.S.S.R.â€™s one; thereafter, U.S. had
   maintained substantial edge, building to 73-46 margin in 1966. In
    1967, US. had led by only one launch, 67-66. Through 1967, US. had
   had 400 successful launches, with 532 payloads orbited. U.S.S.R. had
   had 240 launches with 289 payloads. In 1968 to date, U.S.S.R. had suc-
   cessfully launched 40 rockets with 40 payloads; US. had launched 22
   rockets with 31 payloads, 23 fewer than in 1967, while U.S.S.R.
   launches had increased by five.
      Reasons for decline in US. launch rate were NASA budget cuts and
   improved instrumentation and data recovery in military launches
    (60% of U S . firings). US. military payloads in 1968 numbered 22 to
    U.S.S.R.â€™s 24 out of total 40. Tracking experts had reported 16 of 1968
    U.S.S.R. satellites on reconnaissance assignments, with 13 reentering

    orbit April 25. Drop from nine FOBS tests in 1967 indicated U.S.S.R.
    might have perfected at least first stage in FOBS development.
       Neither US. nor U.S.S.R. had launched men into space in 1968 but
   experts listed Cosmos CCXII and CCXIIl launchings April 15 as
    forerunners of manned lunar mission. In 1968, U.S.S.R. had launched

    craft in near polar orbits to extend studies of atmospheric density, geo-
    magnetically trapped particles, and down-flux of these particles into at-
    mosphere. Expected lifetimes were one year each.
       Explorer X X X l X entered orbit with 1,548-mi (2,492.3-km) apogee,

     waves skirting earth and sun appeared to increase in wavelength, lead-

     would be similarly affected by mass of objects along the way. Effect
     could account for part of â€œred shiftâ€ (shift in spectra of distant gal-

∞ Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
     Flight, told British Interplanetary Society in London : â€œI believe
     that the exploitation of space is limited in concept and extent by
     the very high cost of putting payload into orbit, and the inaccessibility
     of objects after they have been launched. Therefore I would forecast
     that the next major thrust in space will be the development of an eco-
     nomical launch vehicle for shuttling between earth and the installations,
     such as the orbiting space stations which will be operating in space.â€
     Dr. Mueller said efficient earth-to-orbit transportation system would be
     needed to shuttle thousands of tons of material in and out of space,
     operating in mode similar to that of large commercial air transports
     and compatible with airports. Same technology could be applied to ter-
     restrial point-to-point transport. (Text)

     lessness in space, heavy acceleration and deceleration forces, air supply
     and pressure required for breathing in space, psychological problems
     presented by isolation, and problem of radiation.
         Successful termination of Mercury and Gemini programs had proved
     man capable of exizting in space. His capability to do useiul work in
     space had been proved by successful rendezvous and docking of space-
     craft, by space photography, and by extravehicular activity. Pervasive-
      ness of space technology had been demonstrated by range and variety
     of thousands of products, including Saturn V launch vehicle, worldâ€™s
      largest flight vehicle, and integrated circuit, one of worldâ€™s smallest

    flight had developed problems in rendezvous equipment. Dr. Mueller
    had said rate of changes in LM was three times that of Apollo command

    o f missile-limitation talks between US. and U.S.S.R. â€œPerhaps it will
    prove possible to level off the arms race despite MIRV, although it is
    generally acknowledged that this weapon raises special inspection and
    stability issues of its own. If talks do stick, however, the Administration

    must be prepared to bend on MIRV. . . No one seriously claims that
    there is any immediate military justification for it; deterrence works
    without it and the antimissile system it was designed to penetrate evi-
    dently is in low gear. It may be acceptable for MIRV to be tested in order
    to ease the Administrationâ€™s internal tensions and electoral exigencies.
    . . . But it would be intolerable to let MIRV spoil the missile talks. They
    hold more promise of mutual security-the only genuine kind there
    is-than any new weapon can provide.â€ ( W Post, 8/15/68, A20)

    mission for December launch but no final decision on precise mission
    plan would be made until after Oct. 11 Apollo 7 flight results were evalu-
     ated. LM 3, delayed in checkout, would be flown in 1969 on fourth Sat-
     urn V with CSM 104 since preliminary studies had indicated many
    Apollo objectives scheduled for later flights could be obtained by using

    cal oscillation, or pogo effect, in 1st stage of Saturn V and rupture of
    small propellant lines in upper stages-had been corrected and solu-
    tions verified in extensive ground tests.
        Plans and changes were discussed in detail at NASA Hq. news confer-

    Station carried Univ. of Maryland-Geophysics Corp. of America experi-
    ment to 163-mi (262-km) altitude. Primary objectives were to evaluate
    capabilities and accuracies of pulse and thermal equalization probes,
    investigate electron energy distribution in normal daytime ionosphere,
    and evaluate use of wing-slope techniques with Langmuir probes.
    Rocket trajectory was nominal, but despin was higher than predicted.
    Problems were encountered in telemetry. GCA antennas broke off at de-
    ployment and no data were received. Clamshell deployed properly and
    exposed pulse probe as planned, but motor for boom deployment mal-

August 22: Cone-shaped RAM c-11 spacecraft was successfully launched
    from NASA Wallops Station by four-stage Scout booster at 11:16 am
     EDT. After reentering earthâ€™s atmosphere at 17,000 mph, 264-lb space-
    craft completed its eight-minute ballistic flight by impacting 725 mi
    downrange 150 mi northeast of Bermuda. No recovery was attempted.
       Primary mission objective of RAM c-11-15-in-long, 26-in-dia space-
    craft with 12-in-dia hemisphere nose-was to measure electron concen-

∞  JPL researchers Dr. Arvydas J. Kliore and Dan L. Cain in Journal of
    Atmospheric Sciences reported findings similar to July 15 findings of
    Martin Mariettaâ€™s Allan R. Barger that surface air pressure on Venus
     might be 75 or 100 times greater than that on earth, or four to five
    times greater than that reported by U.S.S.R. scientists from data
    supplied by Venus I V spacecraft. Kliore and Cain concluded that
    Venus IV either had landed on 15-mi-high Venusian peak undetected
    by earth radar or had stopped transmitting before it reached danetâ€™s
    solid surface.
        Precise radio tracking of Mariner V-US.        spacecraft which had
    completed flyby mission by crossing Venus orbit Oct. 19, 1967, 24 hr
    after U.S.S.R. had reported parachute landing on Venus-had enabled
    Kliore and Cain to calculate position of spacecraftâ€™s rad;o beam,
    relative to Venusâ€™ center. Resulting profiles indicated Soviet probe
     had penetrated to radial distance of 3,774 mi from Venusâ€™ center, which
     point Soviets had taken to be Venusâ€™ surface. US. radar studies had
     shown Venus radius of only 3,759 mi. If radar data were accurate,
     Yenus IV measurements were made at 15-mi altitude and reported
     conditions far less extreme than on surface. US. measurement of Venus
                                                      F was consistent with
    surface temperature greater than 890â€™-900â€™
     estimates from passive radio astronomy and with results of radiometer
     experiment conducted by Mariner I I in 1962, when surface temperature
     was found to be 800â€ F. (NASA Release 68-147; Pasadena Independent,

     stripping away â€œsome of the most valuable military secrets of Soviet
     Russia for the past five yearsâ€ was being revealed in bits and pieces. At

    cameras could photograph in detail objects less than one foot in diame-
    ter from 150-mi altitude. â€œUltramodernâ€ radar circling in outer space
     now penetrated cloud covers and forest vegetation to reveal hidden mis-
     sile sites, tanks, and even troops. Infrared sensors could detect subma-
     rines and missile launching. Electronic sensors could monitor atomic ex-
    plosions and pick up telephone messages from deep within U.S.S.R. or
     Communist China. President Johnson had said spy satellites alone
    made U.S. space investment worthwhile.

September 15-22: Zond V automatic space station was launched by
     U.S.S.R. and placed on lunar trajectory from parking orbit of another
     satellite to explore outer space and test spacecraft systems, Tass an-
     nounced. All systems were functioning normally. Speculation in Mos-
    cow, later confirmed, was that spacecraft would attempt to circle moon.
     On Sept. 18 Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of U.K.â€™s Jodrell Bank Experi-
     mental Station, said spacecraft had passed within 1,000 mi of moon
     and was returning to earth and predicted U.S.S.R. would attempt to re-
     cover it. West Germanyâ€™s Bochum Observatory agreed that Zond F wasâ€™
     returning but insisted spacecraft had circled moon. U.S.S.R. initially
     denied both reports, but two days later, confirmed that Zond V had cir-
     cled moon Sept. 18 and was continuing its flight. Tass said spacecraft
     had flown within 1,200 mi of moon and obtained data on physical

    characteristics of outer space near moon. Research mission had been
    completed and spacecraft was continuing to relay information to space
    stations.
        Zond Vâ€™s reentry and splashdown in Indian Ocean Sept. 21 was re-
    corded by US., U.K., and West German space scientists, but U.S.S.R.
    made no official announcement until Sept 22. Tass then said Zond V
    had circled moon, explored space near moon, reentered at 11,000 mi per
    sec, softlanded by parachute in predetermined area, and was recovered
    by Soviet recovery ship-becoming first circumlunar spacecraft recov-
    ered on earth. â€œDuring the flight the stationâ€™s systems and aggregates
     for maneuvering on the trajectory and for returning to the Earth were
    tested. Flight control systems of the station and the radio-engineering
     means for measuring the parameters of its trajectory ensured the suc-
    cessful execution of the programme.
        â€œThe successful flight of the â€˜Zond-5â€™ automatic station over the
     Earth-Moon-Earth route, and its return to the predetermined area are
    an outstanding achievement of Soviet science and engineering. Another
     scientific-engineering problem has been solved, and broad prospects
    have been opened up for further research of outer space and planets
    of the solar system by automatic space stations which bring back re-
     search data to the Earth.â€
        Tass announcement that atmosphere and pressure â€œremained within
     the limits of their present rangeâ€ supported earlier speculation that
     Zond V carried prototype passenger cabin with atmosphere of artificial
     helium mixture which would be used by cosmonauts on future flights.
     Later Tass report quoted Soviet Prof. Leonid I. Sedov as saying space-
     craft had special heat shield and was slowed down during reentry by
     66
       air resistanceâ€ and, â€œat a comparatively small height,â€ by parachute.
        Zond V was fifth spacecraft in Zond series and first Soviet spacecraft
     to land in water. Zond Z (launched April 2, 1964) had failed in at-
     tempt to reach Venus and Zond ZZ (launched Nov. 30, 196p) had suf-
     fered communications failure enroute to Mars. Zond ZZZ (launched July
      18,1965) had obtained photos of far side of moon; Zond I V (launched
     March 2, 1968) apparently had reached apogee comparable to lunar
     altitude and had burned in earthâ€™s atmosphere on reentry. (GSFC SSR,

September 16: At White House press conference NASA Administrator James
     E. Webb announced his resignation, effective Oct. 7, his 62nd birthday.
     He wished to retire to devote his time to interests in education and for-
     eign and urban affairs after 25 yr in Government and nearly 8 yr as
     NASA chief. President Johnson would name Dr. Thomas 0.       Paine, NASA
     Deputy Administrator, to succeed him as Acting Administrator. Webb
     would remain as consultant to Dr. Paine until Jan. 20,1969.
        Webb told press: â€˜â€˜I leave NASA well prepared and with a conserva-
     tive financial structure to carry out the missions that have been ap-
     proved. They will go forward. What we have not been able to do under
     the pressures on the budget has been to fund new missions for the
     1970â€™s. So, there is going to be a period when there will be fewer
                                                                      ..
     flights than would, in my view, have been important to do. .          We
     planned, with the Presidentâ€™s leadership in 1961 and his recommenda-

      tions to President Kennedy to develop an ability to fly six Saturn Vâ€™s
      per year and six Saturn 1â€™s per year. . . . Under the reductions in the
      budget beginning in 1964 . . . we have reduced that anticipated flight
      schedule, or production schedule, [until] we have now cancelled the
      production lines on both these boosters. . . . what we will have to do
      is develop a new base of technology for the next generation of boosters
       [and] . . . the country will have to look with great care into what it is
      it wants to do with those boosters that will be in storage.â€
         Answering query, Webb said, â€˜â€˜I am not satisfied with the program. I
      am not satisfied that we as a nation have not been able to go forward
      to achieve a first position in space. What this really means is that we
                                                                      .
      are going to be in a second position for some time to come. . . I am
      satisfied with what we have developed in every field and that we have
                                                                 .
      been flying three successful generations of spacecraft. . . I think now
                                             .
      the question is what will the fourth . . be. We have a vast amount of
      capability. As the U.S.S.R. proceeds to fly and remains in the number
      one position, we will have the capability to start new programs as the
      need is clearly indicated. . . . We have worked up to a work force of
      420,000 people. At the end of this fiscal year, we will be down to just
      over 200,000. So we have shown the administrative capability to build
      up and then to reduce without losing pace in the program.â€ Webb said
      NASA had decided to man third Saturn V flight in December. â€œWe did
      calculate that we needed 15 Saturn Vâ€™s in program to make sure we
      would do the Lunar landing. We have funded eight. . . . Now we can
      only fly seven. So the real question is can we make the landing by num-
      ber seven?â€
         A good many people, Webb said, have tended to use space program
                                     .
      â€œas a sort of whipping boy. . . But in essence, if it were not for the
      fiscal problems faced by the President and the Director of the Budget I
      would believe that the program would have been supported in the Con-
      gress and in the country at a higher level than it has been.â€ Webb
      thought US. had reached parity with U.S.S.R. 21/, yr earlier except in
      large boosters and spacecraft. If U.S. could have had 12 Saturns a year
      in late 1967 or 1968, â€œI think we would have forged ahead.â€ Instead,
      â€œwhile we are reducing down to half to two-thirds of our program, they
      are still increasing.â€ Webb said current U S space program had created
      capability that could be used for major efforts in exploration if ade-
      quately funded. â€œAny danger to the United States that would come
      from the Russian program would be visible in time to use this capabil-
      ity to start out. But they are going to have the reality and the image of
      being out in front for a number of years to come. How dangerous that
      is, you will have to judge yourself.â€ (Transcript; Sheehan, NYT,

      scent from 43.4-mi (70-km) altitude. Basic payload design proved op-
      erational. Rocket performance was good; peak altitude was 6% below
      predicted. Instrumentationâ€™s tone ranging was lost after payload despin
      and new AB signal replacing FM signal slowly deteriorated after lift-
      off. Radar tracked all systems from liftoff to impact. Although para-
      chute was not fully deployed during descent and aluminum oxide
      hydrometer failed to project because of spring malfunction, key events
      occurred within two seconds of predicted times and significant data
      were obtained. Midair-retrieval attempt was not successful, but payload
      and parachute were recovered.
          Second Nike-Cajun carried GSFC payload to 73.1-mi (117.6-km) alti-

      nating 19 grenades and recording their sound arrivals at ground.
      Rocket performed satisfactorily. Grenade timer malfunctioned and in-
      stead of ejecting 19 grenades during ascent, vehicle ejected 1 grenade
      after apogee during descent and 12-14 grenades which detonated at
      sporadic intervals during descent. Final destruct grenade destroyed
      payload before impact. Some significant data could be correlated from
      ground arrivals.

      at 18.6- to 37.5-mi (30- to 60-km) altitudes by observing solar UV
      light attenuation by ozone during parachute descent. Rocket performed
      nominally; altitude achieved was within 10,000 f t of predicted. Instru-
       ments performed satisfactorily and good data were obtained. Parachute
       deployed properly and payload was tracked by radar and retrieved in

     in Washington Evening Star. Unlike Webb, he was new to Government,
     having come up through â€œthe scientific ranks of the sprawling General
     Electric Co. over a period of 19 years.â€ As Webbâ€™s chief deputy since
     March, Dr. Paine had been authorizing and signing major announce-
     ments but had yet to confront Congress. He and Webb saw eye-to-eye,
     he had said, on agencyâ€™s current program emphasis, which had been
    criticized as too heavily oriented to manned flight. â€œI am a very strong
     supporter of doing as much as we can in planetary areas.â€ Dr. Paine
     said, â€œbut itâ€™s one of those cases where youâ€™ve got limited resources
     and youâ€™re trying to do all the things you can. Youâ€™ve got to do things
     in aeronautics; weâ€™ve got to finish up the Apollo program; and weâ€™ve
     got to do more in earth resources (surveying them from space) here on
     this planet.â€ A lot of NASAâ€™s     future â€œis in the questions that weâ€™ll
     be raising as we continue to probe the planets.â€
        On balancing space needs against problems of cities, Dr. Paine felt
     U.S. suffered from â€œwhat I would call almost a national hypo-
     chondria . . . in many ways crippling some of the forward-looking
     things weâ€™re able to do. . . . I feel that one of the very highest prior-
     ity matters is the war on poverty and the problems of the cities. But in
     the meantime, weâ€™re making . . . a lot of progress in the civil rights
     area and really, this nation is a good deal healthier than weâ€™re giving it
     credit for today.â€ He was confident of a resurgence of public interest
     in space once the Apollo program got underway. (W Star, 9/17/68,

      lites had observed such particles rising toward space at supersonic
      speeds. They climbed vertical magnetic force lines and wound up in
     long tail which protruded from earth on side away from sun (distor-
      tion of earthâ€™s magnetic field by solar wind of charged particles flowing

 ∞   Four NAVSATS (satellites resembling comsats) in synchronous equatorial

      worldâ€™s air traffic, according to TRW Systems Div., which demonstrated
      system during Air Force Assn. meeting in Washington, D.C. Satellites
      would serve as reference points for aircraft in flight, ships at sea, or
      mechanized ground equipment and could locate userâ€™s longitude and
      latitude to accuracy within 60 f t and his altitude to within 120 ft. They
      would operate like comsats but, instead of relaying messages from
      point to point, would beam signals to aircraft. By taking bearings on
      any two satellites, computerized unit in aircraft could pinpoint air-
      craftâ€™s location by radio. Militarily, system could lead to accurate all-
      weather bombing capability and armored column movements in poor
      terrain or weather, or help infantrymen in the field. For civilian air
      traffic control, it could overlap existing equipment and eventually
      phase it out. (Lannan, W Star, 9/18/68)

∞  Washington Post commented on resignation of James E. Webb as NASA
    Administrator: â€œVirtually from scratch, with the country in a swivet
    over Soviet prowess, James E. Webb took over the Nationâ€™s feeble
    space program and drove the United States firmly into the space
               .

    and most labryrinthine engineering organization in American
                   .
    history. . . In his eight-year stewardship, NASA proceeded under
    presidential and Congressional flogging toward the goal of a manned
    lunar landing â€˜in this decade.â€™ It achieved repeated successes and but a
    single important failure-the fire that claimed the lives of three astro-
    nauts last year.
       â€œIt is characteristic of this self-effacing, organization-minded man
    that he should choose to retire now at his 62nd birthday, qractically on
    the eve of the Apollo launching-a career-capping event if ever there
    was one. His purpose is to hand NASA over to his lieutenants before the
    change of administration, on the theory that the agency will thereby
    have a better chance of riding out next yearâ€™s power transfer. The
    country is fortunate that Mr. Webb is in good health and determined to
    apply himself vigorously to further the Nationâ€™s understanding of the
    space age. For him this is far more than a matter of projectiles and
    orbits; it goes to the heart of the necessities and the aspirations of a
    great modern society.
        â€œWhereas Mr. Webb leaves NASA with its current mission adequately
     funded and its capabilities well formed, he does not leave it with a set
     mission beyond landing on the moon. This is hardly his fault. The fad-
    ing American taste for competition with the Russians in space and the
    rising competition of other claimants for Federal funds explain NASAâ€™s
    uncertain estate; its budget has been cut $1.4 billion in four
     years. . . . it will be up to the next Administration and the next
     Congress to chart Americaâ€™s future in space. That they have a choice is
    the singular achievement of Jim Webb.â€ ( W Post, 9/18/68, A22)

   fact is that America simply cannot continue to meet NASAâ€™s        ever-ex-
   panding economic demands-not, at least, without a critical weighing
   of those demands against the nationâ€™s existing domestic, diplomatic and
   military obligations. . . .
       â€œLong before the tragedy that threw the timetable into a shambles,
   the conflict between Americaâ€™s technical ability to move men into space
   and Americaâ€™s ability to pay the freight could be seen by those who
   cared to look ahead. . . . Congressional reluctance to commit the na-
   tion to further, open-ended expenditures in manned space flight is
   therefore inevitable. But equally inevitable is the dismay-and in some
   cases the bitterness-of      NASA officials. Webb and his lieutenants can
   take justifiable pride in what has been accomplished in the brief span
    of the space age. . . . They have solved problems quickly and accu-
    rately that men have never faced before. In the process, they pulled to-
   gether a scientific and technical team unequalled in the peacetime his-
   tory of this country. Now they are watching that massive army
   disband. . . .
       â€œMan will someday go to the planets and beyond. But that day must
    wait until the breakdown of nationalistic barriers makes possible a
   truly united world space program. Meanwhile, the United States should
   concentrate on the development of more sophisticated machines, less
    costly rocket systems and closer cooperation between the military and
    civilian space programs to avoid wasteful duplication. Americaâ€™s space
    effort must not end with the Apollo program. It must be diverted into
    equally exciting and frequently more rewarding channels of unmanned
    space exploration.â€ (W Star, 9/22/68, C l )

      activity in 1968, with 42 attempted launches thus far compared to 69 at
      same time in 1967, had caused similar drop in attention to detail. Sec-
      ond theory was that layoffs and turnover in launch crews had cut
       down efficiency and introduced element of inexperience. Third theory
      was that NASA was suffering from â€œa sudden case of overconfidence

      port of the DOD within the framework of their systems approach to new
      military aircraft,â€ major changes in civil aeronautics made that situa-
      tion â€œmore complicated for NASA and the nation.â€ Growth of air trans-
       portation, decline in development of military aircraft whose technology
       was directly applicable to civilian use, and ground transportationâ€™s sat-
       uration had created era in which â€œit is not simply enough to build air-
       craft which are bigger or fly â‚¬aster; rather, future advances in aeronau-

    politicians into putting up $5 billion in a year for civilian space pro-
    gram, â€œhe left many of them feeling a little guilty because they had not
    done enough.â€ Congressional opponents had charged he was overzeal-
    ous to point of dishonesty in protecting his empire at NASA. â€œSpace
    buffs were piqued because Webb continued calling the Apollo space-
    craft a â€˜capsooleâ€™ and publicly seemed to view the astronauts with child-
    like adoration. But Webb had it where it counted. President Johnson
    ranked him with Robert S. McNamara as an administrator. Influential
    Congressmen sided with him against their colleagues who challenged
    the wisdom of the space program and the quality of the Webb
    management. . . .
        â€œIf Richard Nixon is elected President, it is a dead certainty that he
    would not want to keep Webb on as NASA Administrator. Hubert Hum-
     phrey might also want his own man. But even if Webb could stay in
     the job, itâ€™s probably all for the better that he quit now. The investiga-
     tion following the Apollo accident permanently soured his relations
     with some members of Congress. One has to suspect that Webb is leav-

September 28: U.S.S.R.â€™s Zond V automatic research station had apparently
    suffered series of errors during reentry that could have been fatal if
     men had been on board, John Lannan reported in Washington Evening
     Star. According to one unidentified US. source, Zond V had entered
     atmospheie and â€œskippedâ€ back out as planned, but then skipped along
     top of atmosphere and reentered â€œat a peculiar angle.â€ Reentry caused
     g forces and heat loads that would have been fatal to crews if aboard,
     and spacecraft landed thousands of miles short of its intended landing
     area, which was probably on land in Soviet territory.
        Chicago Tribune later supported theory that Zond Vâ€™s reentry was a
    disaster and reported that US. sources said evidence indicated space-
     craft had: (1) failed to circle as close to moon as intended, and was
     thus unable to obtain useful photos of possible landing sites; (2) reen-
     tered earthâ€™s atmosphere at angle much steeper than planned, causing
     friction temperatures that would have killed cosmonauts; and (3)
     landed in water accidentally instead of in Soviet territory as planned.

     represented â€œbetter than 90% of everything we would need to carry out
     almost any mission that even the most daring have placed on our space
     agenda for the next decade.â€ Measurements made by experimental
     spacecraft plus ESSAâ€™s 24-hr-per-day operations were providing hand-
     some returns in understanding and predicting weather. â€œThis is one
     way our country says to every other country, every day, that we as a
     people want to use our new power over the forces of nature in a joint
     effort with them, with benefits to both of us, and not to threaten or to
     coerce them to follow some pattern laid down by us.â€

   Mercury and Gemini had contributed heavily to Apollo, including 16
   flights of unmanned Saturn launch vehicle which had confirmed Apollo
   engineering concepts and qualified all systems for manned missions.
   Although Apollo fire on Jan. 27, 1967, had delayed manned missions,
   it had resulted in safer spacecraft and improved suits for astronauts.
      Ahead were two manned missions for 1968 and possibly five for
   1969, culminating in landing of U.S. astronauts on moon. Facilities at
   NASA installations in US. were worth more than $2.5 billion and peak
   35,000 staff included some of Nationâ€™s top scientists. Industrial work
   force had peaked at 4.00,OOO and was dropping to 200,000. NASA had
   established global tracking network capable of communicating with ve-
   hicles as far away as far side of sun. Its aeronautics program con-
   ducted R&D on noise abatement, flight safety, supersonic and hypersonic

   John Lannan commented on NASAâ€™s         10th anniversary:
   agencyâ€™s real promise for improving the general welfare of mankind as
   set forth in the Space Act which brought it into being has apparently
   been too slow in being fulfilled. The fact that the space investment is
   only now starting to pay off, and at an increasingly rapid pace, is
   going unnoticed in the glare of present problems, past mishaps and the
   imminence of the Apollo venture. Where NASAâ€™s goals lie are in the
                                                     real
   future-the near future and the near earth. Spin-off, the serendipity of
   technology, has long been used as a justification for the vast sums
   poured into space, but little beyond Teflon-coated frying pans have im-
   pinged on the tax-payerâ€™s mind.â€ (W Star, 9/29/68, A l )

    one to measure bending of light from distant source as it passed an

    from newly discovered quasars to determine amount of bending they
    underwent in passing the sun. If light, in form of quasar radiowaves,
    was bent, Einstein theory would receive added support; if it was not

    meant limitation of use of N 1969 appropriations to $3.85 billion, Dr.
    Paine said. â€œOur actions also have had to be constrained by our cur-
    rent instructions within the Executive Branch to hold expenditures to a
    minimum in 1970 as well as in 1969, and to be prepared for the even-
    tuality of budgetary limitations in FY 1970 even more restrictive than
    those in N 1969. I am personally convinced that the nationâ€™s space
    program requires an increase in funding in FY 1970 and I am
    hopeful . . . we will succeed in establishing the need for a significant
    increase. Until this decision is made . . . we have no alternative but to
    proceed with an interim operating plan . . . which, where possible,
    holds open options we can exercise in FY 1970 if the budget is higher
    but which does not overcommit us if the FY 1970 budget is lower.â€
        Plan retained $2.025 billion authorized for Apollo program-$14
    million below budget request. It reduced authorized $253.2 million for
    Apollo Applications to $150 million, amount â€œrequired to work toward
    the important but sharply limited and deferred Apollo Applications
    program we now propose.â€ This would include cessation of Saturn IB
    launch vehicle production after completion of 1 t (Saturn 214) and

    discontinuation of Saturn V at completion of first 15 vehicles. Single
     Saturn I workshop and single Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) would
     be launched in early 1970s. Authorized $5 million for advanced mis-
     sions would be cut to $2.5 million, for continued studies related to
     manned earth-orbital and lunar missions. Authorized $136.9 million
     would be reduced to $132.1 million for physics and astronomy, with
     level of effort in supporting research and technology and data analysis
     approximately 10% lower than in FY 1968.
        The $92.3 million authorized for lunar and planetary exploration
     would be cut to $75.8 million, with $6.8 million for lunar and $69 mil-
    lion for planetary-to support Mariner-Mars 1969 mission, reacquisi-
    tion of telemetry from Mariner V, and Mariner-Mars 1971 mission.
     Plan also supported in FY 1969, at reduced funding level, capability to
    conduct Mars mission during 1973 opportunity in keeping with NAS
     recommendation [see Sept. 191. Overall scope of mission would be re-
     duced and schedule compressed. Operating plan provided for construc-
     tion of two 210-ft antennas for Mars and other missions during 1970s.

     mo in 21-day Biosatellite missions.
         Space applications authorization of $98.7 million would be retained ;
     program change necessitated by May 18 destruction of Nimbus B
     would result in launch of replacement, Nimbus B2, in spring 1969.

     budget would be reduced from $289.8 million authorized to $280 mil-
     lion, providing full Apollo schedule support but limiting support for
     spacecraft aloft and on future missions.
         Construction of facilities funds had been reduced from $39.6 million
      authorized to $21.8 million appropriated. Operating plan would in-
      crease figure to $35.7 million by transferring funds from R&D appropri-
      ation. Facility planning and design funds were reduced from $3 million
      requested to $1 million. Interim operating plan anticipated transfer of
      $20.1 million from R&D to administrative operations, bringing total to
      $623.3 million instead of $603.2 million in authorization and appropri-
      ations acts and $648.2 million requested by NASA in budget. Dr. Paine
      emphasized that administrative operations appropriation did not cover
      only â€œadministrativeâ€ expenses; it covered direct costs of operating
      NASA laboratories, research centers, development centers, and launch
      centers.
         NASA Administrator James E. Webb told Committee: â€œ. . . when you
      use words such as â€˜Congress consistently has supported the Apollo pro-
      gram,, you must add â€˜at a minimum level.â€™ We have clearly indicated in
      every budget that the basis on which we were going forward with this
      support by Congress was one that did not take into account unusual
      risks and happenings and was, in effect, based on success in all these
      efforts.â€ Webb said NASA Apollo funding was related to success on vari-
      ous operations and did not include â€œa return to test flight on the Saturn
      IB should we not be able to make the shift to the big rocket after this
      next flight.â€ From 1961 to 1969, Webb said, â€œwe have not had the
      funds to proceed except in a manner that would permit us, within the
      total budget, to do this lunar landing within this decade and on an all-up
      systems test basis. So the excruciatingly painful period of all-up testing
      on the Saturn V is yet ahead of us.â€ (Testimony; Transcript)

      Murray wrote in Science. Soviet descriptions of Zond V suggested
      U.S.S.R. might plan to send pair of spacecraft to Mars in late February
      or early March. One might land on Mars and cast off satellite to orbit
      it and relay signals to earth; other might fly by Mars and return to
      earth with film of Mars surface. Speculations were based on Pravda
      and Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) articles by Soviet Prof. A. Dmitriyev,
      which said â€œinformation from spaceâ€ must be delivered â€œdirectly to the
      scientistsâ€™ laboratoryâ€ free of â€œencumbrances and distortions of ra-
      dioed signals.â€ He said Zond Y had successfully completed assignment
      of developing means and methods for returning space devices. Also,
      U.S.S.R. had previously sent pair of spacecraft on planetary mission
      and might repeat mission to take advantage of favorable Mars or
      Venus positions for flyby or landing attempts. (Science, 10/11/68,

      Reports to Congress covering July 1, 1966, to Dec. 31, 1967. President

      lieve, concrete evidence that NASA is moving forward, and that America
      is contributing mightily in the worldwide effort to conquer space for
      the benefit of all mankind.â€
         In letter accompanying 17th report, NASA Administrator James E.
      Webb wrote, â€œThis period was overshadowed by the Apollo fire which
      took the lives of three of our astronauts. The thorough investigation of
      the accident and the steps that were initiated to improve safety by
      changes in design and procedures have previously been made matters of
      public record. This report shows that the same period was also one of
      progress in aeronautics and space as evidenced, for example, by the
      successful flights of Surveyor, Lunar Orbiter, and many other space-
      craft. It was a difficult time for NASA, but one in which the agency
      showed, I believe, that it could react maturely to failure as well as suc-
      cess, and continue to deserve the confidence and support of the nation.â€

∞  Comparison of infrared images of lunar eclipses of Dec. 19, 1964, and
    April 13, 1968, showed thermal anomalies of lunar maria unchanged
    after 3y2 yr, Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories researchers
    reported in Science. Graham R. Hunt, John W. Salisbury, and Robert
    K. Vincent wrote that hundreds of hot spots that cooled more slowly
    than surroundings were strikingly similar in images from both eclipses.
    One new, linear thermal anomaly had been discovered, whose close re-
    lation to lunar crustal fracture line suggested it might be of internal
    origin. Origin could give clue to formation of craters. (Science,

    October 11-22: NASAâ€™s                    Apolb 7 (A!3-205), first manned mission in Apollo

    lunar landing program, was successfully launched from KSC Launch
    Complex 34 at 11:02 am EDT by Saturn IB booster. Primary objectives
    were to demonstrate command and service module (CSM) and crew
    performance; demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support fa-
    cilities ; and demonstrate CSM rendezvous capability. All launch events
    occurred as planned and spacecraft, carrying Astronauts Walter M.
     Schirra, Jr. (commander), Donn F. Eisele (CM pilot), and R. Walter
     Cunningham (LM pilot) , entered initial orbit with 177.8-mi (286.1-km)
     apogee, 138.2-mi (222.4km) perigee, 89.9-min period, and 31.6â€™ incli-
     nation. Saturn IB 2nd stage (S-IVB) manned control test was com-
    pleted with excellent results, and S-IVB separated from CSM on sched-
     ule. Crew successfully transposed CSM and simulated docking by
     maneuvering CSM to within four or five feet of S-IVB.
       President Johnson sent message to Apollo 7 crew: â€œEverything in
    the Presidential office came to a halt as Foreign Minister Debr6 of
    France and I watched with mounting excitement the magnificent
    launch of the Saturn. . . .â€ Message was relayed from Air Force I as
     President flew from Washington to visit former President Harry S.
    Truman.
       On second day Schirra told ground controllers crew was too busy to
    set up portable camera for live TV coverage because of minor but
    time-consuming difficulties. Astronauts had to pump waste water manu-
    ally from spacecraft, Schirra and Eisele had trouble with their biomedi-
    cal harnesses, Schirra had head cold symptoms, spacecraft evaporator

   system required maintenance, and hatch windows blurred and were
   bordered by mysterious â€œsmall hairs like fuzz.)â€™ Crew fired SPS engine
   for 10 sec and 8 sec to set up rendezvous and maneuvered CSM to
   within 70 ft of tumbling spent 2nd stage, simulating techniques to be
   used on future flights if LM were to become disabled in lunar orbit.
   Crew took close-up photos of LM adapter attached to 2nd stage. S-IVB
   reentered earthâ€™s atmosphere Oct. 18 and splashed into Indian Ocean.
      On third day crew, which had already accomplished half its objec-
   tives, photographed clouds and earth and continued checking out space-
   craft systems. Power failure in spacecraftâ€™s AC electrical system was
   quickly restored, but overloading prompted officials to reschedule third
   SPS burn 20 hr sooner than planned. Burn positioned and sized ellipse
   for CM reaction control system deorbit in case of emergency and set up
   auxiliary gaging system test. Astronauts, all with head colds, appeared
   on national TV for 7 min for first time live from space. Crew displayed
   hand-printed signs bearing greetings from â€œthe lovely Apollo room
   high atop everything.â€
      Second live telecast for 11 min Oct. 15 showed closeups of spacecraft
   interior and astronauts so clear that observers could read astronautsâ€™
   lips. Third TV appearance Oct. 16, which included nine-minute tour of
   spacecraft, won astronauts honorary membership in American Federa-
   tion of Television and Radio Artists. Later, crew successfully fired SPS
   engine for fourth burn, demonstrating 20,500-lb-thrust engineâ€™s mini-
   mum impulse capability. As spacecraft passed over Hurricane Gladys
   in Gulf Qf Mexico, astronauts photographed storm and relayed data to
   Weather Bureau hurricane center. They also took pictures of â€œlong
   plumeâ€ of air pollution. Crew continued spacecraft checkout, guidance
   and navigation procedures, and TV operations on seventh day, but
   fourth telecast was smudgy. Successful 67-sec fifth SPS burn-longest to
   date-was performed out of plane to test auxiliary gaging system and
   readjust ellipse for lifetime and CM reaction control system deorbit.
      On ninth day astronauts showed viewers exceptionally sharp pictures
   of main control panels in fifth TV broadcast and performed close-order
   drill to demonstrate movement in weightless environment. Sixth SPS
   burn, essentially duplicate of fourth minimum impulse test burn, was
   successfully conducted. Seventh burn, on following day, adjusted time
   phasing for backup SM reaction-control-system deorbit burns. At
   259:39 GET astronauts fired SPS engine for eighth time, to deorbit CSM
   for reentry. CM/SM separation, parachute deployment, and other reen-
   try events were nominal, and spacecraft splashed down in Atlantic
   eight miles north of recovery ship U.S.S. Essex at 7:11 am EDT Oct. 22
   after completing 163 revolutions. Crew was picked up by helicopter
   and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown.
      All primary Apollo 7 mission objectives were achieved, as well as
   every detailed test objective and three not originally planned. Crew com-
   fort and safety were enhanced by change in cabin atmosphere to 100%
   oxygen in flight, hot meals, and relatively complete freedom of motion in
   spacecraft. Engineering accomplishments included live TV from space
   and drinking water produced as by-product of fuel cells. NASAâ€™s I11Ats
   applications technology satellite relayed TV pictures to Europe. Service
   module SPS main engine, largest thrust engine to be manually thrust-
   vector controlled, proved itself by accomplishing longest and shortest

     manned SPS burns, and largest number of inflight restarts. Manual
     tracking, navigation, and control achievements included full optical
     rendezvous, daylight platform realignment, optical platform alignments,
     pilot control of launch vehicle attitude, and orbital determination by
     sextant tracking of another vehicle. Mission also accomplished first
     digital-sutopilot-controlled engine burn and first manned S-band com-
     munications.
        All launch vehicle systems performed satisfactorily; spacecraft sys-
     tems functioned with some minor anomalies, countered by backup sub-
     system, change in procedures, isolation, or careful monitoring so that
     no loss of systems support resulted.
        Apollo 7 spacecraft had been redesigned for safety. Original two-
     piece side hatch had been replaced by a quick-opening, one-piece hatch.
     Flammability within CM had been reduced by extensive materials sub-
     stitution, and systems redundancy had been expanded to reduce single
     failure points. Saturn IB launch vehicle carried less telemetry and in-
     strumentation equipment, to lower weight and increase payload capa-
     bility. New propellant lines to augmented spark igniter had been in-
     stalled in J-2 engine to prevent failure which had occurred on Apollo
     6.      I

October 12: Washington Post editorial noted total cost of space program to
    date was upwards of $20 billion: â€œThe expenditure of sums of money
    like these cannot be justified in terms of the military or civilian spin-
    off, although both have been substantial, or of the knowledge we have
    gained about the atmosphere surrounding our planet. But they can be
    justified in terms of the national prestige that is to be won or lost in
    space and of the inevitable fate of man to pursue knowledge towards its
    ultimate end in hope of some day achieving a better understanding of
    what the earth and universe are all about. It is in this latter hope that
    we cheer the astronauts on, wish them well in their planned 163 orbits
    of the earth, pray for their safe return, and urge those who make the
    crucial decisions about the future space program to proceed with all
    deliberate speed to reach the goal President Kennedy put before us.â€

    ill Research Range to obtain data on variation of temperature, pres-
    sure, and wind profile by detonating 19 grenades per rocket at pre-
    scribed times and recording sound arrivals on ground. Rockets reached
    78.8-mi (126.8-km) and 77.8-mi (123.5-km) altitudes and performed
    nominally. Sound arrivals were recorded from all grenades. Data would
    be compared with data from Oct. 14 Point Barrow, Alaska, launches.

October 27: Lightweight plastic foam invented by ARC scientists Dr. John
    A. Parker and Salvatore Riccitiello showed promise for industrial fire
    protection, particularly fuel fires. Extremely light polyurethane with ad-
    ditives formed tough, protective char layer when exposed to flame,
    while simultaneously releasing fire-extinguishing gases which helped to
    quench flame. Used to fill airspaces within structures, foam would pre-
     vent oxygen from reaching and feeding a fire. Demonstrations had
    shown it suitable for fire protection in aircraft, spacecraft, homes, and
     other structures. Other possible uses included automobiles, boats, trains,
     oil refineries, paint and chemical processing, and laboratories. Foam was
     resistant to heat flow, making it an excellent insulator. (NASA Release

    the solar system and on to the surface of the nearest of the many mys-
    terious worlds that surround us in space.â€ Noting that Apollo 7 had
    logged more than 780 man-hours in space-more than had been logged
    â€œin all Soviet manned flights to dateâ€-and had accomplished 56 mis-
    sion objectives, as many â€œin this one flight as were accomplished in the
     first five manned flights o i the Gemini spacecraft,â€ he said: â€œThis is
    not important as either a game or a contest. But it is important because
    the United States of America must be first in technology if it is to con-
    tinue its position in the world. I believe today, as I did when we had
     our original hearings that created the Space Administration, that the
    United States must be first.â€
        President read citation, presenting Medal to Webb for â€œoutstanding
    leadership of Americaâ€™s space program from 1961 to 1968. . . . More
    than any other individual he deserves the credit for the great achieve-
     ments of the United States in the first decade of space, and for helping
     man to reach outward toward the stars.â€
        Webb responded: â€œThe citation and medal . . . should, in my view,
     be converted into some kind of holographic substance so it could be
     divided into thousands of parts . . . and each part should really go to
     an outstanding person in NASA, in our scientific group, working in our

      of the federal government.â€ Boeing Co. was scrapping swing-wing con-
     cept on SST in favor of fixed-wing and â€œword seeped out of the Penta-
      gon that a real fight has developed over whether to cut back production
      of . . . F-lll.â€ How were such mistakes to be prevented in future?
      â€œOne lesson that emerges . . . is that the government must learn to
      avoid premature commitment to any huge-scale project. . . . Another
      lesson is that in such major decisions, an independent, technologically
      competent judgment should be brought to bear on the issue. On the
      F-111, the Presidentâ€™s Science Advisory Council did not even look at
      the design features of the aircraft. On the SST, a Special Presidential
      Advisory Committee was set up, but it was chaired by [then Secretary
      of Defense Robert S.] McNamara and was dominated by top Adminis-
      tration officials. Such changes in procedures may not wipe out all mis-
      takes, but they could greatly reduce the chances of astronomically

      Program of Research: 1968-1975, report of NASA-supported study by
       31 scientists at Woods Hole, Mass., Aug. 11-24. Report, dated October
      and fourth by Board to provide guidance for NASAâ€™s programs in space
      physics, said results of decade of research by artificial satellites were
       â€œrevolutionary; few of the concepts of the early 1950â€™s have survived
      without major revision and totally unexpected discoveries have pro-
      vided fundamentally new theoretical challenges.â€ And â€œresults of to-
      dayâ€™s space research on the physics of the Earth in space become the
      engineering design data of tomorrowâ€™s civilian and defense applications
      programs.â€
         Report defined program of satellite, space-probe, and sounding
      rocket missions for concerted attack on questions of fundamental physi-
      cal mechanisms of sun-earth system, in contrast to past decadeâ€™s explor-
      atory surveys. It emphasized coordinated investigations, new experi-
      mental techniques, and major observation effort during 1974-1975 low
      solar activity. Recommendations included continued NASA support for
      balloon, aircraft, and ground-based observations and of advanced de-
      velopment of spacecraft instruments; better means of data handling
      and adequate support for data analysis; and restoration of NASA pro-

    Venus ZV (launched June 12, 1967) had reported atmospheric condi-
   tions near level of mean surface of planet. Von R. Eshleman and Gun-
   nar Fjeldbo of Stanford Univ., John D. Anderson and Arvydas J.
   Kliore of JPL, and Rolf B. Dyce of Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory
    (Puerto Rico) had made new determination of radius of planet, based
   on concurrent ranging from earth to Mariner V near encounter and to
   surface of Venus. Extrapolations of measurements had given surface
   values for mid-latitudes of close to 100 atmospheres pressure and
   700Â°K temperature (within 100â€), rather than Soviet values of 1 9 2 2
   atmospheres and 544â€&10â€K. Soviet probe apparently was not de-
   signed to work through such thick atmosphere. Simple ambiguity
    (times two) in Venus ZV altimeter reading could explain supposition
   that probe reached Venus surface, â€œsince this would bring all other
   data into excellent agreement.â€ (Science, 11/8/68,661-5)

    knowledge not only outward, but earthward, too. Astronauts were
    â€œlooking at portions of the earth that had never been documented be-
     fore. A crew can see something and respond to it, on earth or the
    moon.â€ Fellow Apollo 7 crewman R. Walter Cunningham said never

∞  In New York Times Walter Sullivan described â€œThe Sun-Spot Menace to
    Astronauts.â€ Apollo 7 and U.S.S.R.â€™s Soyuz ZZZ served as reminders
    that sunspots were reaching their 11-yr peak. If eruptions were particu-
    larly severe, protons were hurled out at almost speed of light. These
    could penetrate spacecraft. While Apollo 7 astronauts were never in
    danger, Soviet spacecraft placed in orbits reaching north beyond lati-
    tude 51â€ might â€œnudge zoneâ€ within which protons ejected by sun
    â€œrain fiercely on the atmosphere.â€ Major flare had occurred Oct. 30
    just after Soyuz IZI returned to earth. If astronauts had been in orbit
    -particularly if they had been outside spacecraft-they could have
    been subjected to hazardous radiation. Many warnings preceded this
    event. For moon journey it should be possible to postpone or cut short
    flight if sun looked ominous. In any miscalculation, radiation exposure
    to astronauts inside spacecraft would be severe only during most in-
    tense outbursts. However, on prolonged journeys to other planets there
    would be no escape. â€œIt may therefore be necessary to design the space-
    craft so that a portion of its interior will be shielded from such radia-
    tion.â€ (NYT, 11/10/68, 7E)
November 10-17: Zond VI automatic space station was successfully
    launched by U.S.S.R. and placed on lunar trajectory from parking
    orbit of another satellite to explore outer space and test spacecraft sys-
    tems, Tass announced. All equipment was functioning normally. Specu-
    lation, later confirmed, was that spacecraft would attempt to circle
    moon on same route taken by Zond V Sept. 15-21. On Nov. 14 Tass
     announced that Zond VI had circled moon at minimum distance of
    2,420 km (1,503.8 mi) and had conducted studies of physical charac-
     teristics of near lunar space before continuing its journey back to
    earth.
        Zond VZ reentered and softlanded in a predetermined area in Central
     Asia Nov. 17. Unlike Zond V , which had plunged directly through
     upper atmosphere, Zond VI skipped across outer layers of atmosphere
     to reduce its reentry speed and then resumed its descent with aerody-
     namic forces. Announcing recovery, Tass said Zond VI had for first time
     tested a â€œmore complex and promising method of the return of space-
     craft from interplanetary trajectories-the method of controlled descent
     with the use of aerodynamical lifting force (aerodynamical quality) of
     the descending craft. . . .
        â€œThe braking of the descending apparatus in the atmosphere . . .
     was effected along a trajectory with two immersions in the atmosphere.
     During the first immersion . . . the second cosmic speed . . . [ll km
     per sec, 24,607 mph] was reduced to 7.6 kilometers a second (17,000
     mph) through aerodynamical braking. In doing so, the descending ap-
     paratus . . . was oriented through the onboard control system in such a
     way that it, passing through the dense layers of the atmosphere, left
     them and next continued along the ballistic trajectory until the second
                  ..
     immersion .       [in which] the further lowering of the descending ap-
     paratus was also effected along the trajectory of controlled descent with
     the use of aerodynamical qualities which ensured its return to the
     Earth in the pre-set district.â€

    be placed on dependability of life support and electric power systems
    and mission would have to take on additional risks, Gen. Phillips said,

    cargo aircrait might be â€œ100% above the original estimateâ€ of $1.279
    billion for Lockheed Aircraft Corp. airframes. General Electric Co. esti-
    mate of $459 million for engines was not expected to double. Increase
    resulted from rise in manufacturing costs, higher subcontracting prices,
    and rising administrative costs, rather than gross original underesti-
    mate, although there was probably some original underestimate by
    Lockheed. DOD was weighing all factors before deciding action on op-
    tion for 62 additional M A S which would expire Jan. 31, 1969.

 ∞ NASA released plans for lunar landing experiments. First U.S. astronauts
    to land on moon in 1969 would place three scientific experiments on
    lunar surface instead of more complex Apollo Lunar Surface Experi-
    ments Package (ALSEP) originally planned. Change was necessitated by
    uncertainties in workload required to deploy ALSEP by astronauts in
    pressurized suits on moonâ€™s surface. Missionâ€™s primary objective would
    be to prove Apollo system by achieving successful moon landing and
    safe return to earth. During first landing, two astronauts would leave
    spacecraft for up to three hours on moonâ€™s surface, making observa-
    tions and photographing area in vicinity of landed spacecraft, collect-
    ing soil and rock samples, and deploying experiments.
       Scientific and medical data would be obtained on expenditure of as-

November 20: NASA successfully launched two Nike-Cajun sounding rockets
     to 74.6-mi (120-km) and 70.6-mi (113.6-km) altitudes to obtain data
     on variation of temperature, pressure, and wind profile by detonating
     grenades at prescribed times and recording sound arrivals on ground.
     Rockets and instruments performed satisfactorily; sound arrivals were
     recorded from 19 grenades on each rocket. Data would be compared
     with data from launches from NASA Wallops Station and Point Barrow,
     Alaska. (NASA Rpts SRL)
∞  NASA Acting Administrator Dr. Thomas 0. Paine in speech before AIA
      Fall Conference in Phoenix, Ariz., said, â€œToday the United States stand
     at the crossroads.â€ In FY 1969 NASA was operating close to â€œbreakpointyy
     level. Below $4-billion budget level, NASA could no longer â€œhold
      together our hard-won capabilities and utilize them effectively in
     critical programs; some of them would have to be dropped entirely.â€
      Budget aEwe $4 billion would â€œnot only allow us to . . . carry for-
                                                     ..
      ward major programs, but might permit .              modest investments
      aimed at reducing costs of future space activities.â€
         Pointing to â€œlong-term results of the tremendous technological effort
      . . . mounted during World War 11â€ and â€œstill being exploited today,â€
      Dr. Paine urged that as â€œwe tackle grave social ills, weâ€™ve got to con-
      tinue to forge ahead in other areas.â€™We must worry about how we
      create new wealth as much as we do about how we better distribute
      todayâ€™s wealth. It would be an international tragedy if America were to
      turn back now from its forward thrust in space at the end of an aston-
      ishingly productive first decade.â€

    existing boosters but far more economical, â€œmeans a fresh approach to
    the entire concept of boosters and a critical examination of each step
     . . . from the drawing board to the end of the boost operation.â€ NASA
     was recommending that NERVA engine development be continued with

 ∞ NASA Deputy Administrator for Space Sciences and Applications Oran
    W. Nicks described applications of Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter tech-
    niques to Mars exploration before AIAA meeting in Washington, D.C.
    Two 1971 Marinez Orbiter missions would provide new tools for sur-
    vey of dynamic Mars, arriving when most striking seasonal changes
    were evident in Southern Hemisphere. Their combined orbits and life
    expectancies would allow observations of dynamic changes in clouds
    and surface features over several months. In 1973, two additional orbit-
    ers would survey Mars from different orbits during different seasons,
    with support of landing mission as prime requirement. Also planned
    for 1973 was survivable landing spacecraft to make local measurements
     of environment, photograph surface and topography, and analyze soil.

         Burning question of immediate concern to you and me will be ad-

    Has life existed on nearby planets and disappeared for any reason?
     Can nearby planets be made suitable for life?â€™ Together, orbiters and
    landers form a powerful team for the study of Mars and for seeking

    spacecraft. Ion, or electrical engines, producing thrust of less than 20
    micropounds, had been fired for total 23 hr and perfprmed perfectly-
    Ion engines for future spacecraft were ideal systems for countering
    gravitational attraction between spacecraft, moon and sun, and ellipti-

    create radio frequency interference. Test showed no interference. Two
    more ion engines were planned for testing aboard ATS-E, scheduled for

       Primary mission objective was to demonstrate flight operation to
    support two experiments provided by Smithsonian Astrophysical Ob-
    servatory and Univ. of Wisconsin for at least 30 days. Secondary ob-
    jective was to obtain scientific data over a range of star magnitudes
    and wavelengths for at least 50 hr. Experiments would observe inter-
    stellar dust and extremely young hot stars in UV portion of spectrum
    not visible to human eye or earth-based observatories. Satellite would
    he able to collect six hours of UV data per day-twice as much as had
    been obtained in 15 yr from 40 sounding rocket launches. Through its
    complex ground-command spacecraft-attitude system Oao IZ would be
     aimed at individual objects in space with precision never before at-
    tained by an orbiting satellite. Information from experiments would be
     radioed to earth as digital data for analysis by experimenters.

        In NASA-USAF-USN program initiated in 1954, flights by three X-15
     aircraft manufactured by North American Rockwell Corp. had included
     more than 82 min of flight at speeds exceeding mach 5 and total flight

December 21-27: NASAâ€™s
    Apollo lunar landing program and first manned mission to orbit moon,
    was successfully launched from KSC Launch Complex 39 at 7:51 am
    EST by Saturn V booster. Primary objectives were to demonstrate crew,
    space vehicle, and mission support performance during manned Saturn
    V mission with command and service module (CSM) and to demonstrate
    performance of nominal and selected backup lunar orbit rendezvous
     (LOR) mission activities-including   translunar injection ; CSM naviga-
    tion, communications, and midcourse corrections ; and CSM consumables
    assessment and passive thermal control. All launch events occurred as
    planned and spacecraft-carrying       Astronauts Frank Borman (com-
    mander), James A. Lovell, Jr. ( CM pilot), and Willam A. Anders (LM
    pilot)--entered initial orbit with 118.4-mi (190.6-h) apogee, 113.8-mi
     (183.2-km) perigee, 32.51O inclination, and 88.2-min period.
       At 10:42 am EST 3rd stage burned for second time, injecting space-
    craft into lunar trajectory, and astronauts began journey to become
    first men to leave earthâ€˜s gravitational field. Stage and instrument unit
    separated as planned and service module propulsion system was fired
    to increase separation distance from 3rd stage, which was trailing
    500-1,000 ft behind spacecraft, spewing unused propellants. Crew fired
    service propulsion system (SPS) engine for 2.4 sec, correcting trajec-
    tory and increasing velocity by 25 fps.
       Second midcourse maneuver, scheduled for second day, was can-
    celed because trajectory was already so accurate that burn would have
    required velocity change of only 0.7 fps. Borman reported illness, ap-
    parently from 24hr intestinal virus or from reaction to sleeping pills
    being used during space flight for first time, and Lovell and Anders
    reported nausea. Crew took navigation sightings and conducted first
    TV transmission, showing spacecraft interior and earth from 138,690-mi
    altitude and demonstrating food preparation and movements in weight-
    lessness. Signals were received at ground stations and transmitted to
    NASA Mission Control Center in Houston before release live to com-
    mercial networks.
       Second TV transmission, on third day, showed excellent pictures
     of earth from 201,365-mi altitude, including view of Western Hemis-
    phere in sunlight. Crew pointed out North Pole, South America, Cape

   cloudy. Earth, they said, was beautiful; water looked royal blue, land
   areas brown, and clouds bright white. Reflection off earth was much
   greater than off moon. SM reaction control systemâ€™s four rockets were
   fired for 12 sec to reduce velocity by 2 fps and to make approach to
   moon closer to 60 mi at nearest point.
      On fourth day, Christmas Eve, communications were interrupted as
   Apollo 8 passed behind moon and astronauts became first men to see
   moonâ€™s far side. SPS engine was fired for 4 min 2 see, reducing speed
   by 2,994 ips and placing spacecraft in lunar orbit with 193.6-mi
    (310.6-km) apolune and 69.1-mi (111.2-km) perilune. In third
   telecast Anders described lunar surface as â€œwhitish gray, like dirty
   beach sand with lots of footprints on it. Some of these craters look
   like pick-axes striking concrete, creating a lot of fine dust.â€ After
   spacecraft passed behind moon at end of second revolution, SPS engine
   burned for 10 sec to reduce speed by 135 fps and to circularize orbit with
   70.0-mi (112.6-km) apolune and 69.6-mi (112.0-km) perilune. Love11
   said astronauts had â€œa grand viewâ€ of the lunar surface and confirmed
   that prospective landing sites were satisfactory. He reported that at
   about two minutes before sunrise a fan-shaped white haze appeared just
   behind moonâ€™s Iimb. Crew continued landmark sightings and named
   numerous unnamed lunar features after other astronauts, NASA officials,
   and friends. They conducted communications experiment which showed
   that radio signal from earth to Apollo 8 and back to earth took three
   seconds to make 460,000-mi round trip.
      Third TV transmission during ninth revolution showed heavily im-
   pacted mountains described by Anders as â€œa vastness of black and white,
   absolutely no color. The sky up here is also rather forbidding, forebod-
   ing extents of blackness with no stars visible when we5-e flying over the
   moon in daylight. You can see by the numerous craters that this planet
   has been bombarded through the eons with numerous small asteroids
   and meteoroids, pock-marking the surface of every square inch. And one
   of the amazing features of the surface is . . . that most of the craters
     ..
    . have a round mound type of appearance instead of sharp jagged
   rocks. All, only the newest of features have any sharp definitions to
   them, and eventually they get eroded down by the constant bombardment
   of small meteoroids.â€ The moon is â€œa very dark and unappetizing

   place. . .
      Crew read verses from first chapter of Genesis and wished viewers
   â€œgood night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of
   you-all of you on the good earth.â€
      On fifth day, Christmas Day, while spacecraft was behind moon
   completing its 10th revolution, SPS engine was fired for 3 min 23 sec,
   increasing spacecraft velocity by 3,523 fps and propelling ApolZo 8
   back toward earth. Spacecraft left lunar gravity at 201,807 mi above
   earth. At 104 hours mission elapsed time 14-sec reaction-control-system
   burn increased velocity by 5 fps. Fifth TV transmission showed space-
   craft interior, controls, and food preparation. Data analysis revealed
   sixth midcourse correction would not be necessary because of accuracy
    of course. Astronauts reported they had slept well and were in â€œvery
   good shape.â€ Sixth TV transmission showed earth from 112,125-mi
   altitude.

December 22: New York Times commented on Apollo 8 flight: â€œSpace con-
    tains more than enough opportunity for fruitful application of the ener-
    gies that all mankind can devote to its exploration, development and
    eventual settlement. There is no need here for wasteful rivalry deriving
    from earthbound nationalistic and political ambitions. In the face of
    the most breathtaking challenge humanity has ever faced, the only ra-
    tional response is cooperation to make space an arena of unity and in-
    ternational brotherhood. Manâ€™s hopes and prayers ride with the pre-
    Christmas voyagers. After them must come ships bearing the United
    Nations flag, each carrying men of different citizenship, language, polit-
    ical and religious convictions and color.â€ (NYT, 12/22/68, E10)
∞ New York Academy of Sciences investigative committee of 22 members
    directed â€œpreliminary reportâ€ to President Johnson, President-elect
    Richard M. Nixon, and Congress on intensifying crisis in US. science
    and education which they said stemmed from cuts in Federal Govern-
    ment support. Investigation covering 84 academic institutions and work
    of 193 research scientists had shown â€œpotential solutions of such prob-
    lems as poverty, racial discrimination, population control, air and
    water pollution, cancer and cardiovascular disease, mental illness, mass
    transportation, housing and education are not being pursued because of
    lack of continuing support.â€ Committee recommended diverting Fed-
    eral science funds earmarked for buildings and other capital equipment
    to use on research programs and in training scientific manpower to
    â€œpreclude a serious shortage in the near future, a crippling one within
    five years.â€™â€™ (UPI, W Post, 12/23/68, ,420)

    ual evidence they provided of manâ€™s successful entrance into a com-
     pletely new realm, one which poses challenges, opportunities and dan-
     gers such as the human species has never before faced. And yesterdayâ€™s
     pictures provided a sobering perspective on manâ€™s puny earthly works

∞  U.S.S.R. announced through Tass successful completion of experiment in
    which three researchers spent from Nov. 5, 1967, to Nov. 5, 1968, in
     isolated chamber consisting of living compartment and greenhouse
     linked to outside world by videotelephone. Purpose of experiment was
     to test manâ€™s ability to live in isolation for year, using water and oxy-
     gen regenerated from waste products and dehydrated food supple-
     mented by greenhouse-grown vegetables; study effects of various fac-
     tors on human organism and establish optimum conditions for long
     isolation ; and evaluate effectiveness of self-contained life-support sys-
     tems based on regeneration of waste products. Daily requirements of
     astronauts on long voyage included 700 g of food, 2.4 kg of drinking
     water plus 5.5 kg of water for other purposes, and 800 g of oxygen,
     amounting to 1 tons of supplies for one-year space voyage. Report said

      wondered on his way to the moon whether, if he were a traveller from
      another planet, he would think that intelligent life existed on Earth.
      The answer, from Captain Lovell at least, is that our planet is â€˜a grand
      oasis in the great vastness of space.â€™ That is an awing insight and it

∞  Times of India termed Apollo 8, â€œthe most magnificent achievement in
    space to date.â€ It was â€œby any reckoning a tremendous achievement of
    science and technologyâ€ and â€œdecidedly the most daring adventure man
    has ever undertaken.â€™ (Times of India, 12/26/68, 8)
∞ In Washington Post, columnist Joseph Kraft said post-Apollo programs
    had been sharply cut in Congress and space spending had been com-
    pared unfavorably with money for pressing internal needs. â€œIn this sit-
    uation, it makes sense for this country to disengage while it is ahead.
    There is no need for the United States to race Russia to every new
    milestone in space. On the contrary, what the United States wants is a
    program closely connected to explicit American requirements-a pro-
    gram of exploration for its own sake, not for the sake of beating the
    Russians. In that way, this country can continue to develop a capability
    in space, without having to respond in a panic to the ups and downs
    that are necessary part of the space business.â€ ( W Post, 12/26/68)
December 26-31: During 135th meeting of AAAS in Dallas, Tex., Catholic
    Univ. of America assistant professor of international relations John M.
    Logsdon gave paper on lunar landing decision at session of Society for
    the History of Technology. Prof. Logsdon said President Eisenhower
    had planned to end manned space flights after Project Mercury but his
    successor, President Kennedy, had â€œcalculated the costs, weighed the
    needs, and finally decided that â€˜whatever mankind must undertake, free
    men must fully share.â€™ â€
       Outgoing Presidential Science Adviser, Dr. Donald F. Hornig, rec-
    ommended reexamination of concept of Federal Dept. of Science since
    science â€œhas now assumed such importance to the nation that its posi-
    tion would be stronger if it had a voice in the Cabinet.â€ He advocated
    annual report on state of science similar to annual economic report and
    said Office o i Science and Technology â€œcould eventually evolve in an
    office of planning and analysis, looking broadly at national problems
    with some scientific or technological component, but extending well be-
    yond the purely technical areas.â€ Under questioning, Dr. Hornig said
    he agreed with Dr. J. Herbert Hollomon, President of Univ. of Okla-
    homa and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce, that Federal Dept.
    of Science, with NSF as its core, might encompass oceanographic agen-
    cies, high-energy-physics research currently funded by AEC, ESSA, Bu-
    reaus of Census and Labor Statistics, geophysics branches of Geological
    Survey, and some NIH programs. Dr. Hollomon also suggested NASA be
    added when it could be included â€œwithout having it become the tail
    that wags the dog.â€ Dr. Hornig insisted no massive â€œscience agencyâ€
    should be created to usurp supervision of Nationâ€™s science effort.
       Bacteria might have caused gastrointestinal upset suffered by astro-
    naut Frank Borman on Apollo 8 mission, Dr. Rudolf H. T. Mattoni,
    head of Biological Systems Div. of Nuclear Utility Services, Haw-
    thorne, Calif., told meeting. Effects of weightlessness on bacteria on
     Biosatellite I1 flight (Sept. 7-9, 1967) suggested that lack of gravity
     might have allowed common, normally benign, intestinal bacteria to
    cause illness like Bormanâ€™s.

    based on sperm cells flown 45 hr aboard Biosatellite.
       Cornel1 Univ. map expert, Prof. Arthur J. McNair, said sophisticated
    photographic mapping by satellites at 140-mi altitude would provide
    faster, cheaper, broader, and more detailed coverage than now possible
    by airplane mapping. Single map-making satellite photo, he said, would
    be equivalent to 1,000 photos taken by aircraft. US. could be fully
    mapped in one year from photos from satellite in near-polar orbit for
    four weeks. Another 1 mo would be needed for data processing.

       Dr. Robert H. Hardie of Vanderbilt Univ. said planet Pluto had ap-
    peared to be dimming for past 10 yr. It was moving in 248-yr orbital
    period to point where it reflected little sunlight and its surface tempera-
    ture had dropped two degrees. He speculated that planet froze into
    mass of stone and solid nitrogen as temperatures reached -250â€™ C
    when facing away from the sun. When bathed in sunlight, planet
     warmed to -200â€ C and formed reflecting puddles which astronomers
     saw as variations in liqht intensity. (Text; UPI, W Post, 12/28/68, A9;

    I . . . when we didnâ€™t even have a space committee in the Congress,
    when we were talking about the basketball up there in the air, when we
    have weathered the storms that .have brewed-everyone who wanted to
     cut anything, the first thing they wanted to cut was the space program
    -when we have seen the editorial professors inform us that there was
    really no value in doing all of this anyway, it gives me great pleasure
     now to see the thrill that even they are getting out of it.â€
        President described anxiety about complex mission and said he had
    repeatedly asked himself whether U.S. was ready, whether date selected
    was best one, whether every possible precaution had been taken, and
    whether every man had performed his requirements. â€œAbout all you
    can do . . . is to pick men that you have confidence in, that you trust,
    give them the support they need, and then hold on.â€ Remembering he
    had â€œrecommended this goal for this decadeâ€ to President Kennedy, he
    said: â€˜â€˜Therq have been many pitfalls every step of the way. I donâ€™t
    know how many folks have just wanted to abandon it, clip it, cut it,
    take the money for the cities or the war or just anything else. Space
    has been a whipping boy.
        â€œSo when you see the day approaching when visions, and dreams,
     and what we said to the Congress when we created the Space Adminis-
     tration back in 1958 are becoming reality, you naturally are hopeful.â€
        Later, in telephone message to Apollo 8 astronauts, President con-
     gratulated crew and said: â€œYou have made us very proud to be alive at
     this particular moment in history. You have made us feel akin to those
     Europeans nearly five centuries ago who heard stories of the New World
     for the first time. . . . My thoughts this morning went back to more than
                     .
     10 years ago . . when we saw Sputnik racing through the skies, and
     we realized that America had a big job ahead of it.
        â€œIt gave me so much pleasure to know that you men have done a
     large part of that job.â€ (PD, 12/30/68, 1744-50)

 International comment on Apollo 8 mission:
       In statement distributed by Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
   Boris Petrov, Chairman of Council for International Cooperation in In-
   vestigation and Utilization of Outer Space, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sci-
   ences, hailed â€œhardwareâ€ and â€œcourageâ€ of Apollo 8 astronauts but
   called attention to â€œconsiderable accentâ€ placed on â€œautomatic devicesâ€
   in Soviet space program. He said, â€œThe Soviet Union is engaged in a
   large-scale program of planned studies and exploration of outer space,
   which provides for the investigation of the earthâ€™s upper atmosphere
   and of near-earth outer space and studies of sun-earth relationships and
   of our closest space neighbors-the moon, Venus and mars, and later,
    on more remote planets.â€

       Tass: â€œDue tribute should be paid to the courage and mastery of
   Frank Borman, William Anders and James Lovell who have accom-
   plished this outstanding scientific and technical experiment. The suc-
   cessful flight of Apollo 8 ushers in a new stage in the history of space
   exploration.â€ Ten Soviet cosmonauts telegraphed Apollo crew congratu-
   lations for â€œanother milestone in scientific and technical progress.â€
       Pope Paul VI, in message to President Johnson: â€œGiving thanks to
    God for the successful completion of the magnificent enterprise of the

    States of America and particularly the intrepid space travelers, and in-
   voke divine blessing upon all contributing to this noble achievement.â€
       U.N. Secretary General U Thant: â€œThe powerful thrust of the
    rocket engines, the awesome speeds attained in flight, the vast
    distances traveled, the precision of navigation and the fidelity of
    communications, aural and visual, all stagger the imagination and defy
    the comprehension of man.â€

    Johnson : Canadians had followed astronautsâ€™ flight with â€œadmiration
    for their courage and the technical skill of all who have a part in the
    enterprise.â€

    the supreme technological achievement . . of all time,â€ was â€œanother
    exciting chapter in manâ€™s eternal quest to triumph over his own natu-
    ral environment.â€ Same skills and resources which were helping to con-
    quer space â€could easily be diverted to giving man a better life on
    earth itself-if only all of us would allow the good that is inherent in
    all mankind to assert itself.â€ (AP, B Sun, 12/28/68, 1; New Nigerian,

   atmosphere. Since 1962, concentration and temperature of molecular
    nitrogen in upper atmosphere had been measured in 22 successful flights
   under varying conditions of solar activity, from launch sites at Fort
    Churchill, Manitoba, Wallops Island, Va., and Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.
    Scientists had concluded that upper atmosphere consisted of mixture of
    gases-electrons, ions, and neutral particles-each o i which had distinct
    temperature. Multiplicity of temperatures could be expected in upper
    atmosphere of planets, though differences between planetary atmospheres
   must be more striking than similarities because of differences in at-
    mospheric composition and in distance from sun. It was likely that
    absence of permanent magnetic field on either Mars or Venus caused
    further substantial differences between upper atmospheres of these
    planets and upper atmosphere of earth. (Science, 12/27/68, 143741)

    debate about supersonic airliners is sure to be stepped up in the wake
    of the news that the Soviet entry, the TU-144, has made its first flight.
    Since it has not been claimed that this initial trial reached supersonic
    speeds, the likelihood is that the TU-144 was kept subsonic on its first
    outing. But Soviet airplane designers and builders have manufactured
    enough supersonic military planes to suggest that on a subsequent flight

    participated in 1968 agency-wide planning to detail program objectives
    and options from which program could be built. Many tools required
    for future space program had already been developed and many future
    ventures would require onIy modest improvements. Spacecraft pointing
    accuracies and stability would improve, and their lifetimes would
    increase. More powerful transmitters would communicate data across
    ever-widening expanses. Spacecraft weight would increase and man
    would have increasing capability to work and navigate in space.
    Advances in chemical propulsion, introduction of nuclear and electric
    propulsion, and new combinations of existing stages, would permit
    growth of launch vehicle capability to meet mission demands.

         Press marked Webb retirement with praise for many accomplish-
      ments of US. space program during his leadership. Webb, planning
      to devote time to interests in education and urban and foreign affairs,
      continued to serve as consultant to Acting Administrator Dr. Thomas
      0. Paine.
         NASA FY 1969 budget request of $4.37 billion, already smallest since
      1963 and $700 million below FY 1968 request, was further trimmed
      by Congress because of urgent national needs in other areas, particu-
      larly Vietnam war and urban problems. Authorization of $4.013 billion
      was lowered to appropriation of $3.995 billion-$375.12 million below
      original request. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 again
      reduced NASA funds, as well as funds for D m and other agencies.
         Dr. Paine in October announced NASA interim operating plan limited
      to $3.85 billion for FY 1969. Cutbacks included â€œsharply limited and
      deferredâ€ Apollo Applications program, end to Saturn IB and V booster
      production, 50% cut in advanced mission studies, reduced lunar and
      planetary exploration program, one-year delay in NERVA development,
      slips in Biosatellite program, and reductions in astronomy, physics,
      and basic research. In November Dr. Paine said that below $4-billion
      level NASA could no longer â€œhold together our hard-won capabilities
      and utilize them effectively in critical programs; some of them would
      have to be dropped entirely.â€ (EH)
    In its international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched
0
      three satellites for European Space Research Organization : In-
      ternational Radiation Investigation Satellite Iris Z (Esro ZZ-B) ,
      Aurorae (Esro Z ) to study aurora borealis and related polar ionosphere
      phenomeni, and Highly Eccentric Orbiting Satellite Heos A for inter-
      planetary physics research. From eight nations, 35 investigators were
      selected to carry out experiments with first lunar surface material to
      be retrieved by NASA. Four nations contributed experiments flown on
       NASA spacecraft and 122 sounding rockets were launched in scientific
       programs with eight countries. Geodetic satellite observations were
       carried out with 34 countries; aeronautical research was conducted
       with 4 countries; and 52 countries had APT facilities to receive cloud
       cover pictures from US. satellites. (NASA Releases 68-219, 68-204;

    The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard
C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Con-
gress. Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite
Situation Report issued by the Operations Control Center at Goddard Space
Flight Center ; public information releases of the Department of Defense,
NASA, ESSA, and other agencies, as well as those of the Communications sat-
ellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry, the
Satellite Situation Report, translations from Tass News Agency, statements
in the Soviet press, and international news servicesâ€™ reports. Data on satel-
lites of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public Registry, the SateE
lite Situation Report, government announcements, and international news
servicesâ€™ reports.
    It might be well to call attention to the terms of reference stated or im-
plied in the title of this tabulation. This is a listing of payloads that have
 ( a ) orbited; (b) as probes, ascended to at least the 4,000-mile altitude that
traditionally has distinguished probes irom sounding rockets, etc. ; or (c)
conveyed one or more humans into space, whether orbit was attained or not.
Furthermore, only flights that have succeeded-or at least can be shown by
tracking data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe or manned
flight-are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch
site. An asterisk by the date marks those dates that are one day earlier in
this tabulation than in listings which reference to Greenwich Mean Time. A
double asterisk by the date marks those dates of Soviet launches which are
a day later in this compilation than in listings which reference to Green-
wich Mean Time.
    World space activity in 1968 continued at about the same pace as 1967.
There was a slight decline in total successful launches-119 against 127 in
1967-and a decline in total payloads orbited-138 against 159 in 1967, a
good deal under the record 160 of 1965. The difference between launches
and payloads is of coprse accounted for by the multiple-payload launches

(DOD is the principal user of this system, with 9 multiple-payload launches
orbiting a total of 26 payloads and with as many as 8 payloads on one
Titan 111-C vehicle; NASA had 2 multiple launches of 4 payloads against one
multiple launch and 2 payloads in 1967; the U.S.S.R. again had none).
   Of the 1968 world total, the United States launched 45 boosters carrying
64 payloads (compared with 55 and 87 in 1967), the U.S.S.R. launched 74
(compared with 67 in 1967) ; 6 of NASAâ€™s total were non-NASA missions-
Esro I I , Aurorae, Heos-A, Intelsat-Ill F-2, Essa VIII.
   If 1967 was characterized by the large number of U.S. lunar flights
(seven compared with none for the U.S.S.R.), 1968 was distinguished by
the reappearance of manned flight. The US. moved closer to its lunar land-
ing goal with two manned Apollo successes, and the Soviet Union demon-
strated its manned capability in the Soyuz 111 flight. In 1968 both the
United States and the Soviet Union successfully circled the moon. The
Sovietâ€™s Zond V first accomplished the feat with an unmanned craft, while
the United States was first in putting men around the moon in Apollo 8.
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag behind each
flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.

       CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES

  JANUARY 1 , 1 9 6 8 , THROUGH DECEMBER 3 1 , 1 9 6 8

   This chronology of major NASA launchings in 1968 is intended to provide
an accurate and ready historical reference, one compiling and verifying in-
formation previously scattered over several sources. It includes launchings
of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA
or under â€œNASA direction (e.g., NASA provided vehicles, launch facilities, and
performed the launches for ComSatCorpâ€™s Intelsat-Ill F-2, for ESSAâ€™S Essa
VI1 and VIII, and for ESROâ€™S Iris I , and Aurorae and Heos-A in 1968).
NASA sounding rocket launches are published annually by the Goddard Space
Flight Center Historian in Goddard Projects Summary: Satellites and
Sounding Rockets.
   An attempt has been made to classify the performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle perform-
ance and mission results-successful (S) , partially successful (P), and un-
               .
successful (U) A fourth category, unknown (Unk) , has been provided for
payloads where vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to ex-
ercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since
many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact
that a great deal is learned from missions that may have been classified as
unsuccessful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Sources used
were all open ones, verified where in doubt from the project offices in NASA
Headquarters and from NASA Centers. For further information on each item,
see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as
referenced in the index. Prepared May 1969 by Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr.
Deputy NASA Historian (EH) .

                            Appendix C
CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1967-1968

   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
during 1967 and 1968 and, taken with Appendix C to the 1965 and 1966
editions of this publication, provides a summary record of manned explora-
tion of the space environment through 1968. The information was compiled
by William D. Putnam, Assistant NASA Historian for Manned Space Flight.
   The year 1967 saw only one flight by man into space and that mission of
lhe Soviet spaceship Soyuz 1 ended in the tragic death of Cosmonaut Vladi-
mir M. Komarov. Although there were no US. flights in 1967, tragedy also
struck the American program with the death of astronauts Virgil I. Grissom,
Edward H. White 11, and Roger B. Chaffee inside their spacecraft on the
launch pad at Cape Kennedy while they were conducting tests preparatory
to the first manned flight in the Apollo program.
      It was October of 1968 before each nation resumed manned space
flight, with Apollo 7 the initial manned test of Americaâ€™s spacecraft for the
lunar landing program and the Soyuz 111 the first Soviet manned flight
since the crash of Soyuz I 18 months earlier. The epochal flight of ApolZo 8
was manâ€™s first trip outside the earthâ€™s environs to lunar orbit. This land-
mark in human exploration demonstrated the ability of the Apollo-Saturn
V system to perform the mission for which it was designed and built-
manâ€™s landing on the lunar surface and safe return to earth.
   By the end of 1968, the United States had conducted a total of 18 manned
space flights, 15 in earth orbit and one circumlunar voyage, with a total of
22 different crewmen. Six of the 22 American astronauts had participated
in two flights each, and two had flown three times. The Soviet Union had
conducted a total of 10 manned flights, all in earth orbit, with 12 different
crewmen. Cosmonaut Romarovâ€™s fatal flight in 1967 was his second. Cumu-
lative totals for manned spacecraft hours on flight had reached 1,430 hours
53 minutes for the United States and 554 hours 4 minutes for the Soviet
Union. Cumulative total man-hours in space were 3,215 hours and 628
hours 40 minutes, respectively.
   Data on US. flights are the latest available to date within NASA. Although
minor details are subject to modification as data are refined, major aspects
of all U S . manned flights remain subject to direct observation by interested
citizens of the world, with a significant portion of recent missions seen live
on worldwide television.
