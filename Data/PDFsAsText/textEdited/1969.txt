                              Foreword
    History is a word with varied meanings. They range from one conveying
idealistic images, to fat books of ultimate truth, to the professionalâ€™s
prejudices concerning history as an intellectual discipline. To those of US
who have been privileged to be wholly immersed in science and technology
of aeronautics and space over a number of years, history perhaps is the
sense of accomplishment.
    While this chronology volume is not a history, it does attempt to prdvide
a first-cut reference to events and commentary during a most crowded year
and the year that man first set foot upon an extraterrestrial body. When the
Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their lunay walk
on July 20, 1969, it became one of the most vicarious events to date in
world history. Over a half billion people around the world witnessed this
momentous occasion live by television relayed via communications satellites.
Many who did not witness it appear reluctant to admit it today. The full
consequences of the seven-year Apollo endeavor are as yet in the domain of
prophets and posterity despite the worldwide enthusiasm. But we have
already seen evidence of the second thoughts provided by manâ€™s perspective
from the moon of his own planet-a heightened awareness that spaceship
Earth is perhaps unique and certainly is precious, even with the manifold
problems of mankind. And we have learned about ourselves as a people.
We have learned that the United States can set itself a large, difficult, long-
term objective and mobilize itself and sustain its effort to the successful
conclusion.
    Aside from being the year that man landed on the moon, 1969 had many
other significances to students and participants in aeronautics and astro-
nautics. It was NASAâ€™s year under the Nixon Administration and a new
                        first
 Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine. It was the year in which the Space
Task Groupâ€™s report to the President reaffirmed the Nationâ€™s continued com-
mitment to space exploration and painted in the broad outline of post-Apollo
 goals in space. It was the year the concept of the space shuttle emerged in
detail, exciting in its potential as a practical, reusable, economical space
transportation system. In space science it was the year when Mariner VI and
 VII flew within 2,600 miles of Mars and sent back photographs of the Mar-
 tian surface and 200 times more data on Mars than had Mariner IV in 1964.
In addition to these more spectacular events, there was solid progress in
space science, exploration, and applications. All of these events &d many
more find their milestones recorded in this chronology.
    There are both value in and special reservations about this chronology of
 science, technology, and public policy as related to aeronautics aâ€™hd space.
It provides the historian or any analyst with time-oriented steppingstones
toward the human and institutional stories. General items are included to
help create the social environment in which the selected items took place.
There seems some merit, despite inevitable bias in viewpoints, in validating
                                FOREWORD

entries to sources generally available. This facilitates additional research.
With its detailed index, the chronology is cross-referenced to dimensions
other than time and becomes a useful reference available to lay and pro-
fessional inquiry.
  But beyond this, history-maker, historian, observer, and student alike
may become more aware of the documentation and reflection yet to be
performed in comprehending more fully what has transpired.

                                Preface
   The brief, chronological record of 1969 events in aerospace science, tech-
nology, and policy has been prepared as events occurred and were reported
in the immediately available, open sources-the news media, press releases,
speech texts, transcripts, testimony before Congress, and test and study
reports. A first collection of clues to significant occurrences and background
climate for future historians, the volume is also intended to serve for
immediate reference uses. I t does not attempt to analyze but to cite the
who, what, when, and where in sequence and as near real time as possible.
   Within these limitations, we make a considerable effort to ensure accuracy
and comprehensiveness. Our NASA Archives, under Lee D. Saegesser, collects
the current documentation. Under an exchange of funds agreement, the
Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress drafts the
monthly segments in comment edition form. These are edited and aug-
mented by the NASA Historical Division, published, and circulated for com-
ment and use. At the end of the year the entire manuscript is reworked and
augmented by the comments that have come in and by documentation that
has become available since the comment edition was prepared. The Library
also prepares the extensive index.
   The 1969 annual volume is the work of a number of hands. The entire
NASA Historical Division participated in source collection, review, and
publication. The general editor was Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Deputy
NASA Historian. Technical editor was Mrs. Carrie Karegeannes. At the Li-
brary Mrs. Patricia Davis, Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith, and Mrs. Shirley
Singleton prepared the monthly texts, which were circulated throughout
NASA for comments as to completeness and accuracy of NASA items and then
revised for annual publication. Arthur G. Renstrom prepared the index.
   Appendix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, a
Chronicle for 1969,â€ and Appendix C, â€œChronology of Manned Space Flight,
 1969,â€ were prepared by Leonard C. Bruno of the Library. Appendix B,
â€œChronology of Major NASA Launches, 1969,â€ was prepared by William A.
Lockyer, Jr., of the Historical and Library Services Branch, Kennedy Space
Center. Appendix D, â€œAbbreviations of References,â€ was prepared by Mrs.
Brock-Smith. Creston Whiting of NASAâ€™s           Information Services Branch,
Scientific and Technical Information Division, kept the process abreast of
Russian releases. At the NASA Centers the historians and historical monitors
 submitted local material for the chronology. Validation was the work of
many busy persons throughout NASA and in other relevant branches of the
 Federal structure.
   A chronology is but the first step toward history and even it is never
 completed. Comments, additions, and criticisms are always welcomed.

January 1: Washington Evening Star editorial said of success of Dee. 21-27,
     1968, Apollo 8 mission : â€œModern science undercut manâ€™s bland belief
     that he was the center of the universe, and modern philosophy reduced
     him to a trivial atom of matter in the larger cosmos, To be able to
     sail around at will in that vast cosmos may give man back some of the
     confidence he once had, not the arrogance of thinking that he under-
     stands the whole pattern, but the quiet sense that he will not flinch
     from what he may yet learn.â€ (W Star, 1/1/69, A15)
∞ U.S.S.R. disclosed that converted MiG fighter was prototype used for
     testing design features and performance of TU-144, Soviet supersonic
     aircraft. Soviet aviation writer for Pravda K. Raspevin said four-man
     crew aboard Tu-144 maiden flight Dec. 31, 1968, was one of most
     experienced in U.S.S.R. Pilot was Eduard V. Yelyan. Copilot Mikhail
     V. Kozlov had won title Hero of the Soviet Union for testing Tu-22
     supersonic strategic bomber. Tu-144 was constructed of light alloys
     with titanium on leading edges and other areas subjected to high
     temperatures. At cruising speed, outside skin temperature was 150â€ C.
     Air conditioning system cooled cabin. Tail unit was minus horizontal
     guiding surface. Crew members had catapult seats as safety precaution
     during test flights. ( N Y T , 1/2/69, 7)

     Academy of Sciences in June 1958, moved to location adjacent to

January 2: In Washington Evening Star, Judith Randal said worldâ€™s first
     successful heart transplant and Apollo 8 mission made 1968 year â€œof
     spectacular scientific achievementâ€ but that critics of both events had
     charged that technology â€œwas being exploited at the expense of basic
     research and social worth.â€ It did no harm, she said, to celebrate
     heart transplants and voyages to moon, â€œbut, with the advent of a new
     administration, it also is worth reflecting what the price may be-
     when so much else needs doing-of deciding to climb Mount Everest
     just because Mount Everest is there and we have learned how to climb
     it.â€ ( W S t a r , 1/2/69, A14)
∞   NASA awarded Boeing Co. $32,815,000 cost-plus-fixed-fee supplemental
     agreement extending for additional 12 mos Apollo program technical

 ∞  President Johnson announced 12 recipients of 1968 National Medal of
     Science, Governmentâ€™s highest award for distinguished achievement in
     science, mathematics, and engineering. Detlev W. Bronk, President
     Emeritus of Rockefeller Univ., past president of NAS (1950-1962)
     and Johns Hopkins Univ. (19&1953), received award for â€œhighly

     of society.â€ Herbert Friedman, Superintendent, Atmosphere and Astro-
     physics Div., Naval Research Laboratory, won award â€œfor pioneering
     work in rocket and satellite astronomy and in particular for his con-
     tributions to the field of gamma ray astronomy.â€™â€™ (PD, 1/6/69, 11;
     NASA biog, 9/8/68)
January 3: H.R. 16, 17, and 204, bills to authorize award of Congressional
     Medal of Honor to Apollo 8 Astronauts Frank Borman, James A.
     Lovell, Jr., and William A. Anders, were introduced during first ses-
     sion of 9lst Congress. (CR, 1/3/69, H33-42)
∞ Time named Apollo 8 astronauts its Men of the Year for 1968. â€œFor all
     its upheavals and frustrations, the year would be remembered to the
     end of time for the dazzling skills and Promethean daring that sent
     mortals around the moon. It would be celebrated as the year in which
     men saw at first hand their little earth entire, a remote, blue-brown
     sphere hovering like a migrant bird in the hostile night of space.â€
      (Time, 1/3/69, 9)
∞  New York State Supreme Court Justice Frederick M. Marshall issued
     temporary injunction to block sale of Cornel1 Aeronautical Laboratory
     by Cornell Univ. to EDP Technology, Inc., of Washington, D.C., for
     $25 million. He directed case be given preference on trial calendar.

January 4: At Explorers Club symposium in New York scientists, educators,
     community leaders, and students discussed significance of Apollo 8
     mission. William Booth, Chairman of Commission on Human Rights
     in New York, said, â€œI still am quite disturbed by the fact that weâ€™re
     dying at home, people are about to starve. Thereâ€™s overpopulation and
      underproduction of food in the world. We havenâ€™t been able to solve
      these problems and here we are going ofâ‚¬ to the moon.â€ Dr. Robert
     Jastrow, Director of NASAâ€™s    Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said
     flights were â€œa means of concentrating our energies toward building
      a technological capability.â€ Moon flight had played â€œsame role as
      Lindberghâ€˜s flight to Parisâ€ in that it demonstrated new capability.
     Space program was paying economic dividends in communications,
     mineral exploration, and new materials. Dr. Maynard M. Miller, Chair-
     man of Explorer Clubâ€™s World Center for Exploration Foundation, said,
      â€œThe word â€˜impossibleâ€™ has a different meaning after Apollo.8. Perhaps
      its real contribution will be as a symbol of manâ€™s willingness to dare
     to do something great.â€ (Wilford, NYT, 1/5/69, 26)
January 5: Venus V unmanned probe was successfully launched by U.S.S.R.
     on four-month journey to Venus. Tass announced that 2,491433 space-
     craft had been launched into parking orbit and then injected on
     trajectory toward Venus to softland, conduct extensive scientific re-
     search, and continue studies begun by Venus ZV, which landed on
     Venusian surface Oct. 18, 1967. All equipment was functioning nor-
     mally. Spacecraft carried pennants with bas-relief of Lenin and Soviet
     coat of arms and â€œgreater range of scientific and measuring equipment,
     making it possible to improve the accuracy of measurements and to
     obtain additional data on planetâ€™s atmosphere,â€ Moscow News said.

            meeting in Dallas, Tex., Dec. 26-31, 1968, for agency to estab-
    AAAS
    lish priorities for Federal spending in research, education, technology,
    weapon development, and science. Dr. James V. Shannon, former NIH
    director, had proposed creation of top-level council equal in stature
    to National Security Council and Council of Economic Advisers. Dr.
    Donald F. Hornig, President Johnsonâ€™s Science Adviser, had recom-
    mended adding Secretary of Science to Presidential Cabinet. Star
    said, â€œThere will be strong opposition to both of these proposals. The
                                                                         ..  .
    cry of centralization will be raised.â€ However: â€œWhat is proposed
    is a body of informed advisers, whose duty it is to suggest . . . to in-
    struct the President, the Congress and public on the potentialities for
    good and evil that could result if a given path were followed. The Pres-
    ident would still have to make the executive decisions. Congress would
     still control the purse. The public would still have the final verdict of
     the ballot. But all of them could use some responsible, expert guidance
     through the awesome and fantastic new world that lies just ahead.â€
     (W Star, 1/5/69, G1)
January 6: Oao II (launched Dec. 7, 1968) completed 30 days of flight
    operation and was adjudged successful by NASA. Experiments had ob-
    tained 65 hrs of scientific data over range of eight magnitudes and
    4,200 A-1,100 A wavelengths. Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
    celescope experiment made 18 mappings and Univ. of Wisconsin experi-
    ment made detailed observations of 100 stars. Some 40,000 separate
    commands had been sent to Oao ZZ and more than 4 million pieces of
    information had been collected, with 20 times more uv information
     from stars in 30 days than in 15 yrs of sounding rocket launchings.
    Satelliteâ€™s 1 telescopes were studying extremely young, hot stars
                   1
    which emitted most of their energy in uv portion of spectrum, not
     visible to ground observatories because of earthâ€˜s atmosphere. (NASA

∞ Budget squeeze had forced NASA to drop 16 institutions from its sustain-
    ing university program, Scientific Research said. Four others were
     dropped in 1968; 30 remained. Contracts of the 16 would not be re-
     newed as they expired unless institutions devised exceptional research
     proposals. Then money would probably have to be taken from other
     universities. Grants had ranged from $75,000 to $300,000, with total
    saving of $4 million over FYs 1969, 1970, and 1971 expected from can-
    cellation. Program funding had declined from $45 million in FYs
     1965 and 1966 to $30 million in FY 1967, $10 million in FY 1968,
     and $9 million in 1969. FY 1970 budget level was expected to be $9
     million. (Scientific Research, 1/6/69, 15-17; NASA FY 1970 Budget

∞ FAA announced it had moved to reverse â€œescalation of aircraft noiseâ€
     around airports by proposing maximum noise standards and noise ob-
     jectives for new subsonic transport aircraft, including those under de-
     velopment. Proposal was first regulatory action taken under P.L.
    90-411, which granted FAA broad authority in noise control. Noise
     limits on approach would be 102 to 108 effective perceived noise deci-
     bels (epndb) , depending on aircraft weight; sideline noise limits
     would be same; and takeoff limits would be in 93- to 108-epndb
     range. (FAA Release 6P-1; Bisen, W Post, 1/7/69, A3; WSJ, 1/9/69,

    ence that Stanley R. Resor would remain as Secretary of the Army,
    Rhode Island Gov. John H. Chafee would be nominated Secretary of
    the Navy, and former NASA Deputy Administrator, Dr. Robert C. Sea-
    mans, Jr., would be nominated Secretary of the Air Force in Nixon
    Administration. (Wilson, W Post, 1/7/69, 1 )
January 6-8: Three-article series on â€œThe Cost of Preparednessâ€ by Orr
    Kelly in Washington Evening Star quoted interviews with outgoing
    Johnson Administration defense experts who agreed US, might be
    entering peaceful era in international relations though defense cost
    would remain high-at least $50 billion annually-in foreseeable fu-
    ture. Secretary of Defense Clark M. Clifford thought, â€œcautious and
     forceful stepsâ€ could be taken â€œto improve the lot of the people of the
     world.â€
        USN saw post-Vietnam war need for modernization, with emphasis
     on nuclear-powered escort ships; USAF wanted new fighter, manned
     bomber, deployment of interim bomber, and revamping of U S . air
     defense force.
        Dr. John S. Foster, Director of Defense Research and Engineering,
     said: â€œThe Soviets have four characteristics of special concern to the
     R&D community. They are technically advanced, they are strong eco-
     nomically, they have an aggressive military posture-and they work
     behind a veil of secrecy. The one that makes competition difficult is
     secrecy. To counter it, the United States must have technological su-
     periority. We must have been there, technically, before them.â€ (W

January 7: U S . patent No. 3,420,471 was granted to John D. Bird, Howell
     D. Garner, Ernest D. Lounsberry, and David E. Thomas, Jr., LaRC
     engineers who assigned rights to NASA for jet shoes to enable astronauts
     to move in space. Wearer could rotate body by natural ankle and leg
     motions and control direction by turning body and aiming head in

     of UFOS in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. . . .
      Further extensive study of UFOS probably cannot be justified in the
     expectation that science will be advanced thereby.â€ Scientists felt â€œthe
     reason that there has been very little scientific study of the subject is
     that those scientists who are most directly concerned, astronomers, at-
     mospheric physicists, chemists, and psychologists, having had ample
     opportunity to look into the matter, have individually decided that UFO
     phenomena do not offer a fruitful field in which to look for major
     scientific discoveries.â€
         In review of study, NAS special review panel had concluded, â€œOn the
     basis of present knowledge the least likely explanation of UFOS is the
     hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations by intelligent beings.â€

     normal surveillance operations and found no basis for contention that
     UFO data were â€œshrouded in official secrecy.â€ Report stated, â€œThe his-
     tory of the past 21 years has repeatedly led Air Force officers to the
      conclusion that none of the things seen, or thought to have been seen

    â€œI am sure that under the new administration a change in the general
    structure of the space program may occur principally because the
    Apollo landings for 1969 will be carried out. . . [And] that ends an
    era, so to speak, in the space program which President Kennedy started
    when he proposed attainment of a landing on the moon by the end of
    this decade.â€ Question would be raised â€œin Congress and in the ad-
    ministration and by the â€˜people of the country, â€˜OK weâ€™re all through
    now, letâ€™s save that four billion or five billion dollars a year and settle
    back and do something less expensive.â€™ I donâ€™t believe that this is a
    very widespread view in the top levels of the new administration. I
    think the Apollo 8 program came at a very critical momentâ€ to make
    everyone see that â€œby lifting the eyes of the people to something be-
                                                                        ..

    but certainly not abandoning it, and deciding what are the great things
    that can be done in the future of the space program.â€ (Transcript)

    received award â€œfor outstanding contributions to space flight, engi-
    neering, technology and exploration as Commander of Apollo 8, man-
    kindâ€™s first venture beyond Earth into orbit around the Moon. During
    this flawless mission from December 21 to December 27, 1968, he
    made critical decisions and carried out complex maneuvers to fly into
    precise translunar injection, lunar orbit, and transearth injection flight
    paths to a successful reentry and splashdown within 5,000 yards of
    the recovery vessel. His scientific observations during the journey to
    and from the Moon and during 10 orbits of the Moon have added
    significantly to manâ€™s knowledge. He displayed outstanding leadership,
    courage, professional skill and devotion to duty in accomplishing all
    planned mission objectives, significantly advancing the nationâ€™s capa-
    bilities in space. As one of historyâ€™s boldest explorers, he has blazed a

    spectacular achievement, have taught us some very invaluable lessons.
    We have learned how men and nations may make common cause in
    the most magnificent and hopeful enterprises of mankind. We in the
    United States are already engaged in cooperative space activities with
    more than 70 nations of the world. We have proposed a variety of ad-
    ventures to expand international partnership in space exploration. This
    morning I renew Americaâ€™s commitment to that principle and to its
    enormous promise. The flight of Apollo 8 gives all nations a new and
    a most exciting reason to join in manâ€™s greatest adventure.â€ President
    Johnson presented retired NASA Administrator James E. Webb as â€œthe
    single man most responsible for successfully administering this pro-
    gram and, I think, the best Administrator in the Federal Government.â€
        Astronauts gave President Johnson miniature copies of recent inter-

        After awards ceremony astronauts were driven in motorcade to ad-
    dress joint assembly of Congress attended by nine Supreme Court
    Justices. Borman told Congress: â€œThe one overwhelming emotion that
     we carried with us is the fact that we really do all exist on the small
     globe. And when you get to 240,000 miles, it really isnâ€™t a very large
    earth.â€ He said voyage was not just an American achievement; â€œwe
     stood on the shoulders of giants,â€ from Newton and Galileo to present
     day scientists and space explorers. â€œIf Apollo 8 was a triumph at all,â€
    Borman said, â€œit was a triumph of all mankind.â€
        At State Dept. Auditorium press conference, NASA Assistant Admin-
     istrator for Public Affairs Julian Scheer announced Astronaut Frank
     Borman had been appointed Deputy Director of Flight Crew Opera-
     tions at MSC.
        During conference astronauts disclosed they had not seen moon
     during approach to lunar orbit; presented slides indicating presence
     of volcanics on back of moon; and announced their conclusion that
     conditions on pseudolanding site, B-1, indicated â€œlighting conditions
     are . . . adequate for a lunar landing, which was one of our objectives
     of the flight.â€ Borman said, â€œI came away with the idea that the moon
                                                      ..
     may be more homogeneous than I had realized . that you could get
     a spoon one place and find it just about the same as the samples some-
     where else.â€ In answer to question, he said, â€œI donâ€™t believe we found
     anything that would be of concern to future flights. We flight-tested the
     ground system. We flight-tested the airborne system. The command
     module and service module have effectively performed their designed
     task, their designed mission, with the exception of docking. We have
     got magnificent machinery. We have superb ground support.â€

    lievers, we suspect this document and its conclusions will find wide
    acceptance. Professor Condon and his colleagues did make a careful
    and extensive investigation. They enlisted specialists in the relevant
    branches of science, interviewed alleged witnesses, examined photo-
    graphs purporting to show UFO sightings and studied cases of claimed
    radar detection. . . . Those believers will keep on trying, but the rest

     docked with Soyuz V . Tass announcement said: â€œAfter the docking
     there was a mutual mechanical coupling of the ships, they were rigidly
     tightened up and their electrical circuits were connected. Thus, the
     worldâ€™s first experimental cosmic station with four compartments for
      the crew was assembled and began functioning as an artificial earth
     satellite.â€
        Moscow TV viewers watched as Soyuz V crew members Khrunov
     and Yeliseyev put on special spacesuits with new regenerative life-
     support systems and went out into space through service compartment
     hatch. Cosmonauts remained in space for one hour, conducting obser-
     vations and experiments, and then entered service compartment of
     other spacecraft, Soyuz ZV, to join Shatalov. After 4 hrs 35 min of
     docked flight in low, nearly circular orbit, spacecraft were uncoupled
     and continued their flights separately. Soyuz ZV, with three-man crew,

January 15: President Johnson in message transmitting FY 1970 budget to
    Congress said major recommended decreases in budget authority from
    1969 to 1970 included $235 million for the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration, which â€œwill provide for a program level equal
    to 1969 when combined with prior year funds.â€ Major increases
    included â€œ522 million for airway modernization, highways, and other
    activitiesâ€ in DOT. Of estimated $11.6 billion increase in total budget
    outlays, $0.5 billion was for national defense, â€œlargely for improve-
    ments in our strategic forces, modernization of our tactical air forces,
    and other increased research and development efforts needed to assure
    sufficient deterrent power in the future. These increases will be sub-
    stantially offset by reduced outlays for Vietnam resulting from chang-
    ing combat patterns and revised supply requirements. . . . In keeping
    with national priorities, major social programs account for largest
    portionâ€ of increase.
       President said: â€œThe record of achievements of the past 5 years is
    an impressive one. We have witnessed a period of unprecedented eco-
    nomic growth, with expanded production, rising standards ,of living,
    and the lowest rates of unemployment in a decade and a half. Our

    Americans.
       â€œThis Nation remains firmly committed to a world of peace and
    human dignity. In seeking these goals, we have achieved great military
    strength with the sole aim of deterring and resisting aggression. We
    have continued to assist other nations struggling to provide a better

       Dr. Paine noted FY 1970 budgct, as approved by President Johnson,
   â€œwould halt a four-year downward trend in NASA budget.â€ It was
    â€œau6tere and does not make full use of the aerospace capabilities that
    the nation has developed. . . .,, But it permitted â€œa balanced program
    of useful work in critical areas.â€™, Budget left â€œthe major new program
    decisions, especially in the manned flight area, for the next Administra-
    tion,â€ and was â€˜L â€˜holding budgetâ€™ that provides for progress, but defers

∞  Apollo Program Director, L/G Samuel C. Phillips ( USAF) , addressed
   National Space Club luncheon in Washington, D.C., on impact of
    Apollo 8: â€œMany, if not most, of the worldâ€™s newspapers heralded the
    flight as evidence of the greatness of the United States. Iâ€™m told jour-
    nalists in Germany, England and France speculated on the improved
    position that the U.S. would enjoy in the diplomatic arenas in which
    it is engaged in very important discussions. Iâ€™m told that a French
    paper went so far as to say that the lunar flight had vindicated Capi-
    talism as the best system of government, and vindicated our free enter-
    prise system as the most effective way to make progress. Iâ€™m aware
    from personal correspondence and discussions as well as reports in the
    press that scientists throughout the world have been equally impressed
    and that theyâ€™ve applauded the progress that this flight indicates for
    us.,,
       Gen. Phillips described Apollo 9 mission as â€œfar less spectacular
    than Apollo 8, but . . . more complex.â€ It would be â€œcertainly one of
    the most vital missions that weâ€™ve had in our mission sequence over
    the years that leads us to a lunar landing.â€ Risks would be different
    but â€œI personally think theyâ€™re a little greater than the risks which we
    knowingly accepted in committing the Apollo 8 mission.â€
       Apollo 10 would be fifth Saturn V--505-with         106 command and
    service module and L M 4 . Crew would bt. Astronauts Thomas P.
    Stafford, John W. Young, and Eugene A. Cernan. Scheduled for May,
    its objectives were â€œto demonstrate the performance of the crew, the
    space vehicle, and the mission support facilities during a manned
    lunar mission with the Command and Service Module and Lunar
    Module, and to evaluate the performance of the Lunar Module in a

    be studied. But there comes a time, place, and activity where the judg-
    meat and quick reaction of men are needed to do the job or make
    emergency repairs. There may even be situations in which it is cheaper
    to have men do this than to have automated instruments. That time
    has not yet arrived. Manned flight is still very expensive. But I foresee
    the time when you will run beyond the ability of automatic instru-
    ments to do a job either adequately or economically in space explora-

       US., Richard M. Nixon said: â€œThose who would be our adversaries,
      we invite to a peaceful competition-not in conquering territory or
      extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man. As we explore
      the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together-not as new
      worlds to be conquered but as a new adventure to be shared. . . . Only
      a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of manâ€™s first sight of
      the Ttorld as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the dark-
      ness. As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moonâ€™s gray surface on
       Christmas Ere, they spoke to us of the beauty of Earth-and in that
      voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke Godâ€™s
      blessing on its goodness. In that moment, their view from the moon
      moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write:
         â€˜â€˜ â€˜To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that
      eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the
      Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold-
      brothers who know now they are truly brothers.â€™

            In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned
      their thoughts toward home and humanity-seeing in that far per-
      spective that manâ€™s destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that
      however far n e reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the
      stars but on Earth itseIf, in our hands, in our own hearts.â€ (PD,

    We donâ€™t expect to find anything, but our job is to go up there and
    look for it. Now after we have discovered that the LM is a good vehicle,
    we have . . . to prove the joint operations techniques that weâ€™ve tried
    to develop on the ground over the last 3 years. Itâ€™s one thing to fly one
    spacecraft in orbit, and have it controlled by the ground, but when
    you get 2 of them up there, they are trying to look at 2 vehicles simul-

     safely, I guess I should add. They both have the capability of landing.
     We only have one set of parachutes and one heat shield.â€ He described

    Launches would contribute to specimen day program, coordinated in-
    vestigation of winter variability of D region of ionosphere above
    Wallops.
       Nike-Cajuns carried GSFC payloads to 75.2-mi (121-km) and
    12.4-mi (20-km) altitudes. All 19 grenades on each rocket detonated
    as planned and sound arrivals were recorded, but poor vehicle per-
    formance of second rocket prevented acquisition of useful data.
        Arcas carried Naval Weapons Center payload to 33.2-mi (53.4-km)
    altitude to measure ozone concentration in 18.6- to 37.3-mi (30- to
    60-km) region during parachute descent, but parachute did not deploy
    satisfactorily and payload descended too rapidly for recovery.
        First Nike-Apache carried Univ. of Illinois-GCA Corp. payload to
    141.1-mi (227-km) altitude to investigate winter variability of D
    region of ionosphere and measure differential absorption, Faraday
    rotation, and probe current to determine electron density, collision
    frequency, and temperature. Second Nike-Apache carried Univ. of
    Colorado payload to 71.5-mi (115-km) altitude to obtain vertical
    profile of nitric oxide density, using scanning monochromoter. Third
    Nike-Apache carried GSFC payload to 72.1-mi (116-km) altitude to
    measure degree of polarization and intensity of nitric oxide emission
    at 2,147 A to determine whether resonance scattering of sunlight was
    responsible for emission in D and E regions. Secondary objective was
    to determine altitude profile in 46.6- to 65.2-mi (75- to 105-km)
    region. Desired spectrum was not observed, apparently because of
    mechanical failure in payload. (NASA Rpts SRL; WS Release 69-3)

      Dr. Isidor I. Rabi, novelist C. P. Snow, and Catholic theologian Prof.
    Leslie Dewart wrote personal reactions to Apollo 8 mission. Clarke
    said: â€œThe Apollo 8 mission marks one of those rare turning points in
    human history after which nothing will ever be the same again. The
    immense technical achievement is already obvious to every one and
    has been universally praised; yet the psychological impact may be
    even more important and will take some time to make itself fully felt.
    We no longer live in the world which existed before Christmas 1968.
    It has passed away as irrevocably as the earth-centered universe of the
    Middle Ages.â€
       Dr. Rabi said: â€œIt would be misleading to talk of the events that led
    to the journey of Apollo 8 in terms of the vast sums of money that are
    involved, even though it cost several times as much as the development
    of the first atomic bomb. What is more important and more impressive
    is that Apollo 8 represents the cooperation of hundreds of thousands
    of people over a period of years in a gigantic effort with no clearly set
    practical goals, except perhaps the profound desire of mankind to
    prove to itself that it had the knowledge and the ability to overcome
    its earthbound limitations.â€
        Prof. Dewart said: â€œMan has taken his first, halting steps into the
     cosmos beyond that earthly world in which he was born and within
     which he had always lived. The impact of Apollo 8 in other areas of
    human experience is obvious; in religion, it is much less immediately
    evident. And yet, in the end, it may be more significant for the de-
    velopment of manâ€™s religious consciousness.â€ (Look, 2/4/69, 72-8)

  ∞ Supercritical wing would be flight-tested on USN F-8 fighter at FRC, NASA
     announced. Airfoil shape had been developed in four-year wind-tunnel
     studies at Lam by Dr. Richafd T. Whitcomb. If wind-tunnel perform-
     ance was achieved in flight, wing could improve performance and
     efficiency of future aircraft, particularly jet transports. It would allow
     efficient cruise flight near speed of sound at 45,000-ft altitude and
     reduce operational cost of subsonic flights by increasing operational
     range or permitting less fuel and more payload on faster schedules.
        Supercritical wing shape was developed to delay rise of drag force
     and onset of buffeting at high speeds. Flattened top was designed to
     reduce intensity of airflow disturbances; downward curve at rear of
     wing supplied lift lost by flattening. Flight program would evaluate
    behavior of wing in actual flight with both high-lift maneuvering and
     off -design performance, and determine sensitivity of supercritical wing
    to wing-contour variations associated with manufacturing processes
     and deformations due to flight loads. (NASA Release 69-27)

February 10: NAS published NRC Div. of Engineeringâ€™s Useful Applications
     of Earth-Oriented Satellites, Report of the Central Review Committee
     of NRC Summer Study on Space Applications, prepared for NASA. Study
    concluded that space applications program was â€œtoo small by a factor
     of two or three.â€ Benefits from program were expected to be large,
     â€œcertainly larger than the costs of achieving them.â€ However, â€œan ex-
     tensive, coherent, and selective programâ€ would be required to achieve
     benefits.
        Committee recommended that NASA give greater emphasis to earth-
     satellite programs with promise of beneficial applications, commit ad-
     ditional funds to expanded R&D and prototype operations for certain
     applications, and commit $200 million to $300 million yearly to space
     applications program. Manned space programs should be justified in
     their own right, not in terms of space applications; near-term benefits
     for mankind would be achieved â€œmore effectively and economically
     with automated devices and vehicles.â€
        Noting that in meteorology and communications â€œsatellites have al-
     ready entered solidly into the area of economic usefulness,â€ report
     recommended that NASA grant high priority to development of multi-
     channel distribution system for public and private network TV; multi-
     channel system for educational broadcasts in developing countries and
     for special interest groups such as physicians, lawyers, and educators;
     and North Atlantic satellite navigation system for traffic control of
     transoceanic aircraft and ships. Satellite earth-sensing was dependent
     on R&D in sensor signatures-form of information provided by instru-
     ments. Report recommended immediate pilot program for providing

     use of side-looking radar, and start of 10- to 12-yr development plan
     for more sophisticated sensors. (Text; NRC Release)

February 24-28: NASAâ€™s                         Mariner VI (Mariner F) spacecraft was successfully

    launched from ETR by Atlas-Centaur (SLV-3C) booster on five-month,
    226-million-mi, direct-ascent trajectory toward Mars-NASAâ€™s      first of
    two attempts to conduct Mars flyby missions during 1969 launch win-
    dow. Launch vehicle performance and spacecraft injection were nom-
    inal. Spacecraft separated from Centaur, deployed its four solar panels,
    locked its sensors on sun and star Canopus, and entered cruise mode,
    where it remained with all subsystems performing satisfactorily while
    trajectory was refined. Midcourse maneuver was successfully conducted
    Feb. 28 to ensure that spacecraft would fly within 2,200 mi (3,540.5
    km) of Mars July 31.
       Primary mission objective was equatorial flyby mission for explora-
    tory investigations of Mars to set basis for future experiments, particu-
    larly those relevant to search for extraterrestrial life. As secondary
    objective spacecraft would develop technology needed for succeeding
    Mars missions. The 840-lb spacecraft carried six complementary ex-
    periments to provide information about Martian surface and atmos-
    phere. Mission offered first opportunity to make scientific measurements
    on night side of Mars. Two onboard TV cameras would take pictures
    of Mars disc during approach with 15-mi optimum resolution and of
    surface during flyby with 900-ft optimum resolution. Infrared spec-
    trometer and uv spectrometer would probe Mars atmosphere, and oc-
    cultation experiment would obtain data on atmospheric pressures and
    densities. Infrared radiometer would measure surface temperatures on
    both light and dark sides of Mars; celestial mechanics experiment
    would use tracking information to refine astronomical data. Sharp
    increase in data returns would be achieved over 1964 Mariner missions.
    Mariner VI TV pictures would contain 3.9-million bits of information;
    Mariner IV contained 240,000 bits in 1965. Mariner VI would trans-
     mit science data at basic rate of 270 bps and high rate of 16,200 bps
    before flyby; Mariner I V transmitted at 8 1/3 bps.
        Mariner VI was follow-on to 1964 Mariner/Mars missions and pre-
    cursor to 1971 orbital and 1973 landing missions. First Mars probe,
    Mariner 111 (launched Nov. 4, 1964) , had failed to achieve desired
    orbit when shroud remained attached to spacecraft. Mariner IV
     (launched Nov. 28, 1964) had transmitted first close-up photos of
    Mars in July 1965. Mariner VI1 (Mariner G) would be launched

    adequately the challenges that confront those of us in aeronautical and
    aerospace activities, we must take as our perspective the commitments
    that challenge the nation as a whole. President Eisenhower, President
     Kennedy, and President Johnson, each in his own way, had a major
     impact on aeronautics and astronautics. And for each, his support of
     aerospace was a function of his belief that such efforts were instru-
     mental in the accomplishment of national goals. In the future, as in
    the past, governmental support of aerospace will be based largely on
     its demonstrated relevance to the needs of the nation.â€ (A&A, 2/69,

    post-insertion checkout CSM, code-named â€œGumdrop,â€ separated from
    Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB) and LM, code-named â€œSpider.â€ Crew
    successfully transposed CSM and docked with LM, and docked space-
    craft was separated from 3rd stage with RCS burn. Two s-IVB burns
    placed stage on earth-escape trajectory. Crew conducted first docked
    SPS burn.
        On second day crew tracked landmarks, conducted pitch and yaw
    roll maneuvers, and increased apogee by firing SPS engine three times.
    On third day, McDivitt and Schweickart entered LM through docking
    tunnel, evaluated LM systems, transmitted first telecast, and conducted
                                                                 .

    returned to CSM and conducted fifth SPS burn to circularize orbit.
    McDivitt and Schweickart reentered LM on fourth day and trans-
    mitted second telecast. Schweickart, recovered from earlier nausea,
    spent 37 min outside spacecraft, walking between LM and CSM hatches,
    maneuvering on handrails, and standing in â€œgolden slipperâ€ foot
    restraints. He commented on sunâ€™s brightness, photographed spacecraft
    and earth, and described rain squalls over KSC before he and McDivitt
    returned to CSM. Scott opened CM hatch and retrieved thermal samples
     from CSM exterior.
        McDivitt and Schweickart reentered LM on fifth day to perform
     CSM-LM rendezvous. Scott separated CSM from LM and fired CSM
     reaction control system thrusters to place spacecraft about 3.4 mi
      (5.5 km) apart. LM DPS was ignited twice to set up rendezvous. LM
     descent stage was jettisoned and LM ascent propulsion system (APS)
     was fired to set up conditions for circularization. Although problems
     were encountered with crewman optical alignment sight ( COAS) be-
     cause of extremely bright reflections, radar and optical sightings
     backed up by earth tracking enabled spacecraft to dock successfully
     after being up to 114 mi (183.5 km) apart during 61/2-hr separation.
     After McDivitt and Schweickart returned to CSM, crew jettisoned LM
     ascent stage and maneuvered to safe distance while stage burned to
     propellant depletion and entered orbit with 4,309-mi (6,934.5-km)
     apogee and 142.2-mi (228.8-km) perigee. By end of fifth day 97%
     of Apollo 9 objectives had been successfully accomplished.
        On sixth through ninth days crew conducted sixth and seventh SPS
                                             Pegasus I11 meteoroid detection
     burns to alter apogee, tracked NASAâ€™s
     satellite (launched July 30, 1965), took multispectral photos of earth,
     tracked landmarks, exerciskd spacecraft systems, and prepared for
     reentry.
        Final SPS burn for deorbit on 10th day was delayed one revolution
     because of unfavorable weather in planned landing area. CM-SM sepa-
     ration, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal;
     spacecraft reentered during 152nd revolution and splashed down in
     Atlantic 180 mi east of Bahamas at 12:53 pm EST March 13, 241 hrs
     53 secs after launch, within sight of recovery ship U.S.S. Guadalcanal.

       All primary Apollo 9 objectives were achieved and anomalies were
   not serious enough to alter mission operations or flight plan signifi-
   cantly. First manned flight of LM qualified last major component for
   lunar landing mission.
       Apollo 9 was sixth Apollo mission to date and third manned Apollo
   mission. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft
    information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched NOV.
    9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly
    successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hard-
    ware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4, 1968), despite launch vehicle prob-
   lems, had attained four of five primary objectives with spacecraft
    recovered in excellent condition. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7
     (Oct. 11-22, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and verified
    operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. Second manned
    mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21-27, 1968), proved capability of Apollo
    hardware and systems to operate out to lunar distances and return
    through earthâ€™s atmosphere.
        Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space
    Flight; MSC was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MsFC
    for Saturn V launch vehicle, and KSC for launch operations. Tracking
    and data acquisition was managed by GSFC under overall direction of

    American adventure. It is an adventure of man, bringing the accumu-
     lated wisdom of his past to the task of shaping his future. The 10-day

    Committee on Science and Astronautics on NASA FY 1970 authoriza-
    tion request, outlined goals in space and aeronautics toward which
     U.S. should move in next decade:
       â€œFirst-We should do all we can to understand and put into early
     use the promise of space for people here on earth. We should increase
    our scientific knowledge of the vital earth-sun relationship and study
    the earth itself from space. We should develop and experiment with
    new and improved practical applications of satellites, particularly in
     earth resources. We should continue to foster prompt introduction into
    the economy of space applications and technology.
       â€œSecond-We should follow up the first Apollo landing with a sound
    program of manned lunar exploration.
       â€œThird-We should proceed with the development and experimental
    operation of a permanent U.S. space station in earth orbit.
       â€œFourth-We should move out steadily in the exploration of deeper
     space, exploring the planets with unmanned probes and the sun, stars,
    and galaxies from orbital observatories outside the atmosphere.
       â€œFifth-We should provide the technology for developing the full
    potential of US. civil and military aeronautics.
       â€œSixth-We should maintain a strong momentum of broad techno-
    logical advance in all aerospace disciplines.â€
       Although NASAâ€™s   1970 budget was â€œ â€˜holdingâ€™ budget,â€ Dr. Paine
    said request did include funds for starting three principal new pro-
    grams: Earth Resources Technology Satellite Program, with start of
    ERTS A and B development; NERVA flight-weight engine development,
    postponed from 1969; and series of planetary explorers for future
    flights to Venus and Mars.
       In period of â€œretrenchment and declining resources,â€ FY 1969
    operating budget was $762 million below FY 1968 budget and over
    $1 billion below FY 1967. Nationwide employment on NASA work had
    decreased from earlier peak of 420,000 to 2â€™70,000 at end of FY 1968,
    to about 215,000 at end of FY 1969, and under FY 1970 budget to

    awed the on-looker.
        â€œAt the moment of ignition, it was not what lay beyond the astro-

    slowly into a furnace of its own making.
       â€œBut with yesterdayâ€™s flawless Apollo 9 launch, the Saturn V booster

∞  Time magazine said Astronaut Frank Borman had amused audiences
    during February 1969 European tour by claiming Apollo 8 astronauts
     deserved overtime pay because they had aged about 300 microseconds
    more than people on earth during moon mission. At NASAâ€™s         request,
     Univ. of Maryland physicist Carroll Alley had calculated effects on
    astronauts of phenomena described in Einsteinâ€™s relativity equations-
     time ran slower for object as its speed increased, and time accelerated
     for object as it moved away from body exerting gravitational force.
     Alley found Apollo 8 spacecraft speed was predominant factor when
     it was within 4,000 mi of earth; time slowed and astronauts actually
     aged more slowly. Beyond 4,000 mi, effects of earthâ€™s gravity lessened
     as Apolloâ€™s time passed 300 microseconds faster than earthâ€˜s.
         Despite Alleyâ€™s calculations, said Time, Bormanâ€™s claim was valid
     only for Astronaut William A. Anders, who made his first space flight
     on Apollo 8. Astronauts Borman and James A. Lovell had been crew-
     mates on Dec. 4-18, 1965, Gemini VZZ, when time dilation effect was
     dominant for entire two weeks. They had aged less than those on
     earth by 400 microseconds. Lovellâ€™s time also had been slowed during
     four-day Gemini XZZ mission Nov. 11-15, 1966, by about 100 micro-
     seconds. â€œThus,â€ said Time, â€œduring all their missions in space, Lovell
     and Borman respectively spent 200 and 100 microseconds less time
      than was recorded on earth-which means they were paid for more
     time than they actually worked.â€ (Time, 3/7/69, 42)

     realize that while 589 unmanned satellites have been launched, there
     have been only 29 manned flights, eleven by the USSR and eighteen
     by the USA. These few experiments have shown that we have the
     capability to extend manâ€™s genius into the new dimrnsion of space,

     that cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and the processes re-
     sponsible for concentrating ore deposits. The orbits of Apollo 8 and
     the Lunar Orbiters were disturbed by mass concentrations beneath the
     circular lunar seas. These may be huge meteors that struck the moon
     with such force that they melted and sank into the interior, or they
     may be iron deposits.
        â€œAnother objective of lunar exploration is to learn about man as a
     space explorer-his capabilities and limitations. Some day man will
     move on to other planets; the moon is a training ground. . . . We donâ€™t
     have the basic information which early lunar landings will furnish
     and we can only speculate today about the feasibility of the moon as a
     base for an observatory or a permanent science station-about exploit-
     ing its environment of low gravity and high vacuum-about its poten-
                                    .

    my view is to find new ways of organizing and managing the great
     wealth of that continent to overtake, if you like, major American and
     Soviet space and other programs. This is the space-age challenge to
    Europe: not the â€˜technology gapâ€™ but the â€˜management gap.â€™ â€
        Dr. Paine also said, if 1969, 1971, and 1973 space probes should find
     â€œvery exciting things about Mars, it is possible that we or the Russians
    might want to move a manned interplanetary expedition to a higher
    order of national priority. At the present time, the best guess is that
    this would not take place until the mid 1980â€™s but new priorities might
    lengthen or shorten this period.â€
       In reply to question on man-in-space justification, he said: â€œFor
    almost any simple specific experiment . . . an automated probe can
    be developed to do it at lower cost. The basic question here is the
    difference between short-range research projects to achieve simple
    specific objectives, and complex research aimed at developing general

    Lecture at MIT as 1968-69 Jerome Hunsaker Professor of Aeronau-
  . tical Engineering. Describing origins and development of US. space
    program as well as decision-making and implementation in commit-
    ment to manned lunar landing, paper would be presented also at Univ.
    of Maryland March 20 and at LeRC April 24.
        Citing need for set of national goals, Dr. Seamans defined national
    agenda for allocation of R&D that might be acceptable to man in street:
    understanding, forecasting, and controlling environment; supplying
    basic resources of food, fuel, minerals, and water; improving quality
    of life ; improving transportation ; improving communications; encour-
    aging economic growth; and assisting international development and
    providing national security.
        Space program contributed to all categories. Studies of sunâ€™s trans-
    missions, of Mars and Venus atmospheres, of moonâ€™s origin, and of
    earth itself contributed to understanding of environment for practical
    use of man. Space R&D might aid search for alternative basic resources;
     it could establish facilities for detecting available resources and speed
    communications to meet problems. Biological and medical investiga-
    tions in space program held greatest promise in study of reactions of
    biological specimens, animals, and man. Impact on education had been
     cited by some as greatest value of space exploration. Program had re-
     quired in-depth investigation of waste management, fire prevention,
     materials development, and microminiaturization. Space technology
     influenced new vehicles being tested for transportation-hydrofoil
     ships, surface-effect and air-cushion vehicles, high-speed trains, electric
     cars, VTOL and V/STOL aircraft, jumbo subsonic aircraft, and super-
     sonic aircraft.
        Communications satellites, already in commercial use, ultimately
     could broadcast directly to home receivers. In international coopera-
    .. NASA was working with 64 nations in space activity. Returns from
     tion,
             scientific satellites and communications satellites, development

   from landing, storing samples for study and distribution to scientists.
    Institute, funded by NASA and administered through NAS by Rice Univ.,
   would facilitate lunar research by nonspace scientific community,
    Administrator Robert C. Wimberley said in interview. Directed by
   William C. Rubey, Institute was soon to be turned over to consortium
    of universities.
       U.S. Public Health Service, NAS, Dept. of Interior, Dept. of Agri-
    culture, and NASA had planned 30-day quarantine and study of moon
    material and 21-day quarantine of astronauts. Samples would be sealed
    on lunar surface and would be flown from recovery carrier to Labora-
    tory after spacecraft return. Astronauts were to be transferred from
    spacecraft into sealed van through plastic tunnel aboard carrier [see
    May 161. Van would be delivered to nearest port and then flown to
    Houston to sealed-off laboratory. Objective was to prevent importing
    viruses, some of which had been known to survive thousands of years
    under unlikely conditions.
        During three-week debriefing, crew would live in glassed-in quarters
    including medical area. Samples would be maintained under vacuum
    seals until opened in high-vacuum chambers containing remotely con-

    established as necessary today. The lead times are too great.
     The uncertainties as to the future world situation and the precise
    nature of future defense needs are also too great. I believe that the
    approach should be to consider carefully what our long-term national
    security posture would be ten to fifteen years from now if by then
    the United States has developed a space station capability and the
    logistics or â€˜space shuttIeâ€™ system necessary to utilize it, and compare

        Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force and former
    NASA Deputy Administrator, said: â€œAlthough similar space technology
    is used in Apollo Applications and the Manned Orbiting Laboratory,
    there is no unnecessary duplication in the experiments planned. These
    activities require different equipment, different orbits and different
    timing. I believe that any attempt to combine the two programs would
    jeopardize the returns to each agency and would ultimately increase
    the cost. There is a distinct need to continue with manned space
     operations under both military and nonmilitary auspices. Cooperation
    between NASA and DOD has been close, and will continue.â€ (Text)

     for Orville of fifty thousand dollars. We will have about twenty-four
     billion dollars invested in our first five-hundred-thousand-mile trip for
     three astronauts to the moon, giving a cost of only about sixteen
     thousand dollars per seat mile. We are ahead of the Wright Brothers-
     but we have a long way to go to catch up with the DC-8 or 707. If
     subsequent flights to the moon cost two hundred million dollars each,

       â€œIt is no criticism of the       crew that after five days of brilliant

    be compared with driest deserts of earth, he said: â€œIf you took all the
    water we found and laid it out over the whole planet, it would be only
     1,OOOth of an inch thick. Mars may still not be a great place to live,
    but thereâ€™s a chance of life there.â€ Photos to be taken by Mariner VZ

    taneously. According to Boeing engineers, cyclic pitch would eliminate
    need for horizontal tail rotor for pitch control in hovering and slow

    month, 193-mi1lion-miy direct-ascent trajectory toward Mars-NASAâ€™s
     second mission to fly past Mars during 1969 launch window. Launch
    vehicle performance was nominal. Spacecraft separated from Centaur,
     deployed its four solar panels, and locked its sensors on sun and star
    Vega. Because of several minor spacecraft anomalies during launch,
    spacecraft was kept in sun-Vega cruise while performance was eval-
    uated. Star-lock override command was transmitted to spacecraft April
    1; Canopus was acquired as planned initially and Mariner VI1 entered
    stable cruise mode. Midcourse maneuver was conducted April 8 to
     ensure that spacecraft would fly within 1,900 mi (3,057.7 km) of Mars

       Primary mission objective was to fly by southern hemisphere and
     polar regions of Mars to set basis for future experiments, particularly
    those relevant to search for extraterrestrial life. As secondary mission

     Flight, chaired by Dr. Charles H. Townes, published Proceedings of the
      Winter Study on Uses of Manned Space Flight, 1975-1985, Vol. I-
     Proceedimgs: NASA program for next two decades must project state of
     technology for that period. Program must be balanced in use of
     manned and automated operations. â€œThe benefits to the nation, both
     internal and international, dictate that the United States remain in the
     forefront of all major categories of space activities,â€ space sciences,
     cxploration of solar system, manned space flight capability, and eco-
     nomic applications of space flight.
         Study said it was reasonable to use yz% to 1% of GNP to support
     civilian space flight program of which major elements were: (1) ag-
     gressive automated planetary exploration program as recommended by
     NAS-NRC Space Science Board, with options for manned phase to follow
     early automated phase; (2) economic applications program as recom-
     mended by 1968 Summer Study on Space Applications by NAS; (3)
     continuation of lunar exploration after Apollo landing as recommended
     by Lunar and Planetary Missions Board of NASA; (4) vigorous pro-
     gram of astronomical observations in earth orbit as recommended by
     NASA Astronomy Missions Board; and (5) extension of manned space
     flight capability in earth orbit to longer duration for scientific and
     technological purposes. Achievement of manned low-cost transporta-
     tion system deserved high priority. Study recommended use of long-
     duration manned space station designed to support men in weightless
     condition â€œunless unexpected biomedical problems are encountered or
     overwhelming engineering advantages for artificial gravity are dis-
     covered.â€ It agreed on advisability of placing observatories and labora-

   ties and the extent of manned attendance desirable in each, must be

        â€œTo provide a focal point for structuring a manned planetary pro-
   gram a target date of 1982 and the Mars landing mode . . . are assumed

March 29: While Nixon Administration warned of $2- to $3-billion cut in
    FY 1970 budget, NASA was asking $100-million increase with good
    chance of approval, James J. Haggerty, Jr., said in Armed Forces
    Journal. â€œNASA officials report a generally warmer reception on Capitol
    Hill as a result of near-flawless performance on all of the manned
    Apollo missions.â€ Apollo 1970 funding represented penultimate install-
    ment on basic program and â€œCongress can at last see light at the end
    of the tunnel.â€ Most important, â€œextra $100-million is a real bargain
                                  ...
    price for the potential benefit    one of those deals that the buyer canâ€™t
    afford to turn down. If you invest a hundred thousand in a magnificent
    home and the contractor demands another thousand to put a roof on it,
    you have little option.â€ Since US. had committed $25 billion to pro-
    gram, â€œit would be questionable economy to settle for less than maxi-
    mum benefit by withholding what amounts to two-fifths of one percent
    of the total.â€ (AFJ, 3/29/69, 21)
March 30: Thomas Oâ€™Toole in Vushington Post said plans for handling
    lunar samples [see March 121 had stirred bitter scientific controversy.
    Tests scheduled at NASAâ€™s    Lunar Receiving Laboratory would last at
    least two months while scientists waited for â€œthe chance to study what
     amounts to a Rosetta stone that could hold the clue to the origin of life
     itself.â€ At close of examination period, NASA would parcel out moon
    rocks to 110 scientists from group of 600 and even â€œchosen fewâ€ had
    no guarantee of receilring piece of moon. LRL official had explained
     that if NASA found, for example, that there was absolutely no evidence
     of radioactive argon, â€œIt would be quite foolish to waste a sample on
              .
     a man . . whose primary goal was to look for radioactive argon.â€
     Scientists also were disturbed over involvement of other Federal
     agencies in lunar sample handling. ( W Post, 3/30/69, A l )

     Research Div. By June 30, 1969, U.S. expected to have spent $50.6

    launch pads and ground support. While US. had worldwide tracking
    system supplemented by ships and electronics-carrying aircraft,
    U.S.S.R. accepted â€œcertain constraints,â€ relying on ships to fill gaps in
    tracking system. U.S. launch vehicles ranged from those lifting 20 lbs
    to Saturn V capable of 285,000-1b lift to low earth orbit. U.S.S.R. still
    used basic ICBM vehicle introduced in 1957, with upper stages added
    to improve performance.
       While NASA program was run on open basis, there was less â€œopen-
    nessâ€ in DOD. U.S.S.R. â€œholds to a minimum advance notice of flights,
                        .
    limits information . . but at least makes a prompt announcement, as-
    signs a name, and gives orbital parametersâ€ of successful launches.
    There seemed little difference between space programs â€œas to general
    purpose and direction.â€ Both placed emphasis on military, though
    little was known of Soviet organization pattern. All â€œreasonable analy-
    ses are fairly convincing that up to this time the Soviet Union has not
    placed nuclear bombs in orbit.â€
       In space applications US. â€œhas held a clear lead from the earlier
    difys.â€ U.S.S.R. â€œhas made a greater relative effort in . . . flights com-
    mitted to lunar and planetary work than the United Statesâ€ but â€œhas
    not gained as good results.â€™â€™
        In future programs, both nations â€œundoubtedly have to face hard
    budget choices before actual hardware can begin.â€™â€™ Soviet goal was
    â€œcomprehensive exploitation of space technology including the explo-
    ration and settlement (where practical) of the planets, along the way
    exploring the Moon in great detail, and using Earth orbital stations for
    a host of practical purposes.â€ While large orbital station would be
                    technical capabilities in late 1970s, beginning of such
    within NASAâ€™s
    capability probably already existed in U.S.S.R., but â€œit would be risky
    to predict whether such a station will appear soon or only after some
    years.â€
        Cooperation of US. and U.S.S.R. in space already existed in ex-
    change of information, treaties, plans for trading space-collected
    weather pictures, plans for joint textbook on space biology, and joint
    efforts in geomagnetism, but no assessment could be made of future
    prospects. (Text)

        Full impact of Oao ZZ data would not be felt for couple of years.
     â€œSome theories on cosmology will have to be modified and others dis-
     carded. Practically all phases of optical astronomy will be affected.â€
     Temperature figures assigned to young, hot stars with masses more
     than 15 times sunâ€™s would require alteration. â€œThese stars are con-
     siderably hotter than 20,000 degrees absolute. They are aging about
     twice as fast as we thought and are burning hydrogen at a very rapid
     rate.â€ OAO data thus far provided argument against steady-state theory
     of universe which maintained universe always looked same, from any
     point at any time, Dr. Code said.

April 5: NASA adoption of field sequential color TV system to relay pictures
    from moon on future Apollo flights was â€œsolaceâ€ to inventor Dr. Peter
     C. Goldmark, president of CBS Laboratories, New York Times said.
    System, employing small revolving filter disc to inject primary colors
     in front of camera, had been rejected by industry and FCC some 15 yrs
     earlier in favor of all-electronic compatible system now in worldwide
    use. Advantage of Goldmark system on moon flights was ability to
    pick up usable color images under exceptionally low levels of light
     intensity-important where stars might be major illumination source.
     Images received from space would then be converted through com-
     patible system for home reception. Dr. Goldmark said system might
    be â€œfirst technological breakthrough that is 28 years old.â€ ( N Y T ,

     Space Activities, Soviet Government report said Soviet scientists had
     paid â€œgreat attentionâ€ to developing methods of detecting signs of life
     on other planets. â€œWith the development of space research, the prob-
     lem of detecting life on the celestial bodies closest to the earth by
     means of space craft is becoming a priority matter. The considerable
      difference between conditions on the surface of the moon, Venus and
     Mars and those in which terrestrial life exists makes it necessary for
     us to extend our knowledge of the limits within which terrestrial life
     and life in general can exist. In this connexion Soviet scientists are
     investigating the possible limits of the existence of life. The absence of
     systematic processes for the movement of matter on the moon obviously
     makes active life on its surface impossible. On Mars, where free liquid
     water is probably absent, life is possible using matter transfer by frost,
     ice in the soil, water vapour and the wind. Examination of the temper-
     ature limits for the existence of life gives rise to a number of consider-
     ations which allow us not to exclude the possibility of the existence of
     life, in for example, the polar regions of Venus.â€ (Text)

     is that the country ought to do both. Certainly after having put all the
    investment into landing a man on the moon and developing the capa-

 April 21: NASAâ€™s                   Explorer XXXVlll (launched July 4, 1968), orbiting at

     3,640-mi altitude, had discovered earth, like Jupiter, sporadically
     emitted low-frequency radio signals, Radio Astronomy Explorer project
     scientist Dr. Robert G. Stone told 1969 spring meeting of US. Na-
     tional Committee of International Union of Radio Science in Wash-
     ington, D.C. â€œIn the radio frequency range below 10 megahertz, the
     Earth looks very much like Jupiter. This suggests that the same
     processes that account for the Jovian radio noise may also be active
     in the Earthâ€˜s magnetosphere.â€ Signals from both planets appeared
     sharply beamed or directed in narrow cone, were quite intense and
     increased in intensity rapidly when observed toward lower frequencies,
     and were impulsive, occurring in rapid but sporadic bursts.
         Explorer XXXVlll also had revealed sun was more active source of
     radio outbursts in lower frequencies than expected, providing unique
     means of studying sunâ€™s outer atmosphere to 36-million-mi distance of
     Mercury orbit. â€œSuch information,â€ Stone said, â€œcould shed further
      light on mystery of Sunâ€™s part in cause of low frequency radio storms
      on the Earth.â€ Explorer XXXVlIlâ€™s four 750-ft-long antennas had
      provided most comprehensive and detailed measurements of cosmic
      radio noise at low frequencies yet available. Information was providing
      first low-frequency maps of radio emissions in Milky Way galaxy,
      showing that most radio emissions originated in plane or disc of Milky
      Way. Satellite had remained stable since orbit despite repeated move-
      ment and had continued to operate successfully. (NASA Release 69-57;

         Advantage of using space for earth resources survey was twofold.
    One was â€œlarge view that it gives you of the earth.â€ Second was
     â€œability to see the same phenomenon, or the same area of the earth
     time and time again, to be able to arrive over this particular spot on
    the earth periodically and observe temporal changes.â€ Apollo 9 experi-

   be made that exploration of the planets is but a logical extension of
   exploration of the moon; that once the space frontier is crossed in 1969
   everything else is evolutionary, not revolutionary. This sort of gradual-
   ism, which is analogous to a girlâ€™s becoming a little bit pregnant, is
   just as effective in the long run as the flamboyant setting of spectacular
   goals, and probably a good bit more feasible in a time when there is
   already much grumbling about pre-occupation with other worlds when

    tinued lunar exploration after first Apollo landings and for continued
    Saturn V production was â€œthat it recognizes the fundamental fact that
    the United States should not and does not plan to stop its further
    development and use of manned space flight.â€
       Early manned lunar landing would allow additional savings of per-
    haps as much as $39 million in amended Apollo budget. Budget in-
    cluded funds for improved scientific equipment for more advanced
    missions to moon and for limited Apollo Applications program. Fund
    cuts would mean some program reorientation as well as delay in Work-
    shop, previously scheduled for mid-1971.

∞ NASA issued RFPS for design and planning studies of 12-manY   earth-orbital
    space station for 1975 with 10-yr operational life, subject to resupply
    of expendables and crew rotation with logistics vehicles. Work also
    would include conceptual design of 50-man space base of specialized
    modules assembled in low earth orbit in late 1970s and early 1980s and
    comparable to scientific and technical research, development, and
    operations center on earth. Modified Apollo and Gemini spacecraft
    would be considered as initial logistics systems if space shuttle did not
    become available in early phase of space station operations. Data from
    studies would be available for final design of future space station if
    program were approved for development. Proposals were due June 9.

        Cal Tech scientist Kip S. Thoren suggested pulsars were subject to
     quakes which accelerated their pulsation. At press interview during
     annual meeting, he said pulsarsâ€™ insides were probably superfluids-
     more liquid than liquid-and were gradually cooling, with crust crys-
     tallization requiring adjustments. ,4djustments, he said, would cause
     â€œpulsequakesâ€ and could result in sudden speedups in pulsar
     periodicity.
        Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold said observations of
     pulsars indicated they slowed down as they aged, with oldest finally
     slowing billionths of seconds per year until they reached periods up to
     almost four seconds. He suggested pulsar radiation might account for
     luminosity of whole galaxies and even produce all cosmic rays detected
     throughout universe, including earth.

     budget.
     for all purposes to $410 million. I am taking action to accomplish this
     reduction without crippling the essential launch team capability or
     drastically impacting the local economy.â€ Savings would be effected
     by: gradual cutback in efforts of contractors supporting design engi-
     neering; phasing down of Boeing technical integration effort ; decelera-
     tion of Apollo/Saturn V launch rate to three manned vehicles annually,
     reducing employment; and greater use of five-day week and two-shift
     schedule, permitting stabilization of employment level at 18,500 by
     June 30, 1970, instead of current 23,500.
        KSC strength would remain at 80% of current level, with reduction
     in support and stage contractors. Civil service cadre would drop from
     2,920 to 2,880 by June 30, 1970. Employment already had been frozen
     at current level.
        Saturn IB Apollo Applications missions would require increased em-
     ployment at Launch Complexes 34 and 37 in 1971, with estimated
     increase in contract jobs of 2,600 to handle nearly simultaneous or

    base for outward looking space science programs of the future.â€ It
    might eventually support large optical telescopes. There was strong
    evidence â€œthat the most ideal location for large radio telescopes will
    eventually be the far side of the moon. This may be the only place
     within our convenient reach where the earth, which will become in-
    creasingly noisy as a radio source, may be completely screened out. In
    addition, the lunar surface presents us with a very large stable base,

    Their Role in Space Research, report by Committee on Rocket Research
     recommending that NASA increase annual expenditures on rocket re-
    search to $27 million by 1971 and thereafter restore its earlier policy
    of increasing support 12% per year; that NSF, Naval Research Labora-
    tory, and USAF immediately increase their support by 36%, and then
    maintain an annual 12% increase until 1975; and, additionally, that
    support for rocket research be increased by appropriate ratio to com-
    pensate for any reduction in satellite support.
       Report noted sounding rockets were responsible for dozens of major
    scientific discoveries, including discovery of solar x-rays emanating
    from millionth-degree corona of sun; for mapping of solar spectrum
    and structure of earthâ€™s atmosphere; and for existence of three new

     progressive one, nuclear energy will play an increasingly important
     role. As payloads become larger and energy requirements become
     greater to move these payloads farther from the earth, the nuclear
     rocket will become a workhorse propulsion system. As we move farther
     from the sun or as the power requirements increase for the more so-
     phisticated payloads, electric power generated from radioisotopes or

    of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Although specific commitment to a
    particular mission or missions has not been made for the initial ve-
    hicles to be produced under this budget amendment, it was the judg-
    ment of the Space Task Group that this vehicle represented a unique
    and valuable resource that we would undoubtedly wish to continue to
    use, at least through the mid-1970s. Because of the long lead times in-
    volved in a vehicle of this size, action is necessary now if we are to
    have follow-on vehicles produced and available by 1973 and after.â€

    hensive summary of scientific research in space science in U.S. during

     in the United States continues to be with the Earth, its environment,
     the Sun, interactions of solar and terrestrial phenomena, the Moon and

     there is a trend toward increasing emphasis on the use of space ve-
    hicles for stellar and galactic astronomy, especially in areas of the
     electromagnetic spectrum for which the atmosphere is essentially
     opaque. The successful operation of the Orbiting Astronomical Ob-

 ∞ In Science, Leonard D. Jaffe, Surveyor data analysis manager at JPL,
    cited important findings of five Surveyor spacecraft which softlanded
     on lunar surface: surface of both maria and highlands was covered
    with layer of particulate material of 10-micrometer particles scattered
     with rocks and clods; layer was few meters deep in maria and varied
     from few centimeters to tens of meters in highlands, with density and
     other properties varying with depth; p.articulate material had cohesion;
     fine material moved gradually downhill; freshly exposed fine material
     from below surface was darker than previously exposed surface mate-
     rial; density of surface rock was 2.8 & 0.4 gr per cc; composition of
    surface material was approximately that of basalt (mare material had
     elemental composition like high-iron basalt; highland material, like
     low-iron basalt; not more than one-quarter volume percent of metallic
     iron was present) ; lunar surface material had experienced extensive
     melting and chemical differentiation. (Science, 5/16/69, 775-8)

   nodding, rocking, and twisting head-would be done to point just
   below threshold of illness until normal adaptation occurred. Since
   pilots who regularly performed drastic maneuvers in aircraft seldom

May 18-26: NASAâ€™s    Apollo 10 (AS-505), first lunar orbital mission with
    complete Apollo spacecraft, was successfully launched from KSC Launch
    Complex 39, Pad B, at 12:49 pm EDT by Saturn V booster. Flight
    carried three-man crew and CSM-106 and LM-4. Primary objectives
    were to demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support facilities
    during manned lunar mission with CSM and LM and to evaluate LM
    performance in cislunar and lunar environment.
       Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft-carrying Astro-
    nauts Thomas P. Stafford (commander), John W. Young (CM pilot),
    and Eugene A. Cernan ( LM pilot) -entered initial parking orbit with
    118.1-mi (189.9-km) apogee and 114.6-mi (184.4km) perigee. Check-
    out followed lunar trajectory insertion; then CSM, code-named Charlie
    Brown, separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB) and LM, code-
    named Snoopy. Crew successfully transposed CSM and docked with LM.
    Excellent quality color TV coverage of docking sequences was trans-
    mitted to Goldstone tracking station and seen on worldwide commercial
    TV. Crew extracted LM from S-IVB and conducted 1st SPS burn. All
    launch vehicle safing activities were performed as scheduled and suc-
    cessful propellant dump provided impulse to S-IVB for slingshot
    maneuver to earth-escape velocity.
       On second day, first midcourse maneuver was not required. Crew
    conducted midcourse maneuver number two, which was so accurate
    that third and fourth maneuvers were canceled. Five color TV trans-
    missions totaling 72 min and showing excellent views of receding earth
     and spacecraft were made during translunar coast. Spacecraft entered
    moonâ€™s sphere of influence on fourth day, May 21, at 61:50 GET.
     Crew conducted first lunar orbit insertion maneuver with 356-sec
     SPS burn to reduce speed to 5,474 fps and place spacecraft in initial
     lunar orbit with 196.1-mi (315.5-km) apolune and 68.6-mi (110.4-km)
     perilune. Second LOI maneuver, 13.9-sec SPS burn, circularized orbit
    with 70.8-mi (113.9-km) apolune and 67.8-mi (109.1-km) perilune.

    surface. Cernan transferred to LM at 81:55 GET for two hours of house-
    keeping activities and communications test.
       On fifth day Stafford and Cernan entered LM and checked out all
    systems before firing SM reaction control system thrusters to separate
    CSM and LM about 30 ft and again for 2.3-mi separation. LM descent
    propulsion system burn propelled LM to within 9.6 mi of lunar surface
    over landing site No. 2. Crew had no difficulty identifying landmarks
    and Stafford said, â€œIt looks like all you have to do is put your tail
                                  ..   . The craters [around No. 2 landing

    site] look flat and smooth at the bottom. It should be real easyâ€ for
    Apollo 11 landing. LM crew took numerous photos of lunar surface and
    provided continuous commentary on their observations after cameras
    malfunctioned. Astronauts described volcanoes and light-colored craters
    that glowed as if lit by radioactive substance.
       Crew conducted LM radar test during low-altitude pass which indi-
    cated 47,000-ft pericynthian (lowest point in orbit). DPS phasing burn
    raised apocynthian (orbital high point) to 218.6 mi (351.7 km). LM
    descent stage was jettisoned and RCS separation maneuver and staging
    were accomplished. Anomaly in automatic abort guidance system
    caused LM ascent stage to undergo extreme gyrations. By taking over
    manual control, Stafford reestablished proper attitude. APS insertion
    maneuver burn at pericynthian established equivalent of standard LM
    insertion orbit of lunar landing mission (51.8 by 12.9 mi), where LM
    coasted for one hour. Concentric sequence initiation at apocynthian,
    constant-delta-height maneuver, and terminal maneuver were con-
    ducted. LM successfully docked with CSM at 106:33 GET, after eight-
    hour separation; and LM crew returned to CSM.
        On sixth day LM ascent stage was jettisoned; its batteries burned to
    depletion and it entered solar orbit. Crew made 18 landmark sightings
     and took extensive stereo and oblique photos of moon. Two scheduled
    TV periods were deleted because of crew fatigue and crew rested and
    prepared for return to earth. SPS burn at 137:36 GET injected CSM into
    transearth trajectory after 61.5 hrs (31 orbits) in lunar orbit. Ma-
    neuver was so accurate that two other scheduled midcourse maneuvers
    were not necessary. During return to earth astronauts made star-lunar
    landmark sightings, live color TV transmissions, star-earth horizon
    navigation sightings, and CSM S-band high-gain antenna reflectivity
     test. Pictures of moon from receding spacecraft were spectacular.
     Scheduled 10- and 29-min color TV broadcasts of earth, moon, and
     spacecraft interior were later followed by unscheduled TV transmis-
     sion, which provided beautiful pictures of earth and brought total color
     TV broadcasts to 19 transmissions totaling almost six hours.
        On eighth day crew prepared for reentry and SM separated from CM
     on schedule. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred
     as planned. Apollo 10 splashed down in Pacific at 12:52 pm EDT May
      26, 3.4 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Princeton 192 hrs 3 min after
     launch and precisely on time. Crew was picked up and reached re-
     covery ship at 1 :31 pm EDT.
        All primary Apollo 10 mission objectives and detailed test objectives
     were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed
     according to plan, with only minor discrepancies, which were corrected.
     Flight crew performance was outstanding; all three crew members

   of a large permanent space station, a laboratory in the sky.â€

∞  Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorial on Apollo 10 color TV pictures:
    â€œOf all the visions man sees from his new and precarious vantages in
     space, the most compelling is still the planet from which he comes. In
    the eye of Apollo 10â€™s color TV camera, Earth is indeed the fairest
    object, the â€˜oasisâ€™ the Apollo 8 astronauts saw last Christmas on
    Earthâ€™s first manned mission to the moon.
          â€œFor a stranger entering the solar system from the outer reaches of
    the Universe, surely Earthâ€™s mist-shrouded blues, browns and reds
     would be a goal to satisfy the utmost yearning. Set against the cold
     blackness of space, it would be a prize to draw bold and venturesome
     inhabitants of other planets across incredible distances. It would be a
    goal courageous strangers would endure incredible hardships to
         .
     win. . .

          â€œThe awe expressed by the intrepid Apollo 10 astronauts . is
     further reminder that the greatest space prize presently within manâ€™s
     comprehension is already in his keeping. And it is one to leave man
     wondering whether beings on other planets strive and dream as he
     does. For the moment certainly, it would not seem so. For what people
     on another planet could resist the vision in the eye of Apollo 10â€™s TV
     camera? â€ (P Bull, 5/20/69)

     there in their own living rooms with their television sets before them
     and, at the same moment more than 22,000 miles away, observing the
     planet on which they live.
          â€œWhat we saw with such marvelous cold clarity was, of course, a
     round and mottled swirl of blue, brown and white, a small fragment of
     the cosmos which until less than a decade ago had fixed absolute limits
     upon all of mankindâ€™s history. Now suddenly we saw it as a unity, a
     whole, as the habitation common to all of us, just as it would be seen
     by a non-human visitor approaching it as the astronauts are approach-
     ing the moon, silent, mysterious and seemingly lifeless and motionless.

     PostApoElo Space Program: An AIAA View. While â€œremarkable prog-

     about manâ€™s ability to travel in space and return safely,â€ programâ€™s
     magnitude had overshadowed â€œvery solid accomplishmentsâ€ of un-

     inception ; neglected â€œgrowing accumulation of feasible, but unde-
     veloped technologyâ€ in space vehicle design that could affect space
     transportation costs; and failed to specify goals beyond manned lunar
     landing.
        Report rejected single national space objective for next decade. It
     recommended programs to determine manâ€™s usefulness in space over
     prolonged periods and to reduce cost of manned operations and urged

     program. It urged planning and funding for communications data

    change the history of mankind. That is the way of most turning points
    in human history. The Manhattan Project which resulted in the atomic

    doing it first. It launched the atomic age. Johann Gutenberg found a
    way to print with movable type for the simple reason that he wanted

 ∞ Science magazine published letter from Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) ,
    Chairman of Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications of
    House Committee on Science and Astronautics, clarifying his views on
    cost effectiveness evaluation of Earth Resources Satellite system. He
    reiterated opinion he stated in Dec. 1968 Earth Resources Satellite
    System report: â€œPrecise determination of cost effectiveness at this early
                               ...
     stage . . . is not possible.      The magnitude of the economic benefits
    simply cannot be calculated in the absence of the type of data which
    the system is designed to produce.â€ Conclusions of studies already
    completed had constituted â€œstrong evidence that precision was not pos-
                                                                      .
    sible. Yet, I am reassured by the fact that all such studies . . have
    concluded that the potential economic benefits will exceed the costs of
     such a system by a substantial margin and some predict that benefits
     will someday be measured in billions of dollars annually. It is my per-
     sonal conviction that an operational ERS system will ultimately prove
    highly cost-effective.â€
        Karth said he considered it â€œNASA% responsibility to experiment with
     new space systems that appear to have potential, and to conduct the
     necessary research and development which will lead to a firm founda-
     tion for a subsequent determination as to whether operational systems
     should be built. In this context, I believe cost effectiveness is not an
     appropriate standard to apply in advance to NASAâ€™s    experimental work,
     though it is certainly applicable when the time comes to decide whether
     to go forward wi+ an operational system.â€ (Science, 5/30/69, 1009)

During May: Space/Aeronautics said: â€œReshaping of the budget, in com-
    bination with a flurry of new activity among NASA, the Air Force and
    the Presidentâ€™s in-house and specially commissioned science advisors,
    has left no doubt that the Administration favors continuation of a
    strong manned space flight program and a total space effort much
     more national in character than the current one. The latter point in-
     volves greater pressure on the Air Force and NASA to bring their future
     programs together, particularly in the space station and support areas.
         â€œAlthough manned space flight was the clear victor in the Repub-
     lican amendments to the NASA budget, the surgery on the unmanned
     sectors was artfully performed.â€ Although $41 million was cut from
     OSSA, none of it came from Earth Resources Survey satellite program.
     Although $14 million was cut from OART, none came at expense of
     NERVA program. Only notable individual reductions in areas other
     than manned space flight came in deferral of Sunblazer program, can-
     cellation of Biosatellite-F, and deferral for one year of new Planetary
     Explorer project. In net increase in OMSF, NASA essentially traded off
     slippage in AA program for resumption of Saturn V production and
     insurance that lunar exploration would continue into early 1970s.

    face intact in May. Data radioed from two spacecraft suggested terrain
     was very uneven, with height differences of more than 50,000 ft. Re-

    Venus Oct. 18, 1967, had not relayed data from Venusian surface, but
    had apparently been crushed during descent by extreme atmospheric
     pressure. â€œThe pressure might have pushed in the upper lid of the in-
     strument department and affected the instruments of the radio com-
     plex,â€ Tass said. Data suggested that Veiius V had descended over deep
     basin where temperature was almost 1,000â€F and pressure was 140
     times that on earth. VeiLus VI had descended over plateau where tem-
     perature was 750Â°F and pressure was 60 times that on earth. Since
     spacecraft had not been designed to withstand pressures greater than
     25-27 times that on earth, they had not sent data from below 12 mi.

     and 82.0â€™ inclination.
        Primary mission objective was to conduct correlative studies of
     latitude-dependent atmospheric phenomena during period of maximum
     solar activity. Secondary objectives were to search for celestial hydro-
     gen Lyman-alpha radiation, conduct neutron and cosmic-ray observa-
     tions, measure solar uv and x-ray radiation, make detailed observations
     of VLF radio emissions, and exceed one year of active, three-axis sta-

     â€œWhile few tears . . . will be shed for MOL, the process by which it
     fell from grace deserves scrutiny. Many of the suggestions for taming
     the defense budget have posited some kind of non-Pentagon review
     mechanism, either inside or outside government. Yet MOL lost its place
     not through such a review but through intense general pressure, which
     became focused inside the Pentagon upon this particular item. The
     choice of which project to save, which to sacrifice, was made by the
     military on the basis of an obscure bureaucratic struggle with high
     Darwinian overtones. Like the brontosaurus, MOL came upon the
     tougher conditions of a new environment and was found unfit to sur-
     vive. This may be an effective way to exercise a measure of occasional
     control over a swollen defense budget, but it is a crude way and one
     not at all guaranteed to leave the right elements intact. Both the spend-

    in the missile age are often the same people who refer to our alleged
    440-1 superiority over the Soviets in individually targeted warheads.â€
    Ratio would be â€œnearly 1-to-1, with total payload running heavily
    against us, if it were not for our bomber force with its multiple
    weapons on each aircraft. If our bombers are to continue to provide
    deterrence, they must be able to survive an attack and then penetrate
    the ever-improving Soviet defenses. The B-52 is still a good aircraft,
     but the prototype was flying in 1952 and the latest models were pro-
    duced in 1962. An advanced bomber will take advantage of the many
    improvements that have been made in airframe and engine design. It
    would have short take-off and landing capability needed for dispersal
    and payload, structure, and speed necessary for penetration.â€
       In security terms, space age presented dangers, but also afforded
    opportunities for increasing strategic stability. â€œEach generation of
    space vehicles will provide additional improvements in our ability to
    monitor enemy activities. We are now working on a satellite early
    warning system that would detect missiles as they are launched from
     land or sea. With the aid of such a warning system a dispersed bomber
     force would be able to take off from its bases before the impact of
    enemy weapons, even if the time of flight of the latter were greatly

   80% nitrogen) -being used for first time-with          sea-level pressure
    (14.7 psi) and 75Â°F temperature. Primary objective was to provide
   suitable physiological environment for instrumented monkey and
   measure functioning of central nervous system or cardiovascular and
   metabolic systems. Secondary objective was to evaluate monkeyâ€™s per-
   formance in orbit. Monkey was carefully instrumented so that scientists
   could monitor wave patterns from 10 brain areas for first detailed
    studies of brain activity in orbit ever made. Scientists would also
    record heart action and respiration, monitor circulatory and urinary
    systems, and observe performance on two behavioral tasks-short-term

        Developing lunar landing technology was relatively easy. â€œThe laws
    of nature which made it possible have been well known for a long

    brilliantly organized. Hundreds of thousands of Americans worked
    together to make this dream come true. They had faith and they had
    hope.
        â€œThe problems of our cities and the other social problems which be-
    set us are not all that easy. In this area human beings are not working
    together but are in conflict. We find that we do not yet know the cause
    of these troubles nor do we yet have the mechanisms for curing them.
    Hence we must study, we must experiment, we must try and we will
                .

  ∞ Analysis of lunar surface would provide key to earthâ€™s history by indi-
    cating whether moonâ€™s origin was catastrophic or noncatastrophic, Dr.
    H. Alfv5n and Dr. G. Arrhenius of Univ. of Californiaâ€˜at San Diego
    said in Science. Radiometric dating of igneous lunar rocks might pro-
     vide information on time of their solidification. If catastrophic alterna-
     tive was correct, rocks should date to less than 4.5 eons, minimum age
     of moon, and predominant age should be approximately 0.7 eon, with
     major surface and subsurface features less than 0.7 eon. If noncata-
     strophic alternative proved correct, predominant age of lunar rocks
     should exceed 4 eons, at least, since it was likely moon predated earth.

July 5: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong (commander), Edwin E.
       
     Aldrin, Jr. (LM pilot), and Michael Collins ( C M pilot) held press con-
     ference at MSC. Astronauts were seated 50 f t from nearest newsmen and
     were partially enclosed in plastic booth as part of plan to limit crewâ€™s
     contacts during 21 days immediately preceding flight and prevent de-
     velopment of illness. Collins told press that from CM viewpoint, Apollo
     11 should not be very different from previous manned Apollo missions.
     He did not feel â€œslightest bit frustratedâ€ about going to moon without
                                        .  . percent of the way there, and that

         LM flight plan would pick up where Apollo 10 left off with phasing
     maneuver, Aldrin explained. There would be number of â€œfirstsâ€: â€œthe
     ultimate test,â€ actual touchdown; 1/6 g environment; new thermal
     conditions; two-man EVA on lunar surface; sleeping in LM on moon;
     star sighting technique with alignment telescope on lunar surface; and

     quite easy to perform. â€œIt looks like we shouldnâ€™t have too much diffi-
     culty in moving at something like 6, 8, or 10 miles per hour.â€
        Armstrong said crew would use â€œsomewhat hybrid methods of
    manual and automaticâ€ for descent to moon. â€œThe predicted method at
    this point, although we have a great deal of flexibility and choice,
     based on the situation at the time, would be to maintain manual con-
     trol of attitude and automatic control of throttle through the final de-
     scent from an altitude of somewhere between 500 and 1000 feet until
     such time as the automatic throttle rated descent was unsatisfactory, at

     manner like a normal VTOL machine.â€
        Code names for CM and LM had been selected as â€œrepresentative of
     the flight, the nationâ€™s hope,â€ Armstrong revealed. LM would be called
     â€œEagleâ€ for US. national emblem, and CM would be called â€œColumbiaâ€
     for U S . symbol, statue on top of Capitol, and Jules Verneâ€™s fictional
     spacecraft, â€œColumbiad,â€ which flew to moon 100 yrs ago. (Tran-

     absolutely necessary condition for life to flourish,â€ and fact that earth
     had experienced lunar material samples from secondary meteorites.
     Main purpose of quarantine was â€œto protect the samples from earthly
     contamination-not altogether successfully, in view of the exhalations

     While 4,514 hrs of weightlessness endured by US. astronauts in space
     had produced no serious medical problems, on moon â€œwe will be plac-
     ing men in an entirely new environment.â€ After four days of weight-
     lessness, they would step onto surface where gravity field was one-sixth
     that of earth.

     Apollo 11 astronautsâ€™ heart rate, oxygen consumption, and temperature
     of water that cooled spacesuits. Preflight physicals had enabled doctors
     to draw metabolic profile of each astronaut, including work capacity
     on earth at various heart rates, oxygen consumption, and body heat
     generated. â€œWe know the heat production level which the portable life
     support system can handle without being overburdened. If it reaches
     that point for five minutes, we will tell the astronauts to stop and rest.â€™â€™
     Because of spacesuitsâ€™ bulk astronauts would start with simple tasks
     and work up to tougher ones. Excitement could affect ability to sleep
     in four-hour rest period planned before lunar walk. â€œWe might have to
     make a real-time decision on whether to give them a sleeping pill or
     perhaps a stimulant.â€

   on lunar landing mission:
       Los Angeles Herald-Examiner: â€œIt is with an almost breathless sense
   of awe that we await tomorrowâ€™s blast-off from Cape Kennedy-the
   launching of three space explorers on the most ambitious and fearsome
   adventure in all human history. Mere words cannot capture the im-
   mensity of the flight of Apollo 11. Quite literally, man will be attempt-
   ing a final break of the chains which have bound him to this earth.â€
    (LA Her-Exam, 7/15/69)
       Newport News, Va., Times-Herald: â€œNow, this triumph of human
   courage and knowledge stands poised on the threshold of accomplish-
   ment. For a few fleeting moments, the attention of the world will follow
    the Eagle as it ferries its two astronauts toward a destiny until now
    only dreamed of in our history. Then, most probably, our attention
    will filter back to the pressing problems on earth.â€ (Times-Herald,
    7/15/69)
       Milwaukee Journal: â€œApollo 11s providing insight into the mean-
    ing of life and the imperatives of human society. It is forcing us to
    face the grim paradox of exploiting human reason and the marvels of
    machinery to soar into the majesty of space while the world becomes
    fragmented into selfish national sovereignties-some armed, some arm-
    ing, with the hideous capacity to end life itself.â€ (Milwaukee Journal,
    7/15/69)
       Denver Post: â€œThe Soviet attempt to send an unmanned spaceship to
    the moon in advance of Apollo 11 is a bold bid to draw attention to

    Soviet space prowess. But even if it succeeds . . in mechanically
    scooping up samples of the moon and returning to earth, the Soviet
    project will not overshadow the American mission. Instead, the Soviet
    flight will serve to underscore the expensive duplication of effort cre-
    ated by the space race. If the Russians and Americans had cooperated,
    rather than competed, the risks and the costs involved in landing a
    man on the moon would have been far less.â€ (Denver Post, 7/15/69)
       Washington Evening Star: Soviet Luna XV seemed strangely timed.
    During their Moscow discussions on space cooperation, U.S.S.R. Presi-
    dent Nikolay V. Podgorny had not given Astronaut Frank Borman
     â€œslightest hint that the Kremlin was planning to send an unmanned
    spacecraft to the moon to coincide with the history-making Apollo 11
    American mission.â€ Was it really possible â€œto work together in space
     exploration with a country that seems to be playing tricks with ours
     at a moment when we are engaged in a historic effort to land men on
    the moon?â€ (W Star, 7/15/69, A12)

July 16-24: Apollo 11 (AS-506) manned lunar landing mission flown by
     NASA achieved eight-year national goal set by President Kennedy May
     25, 1961. On July 20, spacecraft's LM-5, Eagle, landed on lunar sur-
      face and first man stepped out onto moon. Two astronauts performed
      assigned tasks on lunar surface before reentering LM to lift off from
      moon, redock with CSM-107, Columbia, and return safely to earth.
         July 16-19: Mission began at 9:32 am EDT July 16, when spacecraft
     was launched from KSC Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by Saturn V 506
      booster. Liftoff was relayed live on TV to 33 countries on 6 continents,
      watched by estimated 25 million TV viewers in US., and heard on
      radio by millions of listeners. Launch events occurred as planned and
     spacecraft carried Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong (commander) ,
     Michael Collins ( CM pilot) , and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. ( LM pilot) , into
     circular parking orbit with 118.5-mi (190.7-km) altitude. After post-
      insertion checkout CSM separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB)
      and LM Eagle. Crew successfully transposed CSM and docked with LM,
      ejected CSM/LM from S-IVB, and conducted first SPS burn. Successful
      propellant dump provided impulse to S-IVB for slingshot maneuver to
      earth-escape velocity. Translunar injection maneuver was so accurate
      that first midcourse correction was not required. Midcourse correction
      No. 2, at 26:45 GET, was so accurate that third and fourth maneuvers
      were not necessary.
         Crew conducted two unscheduled color TV broadcasts-for 16 min
      beginning at 10:32 GET (taped for 11:26 GET transmission) and for 50
      min beginning at 30 :28 GET-and one scheduled 36-min transmission
      beginning at 33:59 GET. Broadcasts were very clear and showed earth,
       onboard computer keyboard, and crew. At 55:08 GET (4:40 pm EDT
      July 18) crew began 96-min color TV transmission with excellent pic-
      ture resolution, coverage, and general quality. Viewers in North
      America, South America, Japan, and Western Europe saw live pictures
      of CSM and LM interiors, CSM exterior, and earth and watched crew
      removing probe and drogue, opening spacecraft tunnel hatch, prepar-
      ing food, and housekeeping LM.
         Apollo 11 passed into moon's sphere of influence at 61:40 GET,

July 16-24: Apollo 11â€™s successful manned lunar mission achieved the national goal
set eight years earlier by President John F. Kennedy, who told Congress May 25,
1961: â€œI believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this
decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth.â€


     proach path to Site 2. Armstrong pointed out lunar landmarks and
     described unexplained glow near crater Aristarchus which some scien-
     tists believed to be volcanic activity. Second SPS burn circularized orbit
     with 75.6-mi (121.6-km) apolune and 61.9-mi (99.6-km) perilune.
     Aldrin transferred to LM for two-hour housekeeping, voice and telem-
     etry test, and oxygen-purge-systemcheck.
        July 20-21: Armstrong and Aldrin reentered LM at 95:20 GET and
     checked out all systems before firing SM reaction-control-system
     thrusters to separate CSM and LM on far side of moon. LM descent-
     propulsion-system engine propelled LM to within 9.8 mi (15.8 km) of
     lunar surface. Because LM-powered descent maneuver-initiated            at
     perilune of descent orbit-was about 4.6 mi (7.4 km) downrange from
     planned position, landing point was also shifted downrange. During
     final approach phase, crew noted that landing point to which spacecraft

     down point by controlling attitude manually and adjusting descent rate
     and horizontal velocity. Officials later attributed change in course to
     malfunction in onboard radar and subsequent critical o,verload of com-

     with 16-mm Maurer camera.
        Armstrong took manâ€™s first step on moon at 109:24 GET (10:56 pm
     EDT July 20). Some 600 million viewers on earth-one-fifth  of world

     TV transmission. Armstrong said moon had â€œstark beauty all its ownâ€
     like desert in southwestern US. Lunar surface was â€œfine and pow-
     deryâ€ and could be kicked up loosely. â€œIt adheres like powdered char-
            ..
     coal . but I only go in a small fraction of an inch. I can see my
     footprint in the moon like fine grainy particles.â€ Armstrong checked
     LM exterior and reported penetration of LM footpads into lunar sur-
     face was three to four inches and that strut collapse was minimal.
     Blast of descent engine had not formed crater in surface and about
     one foot of clearance remained between engine bell and lunar surface.
     He reported only problem was seeing his footing in darkness of LM
     shadow. He emplaced microdot containing messages from world lead-
     ers, collected contingency sample of lunar soil near LM ladder, and
     reported that, although surface consisted of soft loose material, mate-
     rial six or eight inches under surface was very hard and cohesive.
     Rocks were very slippery, apparently because vesicles (pores) were
     filled with powdery surface material.
        Armstrong photographed Aldrinâ€™s descent to lunar surface at 11:15
     pm EDT and astronauts unveiled plaque mounted on strut behind
     ladder and read its inscription to their worldwide TV audience:
      â€œHere men from the planet earth first set foot on the moon July 1969,

tripod 40 ft from LM to view subsequent EVA. Aldrin experimented to
assess mobility on moon by walking, running, leaping, and doing two-
footed kangaroo hops between LM and camera. He indicated some
difficulty in maintaining balance but said that his agility was better
than expected and that he was able to move with great ease. Mass of

quite natural and easy. Youâ€™ve just got to be careful landing in

     expressed honor and privilege of representing U S . and world on moon.
        Continuing EVA, Armstrong collected bulk sample of assorted sur-
     face material and selected rock chunks, inspected LM, deployed pas-
     sive seismic experiment package and laser ranging retroreflector, and
     collected two core samples and 20 lbs of discretely selected material.

July 24: Yelcome back to earth: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A . Armstrong, Michael
Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (left to right inside the mobile quarantine facility),
were greeted by President Nixon abmrd the U.S.S. Hornet after their splashdown.

     replica from our Apollo 1 patch with an olive branch.â€ LM docked
                                1
     with CSM at 128:03 GET. Crew transferred with samples and film to
     CSM, and LM ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit. SM reaction-
     control-system separation maneuver placed CSM into orbit with 72.0
     mi (115.9-km) apolune and 63.0-mi (101.4-km) perilune, where crew
     rested and prepared for return to earth.
        July 22-24: crew fired SPS engine at 135:24 GET (12:55 am EDT
     July 22), injecting CSM into transearth trajectory after 59 hrs 28 min
     (30 revolutions) in lunar orbit. Midcourse correction No. 5, at 150:30
     GET, was so accurate that sixth and seventh corrections were not neces-
     sary. During 18-min color TV transmission, crew demonstrated weight-
     lessness of food and water and showed scenes of moon and earth.
     Aldrin showed in-space preparation of ham sandwich and Collins
     showed viewers how to drink water from teaspoon and from water
     gun. Final, 121/-min broadcast at 177:32 GET sent message of appre-
     ciation from each astronaut to all who helped make Apollo 1 mission
                                                                   1

   moved 247.4 mi downrange, where weather was excellent. Parachute
   deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned.
      Apollo 11 splashed down in mid-Pacific at 1 2 5 1 pm EDT July 24,
   15 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Hornet, 195 hrs 19 min after launch.
   Swimmers attached flotation collar and seven-man raft to spacecraft
   and helicopter dropped biological isolation garments, which were
   donned by astronauts inside CM and by one swimmer. Two other
   swimmers moved upwind of CM on another large raft. Postlanding
   ventilation was turned off and CM powered down, and astronauts
   climbed out and helped swimmer close hatch. Swimmer then decon-
   taminated all garments, hatch area, flotation collar, and area around
   postlanding vent valves with Betadine disinfectant. Helicopter carried
   astronauts to recovery ship, where they entered 32-ftslong mobile
   quarantine facility ( MQF) with recovery physician and technician.
   They were congratulated by President Nixon and Dr. Thomas 0.
   Paine, NASA Administrator, who were on board ship. Crew, physician,
   and technician remained inside MQF until it was delivered to Lunar
   Receiving Laboratory (LRL) in Houston July 27.
       CM was retrieved, placed in dolly on board recovery ship, moved
   to MQF, and mated to transfer tunnel. From inside MQF/CM contain-
   ment envelope, MQF engineer removed lunar samples and equipment
   through decontamination lock and CM was sealed until delivery to
   LRL. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown to
   Johnston Island and to Houston for transport to LRL.
      Primary Apollo 11 mission objective-to perform manned landing
   on moon and return-and all detailed test objectives were achieved.
   All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan,
   with only minor, corrected discrepancies. Flight crew performance was
   outstanding; all three crew members remained in excellent health and
   their prevailing good spirits and proficiency were major factors in
   missionâ€™s success. Accomplishments included first manned lunar land-
   ing and return; first lunar surface EVA; first seismometer, laser re-
   flector, and solar wind experiment deployed on moon; first lunar
   soil samples returned to earth; largest U.S. payload ever placed into
   lunar orbit (72,037.6 lbs at lunar orbit insertion) ; acquisition of
   numerous visual observations, photos and TV transmissions of scien-
   tific and engineering significance; and first operational use of MQF
   and LRL.
       Apolto 11 was eighth Apollo mission to date, fifth manned Apollo
   mission, and first manned lunar landing mission. Mission acquired
   major quantities of data for subsequent Apollo flights. First manned
   Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11-22, 1968), had verified operation
    of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. First manned lunar orbital
   mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21-27, 1968), had proved capability of
   Apollo spacecraft and hardware to operate out to lunar distance and
   return through earthâ€™s atmosphere. ApoZlo 9 (March 3-13, 1969) had
   proved capability of LM to operate in space under manned conditions.
   Apollo 10 (May 18-26, 1969) had successfully operated complete
    Apollo spacecraft on lunar orbital mission and had provided major
    quantities of scientific and training materials for ApolZo 11. Apollo
    program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; MSC was

  ∞ In Cape Kennedy interview before Apollo 11 launch, Vice President
     Spiro T. Agnew said, â€œIt is my individual feeling that we should
     articulate a simple, ambitious, optimistic goal of a manned flight to
     Mars by the end of this century. Whether we say it or not, someoneâ€™s
     going to do it.â€
         After liftoff, Vice President told NASA launching team, â€˜â€˜. . . all the
     time I was out there I couldnâ€™t help thinking of you, the people in
     here and all over NASA who have done such a brilliant job in putting
     together the combined effort behind those three gentlemen who are

     the wilderness.â€
         In Washington, D.C., Senate Majority Leader Michael J. Mansfield
      (D-Mont.) told press, â€œI think we have a lot of problems here on
      earth that we must face up to and when we settle those we ought to
     consider future space ventures.â€ Senate Majority Whip Edward M.
     Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, â€œThe Apollo program is for landing a man
     on the moon and exploration and should take another one to two
      years. I think after that the space program ought to fit into our other
     national priorities.â€ (Witkin, NYT, 7/17/69, 1; Transcript, Agnew

      Executive departments and Government agencies would be closed
      and US. flag would be displayed on public buildings.
         With many members at Cape Kennedy, Senate and House met briefly

    Peopleâ€™s Campaign watched launch from bleacher seats with 10,000
    guests including families of Apollo program personnel, while other
     representatives marched outside KSC. Paris Mutch had brought 105
    European businessmen. Some 3,100 press members were at special
    stand. As Apollo spacecraft lifted from launch pad there was some
    applause, but most spectators stared in silence until Saturn V rocket
    disappeared overhead. Afterward many were caught in monumental
    traffic jams. Banana River, five miles south of Launch Complex 39,
    was clogged with several thousand boats registered from New England
    to Texas. (Greider, W Post, 7/17/69, A l ; Weinraub, NYT, 7/17/69,

    so close to the stars and sky.â€
       In Biloxi, Miss., harbor fishermen paused on wharf to hear count-
    down. In Tennessee, tobacco farmers listened to transistor radios in
    fields.
       Washington, D.C., schoolteacher said, â€œThe astronauts didnâ€™t just
    go to the moon. All our minds went to the moon and intellectually
    manâ€™s horizons have jumped leaps and bounds beyond the historical

      rocket expert Dr. Robert H. Goddard â€œwas to the moon rocket what
     the Wright brothers were to the airplane.â€ Guggenheim, administrator
      of Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics during
     period it helped support Dr. Goddardâ€™s research, traced career of
      â€œFather of modern rocketryâ€ from early experiments in 1908. Among
     Goddardâ€™s inventions were: first liquid-fuel rocket, first smokeless
      powder rocket, and first practical automatic steering device for rockets.
      It was no wonder American Rocket Society had conceded to Goddard
      â€œthe almost single-handed development of rocketry â€˜from a vague
      dream to one of the most significant branches of modern engineering.â€™ â€
      He had left â€œtestimony to the power of one solitary individual to effect
      change and to transform the future.â€ While Dr. Goddard had died
      without fame which had accrued to Wright brothers in their lifetime,
      â€œhe died still believing that man would one day shatter the fetters of

     doldrums. Wall Street was â€œbearish about the industry and, from an
     investment standpoint, unenthusiastic about space.â€ Security analysts
     interviewed agreed Apollo 11 would have little effect on long-depressed
     stocks, which commenced decline in 1968; many were selling near
     lows for year. Aerospace industry was chief beneficiary of space pro-
      gram funds, but largest portion of $34 billion spent since 1960 had
     been allocated before â€œreally spectacular shotsâ€ occurred. While
     Apollo program had been â€œtreniendous boon to the aerospace industry
      and to the advancement of technology,â€ it represented small part of

    Dr. M. Ewing of Columbia Univ.â€™s Lamont-Doherty Geological Ob-
    servatory, Dr. F. Press of MIT, and Dr. G. Sutton of Univ. of Hawaii
    explained objective was to detect naturally occurring seismic events
    on lunar surface through early Apollo scientific experiment package
    (EASEP) planted on moon. Package weighed 105 b and would trans-
                                                         s
    mit data to earth one year (or maximum two years), during lunar days
    because its solar cell panels required illumination to provide power.
    Complete Apollo lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP) , contain-
    ing at least three additional experiments for measurements of solar
    wind and magnetic field, would be included on Apollo 12 for day and
    night operation.
       In Apollo 11 experiment astronaut would remove instrument from
    LM to smoothest area within 6.6-9.8 ft (20-30 m) of LM, unfold solar
    panels, adjust package level to within So, orient it with azimuth for
    maximum illumination of solar panels, and aim antenna toward earth.
    MSC would issue commands to uncage and level seismometers and select
    proper gain. Expected sources of lunar seismic activity included several
    hundred monthly moonquakes, thermal stresses produced by rapid
    temperature variations at surface; tidal stresses exerted by earth and
    sun; and meteoroid impacts. By end of Apollo program, scientists
    hoped to have achieved crude curves of travel time for body and
    surface waves and beginning of seismicity map of moon.
       During post-Apollo period, seismologists wanted to achieve wider
    distribution of detectors to map seismically active belts in greater de-
    tail; study mechanisms of energy release; lower minimum detectable
    ground motion of individual seismometer ; and improve performance
    of longperiod seismometer systems at ultralong-period end of spectrum

      in Apollo â€œthat fundamental failing called hubris, which got so many
      protagonists into hot water in the old Greek mythology. Hubris in
      English is usually taken to mean prideful arrogance; in ancient
      Greek the word meant simple insolence. The Apollo enthusiast rejects
       the concept of hubris; he says we go to the moon not because we are
      arrogant, but because we are driven, and thereby implicitly rejects the
       concept of free will and substitutes sappiness for sassiness. The ma-
      jority asks, â€˜But if we didnâ€™t go, what?â€™ and the minority responds,

    experiment package (ALSEP) , explore and survey mare area, and re-
    turn samples to earth. Secondary objective, if LM softlanded on target,
    would be to examine Surveyor IIZ spacecraft (launched April 17,
     1967), which was resting on moon near planned Apollo 12 touchdown
    point. Astronauts would have two periods for extravehicular activities
     (EVA), during which they would explore surface and conduct experi-
    ments for over three hours and walk farther away from spacecraft than
    had Apollo 11 crew. Maximum lunar stay time would be 28-32 hrs.

July 29: First pictures of Mars taken by NASAâ€™s

       between 771,500 and 450,000 mi from Mars, were flashed on screen
      every five minutes. They showed Mars as dull, gray, egg-shaped body
      with crack in surface and bright spot-southern         polar cap-with
      ragged edge. Better pictures were expected as spacecraft traveled closer
      to Mars. (AP, B Sun, 7/30/69, A1 ; Lannan, W Star, 7/30/69, A3 j

       aboard Mariners VI and VII, NASA said. Experimenters hoped to ob-
       tain photos identifying objects 900 ft across at close approach and
       pictures were expected to be 500 times better than those taken to date
      by earth-based telescope cameras. Readings were obtained at NASAâ€™s

       Richard M. Goldstein during planetâ€™s closest approach to earth (Mars
       had been within 45 million mi of earth June 9 ) . They would be of
       great interest to astronomers because they showed that areas which
       appeared light to telescopes might be either high or low in elevation.

    ments-TV to take pictures, uv spectrometer to identify and measure

     micrometeoroid traveling at 40 mps and had locked on planet Jupiter
     or another bright object. Contact with Mariner VII was regained seven
     hours later by switching from one antenna to another and proper atti-
     tude was restored by rolling spacecraft around until it locked on star
     Canopus. Although some of data being transmitted appeared to be ab-
     normal, flyby mission was still expected to succeed.

    disengaged and return to earth orbit for later reuse. Third rocket
    would remain unfired as spacecraft coasted to Mars. On nine-month

       Introducing programs, Dr. Paine said: â€œThe decade of the 1970â€™s
    and 1980â€™s should have a program as bold in concept and as productive
                                                  .
    as we have had in the decade of the 1960â€™s. . . we need to have clear
                                                               ..
    objectives to focus our work and a commitment, subject . to annual
    review, as to what these achievements will be. Our general goal area
    should be the continued exploration of the solar system while deriving
    the maximum scientific and practical benefits here on earth from the
    space program. There is no question that, at some future time, we will
    have the capability for manned planetary exploration and we need to
    face now some of the decisions that will not bear fruition for more
    than a decade. Although I do not believe that we will see manned ex-
    ploration of the planets in the 1970â€™s in the United States . . . I do
    think this could come in the 1980â€™s. It is by no means clear that for
    the Soviet Union the decision may not be made to mount a crash pro-
    gram and bring this in before the end of the decade of the 1970â€™s.â€
       Dr. Wernher von Braun, MSFC Director, described possible 1981-
    1982, 12-man, 2-ship expedition to Mars [see Aug. 11. Each space-
    craft would weigh 1.6 million lbs at departure from earth orbit and
    would be 270 ft long, â€œsmaller than what we are flying already to the

       NASA was using â€œconcept of reusabilityâ€ in planning, to improve
    and reduce cost of operating in space, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA
    Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told Committee.
    Reusability could be achieved â€œthrough the reuse of launch and space
    vehicles and . . . through the reuse of a mission module such as a space
    stationâ€ put into orbit and used over 10-yr or even 20-yr period.
    Space shuttles would be designed to run 100 or more flights. Modules
    and vehicles would be designed for multiple applications in earth,
    lunar, and synchronous orbits. Space tug would permit travel from
    space station to other spacecraft and back again-â€œgeneral purpose . . .
    equipment.â€ In earth orbital operations, â€œit permits us to fly off from
    the space station over to . . . an OAO, orbiting astronomical observatory,
    either to repair or check the OAO, or to bring it back to a space station
    where it can then be loaded on the space shuttle for return to earth and
    then brought back into orbit after repairs.â€ (Transcript)

   niques. Similar reductions in the cost of transportation to the earth
   orbital station will permit us for the first time to consider processing
   materials in space, to use space for the kind of laboratory work that          ,
    we now associate with ground-based laboratories.â€ By end of 1970s
    â€œwe would find so many uses for operations in synchronous orbit both
   for observing the universe and for observing the earth that we would
    have established a space station in synchronous orbit which would be
    regularly supplied by a nuclear shuttle system and which would provide

    to the homes of all people in the world, as well as providing us with
    great stellar observatories and a viewing platform for air traffic control,
    navigation and for a permanent weather watch.

August 7: Scientists at JPL presented conflicting opinions to newsmen on
    preliminary data from Mariner VI and Mariner VI1 flybys of Mars.
    Dr. George 6. Pimentel and Dr. Kenneth C. Herr of Univ. of California
    at Berkeley said data from infrared spectrometer indicated presence of
    gaseous ammonia and methane in Martian atmosphere. â€œWe are con-
    fident that we have detected solid carbon dioxide that is not on the
    surface; that is, it is suspended as a cloud above the polar cap. Our
    data are consistent with and suggest that the polar cap is composed of
    water ice and probably not solid carbon dioxide near the polar cap
    edge.â€ If life did exist on Mars, they said, it could be in region near
    edge of polar icecap where â€œpolar ice provides a reservoir of waterâ€
    and solid carbon dioxide cloud â€œprovides protection from ultraviolet
    radiation.â€
       Dr. Gerry Neugebauer of Cal Tech said temperature of Mars was
    â€œstrong circumstantial evidence that the polar caps are in fact pre-
    dominantly made of carbon dioxide.â€ Infrared radiometer experiment,
    which measured temperatures on Martian surface, indicated that tem-
    perature of south polar cap was close to -253â€F, temperature at which
    carbon dioxide would solidify in thin Martian atmosphere.
       uv spectrometer experiment had found large amount of uv radiation
    reflected from south polar icecap, indicating that uv light from sun
    was penetrating thin Martian atmosphere and reaching surface. Dr.
    Charles W. Hord of Univ. of Colorado said strong uv radiation reach-
    ing surface â€œwould destroy many of the important molecular bonds of
    organic compounds.â€ If life did exist on Mars, he said, it â€œmust be
    pretty strong stuff,â€ or it must have some means of protection against
    UV rays.
       Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech said one of most striking results
    of Mariner photos was indication of dynamic process occurring on
    Martian surface. Unlike rest of Martian surface, which was heavily
    cratered and closely resembled moon, Hellas area appeared to be
     smooth and free of craters. â€œHellas is the first non-lunar-like featureâ€
     discovered by Mariner V U , he said. Apparently there was â€œactivity in

    suits and containers, rubber gloves, and tools used to handle material.
    (Traces of hydrocarbons in two samples of lunar dust had been re-
    ported Aug. 6.) Autopsies performed on 48 mice injected with lunar

                      Os0
    cessfully launched from ETR at 3:52 am EDT by two-stage Thor-Delta N
    booster to study sun and its influence on earthâ€™s atmosphere. Orbital
    parameters: apogee, 348.0 mi (560 km) ; perigee, 307.6 mi (495 km) ;
    period, 95.2 min; and inclination, 32.96â€. Primary mission objective
    was to obtain high-resolution spectral data from pointed experiments
    in 10- to 20-kev range and 1 to 1,300 A range during one solar rota-
    tion and make raster scans of solar disc in selected wavelengths. Space-
    craft would obtain data from nonpointed and pointed experiments for
    more than one solar rotation for extended observations of single lines
    and solar flares.
       Puc (Package Attitude Control) system, carried pickaback on Delta
    2nd stage, was ejected into orbit with 340-mi (547.1-km) apogee, 300-
    mi (482.7-km) perigee, 94.2-min period, and 32.9â€™ inclination. Pri-
    mary objective was to flight-test long-life, low-power, three-axis PUC
    earth-stabilized control system for Delta 2nd stage and to demonstrate
    feasibility of using stage as experimental platform.
        Os0 VI was spin-stabilized, weighed 640 lbs, carried seven experi-
    ments, was designed with six-month lifetime, and had two main
                       (lower) , which carried nondirectional scanning ex-
    sections-wheel
    periments and basic support equipment, and sail (upper), which car-
    ried pointed experiments. It was similar to previous OSOS but had
    unique capability which enabled two sun-pointing telescopes to study
    in detail uv and x-ray spectra at any point on solar disc and would
    provide greater knowledge of solar atmosphere (chromosphere) as well
    as outermost layer (corona) visible only through special instruments
    or during total solar eclipse. Experiments, designed to continue and
    extend work of preceding oso spacecraft, were provided by Harvard
    College Observatory, Naval Research Laboratory, Rutgers Univ., Los
     Alamos Scientific Laboratories, Univ. of New Mexico, Univ. of Bo-
     logna, and University College (London).
        Both tape recorders were operating at liftoff and were still operating
     satisfactorily. Spacecraft stabilized and acquired sun as scheduled
     shortly after entering orbit. By Aug. 15 all experiments had been
     turned on and were operating satisfactorily. Two minor anomalies-
     higher than planned use of current by motor that provided fine eleva-
     tion pointing and lower than expected spacecraft operating temperature
     -were not expected to affect spacecraft operation adversely.
        Os0 V I was seventh in series of eight oso spacecraft designed to
     provide direct observation of sun during most of 11-yr solar cycle.
     Os0 I (launched March 7, 1962) and Os0 II (launched Feb. 3, 1965)
     had surpassed their six-month design lifetimes and together provided
     more than 8,600 hrs of scientific information. OSO-c (launched Aug.

    reorganization, â€œnot merely the firing, promoting and transferring of
    officials, but the functional restructuring of the agency as well.â€ There
    was some suspicion that no place existed for Dr. Thomas 0. Paine,
    NASA Administrator, who was â€œnot only a Johnson-administration hold-
    over, but a card-carrying Democrat as well.â€ Some observers believed
    Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman, â€œthe Presidentâ€™s current darling and
    space confidant,â€ might be next NASA Administrator. â€œThe idea of
     putting astronauts in charge of the space program may seem incon-
    gruous, but it is clearly not beyond the realm of possibility in the
    image-conscious Rixon regime.â€
        Paineâ€™s fate would determine that of Associate Administrator for
    Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller. With lunar landing,
     Apollo had changed from developmental to operational effort. Chris-
     topher C. Kraft, Director of Flight Operations at MSC, would likely
     transfer to Washington as Apollo Program Manager-possibly â€œcon-

August 11: Lunar scientist Dr. Harold C. Urey discussed moon findings at

    San Diego, Calif., press conference after return from study of Apollo 1 1
    lunar samples at LRL. There was â€œno evidence whateverâ€ of life on
    moon and, â€œat present, no age of the rocks on the surface of the moon
    is known.â€ Fine dust on lunar surface consisted of 50% glass-lO% in
    form of small beads, 40% as broken-up beads-and â€˜â€˜something elseâ€
    containing minerals similar to those in lunar rocks. Dust and rocks
    evidenced shock as though produced by â€œrather large collisions some-
    where that dug up material considerably deeper in the moon than the
    few centimeters they have been investigating.â€ There was no evidence
    of water. Chemical analyses had shown high concentration of titanium
    in lunar samples characteristic of area where Surveyor V and Apollo 11 
                             .
    had landed. â€œNo such . . titanium concentration occurs anywhere
    that we know of on the surface of Earth.â€
        No one had â€œanticipated what we are finding. And I believe that no
    one has a good explanation of how it got that way.â€ It would take
    â€œmuch moreâ€ than nine more Apollo manned landings to solve lunar
     mysteries. He saw no economic value in future lunar colonization but
     â€œan observatory on the moon would be a wonderful way to investigate
    the heavens, because the difficulties of the atmosphere would dis-
     appear.â€ (Space World, 12/69,35-42)

     go beyond the disavowal of national claim of sovereignty in the exist-
     ing treaty and explicitly recognize the United Nations as the â€˜ownerâ€™
     or sovereign of extraterrestrial bodies and also define the functions and
     responsibilities of a United Nations space authority, particularly the
     ways in which it would regulate and coordinate national space explora-
     tion programs. The overall objective of such a treaty would be to
     regulate but not eliminate the competition in space. One benefit of such
      an arrangement is that it would allow the space powers to reduce their
     expenditures and so reallocate funds to more pressing domestic and
     international requirements.â€ (GR, 8/11/69, 59633)

August 12-18: NASAâ€™s                                  Applications Technology
   Satellite was launched from ETR at 7:Ol am EDT by Atlas (SLV-3C)-
   Centaur booster on mission to conduct carefully instrumented gravity-
   gradient-orientation experiment for basic design information on
    stabilization and control of long-lived spacecraft in synchronous orbit
    and to obtain useful data from onboard experiments during first 30
    days in orbit. Spacecraft successfully entered elliptical transfer orbit
    with 26,737.2-mi (43,020.2-km) apogee, 5,297.0-mi (8,522.9-km) peri-
   gee, 686.5-min period, and 17.9â€™ inclination.
        Because of anomaly which required excessive fuel to maintain stable
    spin condition, apogee-kick motor was fired on first apogee instead of
    second and spacecraft had to be biased so it would drift from position
    over India to intended station over area west of Ecuador. Maneuver
    successfully placed A ts V into near-synchronous orbit with 22,927-mi
    (36,889.5-km) apogee, 22,221-mi (35,753.6-km) perigee, 1,464.0-min
    period, 2.7â€™ inclination, and 6.9â€™ per day westward drift. Active nuta-
    tion control was overpowered by unidentified force that caused space-
    craft to go into flat spin, preventing ejection of motor case without
    possibility of damage to spacecraft. Controllers were investigating
    alternatives-stopping spacecraft spin, restoring spacecraft to normal
    spin mode, or minimizing ejection hazard-which could be executed
    Aug. 25 when spacecraft became visible to Rosman, N.C., ground
    station. Spacecraft was not in danger thermally or electronically and
    was expected to become stable and operational after successful ejection
    of kick motor.
        Ats V was fifth in series of seven ATS satellites designed to investigate
    and flight-test technological developments common to number of satel-
    lite applications and useful to satellites operating in stationary orbits,
    conduct carefully instrumented gravity-gradient experiments for basic
    design information, and flight-test experiments peculiar to orbits of
    various missions. Ats Z (launched Dec. 6, 1966) had exceeded test
    objectives and was still operating satisfactorily. Ats ZZ (launched April
    5, 1967), though judged a failure because of eccentric orbit, had
    transmitted some useful data before being turned off Oct. 23, 1967.
    Ats IN (launched Nov. 5, 1967) had operated successfully and trans-
    mitted color photos of earth. Ats ZV (launched Aug. 10, 1968) had
    remained in parking orbit when Centaur failed to complete second
    burn and had reentered Oct. 17, 1968. ATS program was managed by
    GSFC under OSSA direction. (NASA Proj Off)
August 12: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.,

   time fashion. I think that we were timely in accepting this mission of
    going to the moon. It might be timely at this point to think in many
   other areas of other missions that could be accomplished.â€
       Armstrong said moon landing heralded â€œbeginning of a new age.â€
    He said moon was â€œstark and strangely different place, but it looked
             .
   friendly . . and proved to be friendly.â€ Astronauts had much less
   trouble than expected on lunar surface. Primary difficulty was that
    â€œthere was just far too little time to do the variety of things that we
                                      ..
    would have liked to have done. . We had the problem of the 5 year
    old boy in a candy store. There are just too many interesting things to
   do.â€
       Armstrong said that during landing they â€œwere concerned about
    running low on fuel on range extension we did to avoid the boulder
    field and craters. We used a significant percentage of our fuel margins
    and we were quite close to our legal limit.â€ On possibility of abort
    during period they were receiving alarm signals, Aldrin said procedure
    in preparation simulations had been always to â€œkeep going as long as
                 .                                                 ..

    programmed to do. The only thing that was missing . . is that we
    did not have some of the displays . . . and we had to make several
    entries . . . to clear up that area.â€ Armstrong added, â€œWe would have
    continued the landing so long as the trajectory seemed safe. And land-
    ing is possible under these conditions, although with considerably less
    confidence than you have when you have the information from the
    ground and the computer in its normal manner available to YOU.â€

     peaks, polygonal outlines, blocky ejecta rims, and irregdar ejecta; and

      should control mission schedules and astronaut activities, â€œNASA hier-
      archy,, or ground-based scientists in NASA; and whether U.S. should
      emphasize unmanned probes or crash program to put men on Mars in

      while astronauts with test pilot backgrounds have been receiving un-
      precedented public acclaim makes it evident where the balance of
      power lies for the moment within NASA. But the issue is far from
      settled, since NASA itself must and does use the prospect of scientific
      advances as a key argument in seeking appropriations for space ac-
      tivities. Hence the dissident scientists could have substantial leverage
      if they teamed up with Congressmen and others who oppose the space

∞  Moon was twin planet of earth, formed from same whirling gas cloud, in
    early view of two LRL scientists studying Apollo 11 samples. Dr. S.
    Ross Taylor of Astri National Univ., Canberra, Australia, said,
    â€œMoonâ€™s composition is unlike the earthâ€˜s. But it is not outside our ex-
    perience. It is like the material you would expect if the earth and moon
    were formed as a double planet.â€ He thought moon was younger twin,
    while Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of State Univ. of New York thought it
    might be equally old.
        Age of two lunar rocks had been estimated at 3.1 billion yrs, â€œgive
            .
    or take . . 200 million years,â€ by measuring proportion of argon 40
    to potassium in rocks, Dr. Schaeffer said. Lunar highlands might be
    4.5 billion yrs old. Moon, he thought, never grew big enough to melt
    internally and produce geologic activity to change lunar surface and
    leave younger rocks. Dr. Taylorâ€™s studies had shown unusually high
    amounts of refractory material and absence or low concentration of
    volatile materials, implying volatile material had boiled away in melt-
    ing process. He inferred rock chemistry was different from deep mantle
    of earth and from cosmic abundances-distribution of elements that
    would be expected in distant, more primitive planet captured by earth.

During August: Pace magazine published articles by Vice President Spiro
    T. Agnew, also NASC Chairman, and by NASA Administrator, Dr.
    Thomas 0.Paine.
        Dr. Paine said, â€œTo improve conditions in our society we need to
    create more wealth through greater productivity based on new tech-
    nology. We should be restless and dissatisfied with our slowness in
    overcoming social ills, and I hope that the space program will con-
    tinue to spur us onward here. If we can go to the moon, why canâ€™t we
    build great and shining cities? Why canâ€™t we eliminate ignorance,
    crime and poverty? If our space program highlights such questions and
    helps form a national commitment to find new solutions, it will have
    served the nation well. Our space advances should embolden the nation
    to proceed forward with increased confidence in these other areas. Our
    Apollo program has demonstrated anew what Americans can accom-
    plish given a national commitment, capable leadership and adequate
    resources.
        b<
          Manâ€™s future in space is limitless. We have embarked on a new
     stage of evolution that will engage all future generations of men. We
     face the unknown in countless areas: What are the effects of sustained
    zero and artificial gravity? Of time-extending flight at nearly the ve-
    locity of light? Of societies genetically selected for extraterrestrial
    living?
        â€œWe must find the answers. We must move vigorously forward in
     space. The practical benefits alone justify this venture, but there are
     many other compelling human reasons. Progress in space should con-
     tinue to spur us onward to find new solutions to our age-old problems
     here on Spaceship Earth. We must make the blue planet Earth a home
     base, worthy of men who will set forth one day on journeys to the
     stars.â€
        Vice President Agnew said : â€œWith the remarkably successful Apollo
     moon-landing program on the verge of culmination, we are now faced
     with a need to define just what we should proceed to do to make use
     most effectively of the results of our past and continuing space-explo-
     ration investment. Wealthy as our economy is, rich as our technology
     has become, we must plan carefully in order to meet a wide range of
                                     .
     urgent national requirements. . . It is our hope that, with a carefully
     reasoned set of goals adequately funded by the people through their
     Congress, the nation and the world will reap the maximum possible
     benefit from mankindâ€™s most ambitious undertaking. We must keep our
     horizons wide and our sights high. Despite its many internal domestic
     priorities, this nation should never turn inward, away from the oppor-
     tunities and challenges of its most promising frontier.â€ (Pace, 8/69,

      it was simple. Just the reverse is true about the great problems of our
      society. What is making these so hard to solve is not technology but
      serious disagreement about goals and priorities, about what is good
      for whom, who is to get what and who should pay for it. The space
      program does not hold the answer to these questions. Trying to find
      them in Apollo will only distort and therefore belittle an incomparable
       achievement. Apollo took us to the moon, to that shining disk in the

 ∞ Study of lunar samples was â€œbringing to light as many mysteries as it
     unravels,â€ New York Times editorial said. Theorists were cautious,
     with evidence from one small area, Tranquility Base. â€œIt is likely that
     the picture will become still more complex when a representative col-
     lection of samples becomes available from ten, twenty or thirty areas
     spread over the entire lunar surface. But even the limitations of the
    present data suggest strongly that the moon is very different from
     earth, and therefore has much to teach human science about the origin
     and evolution of the solar system. The case for intensive scientific study
     of the moon-conducted in part by geologists and other scientists sent
    there for on-the-spot investigation-is strong.â€ (NYT, 9/10/69, 40)
September 11: Press conference on results of Mariner VI (launched Feb.
     24) and Mariner VIZ (launched March 27) was held at NASA Hq. Some
     200 TV pictures of Mars were taken by two Mariners, including 57
     high- and medium-resolution views of selected Martian surface areas
     from altitude of only few hundred miles. Spacecraft measured Martian
     atmospheric temperature, pressure, and chemical constituency and
    measured surface temperatures in effort to correlate thermal charac-
     teristics with features observed in TV pictures. Data indicated Mars
     was heavily cratered, bleak, cold, dry, nearly airless, and generally
     hostile to any earth-style life forms.
        Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech said: â€œWe got nine times the
    number of far encounter pictures that were originally proposed [few
     years ago], 20 per cent more near encounter pictures than were pro-
     posed, and 1,100 digital pictures which were entirely impossible ac-
                                                         ..
     cording to schemes at the time of the proposal. . After Mariner 4
     Mars seemed to be like the moon. At last Mariners 6 and 7 have shown
     Mars to be like Mars and have brought out Marsâ€™ own characteristic
     features, some of them unknown and unrecognized elsewhere in the
     solar system.â€
        Dr. Robert P. Sharp of Cal Tech said Martian terrain could be di-
     vided into three types-crater, featureless, and chaotic. Cratered ter-
     rain was widespread and common on Mars and resembled moon.
     Featureless terrain was represented by Hellas area, which appeared to
     be upland area, 150-mi-wide zone that gently sloped into flat feature-
     less floor. Chaotic terrain had series of â€œshort ridges, little valleys, and
     irregular, jumbled topography.â€ Chaotic and featureless terrain ap-
     peared to be distinctly Martian, suggesting â€˜khat on Mars we have
     either a difference in processes that are operating on the surface or
     within the crust or we have a difference of material from one place to
     another on Mars and different than on the moon, or, more likely, a
                              ..
     combination of both. . We also have good reason for believing that
     the evolutionary history has been somewhat different. Again, there are
     scars on the face of Mars that we do not see on the face of the moon.
     And there have perhaps been episodic events in Martian history that
     are unique to the planet Mars. We end up with the conclusion that
     Mars is its own planet.â€

     evaluation of initial data from infrared spectrometer had shown infra-

    red spectral features earlier ascribed to methane and ammonia were
    actually due to previously undiscovered absorptions of solid carbon
    dioxide. Reflection peak recorded three times in atmosphere off Marsâ€™
    bright limb showed presence of solid carbon dioxide at high altitudes
    and at latitudes north of polar cap. Broad absorption near 9 p recorded
    on bright limb was ascribed to solid silica or silicate material and
    broad absorptions near 12 p recorded near dark limb were tentatively
    ascribed in part to solid carbon dioxide above ground. Further experi-
    mental work was in progress to refine thermal map.
         Initial results of uv spectrometer experiment were detection of ion-
    ized carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, atomic hydrogen, and oxygen.
    Nitrogen and nitric oxide were not detected and no evidence was found
     of clouds, blue haze, or any appreciable atmospheric absorption of uv
     radiation. Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado said important
     point â€œis that the atmosphere of Mars is different than the atmosphere
     of the earth. If I showed you a spectrum taken the same way from the
     upper atmosphere of the earth, we would see a plentiful number of
     nitrogen bands. We could see emissions from nitric oxide. We could
     see emissions from atomic nitrogen. None of those features is present
                                     .
     in the atmosphere of Mars. . .â€
         Dr. Norman H. Horowitz of J P L presented biological implications of
     Mariner 1969 results. â€œThere is nothing in the new data that encour-
     ages the belief that Mars is a body of life. But the results donâ€™t exclude
                        ..
     this possibility. . The Mariner 6 and 7 data strengthen the previous
     conclusion that the scarcity of water on Mars is the most serious limit-
     ing factor for life. . . . Mars is a cold desert by terrestrial standards. If
     there is life on Mars, it must be a form of life that can utilize water in
     the form of water vapor or ice.â€ (Transcript; NASA News Release)

   military missions; continuing strong program of lunar and planetary
   exploration, astronomy, physics, and earth and life sciences; develop-
   ment of new systems and technology for space operations, emphasizing
   commonality, reusability, and economy through development of new
   space transportation capability and space station modules; and promo-
   tion of world community through program of broad international
   participation and cooperation.
       As focus for development of new capability, Task Group recom-
   mended US. accept long-range goal of manned planetary exploration
   with manned Mars mission before end of century. Activities leading
   to goal should include initial concentration on exploiting existing capa-
   bility and developing new one while maintaining program balance
   within available resources; operational phase using new systems and
   capabilities in earth-moon space, with men living and working in that
   environment for extended periods; and manned exploration missions
   out of earth-moon space, using experience of earlier two phases. Sched-
   ule and budgetary implications of phases were subject to Presidential
   choice, with detailed program to be determined in normal annual
   budget and program review.
       Report outlined three possible NASA programs for manned Mars
   landing before centuryâ€™s end. Option I would launch manned mission
   in mid-1980s and would establish orbiting lunar station, 50-man earth-
   orbiting space base, and lunar surface base. Funding would rise from
   current $4-billion level to $8- to $10-billion level in 1980. Decision
   to proceed with development of space station, earth-to-orbit shuttle,
    and space tug would be required in FY 1971. Option I1 would include
   Mars mission launch in 1986, allowing for evaluation of unmanned
   Mars mission results before final designation of landing date and
    require about $8-billion maximum annual expenditure in early 1980s.
   Option I11 would include initial development of space station and
    reusable shuttles, as in Options I and 11, but would defer decision on
   manned Mars landing date while maintaining goal of after 1980 but
    before close of century. Concurrent development of space transportation
    system and modular space stations wouid require rise in 1976 annual
    expenditures to $5.7 billion, while their development in series would
    entail $4- to $S-billion funding level.
       Recommended DOD options were: (A) program of full military space
    capability in case of overt threat to national security, (B) develop-
    ment of efforts to counter known and accepted projections of security
    threat and increase in development activities if threat increased, and
    ( 6 ) program of lower level system deployment with technology and
    support effort necessary for contingency planning on assumption that
    lessening of world tensions would reduce emphasis on national defense.
       At White House briefing following presentation, .press secretary
    Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon had concurred in Task Groupâ€™s
     rejection of two other, extreme space programs, one to land men on
    Mars as soon as possible, regardless of cost, and one to eliminate
    manned flight program after completion of Apollo. He did not know
    when President would make decision on course to follow, but budgetary
    considerations would be major factor. (Text; PD, 9/22/69, 1291;

                          1
    examination of 48 lbs of Apollo 11 lunar samples in LRL by university
    and Government scientists on NASA Preliminary Examination Team
     (PET).
        Report confirmed existence of unexplained erosion process on lunar
    surface indicated in Ranger, Lunar Orbiter, and Surveyor photos,
    â€œunlike any process so far observed on earthâ€; said unique chemical
    composition (that of silicate liquid) of Tranquility Base fines and
    igneous rocks â€œimplies either the composition of the rock from which
    the liquid was derived differs significantly from that of the mantle of
    the earth, or that the mechanism by which the liquid was formed
    differs from analogous terrestrial processesâ€ ; and concluded there was
    â€œvery good chance that the time of crystallization of some of the
    Apollo 11 rocks may date back to times earlier than the oldest rocks
    on earth.â€
        Samples could be divided into fine- and medium-grained crystalline
    of igneous origin, breccias of complex origin, and fines. Crystalline
    rocks differed from any terrestrial rock and from meteorites in modal
    mineralogy and bulk chemistry. Erosion had occurred on lunar surface
    but there was no evidence it was caused by surface water. Probable
    presence of assemblage iron-troilite-ilmenite and absence of any
    hydrated phase indicated crystalline rocks were formed under ex-
    tremely low partial pressures of oxygen, water, and sulfur. Absence of
    hydrated minerals suggested absence of any surface water at Tran-
     quility Base since rocks were exposed. Rocks and fines showed evidence
     of shock or impact metamorphism ; all rocks displayed glass-lined
     surface pits possibly caused by impact of small particles; and fine
    material and breccia contained gases that indicated they were derived
     from solar wind. Measurements on igneous rock indicated crystalliza-
     tion 3 billion to 4 billion yrs ago. Rocks had been within one meter of
     surface for 20 million to 160 million yrs. Level of indigenous volatiliz-
     able and/or pyrolyzable organic material was extremely low. All rocks
     and fines were generally similar chemically. Major and minor constitu-
     ents were same as in terrestrial igneous rocks and meteorites, but dif-
     ferences in composition were significant. Elements that were enriched
     in iron meteorites were not observed or were very low in occurrence.
     No evidence of biological material had been found. Tranquility Base
     soil was fine grained,.granular, cohesive, and incompressible, with hard-
     ness increasing at six-inch depth. It was similar in appearance and
     behavior to soil at Surveyor landing sites. (Program; Text; Science,

     tinental Divide, introducing to my sons the wonders of nature and
     pleasures of looking for deer and for elk. In their enthusiasm for the
     view they frequently stumbled on the rocky trails, but when they
     looked only to their footing, they did not see the elk. To those of you
     who have advocated looking high we owe our sincere gratitude, for
     you have granted us the opportunity to see some of the grandest views
     of the Creator. To those of you who have been our honest critics, we
     also thank, for you have reminded us that we dare not forget to watch

     cult problems here on earth. The Apollo lesson is that national goals
     can be met where there is a strong enough will to doso.â€
         Astronaut Collins said: â€œWe have taken to the moon the wealth of
      this Nation, the vision of its political leaders, the intelligence of its
     scientists, the dedication of its engineers, the careful craftsmanship of
      its workers, and the enthusiastic support of its people. We have brought

     VII: â€œThe unprecedented advances in the study both of the moon and
     of Mars during the past few weeks have produced a stunning crop of
     surprises about both celestial bodies. On the closest examination yet,
     these neighbors in space have proved far more complex and strange
     than previous theories have led men to believe. And the magnificent,
     lifeless desolation of the lunar and Martian surfaces emphasizes more
     than ever how wonderful it is and how little science understands why
      it is that this third planet from the sun is so uniquely green, vibrant

     Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force; Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, Presi-
      dential Science Adviser; and William A. Anders, NASC Executive Sec-

      program of the magnitude that would turn loose every bit of our tech-
      nological abilityâ€ to achieve quickest possible manned Mars landing
      because â€œthere are competing priorities in a difficult time of inflation.â€

      have come out of the Apollo program, the benefits of National
      prestige.â€

      would enable NASA to â€œhold together the teamâ€ and provide â€œmajor
      challenge.â€
         Dr. DuBridge said all three options held â€œheavy emphasis on earth
      applications, satellites, for studying the geology, the geography, the
      atmosphere of the oceans of the earth and bringing space technology
      directly and immediately to the benefit of the people on earth. All three
      programs also . . . include heavy emphasis on scientific programs, to
      extend our scientific knowledge of the earth itself, of the moon,
      through additional lunar expeditions, interplanetary space and addi-
      tional scientific information about the moon and the planets.â€ He also

     Here, truly, mankind is one: as fellow creatures from the planet Earth,
     exploring the heavens that all of us enjoy. The journey of Apollo 11    1
     to the moon and back was not an end, but the beginning.
        â€œThere will be new journeys of discovery. Beyond this, we are just
     beginning to comprehend the benefits that space technology can yield
     here on earth. And the potential is enormous. For example, we are
     now developing earth resource survey satellites, with the first experi-
     mental satellite to be launched sometime early in the decade of the
     seventies. Present indications are that these satellites should be capable
     of yielding data which could assist in as widely varied tasks as these:
     the location of schools of fish in the oceans, the location of mineral
     deposits on land, the health of agricultural crops.
        â€œI feel it is only right that we should share both the adventures and
     the benefits of space. As an example of our plans, we have determined
     to take actions with regard to earth resources satellites. . . . The pur-
     pose . . . is that this program will be dedicated to produce information
     not only for the United States, but also for the world community. We
     shall be putting several proposals in this respect before the United
     Nations. These are among the positive, concrete steps we intend to
     take toward internationalizing manâ€™s epic venture into space-an ad-

    Thomas 0.Paine, NASA Administrator, said: â€œWe know that hydrogen
    bombs work (unfortunately) -the Lord made the Universe that way.
    And, of course, we know that (fortunately) fusion energy keeps the
    sun shining every day. Our great visionary dream is to find out how
    to unlock this energy for spaceship propulsion. This is a great challenge
    but consider the new tools that we have available: giant magnetic fields
    with superconducting magnets, tremendous power densities from lasers,
    the great energy of nuclear power, and new high temperature materials.
    These, with new plasma dynamic developments, may usher in fusion
    power in the eighties, the nineties, or in the next century. Harnessing
    fusion power for propulsion is an even farther-out challenge, but it
    could prove to be one of the more direct applications. We wonâ€™t have
    to convert the fusion energy to electricity; just fuse a couple of deu-
    terium atoms and then let them blast out the back of the vehicle!
        â€œSo fusion remains a tantalizing promise for the future. . . . If we
    ever do achieve such propulsion, weâ€™ll be able to move with some ease
    out from our little 8,000-mile-diameter Solar System. All of the 9
    planets, 32 moons and 1600 known asteroids will come within reach
    of our vehicles. And, indeed, if we could achieve high efficiencies in a
    fusion propulsion process, we could talk of eventual relativistic ve-
    locities, of time compression, and of travel to the nearest stars.â€ (Text)

  ∞USAF magazine Airman published interview with Secretary of the Air
    Force, Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., former NASA Deputy Administrator.
    NASA-USAF X-15 program had been highly successful in providing
    data for many disciplines and â€œvery good test bedâ€ for atmospheric
    probe instrumentation. XB-70 program, initiated as manned super-
    sonic bombing system, was â€œvery bold stepâ€ in speeds over mach 3         .
    When technological difficulties and rising costs resulted in decision
    against XB-70 production, NASA with USAF had initiated experimental
    program. Dr. Seamans felt USAF was not using NASA expertise to fullest
    extent. USAF needed new manned bomber, new fighter, and moderniza-
    tion of air defense. He was not convinced USAF had yet established
    â€œbest relationships with industry to get these things done.â€ (Airman,
    9/69, 7-9)
 ∞ â€œThere appears to be much more to be squeezed from Apollo than just
    the incalculable value of national prestige or scientific discovery,â€
    Michael Getler wrote in Space/Aeronautics. â€œThe ability to mine these
    supporting talents, to judge their value outside manned space flight
     and disseminate and apply them may well prove the most telling and
    measurable argument in the debate which is bound to continue over
    Apolloâ€™s real value.â€ Apollo had combined â€œmuch of what we have
    with what we do best. Though complex, it was manageable. It had
    clear goals, was well funded, enjoyed fairly widespread public support,
    and dangled the element of competition in front of our involuntary
    reflex. Most importantly, it tapped an industrial base and an en-
                                                            .
    thusiasm for gadgetry that are unmatched anywhere. . . Because many
    of todayâ€™s challenges confront human nature and not technology,
    Apollo can be made to seem irrelevant. In fact, however, we are not
    left alone with our behavioral troubles. There is still an economy to
    keep sound, industry and commerce to be kept competitive, and a
    government to be made more efficient, Failure to take this extraordi-
    nary project apart, piece by piece, and examine its usefulness in these
    areas would indeed be wasteful.â€ ( S / A , 9/69, 42-53)
∞  Dr. Mose L. Harvey in Science and Public Aflairs, bulletin of atomic sci-
    entists, discussed lunar landing and US.-Soviet equation: â€œThe capa-
    bility of the United States to continue in space, and otherwise keep
    pace with the scientific-technological revolution, depends entirely on
    continued public faith in the â€˜military-industrial complexâ€™ and the
     â€˜scientific and technological elite,â€™ if one wishes to keep using these
    unfortunate terms. It was only because we were able effectively to or-
    ganize and use a genuine and mutually rewarding partnership between
     industry, universities and government that we were able to effect the
    moon landing and to do the other near-miraculous things we have
     done in space and in other fields involving advanced science and ad-
    vanced technology, It is precisely on this partnership that the superi-
    ority of the American way over the Soviet way has so far rested.â€

      beauty. At that time, no one could have guessed that Columbusâ€™s dis-
      covery was only a beginning. That other discoveries would follow, a
      second America, a third, a fourth, and so on through millions of years
      and billions of kilometers. But today that is happening. Compared to
      our new set of goals, the aims of Marx and communism are pure imag-
      ination. For the first time the real and the rational are about to become
      one. We are now at the end of history-and post-history is just be-

      AFSC was testing new UHF communication terminal in conjunction with
      Tacsat I tactical comsat and had tested UHF shipboard, jeep, van-
      mounted, and team-pack terminals as receivers for satellite communi-
      cations. Second-generation defense comsats would have earth coverage
      antennas and also steerable narrow-beam antennas to direct energy to
      two â€œspotlightedâ€ areas on earthâ€™s surface, permitting use of small ter-
      minals instead of large ground stations. Proposed navigation satellite
      system would consist of high-altitude satellites transmitting navigation
       signals with worldwide coverage, ground stations to track and com-
      mand satellites, and user receiving equipment. Navsat would provide
      all four armed services with common grid for mobile operations and
      could be used by aircraft, ships, submarines, and foot soldiers. Po-
      tential for aircraft carrier operations was being studied.
          Computer revolution would provide new data processing equipment
      â€œwith infinite potential for influencing satellite design and functionâ€
      in future. â€œWe are pressing hard for progress in laser technology,
      which appears to have excellent potential for communication applica-
      tions. We are also pushing the development of new sources of power
      in space in which a breakaway from our heavy reliance upon the solar
      cell could make future satellite development a whole new game.â€ (TRW

    by NASA from WTR by Scout booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 237.4
    mi (382 km) ; perigee, 180.8 mi (291 km) ; period, 91.3 min; and in-
    clination, 85.1'. Primary NASA mission objectives were to place Boreas
    into planned orbit and provide tracking and telemetry support. Boreas
    was backup for and identical to Aurorae (Esro ZA) successfully
    launched by NASA Oct. 3, 1968. It carried eight experiments to study
    aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and related phenomena of polar
    ionosphere, representing six organizations from U.K., Denmark, Swe-

    from insects, disease, and fire. Use of satellite sensors could improve
    surveys of agricultural and forest resources, aid mineral and petroleum
    prospecting, obtain better inventory of earthâ€˜s water sources, detect
    natural and man-made geography changes, sense ocean currents and
    temperatures to aid fishing industry and improve routing of commercial
    shipping, and study effects of environmental and water pollution. While
    NASA space expenditures were averaging about $4.5 billion annually-
    about 2/3 of 1% of GNP-nearly $4 billion was spent in US. for non-
    durable toys and sport supplies, $4.7 billion for foreign travel, and
    over $6.5 billion in amusements.
        Anders urged international harmony through space. â€œWe travel
    through space on a small planet. The Earth looked so tiny in the
    heavens that there were times during the Apollo 8 mission when I had
    trouble finding it. If you can imagine yourself in a darkened room with
    only one clearly visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the
    size of a Christmas tree ornament, then you can begin to grasp what
    the Earth looks l&e from space. I think all of us subconsciously think
    the Earth is flat or at least almost infinite. Let me assure you that,
    rather than a massive giant, it should be thought of more as the
    fragile Christmas tree ball which we should handle with considerable
            ..
    care. .     From space, the earth is indivisible. There are no flags, no

        Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned

    benefits, Apollo Applications program, and lunar exploration. Apollo
    Applications program would â€œstudy the earth through the use of a six
    lens multispectral camera installation. On Apollo 9 some of the rudi-
    mentary work was done using four lenses. 50% more kinds of informa-
    tion will be brought back by the crews of Apollo Applications. Because
    almost everything on earth has a different reflective quality, as distinc-
    tive as a signature or a fingerprint, results from this photographic ex-
    ploration can be expected to yield rich rewards. Many of the earth
    sciences look to this kind of information for answers to previously
    unanswerable questions. Hydrologists are interested in discovering not
    only the depth, but also the temperature of the waters of the world,
    and these conditions can be ascertained from space. Warm water at-
    tracts certain species of fish, so fishermen are also interested in these
    experiments.
        â€œAgronomists believe that soil chemistry will reveal itself on a
    large scale in certain kinds of filtered photography. Agriculturists
    know that different crops, at different stages of their development and
     in different states of health, reflect distinctive amounts of light. They
     hope, using the photographs we will take, to get some measure of the
     worldâ€™s crop, as well as some knowledge of its condition. Geologists,
     who have found clues to mineral deposits in the Gemini and Apollo pic-
     tures, look to this more sophisticated photography for additional infor-
     mation, and for distinctions which will eventually permit certain kinds

        Sun would be prime target for exploration in Apollo Applications
     program, with experiments conducted by astronaut-astronomers using
     Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) in orbit. â€œFor the first time we will
     have a massive set of instruments with high resolution for looking in
     some depth and detail at the activities of the sun from beyond the
     veil of the earthâ€˜s atmosphere.â€ Program would consist of three mis-
      sions into near-earth space, one of 28 days and two of 56 days each.
     First step would be establishment of Saturn V workshop in orbit,
     planned for March 1972 launch, followed by launches of solar panels,
     ATM, and crew of three for 28-day stay. Second manned mission was
     scheduled for launch about three months after first, with third to
     follow one month after return of second crew. (Text)

∞  At Third International History of Astronautics Symposium Oct. 10,
    organized by IAF in connection with its 20th Congress, A. Ingemar
    Skoog of Swedish Interplanetary Society traced rocket development in
    Sweden from 1807, when military first understood possibilities of
    rockets in warfare, to mid-l860s, when rockets were taken out of
    service. â€œAn examination of the rockets preserved at the Army Mu-
    seum in Stockholm, has shown that all 14 rockets are still fitted with
    their original propellant. This will be tested by propellant experts later
    this year in order to find out the properties of a 140 years old pro-
    pellant.â€ (Text)
       W. Geisler of Polish Astronautical Society had submitted paper on
    history and development of rocket technology and astronautics in
    Poland before 1949: use of rockets on Polish territory by Tartars
    in 13th century probably had marked introduction of use of rockets
    in Europe. (R6sum6)
       Frederick I. Ordway, 111, of Univ. of Alabama delivered paper
    â€œThe Alleged Contributions of Pedro E. Paulet to Liquid Propellant
    Rocketry.â€ â€œPaulet, a Peruvian chemical engineer-turned-diplomat,
    spent much of his professional foreign service career in Europe. . . .
    his claim to being a precursor of liquid propellant rocketry rests in
    a letter he wrote from Rome on the 23rd of August 1927 that was
    published in the 7 October 1927 issue of the Lima, Peru, newspaper
    El Cornercio. Therein, he describes liquid propellant rocket engine
    experiments he had conducted . . . in Paris thirty years earlier. . . .
    Relying on this source and derivatives, many subsequent writers have
    accorded Paulet a perhaps undeserved place in the history of rock-
    etry.â€ (Summary)

October 9: Joseph P. Loftus, Jr., Manager of MSC Program Engineering
    Office, described plans for future Apollo lunar exploration at MSC
    press conference. Technological objectives were to increase scientific
    payload to lunar orbit and to lunar surface, permit high flexibility
    in landing site selection, increase lunar orbit and lunar surface stay
    time, increase lunar surface mobility with self-propelled lunar roving
    vehicle, develop and demonstrate advanced techniques and hardware
    for expanded manned space mission capabilities, develop techniques for
    achieving point landings, and demonstrate closed-loop onboard navi-
    gation capability as applicable to advanced missions.
       Scientific objectives were to investigate major classes of lunar sur-
    face features, surface processes, and regional problems; collect samples
    at each site for analyses on earth; establish network of surface instru-
    mentation to measure seismic activity, heat flow, and disturbance in
    moonâ€™s axis of rotation; survey and measure lunar surface from lunar
    orbit with high-resolution photography and remote sensing; investigate
    near-moon environment and interaction of moon with solar wind;
    map lunar gravitational field and internally produced magnetic field;
    and detect atmospheric components resulting from neutralized solar
    wind and micrometeoroid impacts.
       Achievement of scientific objectives would be facilitated by addition
    of scientific instrument module (SIM) under service module sector
     door. SIM would consist of scientific instruments mounted on shelves
    behind door, which would be deployed pyrotechnically after crew left
    lunar surface. Spacecraft would also use new modular equipment
    storage assembly (MESA). â€œUnlike the existing MESA it is modular and
    people, instead of having to take many things out of compartments and
                             ..
    stick them into a bag ; here you simply take hold of a handle . . .
     and lift out an entire shelf. On that shelf are all the things required
     for the next EVA period. So, it is one movement instead of a dozen.â€
       One tank of hydrogen and one tank of oxygen would be added to
    extend mission capability to 161/2 days. Since each EVA period would
     increase up to 5 hrs and total lunar stay time would increase up to
     200 hrs, lithium hydroxide would be increased for portable life-support
     system and for spacecraft, and insulation would be increased on top
     of spacecraft around docking tunnel. Minor changes would be made
     to interior garments so crew would have more suitable environment
     and crew would remove spacesuits and sleep in hammocks during rest
     periods on lunar surface. (Transcript)

    will mean growing reliance on nuclear systems. . . As an integral
    part of a new capability for space transportation, we look to the nuclear
    rocket to provide the propulsion to move large payloads from low
     earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit or to lunar orbit to support ex-
    tended lunar exploration. It also offers major advantages for trans-

    of the complex system of controlling a simultaneous group flight of
    three space ships; mutual maneuvering of ships in orbit with the aim
    of solving a number of problems of developing the piloted space

     timeâ€ that space knowledge was used for advancement of communica-
     tions, meteorology, geodesy, and navigation. Since space exploration
     was not cheap, simpler and more reliable experiments must be tried
     before complex and expensive ones. Three practical applications of
     space research were industrial use of high vacuum and absolute cold,

    to have occurred in situ on moon. â€œConsiderations of angular monien-
    tum show that planetary material probably separated from the sun
    when the radius of the latter was considerably greater than its present
    value. Current work on stellar structure requires that the effective
    surface temperature or* the solar condensation be substantially con-
    stant at 3500â€ to 4000Â°K during this phase, independent of radius.
    Hence, for comparatively large radii the luminosity would have been
    very much greater than the present-day value, so that primitive plane-
    tary material could well have been considerably hotter than would be
    estimated for material at corresponding distances from the present-day

    samples of lunar material establish the existence of such a hot phase,

October 20: Capt. Chester M. Lee (USN, Ret.), Apollo 12 Mission Director,
    described Apollo 12 plans to press at NASA Hq. [see Oct. 21. Mission
    would be launched toward moon at 11:22 am EST Nov. 14, carrying As-
    tronauts Charles Conrad, Jr. (commander) , Alan L. Bean ( LM pilot),
    and Richard F. Gordon, Jr. ( C M pilot). Primary objectives would be
    to perform selenological inspection, survey and sample mare area, de-
    ploy Apollo lunar surface experiment package ( ALSEP) , develop tech-
    niques for point landing capability, and photograph candidate landing
    sites.
       Basic flight plan would be similar to one for Apollo 11 (July 16-24]
    with modifications to improve landing accuracy and increase data re-
    turn. Launch azimuth had been narrowed from 72O-108O for Apollo 11
     to 72â€-96â€ for Apollo 12 and trajectory had been changed from free-
    return to hybrid. Lunar orbit stay time for Apollo 12 would be
     increased from 59.6 hrs for Apollo 11 to 89 hrs; lunar surface stay
    time, from 21.6 hrs to 31.5 hrs; EVA from one 2-hr 32-min period to
     two 3-hr 30-min periods; and total mission time, from 195.3 hrs to
    2M.7 hrs. LM sleeping arrangements would be improved with ham-
    mocks, color TV if repaired by launch date would be used on surface,
     and LM ascent stage would be crashed onto lunar surface near seis-
    mometer after ascent from moon and redocking. To increase naviga-
    tional accuracy crew would avoid waste and water dumps 10 hrs before
    landing to prevent thrust that might carry them off course, would
     approach moon upside-down so landing radar would be operational
     during entire landing phase, and would speed up descent to conserve
    fuel at landing. (Transcript)
∞  Tass reported Soviet scientists had tested â€œelectric jet plasma engineâ€

     producing jet flow of gas that reached 75 mps. Engine â€œneeds neither
     fuel nor oxidizer from the ground. Once the aircraft is taken to the
     ionosphere it is able to continue flying using only atmospheric nitro-
     gen.â€ Tass said engine might be used to power â€œsuperfastâ€ jetliners in
     upper atmosphere.
        Washington Post quoted US. scientists as saying this was misinter-
    pretation. No aircraft could fly high enough to take advantage of such
    an engine. Soviet development sounded like â€œvery interestingâ€ break-
     through, which US. was not even pursuing. It appeared to be new
     version of ion engine, which NASA would use aboard SERT spacecraft
    later in year. But SERT engine would carry its own fuel. Electrical
     power supply to convert nitrogen to electrified gas would be too heavy.

    and VIIl: â€œThe latest Soviet space spectacular, it would seem, adds up
    to a small step for mankind and a giant step for the welding trade.
    There is nothing overwhelmingly impressive about having three space-
    craft in orbit at once. All that is required these days is the decision to
    get them up and the money to build three rockets and launch facilities.
    Even the highly touted welding experiment does not constitute a major
    technical breakthrough. It did raise the honorable trade to new heights,
    but the conditions under which the tests were made could have been-
    and probably have been-largely        duplicated in the laboratory.â€ (W

 ∞        Fifty years of transatlantic flight-from USN NC-4 flying boatâ€™s Lis-
    bon arrival May 27, 1919, to June 3, 1969, maiden Atlantic crossing
    of Boeing 747-was traced in paper by Dr. Richard K. Smith, Ramsey
    Fellow at Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s National Air and Space Museum.
    During â€œthe Heroic Years on the North Atlantic between 27 May 1919
    and 27 May 1939, there were 175 flights across the Atlantic; 142 were
                                    ...
    by airplanes, 33 by airships.         It is confidently believed that all the
    persons who flew the Atlantic by airplane during that period could be
    accommodated aboard a 747, perhaps with some seats to spare. How-
    ever, at least three more 747s would be required to lift those persons
    who flew by airship during 1919-1937!â€ (Text)
   ∞      MSC Flight Operations Director Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., said
    Apollo program might be extended to 1973 to allow NASA to fly three
    space station training missions in 1972. â€œItâ€™s going to be some time
     before we settle it. But itâ€™s going to be difficult to handle both Apollo
     and Apollo Applications from an operational point of view as well as
     a people point of view in 1972.â€ Revised launch schedule set Apollo 19
     landing back to November 1972 and Apollo 20 to May 1973. Between
    Apollo 18 launch Feb. 11, 1972, and Apollo 19 were three orbital
     flights preparatory for establishment of first U.S. permanent space sta-
     tion in 1975. These flights could come just after Apollo 18, in May
     1972 and in September 1972. Further reason for ApolIo landings delay
     was possibility they would be made in remote lunar areas like crater
     Tycho, almost 1,000 mi below moonâ€™s equator and rated among t o p
     priority landing sites. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 10/23/69, A21)
  ∞        Dr. Arthur D. Code, Univ. of Wisconsin astronomer, reported dis-
     covery that relatively young stars in constellations Orion and Scorpius
     were generating heats of 45,000â€F-5,000â€ hotter than had been
     thought. Finding, from data obtained by NASAâ€™sOao I1 satellite
      (launched Dec. 7, 1968),suggested young stars might be more massive
     and maturing faster than originally believed and supported theories of
     thermonuclear processes in starsâ€™ interiors that generated such heats.
     Oao I1 data also showed younger stars had more complex chemical
     composition than stars formed near universeâ€™s beginning. They con-
     tained fairly large amounts of carbon, silicon, magnesium, and heavier
     elements, as well as predominant hydrogen and helium. Other Oao I1

      MSC Director of Engineering Development Maxime A. Faget outlined
   concept of space vehicle with two reusable stages-booster rocket and
   orbiter craft-both with fixed wings, long fuselages, and rear rocket
   engines. Vehicle would be 225 ft high and weigh 2.5 million Ibs at
   launch. Orbiter vehicle, capable of carrying 25,000 lbs of cargo and
   passengers, would be attached pickaback to booster stageâ€™s upper half.
   Booster, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, would elevate
   orbiter to fringe of space, separate, drop away, and cruise to landing
   like jet airliner. Booster probably would be piloted by two astronauts.
   Orbiter would ignite rocket engine to continue upward to space station
   orbiting at 300-mi altitude. After link-up with space station, transfer
   of cargo or 12 passengers, and pickup of new load, orbiter would be
   steered by pilot into atmosphere and controlled glide to landing on
   10,000-ft runways used by aircraft. Key to reentry would be orbiterâ€™s
   Lâ€˜angle of attackâ€ when hitting atmosphere. Faget proposed 60â€™ angle
   with nose up, so flattened bottom would catch airflow to slow descent.
   Small jet engines would be fired to help control final descent phases of
   both orbiter and booster. Outer surface of vehicles would be made of
   metal alloys that could sustain temperatures to 2,700â€™F. Wilford,

        John W. Dyer, Manager of Biosatellite Project Operations at ARC,
    said all of automatically controlled functions performed â€œbeautifullyâ€
    after launch and spacecraft and instrumentation performed well
    throughout mission. â€œThe animal was reported to be enthusiastically
    eating and drinking, and after four or five days, a routine operation
    capable of going the duration of on-board consumables was projected.â€
    Clear data on Bonny and entire flight system were recorded at 16 sta-
    tions in 180 intervals of 5 to 10 min each and good quality data were
    returned from onboard tape and film records recovered with capsule.
        Bonny remained alert until eighth day, providing much new infor-
    mation on cycles of sleep and wakefulness at zero g. Dr. W. Ross Adey
    of UCLA, principal experimenter, said one important discovery was al-
    terations in circadian rhythms, daily rhythms in physiological func-
    tions. â€œAt least it is clear that if there is not an actual prolongation of
    the rhythms there is a very significant phase shift so that the animal
    woke later and later each day.â€ Most interesting discovery about sleep
    patterns was that dream sleep, which constituted 20% of normal nightâ€™s
    sleep on earth and was characterized by rapid eye movements ( R E M ) ,
    occurred in space. â€œIt had never been clear in space whether man or
    animals have this REM sleep, and there is evidence that decreased
    gravitational inputs, or decreased inputs from the body will seriously
    disrupt it. So we were very interested to see that REM sleep in the
                 .
     monkey . . that there was indeed a great deal of sleep of this REM
                                    .
    type, and that it occurred in . . an intermediate stage of sleep.â€
        One of first abnormalities noted in Bonny was pendular eye move-
    ment, swinging movement that occurred when vestibular mechanism in
    inner ear was disturbed. Fluid was moving in some fashion that might
    indicate pressure or cooling if it occurred on earth. â€œNone of these
    conditions applied here. But the weightlessness would allow movements
     of the fluid which were probably unusual. . . . This is interesting be-
    cause the Apollo astronauts who have now much more room to move
     around than in . . . the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft have . . . almost
     uniformly reported some degree of vestibular disturbances.â€
        By eighth day, brain and body temperature and central venous pres-
     sure had dropped dangerously. Fluid loss by sweating and diuresis was
     high, apparently because of redistribution of blood in visceral pools
    from weightlessness. On recovery Bonny was semicomatose and his
    temperature was below 35Â°C. Immediate resuscitation measures with
     intravenous fluid were begun and monkeyâ€™s condition improved sub-
     stantially. â€œThe temperature came up to about 35.8, the heart rate
     stabilized, and the blood pressure came up. . . . And the animal was
                     ..
     lifting his head . and making coordinated movements with all four
     limbs. And then quite suddenly, about twelve hours after recovery, a
    condition of ventricular fibrillation ensued. It came on very suddenly,
     and the heartbeat became totally disordered. And there was no re-
     covery. This is a common occurrence in monkeys of this species when
     recovering from hypothermia . . . and death is almost a certainty.â€
         Autopsy revealed 20% loss in body weight, much higher than
     3%-8% reported for astronuats in early days of flights. Restraint,
     weightlessness, and decreased feedback from peripheral structures had
     decreased shivering response, and monkey had failed to respond to
     falling temperature with normal thermogenic response. Restraint and,

     particularly, weightlessness had led to pooling of blood in thorax and
     abdomen, raising central venous pressures and leading to loss of fluid
     through kidney and sweating. Dr. Adey said mission was â€œhighly suc-
     cessful in revealing physiological effects of weightlessness in spite of
     the reduced duration of the experimentâ€™, and indicated â€œgreat value of
     carefully designed animal experiments in collection of important bio-
     medical data relevant to manned flight.â€
        Virtually every piece of information that could be drawn about
     manned space flight indicated similar changes in astronauts, though to
     smaller degree, he said. Scientists still did not know whether gravity
     was necessary for long-duration space flights. â€œTherefore, I think it is
     premature to consider the design of space platforms or the larger space
     stations until we know more from the biomedical point of view about
     what is absolutely necessary.â€ Presidentâ€™s Science Advisory Committee
     report to President Nixon, being printed, would say necessary bio-
     medical basis for elaborate space platforms and space stations did not
     exist in NASA or in scientific community. (Transcript)
    Retirement of Dr. Abe Silverstein, LeRC Director, was announced by Dr.
                   Paine, NASA Administrator. ,He would be succeeded Nov. 1

     by OART Acting Administrator Bruce T. Lundin. In requesting retire-
     ment, Dr. Silverstein wrote: â€œAS NASA engages in its second ten-year
     program, it may be important that the men whose decisions initiate
     the new long-range projects be available to complete them. Since I do
     not think I can stretch my 40 years of service into 50, it is perhaps

     best . if I bow out now.â€ Few have made so great a contribution to
     our national space effort,â€ Dr. Paine said.
         Dr. Silverstein had been first Director of Space Flight Programs in
      NASA Hq. in 1958. Under his leadership first US. man-in-space pro-
     gram, Project Mercury, had been planned and groundwork laid for
      Gemini and Apollo programs. He had joined NASA at Langley Aero-
      nautical Laboratory in 1929 and helped design and later was in charge
      of Full-scale Wind Tunnel. Transferring to Lewis Laboratory in 1943,
     he was responsible for conception, design, and construction of first
      US. supersonic-propulsion wind tunnels. After three years with NASA
      Hq., 1958-1961, he returned to LeRC as Director.
         Lundin had served NASA since 1943, when he joined staff at Lewis.
      In 1961 he was appointed Associate Director for Development. In May
      1968 he went to NASA Hq. as Deputy Associate Administrator for OART.

     do for perhaps five years. The fact that the Russians apparently failed
     must have been humiliating to them, and gratifying to the Americans,
     but it is unlikely to be more than a temporary check to a programme
     that has rolled with considerable success since the Russians put the
     worldâ€™s first satellite in orbit more than a decade ago. The slow prog-
     ress reflects the state of Soviet industry, but is steady progress with
     few loose ends. The American programme, trimmed and squeezed by
     political pressure and public opinion, is trailing appreciably more
     loose ends; despite the victory on the moon Nasa will have to set
     about tidying them up. And it is then that the Russians will have the

    since task force appointed Aug. 14, 1967, by President Johnson to for-
    mulate â€œnational communications policyâ€ had submitted report. Nixon
    Administration had begun separate investigation. Meanwhile, â€œsup-
    porters of a domestic system, frustrated by repeated delay, are pushing
    the White House and the FCC for a quick decision.â€ ComSatCorp had
    always been â€œardent advocate.â€ In 1965 and 1966, NBC and ABC had
    â€œenthusiastically embracedâ€ comsats as means of transmitting TV
    signals. Recently, CBS President Dr. Frank M. Stanton had become con-
     vert, â€œapparently provokedâ€ by AT&Tâ€™S new, higher TV signal rates.
       Within month, White House might propose approval of domestic
    comsat system but FCC would still have difficult task of approving
    specific system. Only limited number of comsats could be orbited
     24,000 mi above equator without interfering with each othersâ€™ trans-
    mission, even if Government were to allow more than one comsat sys-
    tem. If comsats assumed major role in communications, any decision
    allocating ownership rights could involve multimillions in eventual
     annual revenue. At first networks had asked to be allowed to create
    separate system, while ComSatCorp and AT&T advocated single system.
    Unresolved issue helped explain â€œextended years of study.â€ However,
    recent changes made compromise more likely. (VPost, 10/26/69, F1)

     for scientific objectives. Board recommended : immediately focusing
     lunar program on optimizing returns on investment already made in
     Apollo through maximum use of existing Apollo technology; giving
     priority to current Apollo lunar-exploration phase should choice be
     necessary in early 1970s between funding major new manned explora-
     tion technology and funding extensions of Apollo lunar technology;
     periodic reevaluation of NASAâ€™s   proposed lunar landing sites; earliest
     possible extensions of Apollo technology to increase scientific returns
     and increasing interval up to six months between missions to allow
     incorporation of improvements; early provision of roving vehicle to
      transport astronauts at least 3.1-6.2 mi (5-10 km) from LM; inch-

    NASA objective was to insert spacecraft into quasi-polar orbit in which
    it could study Van Allen belt, Northern Hemisphere auroral zones,
    and spectral variation of solar particles versus time during solar flares.
       The &&-high, 30-in-dia cylindrical satellite carried seven experi-
    ments from five German research institutes to continue studies con-
    ducted by NASA Explorer and OGO satellites. Data would be available
    exclusively to German principal investigators for one year. Launch
    was first in series of cooperative missions between NASA and German
    Ministry for Scientific Research (BMWF)under July 1965 agreement.
    BMWF was responsible for design, development, fabrication, and test-
    ing of spacecraft and experiments and for ground-support equipment

November 7: West German research satellite Azur-first satellite in a cooperative
Federal Republic of Germany and NASA program-was orbited from WTR by NASA to

 ∞ NASA published A Long-Range Program in Space Astronomy: Position
     Paper of the Astronomy Missions Board (NASA SP-213), which Board
     had submitted to NASA in July. Board of 19 leading US. astronomers-
     chaired by Dr. Leo Goldberg, Harvard College Observatory Director-
     had been appointed by NASA in autumn 1967 to consult scientific com-
     munity and propose program for 1970s.
        Astronomy had â€œfar greater potential for advancement by the space
     program than any other branch of science.â€ Astronomical instruments
     in space could reach regions of electromagnetic spectrum unable to
     penetrate earthâ€™s atmosphere; thus, â€œmost fundamental problems of
     astronomy may be brought within range of solution.â€
        Board provided guidelines for minimum balanced program costing
     $250 million annually in 1970s and optimum program â€œproceeding at
     fastest possible rate consistent with available scientific and technical
     manpowerâ€ and costing $500 million annually during same period.
     Proposals included â€œcareful assignment of priorities and balanced allo-
     cation of resources in order to optimize scientific progress on such
     problems as the origin of the universe; the course of stellar evolution,
      including the ultimate destiny of the Sun and solar system; the exist-
     ence of other planetary systems, some of which may support other
      forms of intelligent life; and other problems with deep philosophical
      significance which are of great interest to everyone and are therefore
      properly supported by public expenditure.â€
         Board recommended increased effort in x-ray and gamma-ray as-
      tronomy using Explorer spacecraft with large payload capability;
      optical w astronomy program leading to large space telescope in
      1980s; R&D of detectors and small cooling systems for infrared astron-

    It is another extremely important step in manâ€™s exploration of earthâ€™s
    natural satellite, a venture accompanied by great risk yet promXng
    large rewards in additional knowledge. The mere fact that the Apollo
    12 astronauts are scheduled to spend almost three times as long walk-
    ing on the moon as their predecessors and to bring back to earth part
    of Surveyor 3-which landed in 1967-emphasizes how much more
    complex and ambitious this mission is.â€ Second moon landing might
    seem less glamorous than first, â€œbut it requires great bravery and skill

    Dr. Lee A. DuBridge: â€œIn order to define an appropriate mix of
    manned and unmanned operations, NASA will need to â€˜qualify man for
    space flightâ€™ in the broadest sense. That is, NASA should pursue a bio-
    medical program which explores the optimization of manâ€™s role in
    space, the limitations on his effectiveness and means to circumvent
                      ..
     those limitations . a program to determine the best use of man as
    a space subsystem in interaction with automated subsystems. An effec-

   tions toward strong biomedical research capability. â€œPressures for
   early and reasonably certain success led to placing primary emphasis
   initially on validation of the capability to construct, orbit, and recover
   manned spacecraft, with long-range, scientific goals in the biomedical
   field set aside as potentially interfering with flight objectives. Scientific
   requirements were thus deemphasized at the very time when develop-
   ment of basic scientific knowledge and a cadre of scientific talent
   should have been begun.â€ NASA was now faced â€œwith the question of
    qualifying man for more complex tasks in space, for longer duration
   flights, and of evaluating man as an integral part of the spacecraft
   man-machine system, without sound biomedical foundation.â€ In par-
   ticular, â€œdecisions concerning development directions for the next gen-
    eration of manned spacecraft systems for use in earth orbit must be
   made without an adequate basis of understanding.â€
       NASA should plan overall biomedical program using resources, per-
    sonnel, and experience of other Government areas, especially DOD, and
    support multidisciplinary environmental medical laboratories within
    universities. Report favored international cooperation in space explora-
    tion for peaceful purposes, close communications with biomedical com-
    munity, and broadened participation of biomedical scientists in space
    flight programs. NASA should affiliate biologically and medically trained
    astronauts with research components of NASA or qualified institutions.
    They should be assigned to MSC flight-crew organization only when
    participating in specific missions. Report recommended that NASA con-
    sider separating space biomedical research from organization conduct-
    ing space missions and from flight medical services. (Text)

∞ Behind â€œcomputerized smoothnessâ€ of Apollo 12 countdown, there was

    â€œsmoldering and sometimes explosive struggleâ€ at KSC among scien-
    tists, engineers, and Government officials over how to run space pro-
    gram, John Noble W-ilford said in New York Times. General
     uncertainty over future of NASA and of space priorities was fueling
     â€œinternal feudâ€ which began to be exposed after July Apollo 11 lunar
    landing. Successful Apollo 12 flight could intensify controversy by
     raising â€œstakesâ€ in struggle. Scientists wanted greater emphasis on sci-
    entific experiments; scientist-astronauts were disenchanted at slim
     prospects of space flights ; engineers, especially at MSC, resented scien-
     tistsâ€™ attitude. ( N Y T , 11/11/69, 1)

     successful by NASA. All spacecraft systems had operated satisfactorily
     and all primary objectives had been met. Spacecraft had been operating
     at slightly lower than expected temperatures and elevation motor cur-
     rent was higher than on previous flights. As result, elevation servo
     jitter was less than 2 arc secs, zero to peak, best achieved on any oso
     flight. (NASA Proj Off)

November 18-21: Apollo 12 CSM and LM separated in Lunar orbit and the LM Intrepid
made a pinpoint landing on the moon Nov. 19, 600 feet away from Surveyor 111, which
had landed April 19, 1967. Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., and Alan L. Bean deployed
experiments, took photos, and collected samples in two EVA periods. A t left Conrad,
photographed by Bean, examined Surveyor 111 in the Ocean of Storms, with Intrepid
on the horizon. Above, a crewman used hand tools from a tool carrier.


November 14: President Nixon and his daughter Tricia (foreground) watched prepa-
rations for the launch of Apollo 12 from KSC, while Dr. Thomas 0 . Paine, NASA Admin-
istrator, shielded Mrs. Nixon from rain. Seconds into flight an electrical discharge
shut down the spacecraft fuel cells, but the astronauts corrected the condition.


     10,000 ft with tops at 21,000 ft. During ascent observers on ground
     saw two parallel streaks of lightning flash between clouds and launch
     pad. NASA reported electrical transients, later attributed to electrical
     potential discharges from clouds through spacecraft to ground, had
     suddenly shut off spacecraftâ€™s electrical power at 00:36 GET and turned
     on numerous alarms in CM. Spacecraft automatically switched to
     backup battery power while crew restored primary power system.
        Commander Conrad radioed, â€œWe had everything in the world drop
     out.â€ Control Center commented, â€œWeâ€™ve had a couple of cardiac ar-
     rests down here, too.â€ â€œThere wasnâ€™t time up here,â€ Conrad answered.
        Power system remained normal throughout rest of mission. Space-
     craft entered planned parking orbit with 118-mi (189.9-km) apogee

     separation clearly showed CSM transposing and docking with LM at
     3:27 GET and ice on windows from rain â‚¬rozen during liftoff. Crew
      ejected CSM/LM from S-IVB and conducted first SPS burn for trans-
     lunar insertion. Slingshot maneuver placed S-IVB into earth orbit with

     515,549.4- to 560,429.9-mi (829,519.0- to 901,731.7-km) apogee and
     93,213.2- to 109,324.1-mi (149,980.0- to 175,902.5-km) perigee and
     period of 39 to 45 days, instead of heliocentric orbit planned, because
     of error in instrument unit. To ensure that electrical transients during
     launch had not affected LM systems, Conrad and Bean entered LM at
     7 :20 GET for housekeeping and systems checks. All checks indicated
     systems were satisfactory. Translunar insertion maneuver was so accu-
     rate that midcourse maneuver No. 1 was not necessary. Midcourse
     correction No. 2, at 30:53 GET, placed spacecraft on desired hybrid
     circumlunar trajectory with closest approach of 69.1 mi; third and
     fourth maneuvers were not necessary. Good-quality TV coverage of
     preparations for and performance of midcourse maneuver was trans-
     mitted for 47 min.
        Conrad and Bean began transfer to LM during translunar coast %
     hr earlier than planned to obtain full TV coverage through Goldstone
     tracking station. The 56-min transmission, beginning at 62 :52 GET,
     showed excellent color pictures of CSM, intravehicular transfer, LM in-
     terior, earth, and moon. Gordon reported crew was in good condition.
     TV broadcast scheduled for 81:30 GET before lunar orbit insertion was
     canceled because of sun angle and glare on spacecraft windows.

        Spacecraft entered lunar orbit with 194.3-mi (312.6-km) apolune
     and 72.0-mi (115.9-km) perilune at 83:25 GET (10:47 pm EST Nov.
     17) after first SPS burn. During first lunar orbit good quality TV
     coverage of lunar surface was transmitted for 33 min. Crew provided
     excellent descriptions of lunar features. Second SPS burn circularized
     orbit with 76.1-mi (122.5-km) apolune and 62.5-mi (100.6-km)
     perilune at 87:47 GET. Conrad and Bean transferred to LM for 11/2-hr
     housekeeping, voice and telemetry test, and oxygen-purge-system check
     and then returned to CM.
        November 18-21: Conrad and Bean reentered LM and checked out
     all systems before firing reaction-control-system thrusters at 107:54
     GET to separate CSM and LM. Descent-propulsion-system engine pro-
     pelled LM to position 4.6-5.8 mi north of expected ground track and
     error was corrected during powered descent maneuver. LM guidance
     computer was updated during powered descent to compensate â‚¬or indi-
     cations that trajectory was 4,200 ft short of target point. At entry into
     approach phase trajectory was close to nominal. Crew took over manual
     control at 370 ft, passed over right side of target crater, and flew to
     left for landing on moon's Ocean of Storms about 600 ft from Surveyor
     ZIZ spacecraft at 111:32 GET ( 1 5 5 am EST Nov. 19). Landing coordi-
     nates were approximately 3.036" S and 23.418O W. Conrad reported
     extensive dust obscuring view during final descent. After landing he
     reported sighting CMS orbiting overhead. Gordon, orbiting moon in

    CM Yankee Clipper, reported sighting Surveyor 111 and Intrepid on
    moon.
        Conrad opened LM hatch at 115:ll GET, descended LM ladder, and
    deployed modularized equipment stowage assembly (MESA) containing
    camera which recorded his descent to lunar surface. Conrad reported
    seeing Surveyor III spacecraft and said LM had landed 25 ft down-
    range from lip of crater. Conrad, inches shorter than Neil A. Arm-
    strong, who had stepped onto moon July 21, had difficulty taking last
    step from ladder. When he touched lunar surface at 115.22 GET ( 6 : M
    am EST Nov. 19) Conrad said, â€œWhoopee! Man, that may have been
    a small step for Neil, but thatâ€™s a long one for me.â€ He said lunar sur-
    face was soft and loosely packed, causing his boots to dig in as he
    walked, and sun was bright like a spotlight. LM had landed so gently
    its shock-absorbing legs were barely telescoped by gentle impact.
         Conrad recorded Beanâ€™s descent to lunar surface at 115:52 GET
     (7:l4 am EST Nov. 19). Shortly after color TV camera was removed
    from MESA bracket, transmission was lost and was not regained for
    remainder of EVA. Crew colIected 40- to 50-Ib contingency sample and
    reported mounds resembling volcanoes. Mounds were 4 ft high with
    flattened tops 5 f t wide and sides sloping out to 15- to 20-ft dia. Con-
    rad said he saw neither breccia nor vesicular rocks, only basalts.
    Lithium hydroxide canisters and contingency sample were transferred
    to LM; S-band antenna, solar wind composition experiment, and Amer-
    ican flag were deployed as planned. ALSEP with SNAP-27 atomic gen-
    erator was deployed 600-700 f t from LM. Shortly after deployment
    passive seismometer transmitted to earth signals from astronautsâ€™ foot-
    steps as they returned to LM. During deployment astronauts kicked up
    dust and some adhered to instruments. Overall effect would be deter-
    mined through long-term measurements of systemâ€™s engineering pa-
    rameters. Conrad and Bean dusted each other off and entered Intrepid
     after 3 hrs 56 min walking on lunar surface.
         After resting inside LM and checking plans for second EVA period,
     astronauts left LM at 131:33 GET (10:55 pm EST Nov. 19), 1 hr
     min ahead of schedule. Astronauts stored LM TV camera in equipment
     transfer bag for return to earth for failure analysis. Conrad walked to
     ALSEP site to check leveling of lunar atmosphere detector. Astronaut
     movement on surface was recorded on passive seismometer and lunar
     surface magnetometer. EVA traverse took crew to ALSEP deployment
     site, Head Crater, Bench Crater, Sharp Crater, Halo Crater, Surveyor
     I I I site, Block Crater, and back to LM. Astronauts walked 1,500-2,000
     ft from LM, covering about 6,000-ft distance, their confidence and
     speed increasing with experience. After walk Conrad reported he had
     fallen once but Bean had picked him up without difficulty. Conrad
     rolled grapefruit-sized rock down wall of Bead Crater about 300400
     ft from passive seismometer, but no significant response was detected.
          Crew obtained desired photographic panoramas, core samples, trench
     sample, lunar environment sample, and assorted rock, dirt, bedrock,
     and molten samples. They reported fine dust buildup on all sides of
     larger rocks and said soil color lightened as depth increased. Crew re-
     ported Surveyor footpad marks were still visible and entire spacecraft
      looked brown, as if something had rained on it. G a s parts were not

   broken. Crew retrieved parts of Surveyor III, including TV camera
   and soil scoop. They then retrieved solar wind composition experiment
   and stowed it in equipment bag, took stereo pictures near LM, and
   transferred all collected samples, parts, and equipment to LM. They
   dusted off, reentered LM, and jettisoned equipment according to plan,
   closing hatch by 134:82 GET (2:44 am EST Nov. 20) , after 3 hrs 49
   min walking on lunar surface in second EVA period.
      While LM was on moon Gordon, orbiting moon in CSM, completed
   lunar multispectral photography experiment and photographed Wall
   of Theophilus and future landing sites, Fra Mauro and Descartes. Film
   would be analyzed to aid scientists in planning for future sample col-
   lection and in extrapolating known compositions from returned samples
   to parts of moon that would not be visited.
      At 142204 GET (9:26 am EST Nov. 20) LM successfully lifted off
   moon after 31 hrs 31 min on lunar surface, leaving LM descent stage.
   Astronauts brought back 95 lbs of lunar surface samples, parts of Sur-
   veyor 111, films, and miniature flags of 136 nations, 50 US. states, and
   4 US. possessions. A 1.2-sec overburn of LM ascent propulsion system
   caused by incorrect manual switching sequence prevented automatic
   shutdown of engine and resulted in insertion velocity 32 fps greater
   than planned, placing LM in orbit with 71.4-mi (114.9-km) apolune
   and 10.6-mi ( 17.1-km) perilune. Crew quickly recognized discrep-
   ancy, manually shut down engine, and used RSC trim maneuver to
   enter planned orbit with 53.3-mi (85.8-km) apolune and 10.1-mi
    (16.3-km) perilune.
      Rendezvous maneuvers occurred as planned and LM docked with
   CSM at 145:36 GET ( 1 2 5 8 pm EST Nov. 20). Tv was transmitted from
    CSM for last 24 min of rendezvous sequence. Crew transferred with
   samples, equipment, and fb to CSM; LM ascent stage was jettisoned
                                i
   and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 5:17 pm EST Nov. 20
   about 44.9 mi (72.2 km) southeast of Surveyor 111. Crash was detected
   by seismometer left on moon and produced reverberations lasting for
   more than 30 min. Crew made CSM plane-change maneuver at 159:05
   GET and took high-resolution and stereo-strip photos and tracked land-
   marks, to conclude planned photography of Fra Mauro, Descartes, and
   Lalande.
       November 21-24: Crew fired SPS engine at 172:27 GET (3:49 pm
    EST Nov. 21), injecting CSM into transearth trajectory after 89 hrs
    2 min (44 revolutions) in lunar orbit. Midcourse correction No. 5, at
    188:28 GET, was so accurate that sixth correction was not necessary.
   TV transmission of receding moon and spacecraft interior was trans-
   mitted for 38 min, beginning at 192:27 GET. Good-quality transmission
    of question-and-answer period with scientists and press was conducted
    for 37 min, beginning at 224307 GET. Final midcourse correction-
    No. 7 at 241 :24 GET-resulted in predicted entry velocity of 36,116 fps
    and flight path angle of -6.47'.    CM Yankee Clipper separated from
    SM at 244:07 GET. Parachute deployment and other reentry events oc-
    curred as planned. Yankee Clipper splashed down in mid-Pacific at

    operations for spacecraft using Delta booster. In interim report board
    said recommendation was based on findings of Failure Review Board
    which had investigated failures of Delta 71 (July 25) and Delta 73
     (Aug. 27). Delta 71, carrying Zntelsut-ZZZ F-5, had failed because of
     motor case rupture or nozzle failure; Delta 73, carrying Pioneer E,
    had failed because of vibrating relief valve which caused hydraulic oil
    leak. Failure Review Board suggested additional internal insulation,
    pressure tests, equipment x-rays, installation of specially tested and
     selected valves, and new acceptance tests of hydraulic system. Next

∞ Total $21.35-billion investment â€œin the development and demonstration
    of a national manned lunar landing capabilityâ€ was detailed by Dr.
    Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, in letter to Sen. Clinton P.
    Anderson (D-N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aero-
    nautical and Space Sciences. â€œAt the time of its establishment, the
    national goal of a manned lunar landing and return in this decade
    represented the most difficult technological endeavor ever to challenge
    the American nation. During this period, senior NASA officials in testi-
    mony before the Congress estimated the cost . . . at between $20 and
    $40 billion.â€ Estimate was refined to approximately $19.5 bilIion in
    March 1964, with assumption â€œthere would be a timely initiation of a
    follow-on program which would bear a portion of the relatively fixed
    cost required to develop and sustain this national capability.â€
       Estimates then and annual reassessments had reflected total program
    cost, including cost of initial lunar landing. Lunar objective â€œwas not
     simply an end in itself but, rather, provided the focus for the effort
    to attain space supremacy for whatever the national interest required.â€
       In March 1966 NASA had furnished estimate of $22.718 billion based
    on assumption that there would not be timely initiation of follow-on
     program. In April 1969 NASA furnished estimate of $23.877 billion,
    which would still be valid if negative assumption had materialized.
    â€œBut with the success of Apollo 11, we have the opportunity to utilize
    this demonstrated capability in a more meaningful way. By improving
    payloads and modifying spacecraft to increase lunar surface systems,
    we can enhance significantly the return of scientific data from both
    lunar orbit and the lunar surface.â€
       NASA had met national commitment â€œat a cost nearer the lower end
    of the range of estimatesâ€ despite â€œunpredictable substantial infla-
    tionary conditions.â€ Actual cost accrued through July 31, 1969, was
    $21.35 billion, of which $2 billion was value of flight hardware avail-
    able for future flights. Capital assets included were approximately
    $2.8 billion and were â€œof continuing national value.â€
        Apollo was â€œtriumph in management as well as in technology and
    engineering which united government, industry and universities in a
    common peaceful undertaking. At least one-half million people worked

    CM pilot Richard F. Gordon, Jr., had both received promotions to
    commander, USN. Apollo 12 LM Pilot Alan L. Bean, also commander,
    USN, now rated promotion to captain, but was junior crewman in age,
    service in grade, and space experience. Bean promotion might â€œirri-
    tateâ€ others but would be fair to Bean. Promotion for all three astro-
    nauts would be â€œunfair to other astronauts who have flown twice or
    three times and only promoted once.â€ President Nixon might have to
    make â€œstickyâ€ decision. ( W Post, 11/21/69, A17)

    send man to the stars in the predictable future. NERVA prototype, only
    working model of new-generation engine in US., was too bulky for
    flight. Refined version, scheduled for test flight in mid-I970s, was
    expected to land man on Mars. Beyond that all was conjecture. â€œThere
    is no design concept and even the basic idea of a controlled thermo-
    nuclear reaction has not been demonstrated.â€ It was not known what
    thrust could be generated by fusion engine. U.S.S.R. had announced
    development of plasma-jet or ion-thrust engine which, as designed,
    would not be useful in deep space or close to earth. U.S. scientists

    are important to bomber aircraft because they affect the engine size
    which is necessary to accelerate to higher supersonic speeds. . . . It is
    in this speed range that many interactions, shock waves, and flow sepa-
    rations occur that become important to the thrust, drag, and stall
    margin of the engine and on the lift, drag and buffet characteristics of
    the aircraft. Unfortunately, mathematical prediction techniques do not
    work well in this speed range and experimental testing becomes of
    major importance.â€ Only very small models could be used in transonic
    tunnels â€œand scaling up results from very small models to full size air-
    planes is at best difficult and usually impossible. We will be paced here
     for some time to come by the capabilities of our experimental facili-
    ties.â€ (Testimony)

December 10: NASA announced it was proceeding with plans and prepara-
    tions for launch of Apollo 13 manned lunar landing mission to Fra
    Mauro on March 12, 1970. Decision was based on review of photos
    taken of Fra Mauro area and successful demonstration of pinpoint
     landing techniques by Apollo 12. Fra Mauro was flat, vast highland
    area about 110 mi east of Apollo 12 landing point on Ocean of Storms.

∞ End of era in satellite watching would come with discontinuation in June
     1970 of Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s optical tracking program, John

    ing 10-yr support of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatoryâ€™s efforts
     at Cambridge, Mass. Optical tracking had cost $4 million annually
    since 1958, first through NSF, then NASA. Program had led to nation-
    wide â€œDial-A-Satelliteâ€™7telephone net by which tape-recorded messages
     told callers where satellites could be seen in sky. Service had become
     â€œDial-A-Phenomenonâ€ to note ecological, geophysical, and astronomical
    events, since decay of only visible satellites, Echo Z and Echo ZZ.
     Smithsonian Observatory had watched satellites with worldwide battery
     of Baker-Nunn cameras, which had been phased out except for observ-
     ing maneuvers in major space flights. Observatoryâ€™s geodetic program
     was being expanded, with two lasers operational, one on Mount-Hop-
     kins, Ariz., the other in Athens, Greece, but financial support had been
     halved for current fiscal year and would be cut to $1.3 million in 1971.

        Dust on surface was a major problem, Conrad said. Ground was soft
   and astronauts sank in significantly. It was difficult to keep experiment
   package clean. â€œIt was almost impossible for us to walk around those
   packages without our little dust cloud and at any time the dust hit the
   surface of the package it stuck and the worst thing you could do was
                                                                               .
   try to rub it off because you just smeared it over them even worse. . .â€
       To question about dficulty in landing LM on moon, Conrad replied
   he had misinterpreted correct gage reading and underestimated accu-
                              .                                         ..
   racy of LMâ€™S descent. â€œ. . I felt that that gage was not . giving me
   the proper information. I found it quite hard to believe that I could
                                                                   ..
   have gotten the velocity killed quite as well as I did . and so I was
   continually going out the window to get roll information and a general
   idea of my lateral and horizontal velocities.â€ Although Conrad felt
   landing on moon was not â€œan amateurâ€™s game,â€ he felt satisfactory
   landings under completely instrumented flight rule conditions could be
   made. Crew had suggested adding instrument that would provide auto-
   matic nulling of horizontal and lateral velocities but would leave pilot
   with rate of descent command. Conrad said he did not think dust dur-
    ing descent would be problem on future missions â€œas long as you get
    a look at your landing site before you get into the dust, and ascertain
                                                                                .

   donâ€™t recommend any change from the procedures that weâ€™re using
   right now.â€
        Bean said photos of moon were realistic, but photos of earth were
    not. â€œAs we view the Moon from the Earth, itâ€™s white and flat; itâ€™s
                                                     ..
    quite pretty. When you get up at the Moon . itâ€™s much the same; itâ€™s

∞ Termination of Project Blue Book-USAF investigation of UFOs-was an-
    nounced by Dr. Robert C. Seamaas, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force.
    Projectâ€™s continuation could not be justified â€œon the ground of national

    tion of Jan. 9 report by Univ. of Colorado, NAS review of Univ. of
    Colorado report, and USAF investigations of UFO reports since 1948.
    USAF had concluded: no UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by
    USAF had threatened US. security; there had been no evidence that
    â€œunidentifiedâ€ sightings represented technological developments or
    principles beyond range of scientific knowledge; and there had been

 ∞ House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Space
   Science and Applications published Future of the Bioscience Program
   of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Report con-
   cluded bioscientific experimentation on man and animals in first dec-
   ade of space flight had been â€œrelatively meager.â€ Scientific research
   on manned flight had been â€œminimalâ€ and had not included biomedical
   experimentation of kind done in Biosatellite program. More research
   was urgently needed on biological influence of zero gravity and effects
   of change or elimination of rhythmic daily periodicity of animal and
   plant life on earth. Space technology now permitted advanced scientific
   research on these and related biological factors.
      While professors exchanged scientific theories freely, NASA repre-
   sentatives inclined toward â€œprotecting jurisdiction authority and ex-
   tending organizational power within the framework of their agency.â€
   Complete information exchange should prevail, especially in bioscience,
   â€œwhich eventually may affect human life.â€ â€œRivalryâ€ between science
   and engineering was â€œreal.â€ In NASA, science was â€œusedâ€ but â€œrarely
   accepted in its own right by the engineering management.â€
      While knowledge from 14-day missions was adequate to proceed
   with planning of 28-day AAP mission, it was inadequate to proceed
   safely with proposed 56-day flight or longer planetary flights without
   monitoring astronauts on 28-day mission in experiments â€œbeyond any
   yet undertaken in manned flight.â€ Further biosatellite exploration with
   primates and instruments was â€œmerited if not indeed prescribed.â€ Final
   evaluation of Biosatellite 111 would determine new mechanisms and
   improved monitoring of test mammals to be programmed.
      Subcommittee endorsed proposal of Dr. W. Ross Adey, NASAâ€™s          prin-
   cipal investigator for Biosatellite 111, that basic measurements be re-
   quired on all flight crews and recommended reinstitution of biosatellite
   experiments with animals in earth orbit, extension of bioscience
   research to planets when technologically feasible, uprating of science
   role as mission objective, and NASA and Congress delegation of â€œhighest
    relative priorityâ€ to â€œbioscience programs which offer the most im-

   Advisory Panel for â€œnew level of biomedical research capability,â€ that
   OMSF conduct biomedical experiments on astronauts during 28-day

    and was almost shouted down when he suggested US.-U.S.S.R. coopera-
    tion in internationalized space stations. In presidential address Dr.
    Roberts, President of University Corp. for Atmospheric Research, said
    space technology had â€œvastly enlarged the arsenals of the United States
    and the U.S.S.R., bringing to reality hitherto fanciful modes of military

December 27: Scientists from US., Canada, and France, participating in
    NASA-sponsored 25-day probe of aurora borealis Nov. 24 to Dec. 18,
    had discovered very high ratios of red oxygen emissions to blue nitro;
    gen emissions in earthâ€™s upper atmosphere, NASA announced. Higher
    measured ratios indicated many solar electrons that bombarded atmos-

    polar atmosphere than at other latitudes, or high temperatures in upper
    polar atmosphere. Studies in airborne laboratory-NASA Convair 990
    jet aircraft Galileo-also detected bombardment of earthâ€™s atmosphere

       Highlight of 1969 was achievement of major goal in NASAâ€™s      Apollo
    program-to land man on the moon and return him safely to earth.
    Lunar landing system completed final phases of test and demonstration
    when Apollo 9 demonstrated operation of LM in earth orbit and Apollo
    10 demonstrated operation of complete Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit,
    with LM making two passes within 47,000 ft of lunar surface. Apollo
    program climaxed with Apollo 11, July 16-24, when LM Eagle landed
    on moon and Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.
    -first men on the moon-performed tasks on lunar surface, redocked
    with CSM in lunar orbit, and returned safely to earth with lunar
    samples. Apollo 12 successfully accomplished second manned lunar
    landing with pinpoint accuracy, touching down close to Surveyor 111,
    which had landed on moon April 19, 1967. Crew set up first ALSEP on
    lunar surface and returned safely to earth with lunar samples and parts
    of Surveyor I l l .
        Unmanned Mariner V I and Mariner VI1 passed within 2,000 mi of
    Mars, transmitting more than 200 times more data about Mars than

∞Year 1969 was one of critical decision and realignment of programs for
   NASA as primary goal of first decade was achieved through Apollo pro-
   gram. Post-Apollo planning had preceded the coming of the Nixon
   Administration and Apollo 11. Budget retrenchment accelerated
   throughout Government as cost of Vietnam war continued high and
   White House sought to lessen inflation by fiscal economy. Nationwide
   reevaluation of societal priorities emphasized problems of pollution,
   poverty, and crime.

   worldwide-mushroomed US. enthusiasm for manned space achieve-
   ment. NASA announced development of plans for further lunar missions
   and post-Apollo planetary exploration. But year was turning point, with
   completion of a major goal and examination of possible new goals and
   priorities for the next decade. Phasing down of Apollo program after
   climax brought shifts in program emphasis and in personnel. Most of
   initial Saturn V launch vehicles had been completed. Hardware re-
   quirements would decrease as missions slowed. Peak costs during
    1960s had built NASA base of people, technology, and facilities as
   national capability to conduct space missions.
       Future space objectives and budget options were examined, within

    Government and outside, for balance between more manned missions
    and more unmanned scientific exploration and applications of knowl-
    edge already gained. Criticism of past emphasis on engineering rather
    than on science was partly answered by decision to provide more time
    for scientific study and planning between the next Apollo lunar mis-
    sions. Program plans included Apollo Applications, missions to Mars
    and Jupiter, long-range studies of Venus-Mercury mission and three-
    planet grand tours, development of permanent space station, joint
    NASA-DOD studies of space transportation system with reusable shuttle,
    and accelerated aeronautics activities.
       NASA FY 1970 appropriation of $93.697 billion was $181 million be-
    low budget proposed by outgoing President Johnson and $19 million
    below President Nixonâ€™s amended request for $3.716 billion. Cutbacks
    in Government spending forced NASA to announce 1970 closing of
    Electronics Research Center and DOD to cancel Manned Orbiting Lab-
    oratory ( MOL) program. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator,
    told E&C employees in December that agency had to â€œeffect reductions
    and consolidation across the board if we are to shape our programs to
    meet the nationâ€™s future needs in aeronautics and space.â€ Reductions
    in work force-largely      in contractor personnel-were     brought by
    planned phasing out of Apollo program as well as by budget cuts. Year
    of manâ€™s first landing on moon, despite its global impact, ended w tih
    space goals and levels of effort for the next decade an open question.

     two solar probes (1974-1975) closer to sun than any other spacecraft,
     would obtain data on solar processes and earth-sun relationship. Under
     another agreement with West Germany, Project Aeros, NASA would
     launch German-developedsatellite in 1972 for aeronomy measurements.
     In agreement with Indian space agency, ATS-F satellite would be made
     available for experimental educational TV broadcasting directly and
     by relay to receivers in 5,000 Indian villages.
        Additional cooperative projects during 1969 included launch of one
     Italian, two U.K., and two French experiments; continuation of sound-
     ing rocket projects with Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Nor-
     way, Pakistan, Spain, and Sweden; inclusion of Canadian and French

   Madrid tracking station was extended in June until 1984 and negotia-
   tions were begun with Australia for extension of tracking arrangements
   until same year.
       Lunar surface material returned by Apollo 11 astronauts was dis-
   tributed to 39 principal investigators from nine countries-Australia,
   Belgium, Canada, Finland, West Germany, Japan, South Africa, Switz-
   erland, and U.K.
       International highlights in 1969 included around-the-world tour of
   Apollo 11 astronauts to dramatize conviction that successful lunar land-
   ing was triumph for all mankind; travels of NASA Administrator, Dr.
   Thomas 0. Paine, to inform ministerial and space agency officials
    abroad of US. space plans and invite their participation; and partici-
    pation of foreign experts in NASA conference on space shuttle concepts.
       Efforts by NASA to develop cooperative programs with U.S.S.R. con-
    tinued during 1969, but met with limited success. (Pres Rpt 70 [69])
  Drone aircraft was reportedly impaled with spear of light from experi-
    mental laser and destroyed in three milliseconds at Air Force Special
   Weapons Laboratory, Kirtland AFB, N. Mex. Account in Aviation Week
    & Space Technology was later denied by USAF officials.
       Tri-service laser weapon research programs, principally sponsored
    by ARPA, were studying number of military applications of lasers, ac-
    cording to magazine. USAF had increased planned funding of high-
    energy gas laser development in FY 1969 from $0.5 million to $2.5
    million to make use of power output increase achieved by United Air-
    craft Corp. in 1968. And $1.5 million had been given to exploratory
    development of high-power solid-state lasers. For FY 1970 USAF had
    asked $8 million to exploit United Aircraft development. ( A v Wlc,
    1/12/70, 16-7; USAF PIO; A&A, 4/70, 16-21)
* Aerospace industry sales of $28.3 billion in 1969 were second highest in
    industryâ€™s history despite anticipated decline of 4.1% from 1968
    record of $29.5 billion. All areas of aerospace endeavor leveled off ex-
    cept nonaerospace sales by aerospace companies, which increased.
    Commercial aerospace sales, principally jet transports, were $5,800
    million, down from $6,429 million in 1968. Trend resulted from phas-
    ing out of current transport models while jumbo jet production was
    beginning. Sales by aerospace industry to DOD were $16.2 million in
     1969 and $16.6 billion in 1968. Military aircraft sales totaled $10
    billion in 1969 and $10.7 billion in 1968. Space sales dropped to $4,4#99
    million from $5,108 million in 1968, because of approaching comple-
    tion of Apollo program hardware phase and cancellation of MOL.

  US. scheduled airlines carried 159 million passengers; in 1949 they had
     carried less than 17 million. In 1969 airlines accounted for 75% of
     common carrier passenger-miles between U.S. cities; in 1949 they had
     accounted for 14%. In 1969 18.3 million passengers flew between US.
     and other countries; in 1949 there were 2.2 million. U.S. scheduled
     airlines produced 3.2 billion ton-miles of air freight service in 1969,
     increase of 15.7% over 1968. (1970 Air Transport Facts & Figures)
  Air carrier accidents decreased from 73 in 1968 to 68 in 1969. Accident
     rate was down from 1.12 per 100,000 hrs flown to 0.98. Fatal accidents

                     A CHRONICLE FOR 1969

   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard C.
Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress.
Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite Situation
Report issued by the Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight
Center; public information releases of the Department of Defense, NASA,
ESSA, and other agencies, as well as those of the Communications Satellite
Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite
Situation Report, translations from the Tass News Agency, statements in the
Soviet press, and international news servicesâ€™ reports. Data on satellites of
other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite Situa-
tion Report, government announcements, and international news servicesâ€™
reports.
   This tabulation lists payloads that have ( a ) orbited; ( b ) as probes, as-
cended to at least the 4,000-mile altitude that traditionally has distinguished
probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or ( c ) conveyed one or more humans
into space, whether orbit was attained or not, Furthermore, only flights that
have succeeded-or at least can be shown by tracking data to have fulfilled
our definition of satellite or probe or manned flight-are listed. Date of
launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. An asterisk by the date
marks those dates that are one day earlier in this tabulation than in listings
which are referenced to Greenwich Mean Time. A double asterisk by the
date marks dates of Soviet launches which are a day later in this compila-
tion than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean Time.
   World space activity declined for the second straight year. There was a
 decline in the total successful launches-110 against 119 in 1968--and a
decline in total payloads orbited-124 against 138 in 1968. The difference
between launches and payloads is of course accounted for by the multiple-
payload launches (DOD is the principal user of this system, with 7 multiple-
payload launches orbiting a total of 19 payloads and as many as 5 payloads
on one Titan IIIC; NASA had 2 multiple launches totaling 4 payloads in
1969 and the same in 1968; the USSR., whose last multiple-payload
launch was in 1965, had none).
   Of the 1969 world total, the United States launched 40 boosters carrying
54 payloads (compared to 45 and 64 in 1968). Of these totals, DOD was re-
sponsible for 19 launches and 31 payloads. The 46launches made the lowest
                                                    .
 US. total since 1963, and the 54 payloads are the fewest since 1961. Eight

of NASAâ€™s were nOn-NASA missions-Intelsat~III F-3, Intelsat-Ill F A ,
            total
Intelsat-Ill F-5, Boreas, Azur, Skynet A, Essa IX, and Egrs X I I I . The
U.S.S.R. launched 70 boosters in 1969; it had launched 741 in 1968.
    In 1969 manned space flight peaked both in quantity and in achievement.
Four US. Apollo flights put 12 astronauts in space and five U.S.S.R. Soyuz
flights orbited 11 cosmonauts, for a record 23 men in space in one year.
Apollo 11 was naturally the most dramatic, with the United States achieving
its manned lunar landing goal. In steady progression, the successes of
Apollo 9 in earth orbit and Apollo 10 in lunar orbit prepared the way for
the Apollo 11 lunar touchdown on July 20, 1969. The Apollo 12 follow-up
lunar landing four months later further demonstrated manâ€™s ability to func-
tion in the lunar environment.
    The Soviet Union performed two lunar missions in 1969, both unmanned.
Luna XV impacted the moon and Zond VII was the third successful Soviet
circumlunar flight, reentry, and recovery. The U.S.S.R. also launched two
Venus probes, both of which landed on the planet. The five Soviet manned
flights in earth orbit performed rendezvous and docking and accomplished
the first crew exchange in orbit.
    As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
 appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag behind each
 flight of the analysis and interpretation of the results.

  CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1969

   This chronology of major NASA launches in 1969 is intended to provide
an accurate and ready historical reference, compiling and verifyingâ€™informa-
tion previously scattered in several sources. It includes launches of all
rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA or
under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., in 1969 NASA provided vehicles and launch
facilities and launched ComSatCorpâ€™s three Intelsat 111 satellites, ESSAâ€™S Essa
I X , USAâ€™S Egrs XIII as a secondary payload, ESROâ€™S Boreas, West Germanyâ€™s
Azur, and U.K.â€™s Skynet A, as well as Isis I in joint US.-Canadian pko-
gram). NASA sounding rocket launches are published annually by the God-
dard Space Flight Center Historian in Goddard Projects Summary: Satellites
and Sounding Rockets.
   An attempt has been made to classify performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle performance
                                   (S), partially successful (P), and unsuc-
and mission results-successful
            .
cessful (U) A fourth category, unknown (Unk) , has been added for pay-
loads when vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to
exercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary ;
many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact
that a great deal is learned from missions that may have been classified as
 unsuccessful.
    Rate of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Open sources
 were used, verified when in doubt with the project offices in NASA Head-
 quarters and with NASA Centers. For further information on each item, see
 Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as refer-
 enced in the index. Prepared April 1970 by William A. Lockyer, Jr., His-
 torical and Library Services Branch, Kennedy Space Center.

  CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1969

   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
during 1969 and, taken with Appendix C to the 1965, 1966, and 1968
editions of this publication, provides a summary record of manned explora-
tion of the space environment through 1969. The information was compiled
by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library
of Congress.
   The year 1969 was manned space flightâ€™s most prolific year to date. Four
Apollo flights and five Soyuz flights put a record 23 men into space. The
Soviets accomplished the first crew transfer in orbit. The United States
achieved its goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely
to earth-and     did it again four months later.
   None of the five Soviet flights left earth orbit. Rather, all performed
earth-related experiments. Soyuz IV, carrying one cosmonaut, docked with
Soyuz V, carrying a 3-man crew. Two members from Soyuz V transferred
 to and remained in Soyuz IV until reentry. Ten months later, Soyuz VZ
hovered near Soyuz VI1 and Soyuz VIII as they performed close rendezvous
maneuvers but did not dock. Soyuz V I tested welding techniques in its de-
pressurized spacecraft chamber.
    The early March earth orbital flight of Apollo 9 was the first successful
manned flight of the Apollo LM, and ApolZo 10 successfully demonstrated
the complete system during its circumlunar flight. Apollo 11â€™s Neil Arm-
strong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., returned safely to earth with lunar samples
after becoming the first men to walk on the moon. And the Apolto 12 crew
took an extensive lunar walk and retrieved a soil scoop from Surveyor 111,
 which had been on the moon for 2% years.
    By the end of 1969, the United States had conducted a total of 22 manned
space flights-16 in earth orbit, 2 in lunar orbit and 2 lunar landings-
 with a total of 24 different crewmen. Of the 24 American astronauts, 10 had
 participated in 2 flights each, and 5 had flown three times, The Soviet Union
 had conducted a total of 15 manned flights, all in earth orbit, with 21 cos-
 monauts. Three cosmonauts had flown twice each. Cumulative totals for
 manned spacecraft hours on flight had reached 2,303 hours 56 minutes for
 the United States and 1,054 hours 8 minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumula-
 tive total man-hours in space were 5,833 hours 57 minutes for the United
 States and 1,698 hours 47 minutes for the U.S.S.R.
    Data on U.S. flights are the latest available to date within NASA. Although
 minor details are subject to modification as data are refined, major aspects
 of all U.S. manned flights remain subject to direct observation by interested
 citizens of the world, with a significant portion of recent missions seen live
 on worldwide television.
