January 1970
January 1: Apollo //lunar landing had been voted biggest news story of 1969 in poll of Associated Press member newspapers and radio and TV stations, AP announced. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo 11 commander, had been voted top newsmaker of year. AP poll ranked Vietnam war second biggest story and “story of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy’s political fortunes” third. (Rock, AP, W Star, 1/1/70, A3)
•	President Nixon in San Clemente, Calif., signed National Environ-
mental Policy Act of 1969. Act declared Government policy “to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.” It established within Presidential Executive Office full-time, three-member Council on Environmental Quality and required President to submit environmental quality reports to Congress annually, beginning July 1, 1970. President said that “the 1970’s absolutely must be the years when America pays its debt to the past by reclaiming the purity of its air, its waters, and our living environment. It is literally now or never.” (PD, 1/5/70, 11-3)
•	Dr. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winning Univ. of California
physicist and member of NAS Council, was appointed Chairman of NAS-NRC Space Science Board. Dr. Townes had headed President Nixon’s task force to make recommendations on national space program in 1969. (NAS PIO; NAS-NRC-NAE News Rpt, 3/70; A&A 68)
January 2: Nike-Apache sounding rocket was launched by NASA from TERLS carrying Indian payload to study ionosphere. Rocket and instruments functioned satisfactorily. (SR list)
•	Apollo 10 and 11 photos of lunar far side had revealed number of
probable igneous intrusions, including three probable dikes that crosscut wall and floor of 75-km (46.6-mi) crater, Farouk El-Baz of Bellcomm, Inc., reported in Science. Intrusions were distinguished by their settings, textures, structures, and brightness. Recognition of probable igneous intrusions in lunar highlands supported indications of heterogeneity of lunar materials and plausibility of intrusive igneous activity on moon, in addition to extrusive volcanism. (Science, 1/2/70,49-50)
•	Results of study of infrared spectra recorded by Mariner VI and VII
were reported in Science by Univ. of California at Berkeley chemists Kenneth C. Herr and Dr. George C. Pimentel. Reflections at 4.3/x suggested presence of solid carbon dioxide in upper atmosphere of Mars. (Science, 1/2/70,47-9)
•	msc announced appointment of Sigurd A. Sjoberg as Director of
Flight Operations, replacing Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., who had been appointed MSC Deputy Director. Sjoberg had been Deputy
Director of Flight Operations since 1963. Appointment was effective Dec. 28, 1969. (msg Release 70-1)
•	With advent of SST, information on meteorological conditions at high-
er levels of stratosphere would be needed for routine civil-aviation operations, Frederick G. Finger and Raymond M. Mclnturff of ESSA’s Weather Bureau said in Science. Forecast system would be extended from 12-km (7.5-mi) to 20-km (12.4-mi) altitudes or higher. Forecasting techniques to support SST might be facilitated by exploiting similarities between stratosphere and troposphere weather. Much remained to be done on phenomenon forecasting. Wind effects should be smaller for SST than for subsonic aircraft but wind forecasts might be necessary during winter, when variations were high enough to effect economics of operation. Knowledge of temperature fields and of ozone distribution could prove valuable. Possible solar cosmic radiation hazards would be minimized by ground-based forecasting system and onboard detection equipment but sonic boom problem at ground level might be less tractable. Amplification and attenuation of boom by meteorological conditions could be predicted. World Weather Watch of U.N. and ESSA’s satellites and spacecraft with ability to depict continuous three-dimensional temperature distribution and wind pressure over entire globe would play major role in providing SST meteorological information, as would SST itself. (Science, 1/2/70, 16-24)
January 3: Photos of falling meteorite were taken by automatic cameras at Hominy, Okla., and Pleasanton, Kans., field stations of Prairie Network operated for NASA by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (Sao). Fireball was observed over large area of midwestern U.S. Observatory scientist Dr. Richard E. McCrosky later predicted from film records probable impact point near Lost City, Okla. Meteorite entered earth’s atmosphere at 56 300 km per hr (35 000 mph), creating trail that was visible for nine seconds. (SAO Release 70-01; McElheny, Boston Globe, 1/20/70)
•	Accuracy of Apollo 12 LM lunar landing was described by Henry S. F.
Cooper, Jr., in post-mission report from ksc published by the New Yorker. After successful completion of mission, Cooper had talked with Flight Dynamics Officer David Reed, who had been in charge of LM trajectory during lunar landing. Cooper reported that Reed and other flight engineers had been “too accurate in plotting their trajectory, for Commander (now Captain) Charles Conrad, Jr., who was at the controls, had to change the LM’s landing point at the last minute. ‘He was afraid he’d land right on top of the Surveyor if he kept on going according to plan, and later, when we fed the data from the lm into a computer, we found that if he’d gone on in the way he was, he would have hit it,’ Reed told me.” (New Yorker, 1/3/70, 46-56)
January 4: Lunar Science Institute near MSC in Houston, Tex., was dedicated at ceremonies attended by Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, other nasa officials, and some 70 space scientists who had gathered early for Jan. 5 opening of Apollo 11 Lunar Science Conference at MSC. Dr. Paine said, “This is the institution to help us bring all the expertise we need together to solve the riddles of the moon.” LSI, created by 49-university Universities Space Research Assn., had one-year contract with NASA, renewable annually. Facili-
ties would be open to all scientists, including those from Iron Curtain countries. Dr. William W. Rubey, Univ. of California and Rice Univ. geologist, would be Director. (HPost, 1/5/70)
•	Budget limits had caused cancellation of one lunar landing and
stretchout of remaining seven Apollo missions into 1974, Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said in interview following LSI dedication in Houston, Tex. Eighth lunar landing had been dropped to permit use of Saturn V rocket to launch first U.S. space station in July 1972. (UPI, NYT, 1/5/70, 1)
•	Capt. W. J. Bright of Ascot, England, was named provisional winner
of 1970 London-Sydney Air Race after flying Britten-Norman Islander aircraft 19 300 km (12 000 mi) from Gatwick Airport, London, to Bankstown Airport, Sydney, Australia, in 76 hrs elapsed time. Second and third prizes in $112 000 competition to commemorate 1919 England-to-Australia flight of Ross and Keith Smith were won by Australian pilot Jack Masling in Cessna 310 and British pilot Brian Holland in Piper Twin Comanche B. (Trumbull, NYT, 1/5/70, 61)
January 5: NASA launched two Nike-Cajun sounding rockets carrying gsfc grenade experiments. One was launched from Churchill Research Range; other was launched from Wallops Station. Rockets and instruments functioned satisfactorily. (SR list)
•	ERC announced development of silicon carbide diode that had sur-
vived and functioned over temperature range of 889 K (1600°F)— from 978 K (+1300°F) to 89 K (-300°F). Diode was believed to be first of its kind to withstand extremely high temperatures while performing effectively as detector of high-frequency radiation at frequencies to 10 billion cps and would be operable at Venus surface temperatures—about 700 K (800°F). Diode was developed by erc’s Richard Farrell. (ERC Release 70-1)
•	Time magazine named “the Middle Americans” its Men and Women
of the Year: “They sent Richard Nixon to the White House and two teams of astronauts to the moon. They were both exalted and afraid. The mysteries of space were nothing. . .compared with the menacing confusions of their own society.” Middle Americans admired “men like Neil Armstrong and, to some extent, Spiro Agnew.” Apollo 11 and 12 were “a quintessential adventure of American technology and daring.” Astronauts were “paragons of Middle American aspiration. Redolent of charcoal cookouts, their vocabularies an engaging mix of space jargon and ‘gee whiz,’ the space explorers gave back to Middle America a victory of its own values. It was little noted, except in Middle America where such things still matter, that among Neil Armstrong’s extraterrestrial baggage was a special badge of his college fraternity, Phi Delta Theta. He used it symbolically to establish Moon Alpha Chapter.” Some liberals had “grumbled that the Apollo program’s $26 billion would have been better spent on curing hunger or the urban malaise.” Yet Middle Americans “reveled in the lunar landings precisely because they were victories purely accomplished; in Vietnam, in the carious slums, in the polluted environment, no clear victories seemed possible any longer.” (Time, 1/5/70, 10-2)
•	Chicago Tribune article blamed Apollo program for demise of usaf’s
Project Blue Book ufo study: “Wonderful as the saucers were, the
moon shots probably killed them. The idea of little men with bulbous heads and wagging antennae landing.. .wasn’t a bit more amazing than the spectacle of human beings traversing space and walking the surface of a dead world. And, in addition, the latter was undoubtedly true.” (CTrib, 1/5/70)
• Dr. Max Born, nuclear physicist and corecipient of 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, died at age 87. (NYT, 1/6/70, 1)
January 5-9: Apollo 11 Lunar Science Conference at MSC presented results of first systematic studies of lunar samples by more than 500 scientists from nine countries. Samples from Tranquility Base consisted of basaltic igneous rocks; microbreccias, which were mechanical mixture of soil and small rock fragments compacted into coherent rock; and lunar soil. Soil was mixture of crystalline and glassy fragments with small fragments of iron meteoroids. Most rock fragments derived from larger igneous rocks—probably once part of underlying bedrock. Some crystalline fragments might have come from Highlands near Tranquility site. Rocks and fragments in soil showed evidence of surface erosion from hypervelocity impacts accompanied by local melting, splashing, evaporation, and condensation. Crystalline rocks ranged from fine-grained vesicular to vug-gy, medium-grained equigranular.
Most common minerals found were pyroxene, plagioclase, ilmen-ite, olivine, and cristobalite. Three new minerals occurring in igneous rocks were pyroxmanganite, ferropseudobrookite, and chromium-titanium spinel. Free metallic iron and troilite, rare on earth, were common accessory minerals in igneous rocks. Silicate minerals were unusually transparent because of complete absence of hydrothermal alteration. Tests had shown that, at time of crystallization, observed phases could have coexisted only in very dry, highly reducing system in which oxygen pressure was estimated to be 10-13 atmospheres—more than five orders of magnitude lower than for typical terrestrial basaltic magmas.
Melting experiments indicated 98% of primary igneous liquid crystallized in 1483-1333 K (1210-1060°C) temperature range with minor interstitial liquids continuing to crystallize down to 1223 K (950°C). Microscopic and microprobe examinations had produced evidence for existence of interstitial liquid rich in potassium and aluminum, which probably was immiscible with main liquid. Viscosity of lunar magmas was calculated an order of magnitude below that of terrestrial basaltic magmas. This characteristic might be significant in explaining textural features, differentiation mechanisms that produced chemical composition, and morphological features of lunar seas.
Chemical compositions of all igneous rocks were similar except for concentration of potassium, rubidium, cesium, uranium, thorium, and barium. These elements distinguished two groups of igneous rocks, with fine-grained rocks containing more than coarsegrained rocks. All rocks had high concentrations of titanium, scandium, zirconium, hafnium, yttrium, and trivalent rare earth elements, and low concentrations of sodium. Low abundance of europium was striking feature of igneous rocks. Composition of soils and breccias was similar to but distinguishable from igneous rocks. Igneous rocks contained at least one other “rock” component dis-
tinctfrom lunar basalts sampled. Soil was rich in nickel and volatile elements—cadmium, zinc, silver, gold, copper, and thallium—that occurred in carbonaceous chondrites. Enrichment was consistent with observed occurrence of meteorite material in soil.
Many elements that occurred in low abundance in lunar igneous rocks were strongly enriched in terrestrial crustal rocks that were product of igneous differentiation. It had been suggested that low abundance of these elements derived from residual lunar liquids was indication that whole moon was depleted in number of volatile elements. If inference was correct, it could be inferred that lunar material separated from high-temperature, dispersed nebula at 1273 K (1000°C) or higher.
Coincidence of high abundance of titanium, separation of europium from other rare earth elements, and separation of barium and strontium suggested igneous liquids were end product of fractional crystallization process or, less likely, that they were produced by partial melting and subsequent segregation of liquid in lunar interior.
High-pressure and temperature experiments had shown that materials with chemical composition of Tranquility Base basalts would, at conditions inferred for lunar interior, have densities exceeding moon’s average density. Therefore, basalts could not represent moon’s bulk composition.
Age of basaltic crystalline rock was determined at 3.7 billion yrs. Igneous rocks were melted and crystallized about 10 billion yrs after moon’s formation. Single exotic rock fragment had yielded age of 4.4 billion yrs and indicated variability in age between different areas on lunar surface. Relatively young basalts showed moon had not been completely dead planet from its formation, but that it had undergone significant differentiation, at least locally, in thin lunar crust. Period before 3.7-billion-yr event recorded in older Highland areas was interval in which earth’s record had been obliterated. Therefore much of lunar surface was important in understanding early evolution and differentiation of planets.
Observations showed lunar materials were product of considerable geochemical and petrological evolution. Optical properties of soil measured in laboratories agreed with those inferred from telescopic studies and indicated thin layer of soil must have covered most of moon. Correlation of spectral features determined in laboratory with telescopic studies suggested that iron content of lunar surface might vary. Measured dielectric constant of soil agreed with known radar reflectivity of moon. Penetration depth suggested upper layers were electrically transparent. Measured thermal conductivity suggested that diurnal variations in temperature should extend to less than one meter in soil regions. Thermoluminescence studies on core samples showed substantial diurnal variation in temperature 12 cm (4.7 in) below surface.
Seismic study showed that attenuation of lunar sound waves decreased with pressure. High-pressure velocities were consistent with those observed in Apollo 12 seismic experiments, suggesting possibility of seismic wave guide at shallow depths on moon. Natural remanent magnetization found in crystalline rocks and breccias suggested ancient moon might have had magnetic field with strength of few percent of earth’s field. Field existing 3.7 billion yrs ago
might have been result of fluid motions in lunar interior—effect of earth’s field when moon and earth were closer together or result of processes not yet understood.
Lunar samples were valuable for study of low-energy, weakly penetrating radiations and had provided sample of gases blown off sun in solar wind, making it possible to determine isotopic composition and abundance of elements in sun by direct measurement. Results would lead to better understanding of sun’s evolution. Studies of stored nuclear tracks and induced radioactivities had shown effect of bombardment by solar flare particles and suggested activity had persisted for long periods. Abundance of cosmic-ray-produced nuclides in samples showed some rocks had been on or within several centimeters of lunar surface for at least 10 million yrs and within one or two meters (three to six and a half feet) for at least 500 million yrs.
In search for life origins on moon, micropaleontological examination of sample by optical microscopy and by electron and scanning electron microscopy had produced uniformly negative results. Intensive search for viable organisms using many environmental and media combinations had produced negative results, as had the one quarantine study.
Reports given at conference were published in Jan. 30 issue of Science under NASA contract. (Science, 1/30/70)
Cambridge Univ. astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle was principal speaker at banquet given by National Space Hall of Fame and City of Houston during conference. He said it was significant that in year when men first set foot on another world, desire to save their own planet had suddenly blossomed. “Quite suddenly everyone worldwide has become seriously interested in protecting the environment. Something new has happened to create this feeling of awareness about our planet.” He warned that man had to face probability that he could no longer discover important physical laws solely by observation in earth laboratories. “We are in a transition period, and in the future we must rely more on outside laboratories than astronomers did in the past.” (Burgess, CSM, 1/8/70)
January 6: Dr. Gary V. Latham, Columbia Univ. seismologist and principal seismic investigator for Apollo program, during Houston, Tex., press conference withdrew proposal that atomic bomb be detonated on moon. Instead, he said, NASA should find way to hit moon hard enough to create strong internal reverberations. Pressure from scientists and public had led to retraction of original proposal.

•	Importance of studying asteroids was cited in Science by Dr. Hannes
O. Alfven of Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and Univ. of California at San Diego and Dr. Gustaf O. S. Arrhenius of Scripps Institution of Oceanography: “There are now good reasons to believe that the asteroidal belt represents an intermediate stage in the formation of the planets. This links the present conditions in the asteroidal region with the epoch in which the earth and the other planets were accreting from interplanetary grains. Hence, in order to understand how the solar system originated it may be essential to explore the asteroids.” Since manned Mars landing would take place after 1980, “it is of interest to discuss whether a sample of an asteroid may be obtained in an easier way, at an earlier time, and as a technologically intermediate step.” Asteroid sample could be obtained by landing spacecraft on asteroid or by capturing small asteroid and landing it on earth’s surface or storing it in earth orbit for later investigation.

For the moment they are up and Nasa is down.” NASA was “between space programmes and is running short of friends and also short of cash as its budget is daily cut. The rate of moon shots has now been cut to two a year. This really ought not to please the scientists but it pleases them just the same since they have complained bitterly that they cannot conduct research at Nasa’s hectic pace and their work is suffering as a result. This is not exactly the happiest time to be a Nasa administrator waiting daily for the President’s next word but it is a wonderful time to be a moon man.” (Economist, 1/10/70, 15-6)

•	Nixon Administration had decided against big space program for
1970s, Thomas O’Toole wrote in Washington Post. There would be “no set goal for landing men on Mars, no plan to colonize the moon and no sudden push to orbit a permanent manned space station above the earth in the next five years.” While space program would “not be allowed to shrink much” in 1970, Administration would ask Congress for no more than $3.7 billion for space in FY 1971, “the lowest request for space funds in almost a decade.” Low funding level meant space spending would not rise above $4 billion annually for at least several years and new programs would not be started in near future. (WPost, 1/11/70, Al)
January 11-18: Washington Evening Star published series of seven articles on environmental pollution. Many scientists feared “that the 1970s will be the dawn of Doomsday.” Mail to White House on environment had doubled after first lunar landing. “To many, the flights raised the question of where technological priorities should be directed—into space or back on the earth?” Some astronauts had said that from space, air pollution was so visible it cut into the joy of seeing earth from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Articles examined “what man has done to his environment, and what he can do to save it.” Observers saw “great promise” in National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 signed Jan. 1. “To Congress, the President, and so many others who will become embroiled in this recently dramatized issue, the task at hand can be summed up in the phrase ‘quality of life.’ It will be a task of cleaning up, of making the air and the water and the land healthier and more enjoyable. Over the decades, as Americans have built a richer economic standard, they have run up a huge bill to the natural world around them. The bill is overdue.” Total cost of cleaning up environment had been estimated at $100 billion to $125 billion. (Hornig, Welsh, W Star, 1/11-. 18/70, Al)
January 12: aec Chairman, Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, in New York Times article predicted new frontiers for nuclear energy during 1970s. Major advances would include development of large commercial fast-breeder reactor which should lead to “breeder economy in the 1980’s that will inaugurate vast savings in fuel resources and costs”; use of abundant cheap power for desalting seawater and introducing new industrial processes; use of nuclear fission as power source; and melding of nuclear and space ages “as nuclear energy becomes a major source of auxiliary and propulsive power for space activities.” snap systems for nuclear auxiliary power would become “principle source of electricity in space.” Seventies also would see expanded use of nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes, such as power source for navaids, for underground excavation in stimulating production of natural gas, and in extraction of minerals from low-grade ores and oil from oil shales. Advances were expected in use of radioisotopes in medicine, agriculture, and industry and in basic and applied research in nuclear fields. (NYT, 1/12/70, 81)

•	Mathematics had become “key tool in almost all of the physical and
social sciences,” Harry Schwartz said in New York Times. “Theories and working hypotheses in the most diverse fields are now expressed in terms of equations using not only the language of ordinary algebra, but also derivatives, matrices, and even more advanced concepts.” It was “stress on numerical results and quantitative, not qualitative, predictions, that gives the computer its present central and increasing role in scientific research.” (NYT, 1/12/70, 81)
•	Editorial by Robert Hotz in Aviation Week & Space Technology out-
lined space outlook for 1970: “Space will. . .see some titanic struggles in the market-place as the key programs in the space transportation system of the mid-1970s come up for contractor selection. Many observers will be misled by the relatively small dollar increases in Fiscal 1971 space budgets. Many new programs can be initiated with the same level of funding that was required for the Apollo era, plus some heavy reprogramming of existing projects that are approaching technical obsolescence much faster than any planners imagined. By judiciously paring its present programs and getting only a modest boost for Fiscal 1971, NASA can lay the foundations for the next decade’s major space program. Military space, temporarily deflated by the manned orbiting laboratory cancellation, will trend toward a broader program involving several major new fields. Commercial and non-NASA space will provide a modestly expanding market, and the big battle between celestial and terrestrial communications is shaping into a major clash.” (Av Wk, 1/12/70, 11)
January 13: Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, said at NASA Hq. news conference on future plans he was directing portions of space program to bring operations in line with FY 1971 budget. “We recognize the many important needs and urgent problems we face here on earth. America’s space achievements in the 1960’s have rightly raised hopes that this country and all mankind can do more to overcome pressing problems of society. The space program should inspire bolder solutions and suggest new approaches. It has already provided many direct and indirect benefits and is creating new wealth and capabilities.” Strong space program continued as one of Nation’s major priorities. “However, we recognize that under current fiscal restraints NASA must find new ways to stretch out current programs and reduce our present operational base.” NASA would “press forward in 1971 at a reduced level, but in the right direction with the basic ingredients we need for major achievements in the 1970s and beyond. .. .we will not dissipate the strong teams that sent men to explore the moon and automated spacecraft to observe the planets.”
NASA would suspend Saturn V production indefinitely after Saturn V 515 completion, stretch Apollo lunar missions to six-month launch intervals, defer lunar expeditions during aap space station flights in 1972, and postpone Viking/Mars 1973 unmanned lander launch to next Mars opportunity in 1975. Number of employees in nasa program was expected to decline from 190 000 at end of FY 1970 to 140 000 at close of FY 1971.
Positive aspects of space program for 1970s included Apollo missions through Apollo 19, use of one Saturn V to launch first experimental aap space station into earth orbit in 1972, Mars orbit by two unmanned spacecraft in 1971, launch of first Jupiter probe in 1972, launch of spacecraft past Venus to Mercury in 1973, and continuation of scientific satellite launches.
Design of reusable space shuttle would be started and first experimental space station would be launched, as planned, in 1972. FY 1971 budget would permit proceeding with design of advanced space station as permanent base in earth orbit, continued work on nasa-aec nerva project, practical earth applications of space technology, and advances in applications of space technology in fields such as meteorology and communications. Although “austere,” space program for 1971 was “forward looking” and contained “basic ingredients needed for an effective space program in the 1970s.” It would “extend our space capabilities, expand our scientific knowledge, and make available new applications of benefit to people here on earth.”
In response to question, Dr. Paine said he foresaw no shutdown of ksc and had no plans for closing other centers. Intended actions “represent a decision to proceed through the year 1971 and see what our studies turn up. I think it is important to realize these are very advanced, perhaps, and we have a lot to learn about the technological feasibility, the cost, schedules—and I wouldn’t want to say we now have a complete free road into the future. We don’t.” Asked if he thought NASA was close to point where “team started falling to pieces,” Dr. Paine said that “you can carry out space programs for the United States at a large number of different levels. I think the level we have now is a level we can take great pride in and I think the country in the 1970’s will be very proud of the achievements NASA will turn in.” (Transcript)

dress before Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards afb, Calif.: “To the man in the street, we may have made it look too easy to prevent nuclear wars for more than 20 years, to deter or contain lim-
ited wars, and even to put men on the moon. The average American may well be bored by the third moon landing, but the Soviet planners—who know exactly what magnitude of effort is involved—do not get bored. They see us researching and developing new strategic and tactical weapons; they see us producing the largest airplane in the world and developing a new superiority fighter and advanced bomber; they see us committed to a larger and faster supersonic transport. And, knowing full well that they had a significant head start, they see us on the moon—in living color.” They “know in the Kremlin—far better than most of our own laymen know—the time, the effort, the skill and dedication, and the vast commitment of resources all this requires. To them, what we do does not look easy— and in any contest of endurance, it must by now have become obvious that our far greater productivity must inevitably prevail.” (Text)

•	Washington Post editorial commented on Boeing 747 jumbo jet debut:
“We have a sneaking suspicion that the 747, as the new behemoth of the skies is called, has appeared on the scene three or four years prematurely. It is, or so everyone who has flown in it says, a magnificent airplane that brings a jump in passenger comfort equal to or surpassing that which occurred when the smaller jets went into service. But passenger comfort in the air is only part of the business of air travel and it looks to us as if other parts of that business—the airports and the airlines themselves, to be exact—are not really ready.” (WPost, 1/20/70, A14)

•	President Nixon delivered State of the Union Message before Joint
Session of Congress: “The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this land to the creation of a new American experience. . .more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit. The seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both on the earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery.”
gnp would increase by $500 billion in next 10 yrs—increase greater than entire growth of U.S. economy from 1790 to 1950. “Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the programs of the past. The time has come for a new quest—a quest not for a greater quantity of what we have had but for a new quality of life in America.”
President proposed total reform of welfare system; assessment and reform of institutions of government at Federal, state, and local level; and “reforms which will expand the range of opportunities for all Americans.” Greatest question of seventies was “shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?”
President would propose to Congress $10 billion nationwide clean waters program “to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in America where they are needed to make our waters clean again.. .now.” He called for further advances in engine de-
sign and fuel composition for automobile, “our worst polluter of the air,” and new rural environment to reverse migration to urban centers. He also planned balanced FY 1971 budget to help stop rise of cost of living.
. I see a new America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now. I see an America in which we have abolished hunger, provided the means for every family in the nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormous progress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improved health, and superior education. . . . I see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping pollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks, continuing to explore in space. Most important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of the world.

January 23: NASA successfully launched Itos /(Tiros-M) Improved Tiros Operational Satellite from wtr at 3:31 am pst by two-stage, long-tank Thor-Delta (DSV-3N-6) booster with six solid-fuel, strap-on Thiokol rockets. Satellite entered polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 1478.2-km (918.7-mi) apogee, 1432.3-km (890.2-mi) perigee, 115-min period, 102° inclination, and 0.02° per day orbital drift.
Australis Oscar V (Oscar A) Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio, carried pickaback on 2nd stage, was successfully ejected and entered orbit with 1482-km (920.9-mi) apogee, 1434-km (891.1-mi) perigee, 115-min period, and 101.9° inclination. Oscar V was fifth in series of Oscar launches; previous spacecraft had been launched in conjunction with dod missions. Satellite had been constructed by amateur radio operators at Melbourne Univ. in Australia and prepared for launch by U.S. Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.; 17.7-kg (39-lb) satellite would transmit at 29.45 mhz in 10-m band and 144.5 mhz in 2-m band.
Primary objective of Itos I was to flight-qualify prototype spacecraft for Improved Tiros Operational System and obtain engineering data for evaluation of single-momentum, wheel-stabilized system for earth-oriented stabilized platform. Secondary objective was to evaluate use of stabilized platform for operational meteorology by observing cloud cover by direct readout.
January 23: NASA launched Itos 1 Improved Tiros Operational Satellite into orbit to photograph the earth day and night and flight-qualify the spacecraft for use in the National Operational Meteorological Satellite System. Itos I would take night infrared pictures and transmit cloud-fop and surface temperatures. TV photos could be received by automatic picture transmission system stations. "Super-six" version of two-stage, long-tank Thor-Delta launch vehicle (at right)—thrust augmented for the first time by six soiid-fuel strap-on Castor rockets instead of. three—made its debut to orbit the spacecraft weighing more than twice as much as previous ros satellites. Before the launch, above, the spacecraft was photographed as it was prepared for mating to the Defta-N at the Western Test Range. Oscar V was launched pickaback for use by amateur radio operators at Melbourne University, Australia.
Itos I was first in new series of operational meteorological satellites to be launched in joint NASA-ESSA program to replace tos satellites operating in National Operational Meteorological Satellite System. Itos I weighed 306 kg (675 lbs)—more than twice as much as previous TOS satellites—and carried both automatic picture transmission (apt) and advanced vidicon camera system (avcs) cameras, previously carried on separate missions. Satellite was boxshaped with three-panel solar array and had new “stabilite” three-axis stabilization system. Onboard experiments included two redundant avcs cameras for stored global cloud-cover data for remote readout; two redundant apt cameras for local readout of global cloud-cover data; redundant scanning radiometers for global cloud-cover data for remote and local readout, both day and night; flat-plate radiometer for data on global heat balance; and solar proton monitor for routine observation of solar flares. Spacecraft would more than double daily weather coverage possible from ESSA satellites already in orbit and give more effective coverage at less expense for longer time. Nighttime photo capability would provide cloud-cover photos night and day every 12 hrs; essa series provided one picture per day.
Itos I was 19th spacecraft to be launched in nomss. First, Tiros I, had been launched April 1, 1960; last, Essa IX, had been launched Feb. 26, 1969. Itos I was funded by NASA except for meteorological sensors; ksc was responsible for launch operations and GSFC was responsible for Delta booster. Future itos spacecraft would be funded by essa and would be turned over to essa by NASA after postlaunch checkout. (NASA Proj Off ; NASA Release 70-2)

•	At annual meeting of American Physical Society in Chicago, sympos-
ium on cosmic physics suggested stellar explosion could have precipitated condensation of dust and gas to form sun and planets. Analysis of meteorite discovered several years earlier at St. Sever-in, France, had led to suggestion by Cal Tech physicist Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg that great stellar explosion had accompanied or immediately preceded formation of solar system, Walter Sullivan said in New York Times. Meteorite had contained calcium phosphate crystals in tiny tracks of particles ejected by radioactive atoms. Suspected source was plutonium 244—element manufactured in laboratory but not found in nature. Because plutonium 244’s mean lifetime was only 118 million yrs, any plutonium in earth rocks or meteorites, both more than 4.5 billion yrs old, would have decayed radioactively unless something occurred just before or during solar system’s formation that synthesized this substance. According to Wasserburg hypothesis, material was incorporated into meteorite where, during solar system’s infancy, it decayed possibly into neutron-rich forms, or isotopes, of xenon found in meteorite, leaving radiation tracks.

January 31: Library of Congress Legislative Reference Service published United States and Soviet Progress in Space: How do the Na-
tions Compare? Report by Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Div., summarized 12-yr efforts of major space powers. U.S. expected to have spent by June 30, 1970, just over $56 billion on combined military and civilian space programs in which some half million persons had been employed. It was likely U.S.S.R. had “committed a similar amount of resources.” U.S. space employment had peaked; Soviet had not, “as judged by their rising number of launchings.” There was no evidence that total Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped as U.S., but missiles of differing design philosophies seen in Moscow parades suggested “more than one design and development team for space work just as in Soviet aviation.” Each country seemed adequately equipped with launch pads. U.S.S.R. claimed nationwide tracking system but relied on ships to fill gaps.
U.S.S.R. was still using icbm with 1400-kg (3000-lb) thrust and improved staging to boost 4700-kg (10 400-lb) Vostok and 6600-kg (14 500-lb) Soyuz. Proton launch vehicle had carried 16 800 kg (37 000 lbs) to earth orbit and might have potential to lift 27 200 kg (60 000 lbs) with circumlunar capacity of 6000 kg (14 500 lbs). “We have not yet seen the very large Soviet vehicle confidently predicted by NASA officials the last three years. Lesser Soviet launch vehicles account for unmanned programs.” There was no sign of Soviet breakthrough in fuels “but their engines are run at relatively high pressure, increasing efficiency.” There was no sign that solid-fuel rockets had been used by U.S.S.R. for space purposes and question of Soviet development of nuclear rocket was “highly speculative.” Soviet work on electric rockets had reached only “early proof-of-principle” stage. U.S. Saturn V was “clearly the best operational weight lifter in the world.”
Odds were “overwhelming” that Vladimir Komarov had been only Soviet Cosmonaut killed in space so far. “This is because the Russians have followed a conservative approach to manned flight with heavy vehicles allowing much redundancy in equipment.”
There seemed to be “little difference between the Soviet and U.S. space programs as to general purpose and direction.” About three fifths of U.S. flights were conducted for dod; similar heavy military emphasis existed in U.S.S.R. “Soviet Union has a large and regular program of military support flights including use of satellites for photographic observation, electronic listening, weather reporting, communications relaying, and ship navigation.” U.S. did not have fob program, “because it does not regard them as necessary or desirable. The Russians obviously do, for reasons not wholly clear.” While assessment could not be conclusive, “suspicion remains that a capability to inspect and destroy satellites has been created” by U.S.S.R.
In space applications, U.S. “has held a clear lead from the earlier days of the space program, and this experience has permitted us to move ahead to more advanced systems while the Soviet Union was still working hard to catch up.” U.S.S.R. had made greater effort in number of lunar and planetary flights, “but so far has not gained as good results as we have from a more modest program.” Some 14% of Soviet flights had been in escape mission category and 8% of U.S. flights. Reasonable assumption was “that manned flights by the
Russians to the Moon will come as soon as they solve their present problems of unreliability of hardware.” Question of U.S. and U.S.S.R. going to moon together “has been asked more in rhetorical sense than as a concrete offer by either side.” No assessment of prospects could be made “without forecasting the future political climate which is beyond our present capabilities.” (Text)

During January: Space/Aeronautics reviewed status of aerospace and aeronautical projects at commencement of 1970s. Commercial transport industry was “microcosm of the capitalistic system. The health of any constituent, sst or airbus or Stol, is on trial in a harshly profit-motivated atmosphere that says. .. ‘shape up or ship out.’ Nowhere is this test more evident than in the troubled, hesitant posture of the U.S. SST program.” With retrenchment to fixed-wing design “and a continual dropback in the urgency level of our SST effort,” sst’s competitive advantages were “being dissipated by an inexorable calendar.”
Apollo 11 lunar landing had alleviated Congressional opposition to further expensive long-term space commitments. “Suddenly, it was practical to think of going ahead with an expanded lunar exploration program.”
Space science and applications program had been marking time, “with most programs stretched out to match the diminished funding made smaller still by the nasty bite of inflation.” But “light is beginning to show at the end of the long, dark tunnel of fiscal retrenchment.” Success of satellite infrared spectrometer (sirs), “welcome and long overdue test of ATS-3” for coast-to-coast relay of TV programs, and climb in “Comsat’s ’69 operating profiles” above Si-million mark had led space science program steadily to shift “its dollar focus away from the earth.”
Civil systems activity by aerospace community was only token. “Yet 1969 may prove to have been a landmark year for the industry’s relations with this strange and often self-contradictory market. New initiatives by the federal government indicate a growing awareness in Washington of what aerospace may be able to contribute to the solution of complex civil problems.” (S/A, 1/70, 27-69, 81-132)

Indeed, in the long view of history, the Sixties will be remembered not just for tragic episodes, the war, riots, and assassinations, but also for the greatest floodtide of material abundance ever seen by human eyes.

•	J. W. Chamberlain, Associate Director for Planetary Sciences at Kitt
Peak National Observatory, Ariz., reviewed cosmological theory for systematical exploration of outer planets in Astronautics & Aeronautics. Jovian planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune— had high intrinsic interest because their characteristics were similar to one another’s but “vastly different” from those of terrestrial planets. Atmospheric distinctions which did exist among Jovian planets had probably “arisen from relatively minor differences in the prevailing conditions at the times of their birth.”
Major planets constituted “completely different kind of object.” Nearest and biggest—Jupiter—had over 1000 times earth’s volume and 300 times earth’s mass for mean density of only 1.3 times that of water. It was “guardian (if not the parent) of a large family of at least 12 satellites, two of which are as large as a small planet. It has a daily rotation period of only 10 hr; and its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, the most abundant elements in the Sun (and the universe itself. ..).” Neptune was “most distant of the giants” and Pluto was “nonconformist of the solar system” whose orbit “is far from circular, the solar distance ranging between about 30 and 50 A.U. [30 and 50 times distance from earth to sun] during its 248-year revolution, at a 17-deg inclination to the ecliptic.” Many astronomers suspected larger differences between terrestrial and major planets held clues to formation of solar system.

•	Lord Ritchie-Calder wrote in Foreign Affairs: “Past civilizations are
buried in the graveyards of their own mistakes, but as each died of its greed, its carelessness or its effeteness another took its place. That was because such civilizations took their character from a locality or region. Today ours is a global civilization; it is not bounded by the Tigris and the Euphrates nor even the Hellespont and the Indus; it is the whole world. Its planet has shrunk to a neighborhood
round which a man-made satellite can patrol sixteen times a day, riding the gravitational fences of Man’s family estate. It is a community so interdependent that our mistakes are exaggerated on a world scale. ... Modern Man can outboast the Ancients, who in the arrogance of their material achievements built pyramids as the gravestones of their civilizations. We can blast our pyramids into space to orbit through all eternity round a planet which perished by our neglect.” (Foreign Affairs, 1/70,207-20)
February 1970
February 2: President Nixon in message transmitting FY 1971 budget to Congress said: “Man has ventured to the moon and returned—an awesome achievement. In determining the proper pace for future space activities, we must carefully weigh the potential benefits of: scientific research by unmanned spacecraft; continued exploration of the solar system, including manned exploration of the planets; and the application of space and aeronautics technology to the direct benefit of mankind.
“I have reviewed many exciting alternatives for the future. Consistent with other national priorities, we shall seek to extend our capabilities in space—both manned and unmanned. I intend to do this within total space outlays 12% smaller than in 1970. In our current efforts, we will continue to stress additional uses of space technology. Our actions will make it possible to begin plans for a manned expedition to Mars.”
President said national budget, first for which he bore full responsibility, fulfilled pledge to submit balanced FY 1971 budget. “This anti-inflationary budget begins the necessary process of reordering our national priorities. For the first time in two full decades, the Federal Government will spend more money on human resource programs than on national defense.” About 41% of estimated outlays would be devoted to spending for education and manpower, health, income security, and veterans benefits and services. Pollution control, crime reduction, transportation, and housing programs were “planned to grow substantially in the years ahead.” {PD, 2/9/ 70, 106-19)
• President Nixon sent $200.8-billion FY 1971 budget request to Congress, including total space budget of $4,954 billion. Of this sum, NASA would receive $3,148 billion (plus $185.5 million for aircraft technology); dod would receive $1,674 billion; aec, $99 million; essa, $26 million; Dept, of Interior, $4 million; nsf, $2 million; and Dept, of Agriculture, $1 million.
Total NASA new obligational authority (noa) requested, $3,333 billion, was $404.9 million less than FY 1970 noa of $3,737 billion. NASA expenditures were budgeted to decline $486.4 million, from FY 1970 level of $3,889 billion to $3,403 billion. Reductions placed proposed NASA FY 1971 funding at lowest level since 1962. Of budget request, $2,606 billion would go for r&d, $34.6 million for construction of facilities, and $692.3 million for research and program management.
Apollo funding decrease of $729.6 million, to $956.50 million in FY 1971, reflecting successful completion of manned lunar landing goal, would be partially offset by increase to $515.2 million for manned space flight operations. The $515.2 million would include $364.3 million for Apollo Applications, $110 million for space shut-
tie and station, and $40.9 million for operations. Advanced missions would receive $2.5 million, same as in FY 1970, to bring total for manned space flight to $1,474 billion, down $557.5 million from FY
1970.
Funding for space science and applications programs would increase $45.9 million, from $519.7 million in FY 1970 to $565.7 million. Increases would go to physics and astronomy program, for airborne research ($3 million), s<Jlar observatories ($16.1 million), and Explorer satellites ($25.6 million). Funding for Pioneer program of planetary exploration would increase from $20 million in FY 1970 to $32.9 million. Funding for biosatellites would decrease from $6 million in FY 1970 to $1.5 million. Earth resources survey would receive more than 50% increase in funding, from $26 million to $52.5 million, with $41.5 million allocated for Earth Resources Technology Satellite. New projects funded were navigation and traffic control studies (with dot), $3 million, and Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) study, $1 million.
Total for advanced research and technology programs would be reduced from $272 million in FY 1970 to $264 million, nerva rocket funding would increase from $27 million to $32 million. Increases also were proposed for v/stol aircraft technology ($15 million in FY 1971, from $9.5 million in FY 1970), subsonic aircraft technology ($11.9 million, from $9.4 million in FY 1970), and supersonic aircraft technology ($21.9 million, from $18.9 million in FY 1970), within total $185.5 million requested for aeronautics.
Sustaining university program was being phased out, with no funds requested for FY 1971.
dod space funding, down $82 million, reflected cancellation of mol program. FY 1971 funding would support satellite development, portions of missile development, and range operations.
AEC’s requested $99 million reflected slight decreases for development of nerva rocket and space nuclear electric power sources for space applications.
Funds for Depts. of Interior and Agriculture would support participation in erts project. NSF’s $2-million space funding was for research rockets and satellite and observation instruments.
faa 1971 budget reflected restoration of $275 million in Federal funds for development of two prototype ssts. (NASA Release, 2/2/ 70; US Budget for FY 1971; bob Special Analysis)
• NASA Hq. briefing on FY 1971 budget, held Jan. 31, was released. Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, had said: “We are putting into motion with this budget a program which does not advance toward a single climactic event. It follows the recommendations of the Space Task Group Report’s Option II, although at a reduced pace. The budget to implement the recommendations, however, is austere and, as a result, does not take full advantage of our total capability. But the new program has the flexibility to accommodate this reduced budget in FY 1971.”
Lowest NASA budget since FY 1962 “means substantial cutbacks and deferrals in a number of programs. Our best current estimate is that the total nationwide employment on NASA work—which was once 420,000 people—will decline from current level by another 45,000, to about 144,000 people by the end of fiscal year 1971. The
impact will be felt in many sections of the country. This is regrettable, but the Administration has faced the hard fact that these steps must be taken to achieve a fiscally responsible balanced budget in this time of inflation. .. .this budget level, which we hope will be NASA’s lowest level, is strongly oriented to the future. The necessary reductions.. .have not been made ‘across the board.’ We have made careful selections and decisions.”
NASA would preserve strong future capability centered on development of economical, reusable space transportation system including shuttle, space station, and reusable nuclear rocket; continue efforts on practical applications of space technology for early practical benefits on earth; continue lunar exploration with Apollo vehicles and Apollo Applications earth orbital workshop flights with hardware previously under procurement; continue, “but with stretchouts and deferrals,” balanced program of planetary exploration and scientific investigations in space focused on potentially exciting discoveries; continue increasing emphasis on aeronautics; and maintain “essential cadre of NASA’s technical, operational, and management capabilities on which the continuing and future position of the United States in space depends.” [See Jan. 13.]
Assistant Administrator for Administration William E. Lilly during briefing had replied to question that planned fund request for space station and shuttle had been for $250 million to $260 million— supporting Task Group’s Option II, to provide operational systems in 1977—but request had been cut to final $110 million. Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers had said program should give CY 1978 operational date. Dates for Mars mission were not yet planned.
Michoud Assembly Facility and Mississippi Test Facility were among NASA installations to be affected by budgetary action, Lilly had said. Plans on Michoud would be to “complete the last of 15 Saturn 5’s in 1970; then we will be carrying on activities for the storage, repairing and refurbishing of the 1-B and the Saturn 5 stages, providing the engineering and support necessary for the flights through 1974, and maintaining the capability to restart or reinitiate the production of Saturn 5’s; maintaining the capability to accept new work.. .and. . .attempting to find other, users of that facility in New Orleans.” At mtf, Saturn V static test firings would be completed. “Then, the plans in our budget are to mothball the facilities. Personnel will be phased down.. .to essentially a mothball or caretaker mode.” NASA was working with other agencies to seek other uses for that location. (Transcript)

February 3: NASA successfully launched 1500-kg (3300-lb) Serf II (Space Electric Rocket Test) from wtr at 6:49 pm pst by Thorad-Agena booster. Spacecraft entered orbit with 1008.9-km (626.9-mi) apogee, 998.4-km (620.4-mi) perigee, 105.2-min period, and 99.1° inclination. Deployment of solar panels, disabling and dumping of Agena attitude control system, and transfer of Agena horizon sensor to spacecraft were accomplished satisfactorily. Spacecraft attitude was being maintained by gravity gradient forces and control moment gyros to well within required limits.
Primary mission objective was to operate electric ion thruster system in space satisfactorily for six months. Secondary objectives were to determine variation of thruster power efficiency with mission time; measure rf noise from ion beam in frequency bands associated with interplanetary communications systems; measure extent of coupling between ion beam and space plasma; measure magnitude of ion engine’s thrust by electrostatically suspended accelerometer, orbit change, or thruster measurements; measure long-term effects of ion thruster efflux on silicon-cell solar array; and measure change in equilibrium temperature of optically reflective coating in space environment.
Sert II system had large solar array, cylindrical spacecraft support unit (ssu), and spacecraft ring housing two ion engines, electric propulsion experiments, power conditioning, power switching and signaling equipment, and reacquisition control system, ssu housed two telemetry transmitters, two command systems, two tape recorders for data storage, power distribution system, battery for reacquisition control, and four control moment gyros.
Serf II was second mission in sert project, sert i, launched on suborbital mission July 20, 1964, had proved that ion engines could produce thrust in space, sert project was managed by LeRC under oart direction.

•	President Nixon transmitted to Congress Aeronautics and Space Re-
port of the President for 1969 (dated January 1970). He said: “The year 1969 was truly a turning point in the story of space exploration —the most significant of any year in that still brief history.” U.S. had achieved “most prominent of our goals in space—one which had long been a focus for our energies. As we enter a new decade, we must now set new goals which make sense for the Seventies. The space budget that I am submitting to Congress reflects my view of a balanced space program, one which will build on the progress we have already made. Our space and aeronautics program has benefited this Nation in many ways. It has contributed to our national security, to our educational, transportation, and commercial strength, to our scientific and medical knowledge, to our international position and to our sense of the dignity and the capacity of man. And the story is only beginning. We have made long strides into the future during the past year; now we must build on those accomplishments in the coming years and decades.” (Pres Rpt 70[69]; PD,2/9/70; 146)

Committee on Science and Astronautics Assessment of Space Communications Technology: NASA program of r&d in comsats and associated equipment during past decade had been “remarkably successful.” ComSatCorp also had made “significant strides.” As result, U.S. was “undisputed leader in this new technology.” State of the art was sufficiently advanced to “make important contributions to the improvement of the American domestic telecommunications system, particularly in Alaska. . .largest and most remote State of the Union.”
Committee urged expansion of NASA space applications program. It should be “principle purpose of the U.S. Government.. .to bring to the American people the best, the most effective, the least expensive communications services. It is the clear responsibility of the Government to develop and implement public policies, and improve the effectiveness of its regulatory functions, so as to promote the improvement of the Nation’s telecommunications at a rate which reflects the progress of technology. To the extent that governmental indecision has delayed the efficient integration of innovation and invention, the Government must be considered to have failed in this responsibility.” (Text)

February 4-6: aiaa held Advanced Space Transportation Meeting at Patrick afb and Cocoa Beach, Fla. In keynote address Charles W. Mathews, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, discussed capabilities of NASA reusable space shuttle. “In the area of multi-mission and multi-agency use, we are talking and thinking in the broadest sense. Certainly, the Department of Defense, in addition to NASA, has many requirements to carry payloads into space. Other agencies, the industrial community, and the academic community also have been involved in like fashion but have been.. .inhibited by the limited capabilities and costs of present launch systems and payloads. However, in addition to a higher level of participation within our own country, a much greater involvement is expected internationally because of the flexibility and utility of the space shuttle. Other nations might utilize a United States shuttle to carry and deploy their payloads or carry their personnel to a space station, but ultimately, nations or a consortium of nations may desire to operate their own shuttles just as foreign airlines operate U.S. developed commercial aircraft.”
Design baselines at start of Phase B studies of shuttle included 1.6 million kg (3.5 million lbs) at liftoff and payload compartment volume of 4.6-m (15-ft) dia by 18.3 m (60 ft) long.

Train said, “The environmental problems posed by the SST are exceedingly serious and have not been solved yet.” Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald said he shared Train’s views and mentioned large quantities of water vapor introduced into atmosphere by sst in flight. Robert Cahn said that, while sst would fly at subsonic speeds over populated areas, “we don’t know the effects [of supersonic speeds] on wildlife in nonpopulated areas.” (Kenworth, NYT, 2/6/70, 73)
February 6: At NASA Hq. industry briefing on space program for 1970s and beyond, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, said: “I think that when we talk about reducing the overall aerospace program by 12 percent, we have to look at the other side of the point too.. .we will still be spending $3.3 billion in the 71 budget, and I
think by any possible measure that puts the space program very, very high in the nation’s priorities.” Major reduction would be in manned spaceflight “from a little over $2 billion in FY 70 to $1,474,000,000 in 71.” With “the manned lunar landing behind us, with almost all the initial buy of 15 vehicles now completed, we are able to take a major reduction in the Apollo account as that program reaches a logical termination. We had hoped to continue the Saturn V at limited production of several a year. The decision was made under these austere conditions that we would terminate that production and take the savings.”
Peak NASA expenditure of $6 billion in 1965 included outlay for buildup of total NASA base. Fact “that we are now down between the three and four billion mark by no means means that we will be operating at a substantially lower space activity than we had at the peak. It reflects more the fact that the base is now completed; we can put a much higher percentage of our expenditures into program.”
However, FY 1971 budget would delay Apollo Applications flight until end of 1972; stretch Apollo lunar flights to two a year, with Apollo 16 occurring before aa program launch in 1972-1973 and Apollo 17 and 18 after aa program missions; delay ATS-F and ats-G by one year, and Viking-Mars lander from 1973 to 1975; and reduce NASA operational base by shutting down erc and possibly mothballing Mississippi Test Facility. Dr. Paine said NASA aeronautics effort would increase. “We feel that much of the work that will be going forward in the shuttle program will probably have some spin-off into the aeronautics area.” Emphasis would be placed on v/STOL and quiet engines.
Orbiting Solar Observatory launch recommended by Space Task Group for 1975 would be delayed to 1976. Interplanetary Monitoring Probes originally scheduled for 1971 and 1972 would be launched in 1972 and 1973 and ISIS would be moved from 1970 and 1972 to 1971 and 1973. Synchronous Meteorological Satellites each would slip one year, to 1972 and 1973, and Applications Technology Satellites, one year, to 1973 and 1975. lunar roving vehicle would be carried on Apollo 16,17, 18, and 19. Decision on whether to fund two or three space shuttle definition studies would be made after proposals were received. In space station area experimental requirements would be emphasized. Two Phase-B definition studies were under way. Summer study of utilization of space stations would be international conference “with, we hope, strong participation from the European space research organization.” nerva studies would continue.
Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told conference that “with the technology we already have in hand” antipollution program could be initiated “to produce a space reflector—maybe it will have to be a mile [1.6 km] in diameter—that can direct the sun’s energy to create holes over our cities which would act as chimneys to evacuate smog.” (Transcript)
• Value of space program to national defense was discussed by samso Commander, l/g Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), before Executives’ Club in Chicago. Program had produced “greatly improved military communications, strategical and tactical; the ability to detect and monitor nuclear detonations anywhere in the world; new capabili-
ties for precise navigation of fast-moving aircraft, ships, submarines or land vehicles; and a variety of capabilities for early warning and other defensive space systems.” First defense comsat system had been transmitting “substantial load of voice communications between Washington and Vietnam since 1967. It can also handle highspeed digital data such as tactical reconnaissance photographs. Improved adaptations of this 26-satellite initial system have been developed for the United Kingdom and NATO.”
In year’s time “we will be launching a still further improved Phase II United States system with greater traffic handling capacity, higher reliability and longer life expectancy.” First experimental satellite had also been launched “in development of a new tactical communications capability that will enable troops. . .to communicate with each other in spite of intervening obstacles like mountain ranges or enemy forces. Another new defense capability was built into our vela satellites. . .launched in October of 1963 to monitor the nuclear test ban treaty.” Velas had become “oldest man-made functioning systems in space; they still respond to command, although their duties have largely been taken over now by more advanced versions.” Velas had performed scientific chores like “monitoring the level of solar radiation during manned space flights, to ensure against danger to the astronauts.” usaf navigation satellites under study would permit pinpoint accuracy in navigation of supersonic aircraft and surface and subsurface vehicles. They held promise for prevention of midair collisions. “We’re also doing extensive studies on a space shuttle system that would be. . .a reusable space booster capable of supporting both military and civilian space operations.” It could put satellites into orbit, service satellites operating in space, supply manned space station, or assist in rescue of astronauts in space emergencies.

Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard F. Gordon, Jr., and Alan L. Bean had observed brilliant flashes of light on closing eyes in darkened portions of spacecraft. They were believed to be caused by charged particles or rays from sun or from space. Astronauts also experienced sensitivity to lunar dust, body changes including face fullness, reddened eyes, and flushed faces during early part of flight, and increase in skin bacteria beyond amount normal on earth. Dr. Berry blamed body changes on pooling of fluids in head from lack of gravity. Behavior of bacteria might make doctors consider altering normal skin surface bacteria content by special baths for astronauts before flight.
Dr. Berry also said that woman might share in planetary exploration but tests were needed to ensure “she doesn’t create more problems than she solves. I think it would definitely be more comfortable if we took women along.” (Huntsville Times, 2/10/70; Huntsville News, 2/10/70)

•	NASA Hq. briefing explained to university administrators effects of
NASA budget cuts on funds for educating space scientists. Termination tof sustaining university program in FY 1971 would eliminate more than 200 predoctoral training grants which had been funded at $4.18 million. Funding for multidisciplinary research grants also would end. Students would not be cut off immediately, since grants had been step-funded and would be reduced over three years. NASA Assistant Administrator for University Affairs F. B. Smith said other agencies might assume funding of some grants, since university r&d funding in total Federal budget would increase by $114 million during FY 1971. Presidential Science Adviser, Dr. Lee A. Du-Bridge, said increase would not compensate for leveling off of r&d budgets in past few years nor for effects of inflation. He noted Government support for graduate students was declining generally and said Government did not need as many scientists as previously.
Total $21 million would be cut by NASA in contracts and grants to universities. In ossa, university R&D grants in bioscience would be cut by 30%. Cuts would eliminate a high-energy astronomical observatory. oart would experience 30% cut in university r&d, chiefly affecting electronics and space vehicles research, omsf contracts with mit for Apollo program would be reduced by $2 million.

With termination of Apollo fabrication, 8 Saturn Vs and 6 Saturn IBs, 12 cms and sms, and 1 or 2 lms would be available for manned flight. After 1974, U.S. would have no capability for lifting manned payloads over 27 200 kg (60 000 lbs) into space and would have only three vehicles that could lift 27 200-kg payloads unless Saturn V production was resumed or substitute was developed. Launch rate of less than two manned vehicles per year could materially increase risk of manned launch and spaceflight operations; production rate of two or more Apollo spacecraft and launch vehicles per year would minimize annual cost without inordinate increases in total vehicle cost over current costs, while maintaining critical skills of major subcontractors.
U.S. would have no long-duration manned earth-orbital capability after 1973 without extension of orbital workshop program or initiation of development of space station. Early development of low-cost earth-to-orbit transportation system appeared to offer greatest opportunity for reducing space flight costs while increasing flexibility and variety of missions in near-earth orbit. For increased flexibility in low-cost earth-to-orbit recoverable transportation system, development of chemical space tug was advised. Report noted that nasa maintained the only U.S. manned space flight capability and advised major decisions on manned space flight program to prolong capability beyond 1974. (Text)

STS would consist of “earth-to-orbit space shuttle.” Agreement established nasa-usaf sts Committee to conduct continuing review of STS program and recommend steps to achieve “system that meets DOD and NASA requirements.” Recommendations would include, but not be limited to, “development and operational aspects, technology status and needs, resource considerations, and interagency relationships.” (Text)
•	Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, opened testimony before
House Committee on Science and Astronautics on NASA FY 1971 authorization: “Apollo 11 and 12 demonstrated that we can fly across a quarter of a million miles [400 000 km] of space, land with precision, carry out research and exploration, and return safely to earth. We met our commitments for the decade of the sixties. Now we must chart a new course for the next decade in space. The Congress again shares with the Administration the responsibility for continuing progress and leadership in space and aeronautics. At the same time, NASA is going through a difficult period of redirection, and austere budget goals must be met. This is therefore a time of great challenge. But I firmly believe that with your support we can continue to forge ahead in space exploration, in science, in applications, and in aerospace technology. The program which we will lay before you, although austere, provides for balanced progress toward the challenging goals for the 1970’s and the decades to follow.”
NASA budget as it came from President included “major reduction in space program,” to achieve balanced U.S. budget in “time of inflation.” By reducing operating base, making selective cut-backs, and deferring new starts NASA had developed program permitting progress toward SpaceTask Group’s Option II goals, but at reduced pace, [see Jan. 13 and Feb. 2], Dr. Paine noted it was significant
that, “in a sharply reduced total budget, we have been able to increase our space applications efforts. Our aeronautics effort will also continue to be strengthened.”
He urged Committee to keep in mind that proposed program “could not be conducted in the face of further cuts.” NASA had no plans to fly astronauts in space between last Apollo flight in 1974 and the time space shuttle would be operative in late 1970s. “Any significant reduction in our FY 1971 request will further extend this gap in American manned space flight, and reduce other important programs.” (Testimony)
•	Apollo 12 lm in final moments of descent to lunar surface had caused
dust shower that pocked Surveyor III and sand-blasted camera, NASA announced. Burton G. Cour-Palais, Chief of Meteoroid Sciences Branch at MSC, reported that Surveyor III TV camera experienced little meteoroid damage during 950 days of exposure to space environment, but had numerous shallow craters of recent origin— apparently caused by lm 183 m (600 ft) away. LM-caused craters were “shallow. . .mostly of recent origin, as indicated by their whiteness against the sandy brown color of the TV camera housing painted surface.” White craters were concentrated on arc of TV camera facing lm, 10 to 100 times as many as on side away from lm. Preliminary assessment of meteoroid impacts indicated more than five impacts on camera housing and four on polished tube. (NASA Release 70-23)
•	ESSA announced it had received NASA contract to investigate lightning
hazards to rockets as part of NASA effort to develop lightning-warning system and techniques for lightning suppression. Dr. Heinz W. Kasemir, head of essa research project, said that “launching a rocket through thunder or rain clouds can be hazardous, not so much because the rocket will be hit accidently by natural lightning, but because the rocket itself may trigger a lightning stroke in the storm.” NASA’s Apollo 12 had suffered temporary power failure from lightning during launch through storm at KSC Nov. 14, 1969.
Suspected triggering effect of rockets in thunderheads had been demonstrated when specially equipped essa DC-6 research aircraft operated by essa’s Research Flight Facility was struck by lightning three separate times under similar meteorological conditions during thunderstorm research project near Flagstaff, Ariz. Each time lightning struck, aircraft was in dissipating thunderhead near freezing level and in area of cloud that contained both ice and water. Corona discharge had been audibly detected on aircraft communications system for two seconds before each lightning strike. Observations of electrical field within the storm before and after lightning bolts suggested that aircraft itself, moving through thunderhead, might have triggered discharges, (essa Release 70-8-30)

February 19-20: Medical behavioral experiments to be conducted on Apollo Applications missions were described by NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers in authorization hearings before House Committee on Science and Astronautics: Experiments would seek “information required to understand man’s capability for long-duration flight and to provide the confidence that man can participate in an optimal manner in these. . .activities.” Four experiments to determine skeletal and muscular alterations during space flight and evaluate biochemical changes and nutritive requirements would measure input and output of calcium, nitrogen, and other biochemical constituents; make x-ray studies of bone demineralization; and assess hormonal and electrolyte constituents of blood and body waste products. Cardiovascular study would use lower body negative pressure—preflight, inflight, and postflight—to test cardiovascular system reflexes regulating regional perfusion pressure in distribution of blood throughout body as man changed posture on earth. Inflight measurements would allow establishment of onset, rate of progression, and severity of adverse changes in protective reflex responses. Investigations of hematology and immunology would be made.
Two neurophysiological experiments would evaluate central nervous system responses. First, human vestibular experiment
would extend studies initiated during Gemini program to investigate effects of weightlessness and subgravity states on perception and organization of personal and extrapersonal space and establish integrity of vestibular apparatus during prolonged weightlessness. In second, electroencephalogram (eeg) would determine efFects of prolonged space flight on patterns of sleep and wakefulness and assess attention levels in task performance and work-rest cycles. Energy expenditure in space would be measured for first time by comparison of metabolic rate during rest, during calibrated exercise, and while performing operational tasks. (Testimony)

February 23: At annual meeting of American Chemical Society in Houston, Tex., Univ. of Chicago lunar chemist Dr. Anthony Turkevich described lunar highlands as “comparable to the continents of earth, floating like icebergs on a more dense medium of deeper rocks.” Only chemical basis of comparison between lunar plains and highlands had been provided by Turkevich-designed experiment flown on Surveyor mission to highland region near crater Tycho. Compared with Apollo II lunar sample data, experiment data proved plains were darker and denser than highlands because they contained twice the abundance of elements heavier than calcium. Moon’s chemical content also showed “evidence for a crust on the moon.”
Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astophysical Observatory presented corroborating evidence based on traces of highland material in Apollo ll samples. He explained meteoroid impact at nearby highland area might have showered lighter-colored material—anorthosite—on plain where Apollo II landed. Anorthositic crust, formed by melting, probably covered moon at one time. Then giant craters, which became plains, were blasted into crust by early impacts and lavas from beneath surface welled into holes and solidified. Dr. Wood estimated depth of crust at 24 km (15 mi), but other scientists were skeptical.
In interview following meeting, Cal Tech chemist Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg said crust was thin “like the skin of an onion.” (Wil-ford, NYT, 2/24/70, 25)

• Challenge and objectives of space science and applications program for next decade were outlined by Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, before House Committee on Science and Astronautics during NASA FY 1971 authorization hearings: “In the allocation of its scarce resources NASA is emphasizing those projects which help solve immediate problems and deferring to a later year those major new starts whose objectives are primarily to gain the new knowledge. Obviously, we cannot continue to defer such promising scientific projects indefinitely without mortgaging the economic health, the technical progress, and the security of this Nation.
“In the immediate future these postponements are tolerable because of our active ongoing program. Future Aeronomy and Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (imp) Explorer missions will be directed at the earth’s environment: improved oso’s will study the sun and provide data for correlation with ecology studies; the Small Astronomy Satellites (sas) will start giving us continued data on galactic x-rays and gamma-rays; and future missions of the OAO will continue the successful observation program begun with oao-2. Before the middle of the decade, we will visit two additional planets, Jupiter and Mercury. We will orbit Mars in 1971 and land in 1976. Under our supporting programs, we are analyzing space data, developing theories to explain the findings; we are conducting relatively less expensive but very productive investigations with sounding rockets and airplanes; and are developing concepts and investigations for future missions.” Establishing scientific priorities, allocating proper resources to research, and deciding between various expensive scientific projects would continue to be “a most difficult problem.” NASA would work with in-house scientists, advisory groups, and nas and nae “to be sure that the scientific projects we are undertaking are sound and worthy of support.” (Testimony)
Donald P. Hearth, Director of Planetary Programs, ossa, testified on continuation of Mars program before Committee: “The results of the Mariner 6 and 7 missions have affected very little the probability that life, in some form, may exist and they have not dampened the enthusiasm of the biologist to search for life on Mars. The apparent low nitrogen content in the atmosphere can be tolerated by many organisms. In fact, biota can be readily conceived which do not directly utilize gaseous nitrogen at all. The results have increased the geological interest in Mars primarily due to the discovery of the chaotic and featureless terrains. An understanding of these geological differences could shed new light on the origin and evolution of Mars and, thereby, on the origin and evolution of the
solar system as a whole. We are, therefore, continuing the Mars program. . . . However because of the need to minimize expenditures. . .it has been necessary to delay the Viking missions from 1973 to 1975.” (Testimony)
R. B. Marsten, Director of Communications Programs, OSSA, testified on broadcast service of NASA advanced flight experimentation in satellite communications: “Broadcast services come in three classes—the distribution class, which, through a relatively small satellite, would broadcast program material to large receivers, perhaps co-located with local broadcast transmitters for rebroadcast in the conventional mode; a somewhat larger satellite in the community mode, which would broadcast to moderate size receivers located in village squares, or in remote areas and connected to a cable distribution system for redistribution of the program material to viewing sets; and. . .direct broadcast mode, in which multi-kilowatt power level satellites broadcast directly to the user, who may have a conventional TV receiver. This application has the potential of providing instant national service where there is no ground infrastructure, and is much talked about now for educational purposes.” (Testimony)
Jesse L. Mitchell, Director of Physics and Astronomy Programs, OSSA, said in submitted statement that research with instrumented aircraft was integral part of NASA program. “This research helps to bridge the gap between groundbased experiments and those that require the more expensive rockets and space vehicles. We have conducted auroral and airglow research observations of the solar corona during total eclipses and infrared observations. The ability to investigate interstellar dust and other celestial objects by observing their infrared emissions is opening up a promising line of research. A small jet aircraft has been used to take a 12-inch [305-mm] infrared telescope to 50 000 feet [15 200 m] above the earth. At this altitude, much of the infrared radiation from the universe is observable; in contrast, at the surface of the earth it is obscured by water vapor. Investigators from the University of Arizona have used a Lear jet from ARC for observations of planets, stars, and galaxies at wavelengths from 30 to 300 microns.” They had discovered centers of galaxies were bright in infrared. Because of importance of this area of astronomy, “36-inch [914-mm] telescope is presently being constructed to be placed in a C-141 jet airplane. This plane and the larger telescope will constitute a unique and effective airborne astronomical observatory.” (Testimony)
Joseph B. Mahon, Director of Launch Vehicle and Propulsion Programs, OSSA, submitted statement on NASA plans for use of Titan IIIC and Titan-Centaur booster configuration. Titan IIIC would be used to launch ATS-Fand ATS-G into synchronous orbit. Introduction of Titan-Centaur configuration in time scale to support Viking mission would represent "vital portion of the effort associated with the Centaur Program in Calendar Years 1971,1972, and 1973.” NASA and USAF had concluded basic management agreements for operation of Titan IIIC and Titan-Centaur systems, usaf would act as Titan IIIC launch vehicle systems manager, responsible to NASA mission direction. NASA would be Titan-Centaur launch vehicle systems manager but would use selected elements of existing usaf contractor organi-
zations. Titan III complex at etr would be modified to provide single launch pad capability for supporting planetary opportunities with two launches from the same pad. Plans for Titan Ill-Centaur included engineering proof flight of all-up Viking configuration late in 1973. First operational use was planned for 1974 to support He-lios-A solar probe, subject to discussions with West Germany. During FY 1970, preliminary design and program definition effort for Titan Ill-Centaur would be completed and final design and qualification effort initiated, as well as action for procurement of proof-flight vehicle and supporting hardware.

• Oran W. Nicks, NASA Acting Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics on oart’s FY 1971 program. Primary objective of v/STOL program was “research needed for the development of advanced rotorcraft which will offer hovering capability and low-noise operations for inner-city operations plus the cruise flight efficiency necessary for inner-city to outlying airport service. Experience with conventional helicopters shows that this service is desired but that it falls short of economic success. If the gap can be closed by improved technology, then the way will be clear for rapid development of this type of travel service. To this end, we are working on several advanced rotor concepts.” LaRC v/stol Transition Research Wind Tunnel would be operational in late 1970. Facility would study effect of down flow from rotors on fuselage and tail, high-lift flaps for stol air transport applications, and effect of jet-lift engine exhaust on aerodynamic and propulsion characteristics of vtol fighter configurations.

Charles W. Harper, Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, oart, testified before House Committee on NASA’s v/stol technology: “In the past few years NASA has focused its research increasingly toward the objective of enabling development of several types of v/stol aircraft, each directed at a single important mis-
sion. These include an advanced rotor type with airplane-like cruise capability for those missions where vertical takeoff and landing is mandatory, a small and agile stol aircraft with modest cruise performance and capable of operating easily out of 1500' [460-m] runways having minimum site preparation and a large stol aircraft having jet transport type cruise performance while also operating easily out of well prepared 1500' [460-m] stol ports. In addition to this more focused activity, the v/stol program contains broader research objectives leading eventually to multimission v/stol aircraft satisfying this growing transportation mode most effectively.” (Testimony)

Kurzweg, Director of Research, oart, testified on NASA basic research programs: NASA-supported research had developed new approach permitting for first time step-by-step numerical calculation of growth of disturbances in atmospheric shear flows, which should contribute to detection and avoidance of clear-air turbulence by jet aircraft. First steps had been taken to apply fluid physics knowledge to atmospheric pollution from airborne and ground sources, testing pollutant action in models of city streets. New research programs would apply knowledge of fluid dynamics to noise abatement studies. Establishment of direct relationship between surface structure and electrical characteristics of germanium surface during oxidation had increased knowledge of oxygen’s role in device performance and should increase efficiency in electronic devices. Special attention was being given to evaluation of alloys at the high temperatures of supersonic speeds and to evaluation of rigid polymeric foams as lightweight structural materials for aircraft.

Nuclear rocket would be in-space link between earth-to-orbit transportation system and operations at moon and in distant earth orbits. NASA budget request for $38 million for program in FY 1971, however, could “be viewed as maintaining progress in only the most important longest-lead-time development activities in nerva.” Progress made in “early, critical years, will permit later development activities. . .to proceed smoothly.” Effort was essential to meet major milestones: first ground test of series of nerva flight reactors in 1973 and first ground test of series of nerva flight engines in 1974.

February 26: President Nixon sent message to Congress setting forth Federal Economy Act of 1970: “I propose reduction, termination or restructuring of 57 programs which are obsolete, low priority or in need of basic reform. These program changes would save a total of $2.5 billion in the fiscal year 1971.” Among “most significant” items in total savings effort was space program. “After the recent successful Apollo missions, scientific needs for more manned lunar explorations were reassessed. We concluded that fewer manned expeditions to the moon were needed, and production of additional Saturn V launch vehicles and spacecraft has been suspended. Eight Saturn Vs remain in our inventory for manned flights during the early 70s: Savings as a result of these and related space research decisions total $417 million in fiscal year 1971 appropriations.” (PD, 3/2/ 70,271-5)
•	President Nixon sent to Congress Annual Report on Activities and
Accomplishments under the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. He said: “Communications between Earth and the Moon, while certainly the most dramatic use, is only one of many ways in which satellite communications can now be employed. The Intelsat Consortium of more than 70 nations has been highly successful in bringing the benefits of communications satellite technology to the people of many nations. This report reflects the steady progress being made toward an improved global communications network. Already we see major improvements in international telecommunications capabilities—improvements that will ultimately benefit all of the world’s people.”
Report said 1969 “saw the largest annual increase in the number of operational earth stations in the history of INTELSAT.” At year’s end, 41 earth station antennas were in operation in 24 countries. “Nine other stations or additional antennas are expected to be in service within the first six months of 1970.” (PD, 3/2/70, 275; H Doc 91-264)
•	Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, testified in NASA FY
1971 authorization hearings before House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “Our most serious problem in recent years has been our inability to hire newly graduated scientists, engineers and administrative professionals in sufficient numbers. The average age of NASA employees is now increasing 8/10 of a year each year. While we were able to hire 965 graduating college students in 1966, the number dropped to 738 in 1967, 567 in 1968, 253 in 1969, and an estimated 180 in 1970.”
NASA Civil Service staffing would decline from 31 350 at end of FY 1970 to 30550 at end of FY 1971. Of this reduction, 600 would result from phasing out of erc employees. Total of 200 would be reduced at manned space flight centers and NASA Hq. (Testimony)
•	NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition
Gerald M. Truszynski testified before House Committee: Tracking networks had supported 101 manned and unmanned missions in addition to Apollo 11 in 1969. Meeting basic requirements of flight projects when budget was at “minimum level” had required significant reductions in overall network capability. Planned improvements had been deferred in FY 1969 for second year and, for first time, sustaining equipment items had been deferred.
FY 1971 request of $299.3 million—$298.0 million for R&D and $1.3 million for construction—included MSFN equipment to support Apollo Applications program while continuing alsep support. Satellite Network reductions in FY 1969 had terminated or greatly reduced support of several in-orbit spacecraft still capable of transmitting valuable scientific data. Remaining workload of some 45 satellites! continued to require around-the-clock bperationsjatimostlnet-work stations. Many satellites already aloft would require support in FY 1971, as would 10 new spacecraft scheduled for launch. FY 1971 equipment replacement program was critical. Network could support only portion of spacecraft passes and reliability was essential.
Continued support from dsn overseas facilities would be needed to support four on-going Pioneer missions and Mariner VI and VII. Major increase in workload in late FY 1971 with launch of dual Mariner ’71 mission would require substantial preparatory engineering effort, as would multimission capability for future programs of Pioneer F and G, Mariner/Mercury ’73, and Helios.

•	Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
Flight, testified on NASA FY 1971 authorization before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: Manned space expenditures for FY 1971 would be about 25% less than in FY 1970 and about half FY 1966 peak. “We are able to make these rapid changes . . . as the result of two fundamental policies .... One of these policies is that the great bulk of the NASA program is carried out under contracts with industry, university laboratories and other institutions in the private sector of our economy. The other ... is that NASA must maintain a civil service staff sufficient in quality and numbers to properly supervise the work performed under contract .... Essentially all the reductions being implemented in the manned space flight programs in Fiscal Year 1971 are in those efforts carried out urtder contract.”
In FY 1971 NASA proposed to complete definition of space shuttle and space station and continue studies of systems, missions, and payloads for further economies in future years. In Apollo program, Myers pointed out, scheduled stretchout of manned lunar landings would “add to operational costs of the lunar exploration program, although not to our costs this year.”
In Skylab program, design, development, and ground testing of subsystems and assemblies of Saturn Workshop, airlock module, multiple docking adapter, and atm were well advanced. Fabrication had begun on first flight articles, with delivery scheduled for late 1971.
In space shuttle program, shuttle would be “designed so that it can be maintained in a state of launch readiness for lengthy periods and yet be launched within two hours notice into an orbit of any inclination. In the event of an emergency in space, it would be able to carry engineering or repair specialists to overcome the problem or rescue an endangered crew.” (Testimony)

March 2: Apollo 13 Mission Director’s briefing was held at NASA Hq.: Mission would be launched from ksc April 11 on hybrid trajectory to moon’s Fra Mauro, rugged highland area. Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB) would be ejected onto trajectory that would crash it onto lunar surface, providing signals that could be recorded by seismometer left on moon by Apollo 12 crew. Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., and Fred W. Haise, Jr., would land lm on moon and conduct two fivehour eva periods on lunar surface while Astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly II orbited moon in csm, photographing candidate landing sites. Lunar surface eva would be covered with color TV camera; black-and-white camera would be carried as backup.
After return to earth crew, lunar samples, and spacecraft would be quarantined under procedures similar to those for Apollo 11 and Apollo 12. Apollo Mission Director, Capt. Chester M. Lee (usn, Ret.), said continuation of quarantine—thought unnecessary by many scientists—was based “solely upon the fact that a segment of the scientific community considered the hilly upland site to constitute a new lunar environment.... The bio tests . . . physical science, and organic chemistry analyses, have found absolutely no evidence of any life forms or precursors of life.”
To reduce risk of lightning from high-potential near thunderstorms which had affected Apollo 12, NASA had tightened rules for launching in bad weather. Spacecraft would not be launched if nominal flight path carried vehicle through cumulonimbus clouds, within 8 km (5 mi) of thunderstorm cloud, or within 5 km (3 mi) of overhang from a cumulonimbus cloud; through a cold front or squall lying clouds extending 3000 m (10 000 ft); through middle cloud layers 1800 m (6000 ft) or more deep; or through cumulus clouds with tops 3000 m (10000 ft) or higher. Capt. Lee said although Apollo vehicle was well protected, lightning discharge did occur and NASA officials were “doing everything we possibly can to avoid it, without restricting ourselves unduly” to never launching at all.

Scientific Activities, Fiscal Years 1968, 1969, and 1970: Federal ob-
ligations for R&D were $15.9 billion in FY 1968 and were expected to total $15.8 billion in FY 1969 and $16.5 billion in FY 1970. Cycle of rapid advancement in Federal r&d funding that began in 1950s had ended. Basic research obligations totaled $2.1 billion in FY 1968 and were expected to be same in FY 1969. In FY 1970 research obligations were expected to rise to $2.4 billion. During decade, basic research had grown more rapidly than either applied research or development. Applied research obligations totaled $3.3 billion in FY
1968	and were expected to be same in FY 1969. For FY 1970, obligations were expected to reach $3.7 billion. Applied research growth rate since FY 1967 had slowed to less than 1% annually. Development obligations totaled $10.6 billion in FY 1968 and were expected to decrease to $10.4 billion inFYs 1969 and 1970. From FYs 1959 to
1969	development portion of Federal R&D total dropped from 79% to
66%.
In FY 1969, 77% of Federal r&d funds was expected to go to extramural performers and remainder to intramural at Federal facilities.
dod, NASA, and aec continued to provide bulk of Federal r&d dollars (83%) in FY 1969, with 75% of their obligations allocated to development.

March 2-4: aiaa Earth Resources Conference to consider technical, economic, and political aspects of global satellite system was held in Annapolis, Md. In keynote address Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson said surveying earth’s resources from space could change face of international relations. He warned nations must organize international survey program to avoid serious diplomatic problems when system became operational in few years. “We should start now to consider with other countries how best to capitalize and coordinate earth resource surveying systems as they come to serve the interests of many countries. People value what they pay for and they will not contribute to a U.S. program.” Problem of how to handle data gathered from country not participating or not wanting information known was major problem.
Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of Subcommittee on NASA Oversight of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said NASA’s projected new program costs were “unrealistically low.” He predicted, “There will be pressure on Congress to reduce
the space budget still further unless the future orientation of the program is based less on space spectaculars and more on the production of tangible benefits.”

•	Science published report of Apollo 12 Lunar Sample Preliminary
Examination Team. Samples from Ocean of Storms were about one billion years younger than Apollo 11 samples from Tranquility Base. While most conclusions reached on Apollo 11 rocks also applied to Apollo 12 rocks, Apollo 11 crystalline rocks displayed one texture (lath-shaped ilmenite and plagioclase with interstitial pyroxene) and similar modes (50% pyroxene, 30% plagioclase, 20% opaque, 0 to 5% olivine), while Apollo 12crystalline rocks showed wide range in texture and mode. Most Apollo 12 igneous rocks fitted fractional crystallization sequence, indicating that they represented either parts of single intrusive sequence or samples of number of similar sequences. Breccias were of lower abundance at Ocean of Storms site than at Tranquility Base, “presumably because the regolith at the Ocean of Storms is less mature and not as thick as at Tranquility Base.” Complex stratification existed in lunar regolith, “presumably due mainly to the superposition of ejecta blankets.” Apollo 12 sample 12033 indicated presence of layer of volcanic ash. Greater carbon content in Apollo 12 breccias and fines than in crystalline rocks was “presumably due largely to contributions of meteoritic material and solar wind.” Amount of indigenous organic material capable of volatilization or pyrolysis, or both, appeared extremely low in Apollo 12 samples. Content of noble gas of solar wind origin was less in fines and breccias of Apollo 12 rocks than in fines and breccias from Apollo IVs Tranquility Base site. Breccias contained less solar wind contribution than did fines, indicating that breccias were formed from fines lower in solar wind noble gases than were fines at surface. Presence of nuclides produced by cosmic rays showed Apollo 12 rocks had been within 1 m (3.3 ft) of surface for
10 million to 200 million yrs. Igneous rocks had crystalized 1.7 billion to 2.7 billion yrs ago. (Science, 3/6/70, 1325-39)

March 6-8: NASA launched barrage of 31 sounding rockets—Areas, Nike-Apache, Nike-Cajun, Nike-Tomahawk, Nike-Iroquois, Aero-bee 150, Aerobee 170, and Javelin—from Wallops Station to collect data on solar eclipse. Meteorology, ionospheric physics, and solar physics experiments were provided by four universities and seven other research organizations. All 31 rockets were launched on time, all vehicles performed satisfactorily, and excellent radar traces and telemetry records were received. Only one experiment, ozone and water vapor experiment on a Nike-Cajun, failed to return any scientific data. Three other experiments—solar flare spectrum on an Aerobee 170, airglow experiment on a Nike-Tomahawk, and Pitot probe on a Nike-Apache—were partial successes.

March 7: President Nixon issued statement from Key Biscayne, Fla., on future of U.S. space program: “Having completed that long stride into the future which has been our objective for the past decade, we must now define new goals which make sense for the seventies. We
must build on the successes of the past, always reaching out for new achievements. But we must also recognize that many critical problems here on this planet make high priority demands on our attention and our resources. By no means should we allow our space program to stagnate. But—with the entire future and the entire universe before us—we should not try to do everything at once. Our approach to space must continue to be bold—but it must also be balanced.”
General purposes of space program should be exploration, acquisition of scientific knowledge, and use of practical applications to benefit life on earth. Six objectives of space program should be lunar exploration; planetary exploration, including eventual manned Mars exploration; reduction in cost of space operations; extension of man’s capability to live and work in space; expansion of practical applications of space technology; and encouragement of greater international cooperation in space. “A program which achieves these goals will be a balanced space program. . .which will extend our capabilities and knowledge. . .and put our new learning to work for the immediate benefit of all people. As we enter a new decade, we are conscious. . .that man is also entering a new historic era. For the first time, he has reached beyond his planet; for the rest of time, we will think of ourselves as men from the planet Earth.”
President Nixon said NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, had met recently with space authorities of Western Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia to “find ways in which we can cooperate more effectively in space.” (PD, 3/9/70, 328-31)
• Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, at Key Biscayne press conference following release of President’s space message outlined NASA plans for “Grand Tour” missions in 1970s and space developments for next decade: “A strong effort in exploration, in science and in the practical application of space for the benefit of man here on Earth is laid out, with increasing emphasis on international cooperation.” Space shuttle and space station proposals contained reduction in cost of space activities and increase in man’s capability to travel back and forth and to work in space for long periods. Space shuttle would take off vertically; at 64-km (40-mi) altitude and 11 300 km per hr (7000 mph), 2nd stage would separate and carry 22.5-metric-ton (25-short-ton) payload of men, equipment, and supplies into earth orbit, with 1st stage returning to earth for horizontal landing. After mission of up to two weeks, 2nd stage would reenter atmosphere and land horizontally for reuse.
President’s program of planetary exploration would “provide man with a closehand look of every planet in the solar system.”
Administration placed “great emphasis. . .on the practical applications of space techniques, not only in communication satellites and weather satellites, but in new areas such as Earth resources satellites.”
Dr. Paine saw as “most statesmanlike portion” of President’s statement “increasing recognition of the international participation of other nations in both the exploration and the utilization of space.” It was too early to report specific results of Dr. Paine’s visit to world’s space capitals but “there certainly is a very substantial interest overseas in utilizing more fully the American program as a
means of closing the technology gap on the part of other nations and, at the same time, allowing them to participate in both the exploration and the utilization of space in the decades to come.” (Transcript)

•	In NASA-sponsored solar eclipse project scientists used spacecraft in
deep space, earth-orbiting satellites, instruments on ground, and sounding rockets to make intense study, concentrating on eclipse’s effect on earth’s atmosphere and ionosphere.
In-space observations were conducted with four NASA spacecraft and three U.S.-Canada satellites. Radio signals from Mariner VI on far side of sun were measured to determine how eclipse affected signals and to study changes in charged particles in earth’s atmosphere. Oso V and Oso VI, in earth orbit, pointed instruments at sun to gather data on sun and solar atmosphere, and Ats III photographed earth and its cloud-cover to show path of eclipse across northern hemisphere. American-Canadian satellites Alouette I, Alouette II, and Isis I investigated eclipse-caused changes in ionosphere.
Ground observations were conducted by observers from three universities and four NASA centers at sites in Virginia and Mexico. At site near Sandbridge, Va., Univ. of Michigan team photographed solar corona and LaRC experimenter photographed solar flash spectrum that was too weak to be seen when sun was not obscured. LaRC, GSFC, and sao scientists used four Super Schmidt Meteor Cameras at Wallops Island, Eastville, and Sandbridge, Va., to photograph faint comets believed to be near sun. At LaRC, Univ. of Colorado scientists used optical assembly for two Wallaston prisms on LaRC’s 241-mm (9.5-in) Cassegrain telescope to investigate difference between color of tangentially and radially polarized radiation from solar K-corona. arc scientists photographed full intermediate-scale coronal structure, using special radial transmission filter in front of LaRC telescope’s prime focus.
In Mexico LaRC scientists used NASA’s mobile Satellite Photometric Observatory in path of totality at Miahuatlan to determine intensity of coronal radiation to 1% accuracy. Simultaneous wideband monitor measurements of intensity and polarization of coronal radiation were made out to 3.2 million km (2 million mi) from sun to determine for first time fine structure of coronal electron density and temperature. Team of MSC and Univ. of Houston scientists made variety of observations near Miahuatlan in attempt to separate F- and K-coronas, determine structure of coronas, and study interplanetary dust and particles by measuring coronal intensity and radiation, recording flash chromosphere spectrum, and using photographic and photoelectric techniques to study shadow bands.

• afcrl KC-135 research aircraft, carrying new infrared sensing system and multichannel tape recorders above moon’s shadow, collected data on solar eclipse. Primary objective was to develop techniques for predicting wavelengths at which atmosphere would be most transparent under different conditions. Although eclipse lasted only 3 min 30 secs on earth, by chasing lunar shadow scientists prolonged effect to 5 min 38 secs. Abrupt switching off and switching on of sunlight provided ideal means of learning nature of airglow reaction, particularly in 80- to 100-km (50- to 60-mi) region.

In addition, the pace of earth station development by national entities in many countries has been significant. Investment worldwide of about $200 million in earth stations and more than $100 million in satellites reflects a widespread confidence in the present and future benefits of satellite communications.”
Highlights of 1969 included achievement of major intelsat goal, global coverage by comsat; full commerical operation of 22 new antennas in 18 countries; start of construction on Intelsat IV series satellites and selection of Atlas-Centaur as series launch vehicle;
completion of ComSat Laboratories, major r&d facility; and reaffirmation by ComSatCorp of its readiness to finance, establish, and operate domestic comsat system. (Text)
•	Press editorials commented on President Nixon’s statement on Na-
tion’s space program.
New York Times: “If the President’s program is fulfilled pn schedule, the economics of space activity—both its costs and its dividends for nonscientists here on earth—will be revolutionized. The reconnaissance activities of earth resources satellites have enormous potentials for aiding agriculture, forestry, the search for new minerals, and the exploitation of the seas. The prospect of communications satellites that can broadcast radio and television programs directly to homes everywhere offers exciting new perspectives for further unifying all peoples, while simultaneously raising delicate political problems. . . . When it becomes available, the reusable space shuttle will. . .facilitate construction of a permanent manned orbiting space station that will open up new areas of scientific and economic activity in the near neighborhood of earth.” (NYT, 3/9/70)
Washington Evening Star: “The 1970’s promise to be an exciting decade in space, not just a comedown from the exhilaration of the initial moon landings. The next 10 years will be even more satisfying if another of the President’s goals—increased international cooperation in space—is realized. To that end, Soviet space scientists have been told about the U.S. plans. The Russian leaders would do well to consider the economies and other benefits that could come from pooling skills and resources as man reaches farther and farther beyond his planet.” (W Star, 3/9/70)
Washington Post: “It was appropriate that President Nixon should announce his proposed plans for exploration in space on the last day in this century when a total eclipse of the sun was visible in the United States. Opportunities to make strides in learning about our universe do not come often and must be seized when they arrive. The scientists. . .did the best that could be done in Saturday’s brief moment of darkness to learn more about the forces in the sun that dominate our solar system. And the President seems to have done about the best that can be done with the resources now available to keep our space program on the right track.
“The emphasis the Administration is giving to unmanned flight activities—the commitments to launch vehicles in 1977 and 1979 for grand tours of our outermost planets are the most exciting—will test the willingness of the nation to spend huge sums on basic research. The future programs of NASA, at least for the next decade, will have little of the appeal that seized the public during the race to land men on the moon first. And the worth of these programs, in terms of knowledge they may yield about the solar system and the usefulness of that knowledge, is difficult to appreciate fully. The test in the future will be whether we are willing to pay for these probes for knowledge without the exhilarating experience of watching the first man step onto the moon’s surface, and of beating the Russians.” (W Post, 3/9/70)

•	“Grand Tour” of outer solar system was discussed by William Hines
in Chicago Sun-Times: “The grand tour idea came out of Caltech several years ago after a graduate student in Prof. Homer J. Stewart’s aeronautical engineering department calculated the added energy that could be imparted to a spacecraft by the massive gravitational fields of various planets. This information, together with the unusual configuration of outer planets in the 1980s, was patched together by Stewart into the grand tour concept. Theoretically, Stewart calculated, it should be possible to fire a spacecraft into a near-miss trajectory toward Jupiter and then let that planet, biggest in the solar system, take over. Jupiter would add energy, and hence velocity, to the spacecraft.... This would send the craft toward Saturn, where more energy would be borrowed from the ringed planet’s gravitational field, and then on to Uranus for more of the same, Neptune and finally Pluto.” (C Sun-Times, 3/9/70)

• Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, reported on international cooperation in NASA programs before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: NASA had established “sound base of extensive and successful cooperation” with over 70 countries in 1960s, entered into almost 250 agreements for international space projects, orbited foreign satellites and flown foreign experiments on U.S. spacecraft, participated in more than 500 cooperative scientific rocket soundings from sites throughout world, involved more than 50 foreign scientists in analysis of lunar samples, and provided for direct daily reception by some 50 countries of data from weather satellites. “Third” countries together spent “roughly $300 million a year on space.”
“On the aeronautics side of NASA’s responsibilities, cooperative projects with Canadian, French, German, and British agencies are contributing importantly to the development and testing of a variety of v/stol aircraft configurations.”
In experimental meteorological satellite and balloon program, Project Eole, NASA would launch French satellite to track several hundred balloons to derive global circulation of winds. Cooperative earth resources survey projects had been undertaken with Brazil and Mexico to acquaint foreign scientists and policy makers with potential of remote sensing. NASA had added earth resources disciplines to international graduate fellowship program and planned international workshop in 1971. NASA was providing technical assistance to India in aircraft survey of coconut palm blight in Kerala State so that its spread could be controlled. Agency was considering proposal to launch French synchronous meteorological satellite as joint contribution to Global Atmospheric Research Program and had met informally with ESRO and European aviation officials to consider mission requirements for possible preoperational air-traffic-control satellite system for North Atlantic.
Dr. Paine had written new letters to Soviet Academy of Sciences President Mstislav V. Keldysh and to Academician Anatoly A.

Robert C.

As we interpreted the contract, the contractor would lose some $285 million on 120 aircraft, and any smaller buy the contractor’s loss would be higher. The contractor disagreed. By his interpretation. . .he expected to make a small profit on the total program. As a consequence of budget restraints, rising costs, and an overall reappraisal of defense requirements, we have now limited the program to 81 aircraft. The program’s final cost to the Government, however, depends on resolution of the issues between the Air Force and contractor over the contract. We are still trying to work these out with Lockheed
but.. .litigation may be required. If the Air Force wins all the arguments, the 81 aircraft program will cost about $4 billion. If the contractor wins all his points, the cost will be. . .on the order of $500 million more.” It might be “several years before we know the exact outcome of this program.” (Testimony)

•	Office of Science and Technology sent to Congress The Next Decade
in Space, report of Space Science and Technology Panel of President’s Science Advisory Committee: National program for next decade in space should focus on using “space capabilities for the welfare, security, and enlightenment of all people.” Recommended goals were to contribute to Nation’s economic strength and security and expand earth-oriented research and applications of space sci-
ence and technology; explore solar system with phased program of lunar exploration, search for extraterrestrial life, and diversified planetary exploration; and use space platforms to expand knowledge of universe and basic physical laws. Panel urged that U.S. develop technology to expand capability for automated equipment controlled by man in remote location for space exploration and civil applications, reduce cost of space operations by cost reduction for expendable vehicles and payload development, strengthen biomedical basis for possible long-duration manned space flights, and encourage international cooperative programs.
Panel recommended NASA and dod continue joint study of reusable space transportation system “in the expectation that a decision can be made for a FY 1972 budget decision on an STS development program.” Design target should be replacement “of the largest possible part of the national launch vehicle stable,” including Saturn V. “We urge the deferral of a development decision on space stations more elaborate than the aap space station.. .concept until the prior availability of the STS can be'confidently anticipated.” It was “likely that some form of multiply reusable space transportation system will indeed become the most attractive major new technology development for the decade.”
Other recommendations were basic biomedical research program supplemented by 12- to 18-mo Apollo Applications flight program, to provide human factors information for more ambitious space station; possible second-generation space station to utilize sts; and earth-orbital manned space flight activity with systems using sts.

Advisory Committee panel that NASA devote more time to biomedical research: “There appear to be practical limits other than the budgetary ones on the expansion of basic studies in the manned space program. It will be a long time before astronauts on missions operate in conditions anything like those of the laboratory.” msc Director of Medical Research and Operations, Dr. Charles A. Berry, and his staff “have been responsible for establishing medical protocols for the missions, in a way that balances the need for biomedical data with operational demands and the willingness and ability of the astronauts to cooperate. Some medical procedures are tedious, unpleasant, and even humiliating, and when the work load on astronauts is heavy, data gathering has to be limited. For this reason in part, then, tension between biomedical insiders and outsiders is likely to continue. At the same time the interests of the two groups are nearer to converging than ever before.” (Walsh, Science, 3/13/70, 1469-71)
March 14: Apollo 13 Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., Thomas K. Mattingly II, and Fred W. Haise, Jr., held press conference at msc. Lovell announced final code names for lm and cm had been selected according to theme of mythology, lm would be called “Aquarius” after mythical Egyptian water carrier who brought fertility and knowledge to Nile Valley. Code name originally selected for CM— “Auriga,” for constellation Auriga—had been dropped in favor of “Odyssey,” epic Greek poem about long adventures and wanderings of Odysseus in Greek mythology. Lovell said Apollo 13 crew had “already had quite an odyssey just getting trained” for mission.
Landing of Aquarius on moon would be different from previous landings, Lovell said. Key to landing was Cone Crater on Fra Mau-ro. LM was “being targeted for a spot that we don’t want to land at,” uprange about 1/2 km from desired site; “we’re not sure of the actual height of this ridge [of Cone Crater]. . .so we’re targeting uprange to make sure we get over it.”
Reason for going to Fra Mauro was “its peculiar geologic formations there and.. .a place called the Mare Imbrium. . .a large circular basin that was formed early in the moon’s history.. .by a large impact. In the formation of this impact it made hummocky ridges, radiating outward from the center of the impact down into. . .Fra Mauro. ... Now, by going to Fra Mauro, we hope to. . .bring back some of the basin type material that was thrown out by this catastrophe.” (Transcript; upi, C Trib, 3/15/70)

Young Americans need to appreciate that what appear as unsoluble problems today are not new to man’s experience. Dr. Robert H. Goddard’s rocket artifacts and his lifelong labors should be an inspiration to each generation of youth as they grapple with their concerns of their day and their dreams of a better world of their tomorrows in a dynamic universe. This nation cannot afford not to have Robert H. Goddards in the future.”
Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator, testified: “It seems very important that we and our children after us never lose awareness of what key individuals such as Robert Goddard provided to a fuller understanding of the progress of mankind. He, like Konstantine Tsiolkovsky of Russia and Hermann Oberth of Germany, correctly theorized on the use of liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen for high-energy thrust. Based upon the liquid-hydrogen work at the Lewis Research Center, NASA developed the upper stages for the Saturn V which enabled us to achieve the Apollo missions to the moon.”

budget request to House Committee on Armed Services: U.S.S.R.’s operational icbm force outnumbered that of U.S. and, “by mid-1971, will probably exceed ours by several hundred launchers.’’ Soviets had technology to develop hard-target MIRV and “Fractional Orbit Bombardment (fobs) or depressed trajectory icbm (dicbm) may already be operational. Their new ‘swing-wing’ bomber prototype could become operational, and their submarine-launched ballistic missile force is expanding rapidly.”
U.S. continued to reduce bomber strength of Strategic Air Command. “We have phased out the B-58s, and severely cut back the FB-llls. At end FY-71, we will have fewer B-52s and 66 FB-llls. We hope to offset the reduced strength by increasing the capability of our bombers with the Short Range Attack Missile (sram) and the Subsonic Cruise Armed Decoy (scad) and providing for increased prelaunch survivability through satellite basing and improved warning.” In last five years, “we have cut our active interceptor strength by two-thirds and our radars by one-half.

•	Nixon Administration was reviewing need for Government program
to stockpile helium, Science reported. Program, “which provides for extracting helium from streams of natural gas and storing it underground for future use, has recently been running at a huge deficit.” Scientists were worried that Administration might allow squandering of “priceless natural resource that may be desperately needed by future generations.” Helium had unique properties “for which there is no real substitute in high-technology applications.” Largest use was “as a purging and pressurizing agent in liquid-fueled rockets.” Helium also was expected to play key role in development of nuclear reactors, lasers and masers, magnetohydro-damics, and superconducting cables for electric power.
Threat to supply lay in use of natural gas as domestic fuel. Unless helium was extracted first, it was passed into atmosphere when natural gas was burned. Federal Government had begun conservation program in 1960. (Boffey, Science, 3/20/70, 1593-6; Budget of the U.S. Government, FY1971, 357)

more energy than can be accounted for by known physical processes.” New theories discussed seemed “to bring two trends to the surface. First is the idea that a collection of discrete sources helps get around the severe limitations placed on the size of the radiating object and may help account for the random variability observed in the emission of many extragalactic objects. Second, the idea that many collections of matter may be expanding seems to be making a small dent in the long-held view that all objects are condensing from a homogeneous universe.” (Holcomb, Science, 3/20/70, 1601-3)
March 21: Theory that helped to explain source of uncontrolled malignant growth and indicated short cuts to development of chemical countermeasures against cancer was described by LaRC biophysicist Clarence D. Cone, Jr., at 12th Annual Science Writers Seminar of American Cancer Society in San Antonio, Tex. Theory proposed that division of body cells was controlled precisely by pattern of ion concentrations on surface tissue of cells. Pattern was formed by electrical voltage that normally existed across cellular surfaces and varied from one part of body to another. Theory provided explanation of functional connection between two major pathological features of cancer—uncontrolled growth of cells and spread of disease in body—and implied that basic functional aberrancy producing both conditions lay in alteration of molecular structure of cell surface. Theory proposed central mechanism for control of body cell division, which, if proved valid, would provide new basis for research progress on key biomedical problems, such as human conception, birth defects, growth, aging, and cancer.

•	l/g John W. O’Neill (usaf), afsc Vice Commander, testified on status
of F-lll aircraft before Senate Committee on Government Operations’ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. USAF investigation of Dec. 22, 1969, crash that had killed two pilots near Nellis afb, Nev., had shown “structural failure of the left wing occurred at very low altitude, during a normal dive recovery after a routine delivery of air-to-ground ordnance. Although the aircrew escape module performed as it was designed, time between ejection and ground impact did not allow the recovery chute to open.” Metallurgical flaw, “somewhat like an ultra-thin hairline crack, existed in the lower plate of the wing pivot fitting.” In addition to usaf investigations, special ad hoc committee of Air Force Scientific Advisory Board had reviewed findings and technical data. “We have concluded that the flaw was introduced at a subcontractor facility at some point during the manufacture of the lower plate. ...”
No modifications to present structure were planned but structural inspections of all F-llls would “utilize improved ultrasonic inspection techniques and procedures developed as a direct result of this problem.” Program would cost estimated $31.2 million. First aircraft were to be completed and returned to flight status in June 1970. All aircraft should be restored by shortly after first of year. (Testimony)

•	In first public appearance since assuming duties at NASA Hq. as Depu-
March 3): Explorer I. first U.S. satellite (launched Jan. 31. 1958), reentered the atmosphere over the South Pacific after completing 58 408 revolutions and traveling 2.67 billion kilometers (1.66 billion miles) during its 13-year lifetime. To celebrate the launch. Vice President Richard M. Nixon visited Jet Propulsion Laboratory Feb. 17. 1958. Examining the spacecraft model with him (left to right above) were Dr. Clark B. Millikan. Director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Cal Tech: Dr. Lee A. Du Bridge, President of CalTech: Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of JPl; Dr. Jack E. Froehlich. Explorer Project Director at JPL; V, C. Larsen, Jr., Laboratory Administrator at ipl: and Robert J. Parks, Chief of JPl. Guidance Control Division.
ty Associate Administrator for Planning, Dr, Wernher von Braun held press conference on NASA planning procedures: Skylab program would consist of four flights. First would be an unmanned flight boosted by two-stage Saturn V—only first and second stage, with third stage replaced by orbital workshop, now called Skylab.
“It will be this country’s first orbital space station. Attached to this Skylab is an airlock module, and a multiple docking adapter, to which arriving command and service modules can dock for crew exchange. And ajso attached to it is the ATM.. .a manned solar observatory that will be serviced by the people living in the Skylab. One day after this Skylab has been launched into orbit and has deployed its solar panels, both on the ATM and the Skylab itself, it will be visited by a Saturn IB-launched command and service module, bringing the first crew complement of three. The command module will dock to the multiple docking adapter, the crew will slip through the docking adapter and the airlock, into the workshop. . . . And the men will stay up there for 28 days.” Crew would then “crawl back into their command module, detach.. .use the service module to
deboost themselves, and the command module will reenter the ocean and make a normal Apollo landing.
“About three months after the first flight, another flight will go up, and this time the crew stay.. .will be extended to 56 days. ... And finally, there will be a third revisit, again of 56 days, after which the third crew will descend. The Skylab will then go into storage and can potentially be reactivated any time thereafter if more revisits are planned.”
Even without budget restraints, it would be “something like 1977 before we could have a [space] shuttle flying.”
NASA was “in continuous touch with the Air Force” in space shuttle and space station field. “The armed forces. . .have the duty to look into everything that may have a defense aspect; and so it is entirely proper that they want to understand the ramifications of space.” (Transcript)

During March: Dr. James A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa Director of Physics and Astronomy Depts., discussed significance of lunar landings, in university lecture series: “The Apollo missions, to me, are straightforward though immensely difficult tasks. They do, however, yield relatively little in the way of fundamental understanding of nature. They are not scientific in that sense. There is a longstanding controversy as to whether a manned spacecraft is a better way to conduct science in space than an automated, commandable spacecraft. I’m sure there is no simple answer to that question. As the general romance and entertainment value of manned flight tend to wear off a little, I think this question will be attacked in a thoroughly pragmatic way.” Apollo 11 lunar landing “might properly be compared to the explorations of Amundsen and Perry and Byrd in the Arctic and Antarctic, or perhaps Lindbergh flying the Atlantic. These
are great achievements, heroic achievements, but the general potential of the Moon in its relationship to human life on a large scale is by no means obvious to me. I don’t think any competent person has found a significant, economic, human use fortheMoon.” There was general feeling, mostly from aeronautics and allied industries, that development of space flight was important to U.S. future in same sense that aircraft development had been. “I think this is fundamentally a false analogy.” Space shuttle and space station were feasible. “Whether or not it is sensible to pursue them, I have a great difficulty in judging.” (Univ of Iowa Spectator, 3/70,6)
•	aiaPresident Karl G. Harr, Jr., said in Aerospace Technology: “In
terms of its scope and novelty no single enterprise matches man’s landing on the moon—the Apollo program. Nor has any other enterprise in history broker* so much new technical ground. The technical and managerial ingredients of these space accomplishments, as well as of comparable national security programs, are available for broader applications in the nation’s service. The problem is how to harness them effectively for such purposes. The Apollo program centered on a clearly stated goal with adequate funding for its attainment. Because it represented achievement of a national goal, lines of authority and responsibility were clear, simple and strong. Our nation’s environmental problems, however, often do not enjoy such clear delineations. . . . The greatest need is for the development of innovative means to overcome such constraints so that technology’s revolutionary new tools can be more effectively applied to the pressing needs of our society. . . . The transfer of aerospace technology to domestic areas is underway and is already making significant contributions.”

•	Space shuttle mission capabilities were described by LeRoy E. Day ,
Manager of Space Shuttle Task Group in NASA omsf, in paper presented at aiaa Conference on Test Effectiveness in the 70s at Palo Alto, Calif.: “It is envisioned that the shuttle will eventually repjace essentially all of the present day launch vehicles or their derivatives except for very small vehicles of the Scout class and the Saturn V. This will be possible because low operational costs of the reusable shuttle will make it competitive even if it carries only a fraction of its full payload capability on particular missions. In addition to the low launch costs, we expect the benign acoustic and acceleration environment of the shuttle to allow significant reductions in the cost of payloads. Acceleration during descent and reentry will be less than 3 g’s. Payload design will be further aided by allowing greater volume and weight for many payloads because of the shuttle cargo bay accommodations. Preliminary analyses indicate reductions in payload development costs of 25-30 percent may be expected.” (Text)

April 8: Nimbus IV (Nimbus-D) meteorological satellite was successfully launched by NASA from wtr by long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor
(THORAD)-Agena D booster. Launch was 400th for USAF’S Thor booster. Satellite entered orbit with 1098.0-km (682.4-mi) apogee, 1087.2-km (675.7-mi) perigee, 107.1-min period, and 99.9° inclination.
USA’s Topo I first in new series of topographic satellites to be used with equipment modified from USA’s SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) program, was carried as secondary payload on Agena D 2nd stage. Topo I was ejected into orbit with 1092-km (678.5-mi) apogee, 1085-km (674.2-mi) perigee, 107-min period, and 99.8° inclination, where it would investigate new technique for accurate, real-time determination of positions on earth’s surface.
Primary objectives for Nimbus IV were to acquire sufficient number of global samples of atmospheric radiation measurements for comparing vertical-temperature, water-vapor, and ozone profiles and to provide basis for comparing merits of at least three of five spectrometric experiments on board. As secondary objectives spacecraft would demonstrate feasibility of determining wind-velocity fields by tracking multiple balloons and demonstrate satisfactory operation of advanced modular three-axis attitude-control system for six months.
Nimbus IV carried nine meteorological experiments: three new (backscatter uv spectrometer, filter wedge spectrometer, and selective chopper radiometer) and six carried on previous Nimbus missions (infrared interferometer spectrometer; satellite infrared spectrometer; interrogation, recording, and location system; temperature and humidity infrared radiometer; image-dissector camera system; and monitor of uv solar energy). Spacecraft’s new attitude-control system stabilized Nimbus IV constantly pointing toward earth within 1° accuracy and permitted initial acquisition and reacquisition of earth from any attitude.
Butterfly-shaped, 675.2-kg (1488.6-lb) Nimbus IV was fifth in series of seven spacecraft designed to explore and collect data for understanding nature and development of atmosphere and for reduction of economic impact of adverse weather on all nations.

•	Interview on Apollo 13 cuisine with msc chief of food and nutrition
Dr. Malcolm Smith, Jr., was published by New York Times. Increased use of spoons, use of bowls, and facilities for spreading sandwich fillings on slices of fresh bread would provide Apollo 13 astronauts more nearly normal eating procedures than on previous missions. Freeze-dried pork and scalloped potatoes would contain chunks rather than be of baby food consistency but meal would still be lukewarm. Wider variety of fresh bread had been baked for Apollo 13 mission, in lidded pans to provide uniform crust as insurance against loose crumbs which had been problem with former freeze-dried cracker sandwiches. Loaves were passed through 1900 K (3000°F) flame to destroy all mold-producing spores. Two slices of bread made from irradiated flour would be carried to test potential alternate method of preserving food without refrigeration. Apollo 13’s food was 70% freeze-dried, mainly because of space limitation; bread was treated with nitrogen gas to retard staling. Other “firsts” in foods to be carried were pecans to stimulate astronauts’ appetites, dehydrated orange crystals modified to prevent caking, and instant rice product to be reconstituted by hot tap water.
Dr. Smith was already planning for 120-day Skylab missions, when hot food would be welcomed. Major obstacle was difficulty in heating food at zero g. He hoped to place test heating device aboard Apollo 14. (Hewitt, NYT, 4/8/70, 51)

II: “As the astronauts get ready to soar to the heights, it is worth mentioning that a group of aquanauts have sunk to the bottoms—in this case, the crew of Tektite II.... The drama of undersea exploration is considerably less than probes into outer space; but, in many ways, the world on the floor of the sea is more mysterious, more
demanding—and potentially richer in what it offers mankind—than anything on the craterscape of the moon.” (WPost, 4/10/70, A18) April 11-17: NASA’s Apollo 13 (AS-508)—carrying three-man crew, LM-7 Aquarius and CSM-I090dyssey—was launched on lunar landing mission, but 56 hrs into flight toward moon mission was aborted because of SM oxygen tank rupture. In most serious inflight situation experienced in manned space program, crew foljowed lm “lifeboat” emergency plan, transferring to lm and using its systems and supplies to swing around moon and back to earth on fastest feasible course. Emergency procedures were used to make electrical power, water, and oxygen last to end of journey. Crew returned to CM and jettisoned lm before reentry and splashed down safely in Pacific April 17.
April 11-12: Mission began with successful, on-schedule liftoff from KSC Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at 2:13 pm EST April 11, carrying Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr. (commander), John L. Swigert, Jr. (cm pilot), and Fred W. Haise, Jr. (lm pilot). Swigert was last-minute substitution from backup crew for Thomas K. Mattingly II, who had failed to develop immunity after exposure to German measles. Launch was watched by 4500 persons in vip stands. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, and Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, watched from ksc firing Room No. 1. Weather conditions at launch were satisfactory: peak ground winds of 10 knots, overcast at 6000 m (20 000 ft), and visibility of 16 km (10 mi).
Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with
185.5-km (115.3-mi) apogee and 181.5-km (112.8-mi) perigee. During 2nd-stage boost S-II center engine cut off 132 secs early and remaining four engines burned 34 secs longer than predicted. Space vehicle velocity after boost was 68 m per sec (223 fps) lower than planned, causing S-IVB orbital insertion burn to be 9 secs longer than predicted, but sufficient propellants remained for translunar insertion. Onboard TV was initiated at 1:35 GET for 5 1/2 min. Second S-IVB burn, on schedule at 2:41 get, injected spacecraft on translunar trajectory.
csm separated from S-IVB and lm Aquarius. Onboard TV initiated after separation for 72 min clearly showed csm “hard-docking” with lm, ejection of csm/lm from S-IVB/IU at 4:01 get, S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system (aps) evasive maneuver, and spacecraft exterior and interior.
First S-IVB APS burn, lasting 217 secs beginning at 6:00 GET, aimed stage for lunar target point so accurately that second burn was not required. S-IVB/IU hit lunar surface at 77:57 GET (8:10 pm est April 14) at 259 m per sec (8465 fps) and energy equivalent to 11.5 tons of tnt at 2.4° south latitude and 27.9° west longitude— 137.1 km (85.2 mi) from Apollo 12 seismometer that detected impact. Seismic signal for S-IVB/IU was similar to signal from Apollo 12 lm Intrepid that had impacted moon Nov. 20, 1969, but was 20-30 times larger and lasted 3 hrs 20 mins—four times longer. Signal was so large that ground command had to reduce seismometer gain to keep recording on scale. Suprathermal ion detector experiment (side) deployed by Apollo 12 crew recorded jump in the number of ion counts after S-IVB/IU impact. Instrument, in lunar shadow,
April 11-17: Apollo 13, launched toward moon from Kennedy Space Center by Saturn V (left), was aborted 56 hours into flight by the rupture of a service module oxygen tank. Astronauts transferred to lm in an emergency “lifeboat” plan and used its systems and supplies to return to earth without landing on the moon. The severely damaged SM (above) was photographed from the LM/csf following jettison just before earth reentry. An entire panel was blown away by tbe explosion.
recorded no ions at time of impact; count increased from few ions 22 secs after impact to 250 and up to 2500 before decreasing to few ions and back to none. Scientists speculated ionization had been produced by 6300 K to 10 300 K (6000°C to 10 000°C) temperatures generated by impact or that particles that reached up to 60 km (37 mi) had been ionized by sunlight.
Translunar insertion maneuver was so accurate that midcourse correction No. 1 (MCC-1) was not necessary. MCC-2, for 3.4 secs at 30:14 get, placed spacecraft on desired hybrid circumlunar trajectory with closest approach of 114.9 km (71.4 mi). MCC-3 was not necessary. Good-quality TV coverage of preparations for and performance of midcourse maneuver was transmitted for 49 min, beginning at 30:03 GET, including dumping waste water from spacecraft fuel cells with moon visible in background.
While joking with Mission Control, Swigert suddenly remembered that he had failed to file his Federal income tax return, but was assured that he could be granted an extension.
April 13-14: Lovell and Haise entered lm for housekeeping and system checks, reported that helium tank that had malfunctioned before launch was satisfactory, transmitted TV pictures of lm interior, and joked about sleeping and eating in space. Haise reported he had shaved to improve his TV image. Lovell closed telecast by wishing everyone on earth “a nice evening,” saying astronauts were ready “to get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey.” Minutes later, at 55:55 get (10:08 pm est April 13), crew reported undervoltage alarm on csm main bus B, rapid loss of pressure in SM oxygen tank No. 2, and dropping of current in fuel cells 1 and 3 to zero.
“Hey, we’ve got a problem here,” Swigert told ground controllers.
“This is Houston, say again please.”
“Houston, we’ve had a problem,” Lovell replied. And Haise reported “a pretty large bang associated with the caution and warning.
A few minutes later crew reported spacecraft was venting something—later determined to be oxygen—out into space. Astronauts could see blizzard of particles flying out of sm, presumably from ruptured tank. Despite desperate efforts improvised on board and suggested by Mission Control, nothing seemed to halt drop in oxygen pressure. Spacecraft dipped repeatedly, apparently because of venting gas. By 57:24 get, Mission Control reported tank No. 2 pressure was “slowly going to zero and we’re starting to think about the lm lifeboat.” Swigert replied, “Yes, that’s something we’re thinking about, too. We’ve been talking it over. ...” Decision was made to abort mission.
Astronauts hurriedly had to salvage enough oxygen to supply CM during reentry and keep gyros operating until lm navigation equipment could be powered up. With only minutes of power remaining, crew fed oxygen into reserve tank and hooked up emergency batteries to csm navigation gyros until lm was powered up. Crew activated lm, powered down csm, and used lm systems for power and life support.
Astronauts remained calm as they wrestled with procedures to stabilize spacecraft and stretch consumables. All information on

mission—including details of accident and emergency procedures— were made public immediately as data were received, Public’s apparent boredom at beginning of mission was transformed into deep concern for astronauts’ safety. Messages and offers of aid were sent to U.S, from world leaders and prayers were offered by religious leaders on every continent.
MCC-4 was conducted with lm’s descent propulsion system (dps) at 61:30 GET, placing Apolio 13 on free-return trajectory around moon on which CM Otfyssey would splash down in Indian Ocean at 152:00 GET. Both lm guidance systems were powered up and primary system used for 263.4-sec dps burn at 79:28 get as spacecraft swung out from behind moon, two hours after closest approach. Bum produced 262-m-per-sec (860 fps) differential velocity, shortened predicted return time to 143:53 GET, and moved predicted landing point to mid-Pacific. After maneuver, passive thermal control was established and lm was powered down to conserve consumables.
“Aquarius has really been quite a winner,” Haise said to Mission Control about three hours later. “When this flight’s all over we’li really be able to figure out what a LM can do.”
During remainder of transearth coast crew continued emergency procedures to deal with shortage of water to cool LM electronic systems, decreasing temperatures in both cabins, and buildup of carbon dioxide in lm. Fearing that CM instruments needed for reentry might freeze, crew kept spacecraft in passive thermal control—“barbecue mode” of rotation to let sun uniformly heat all sides, Astronauts met cooling water shortage by filling every plastic bag they could with water from CM and carrying it to lm. Shortage of air-cleaning lithium hydroxide in LM was met by rigging combination of cm and lm cartridges; following instructions worked out on ground, crew built adapter and ran lunar spacesuit air hoses from LM fans through tunnel to connect to cm air-scrubbing canisters. Transmission of health data was eliminated and communications held to minimum to conserve electricity. Crew tried to keep warm by wearing boots carried for walking on moon, sleeping in narrow tunnel between LM and CSM that seemed warmer, and wearing extra clothing.

mal conditions. Because of unusual spacecraft configuration (with LM still attached) and LM’s inability to survive reentry heat, officials on ground developed new reentry procedures and verified them in ground-based simulations. A 30-man team at MIT’s Charles S. Draper Laboratory worked throughout night studying stressed Apollo 13 guidance system and working out new trajectories. Simulations and programming of emergency problems were conducted by NR engineers in Downey, Calif., by Astronaut Richard F. Gordon, Jr., in LM at KSC, and by Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan and David R. Scott at msc, so that almost every move Apollo 13 crew made had first been proved out on ground.
MCC-7 was successfully accomplished at 137:40 get with 22.4-sec LM RCSburn, resulting in predicted -6.49° entry-flight-path angle. Crew viewed and photographed SM when it was jettisoned at 138:02 get, reporting that one entire panel was missing near S-band high-gain antenna and that great deal of debris was hanging out.
CM was powered up and lm was jettisoned at 141:30 get. SNAP-27 nuclear generator carrying 3.9 kg (8.6 lbs) of radioactive plutonium fell from lm into Pacific northeast of New Zealand.
“Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you,” Mission Control responded to spacecraft’s report “lm jettison.” “She sure was a good ship,” Swigert added later.
Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned and Odyssey splashed down in mid-Pacific southeast of American Samoa at 142:54 get (1:07 pm est April 17), 6.4 km (4 mi) from recovery ship U.S.S. Iwo Jima. Astronauts—exhausted but in good health—were picked up by recovery helicopter and were safely aboard recovery ship less than one hour after splashdown.
Primary Apollo 13 mission objectives—to make selenological inspection, survey, and sampling of materials in preselected Fra Mauro area; deploy and activate ALSEP; develop man’s capability to work in lunar environment; and photograph candidate exploration sites—were not achieved. Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, announced April 17 that Apollo 13 Review Board, headed by LaRC Director Edgar M. Cortright, would be established to determine cause of accident.
Apollo 13 flight crew performance was outstanding throughout mission; calm, precise reaction to emergency and diligence in configuring and maintaining lm was noteworthy. Despite lack of adequate sleep and low temperature in spacecraft, neither performance nor spirits faltered. Similarly, performance of flight operations team was outstanding in planning and aiding crew to safe return.

•	Editorial comment as damaged Apollo 13 attempted safe return to
earth:
New York Times: “An emergency in a space craft on the voyage between earth and moon was bound to occur sometime. The enormous hazards of the long journey through the most hostile of environments, the ever present possibility of failure by one or more of the millions of components contained in an Apollo vehicle, the ubiquitous threat of human error, all these combine in lunar flights to make them the most dangerous expeditions human beings have ever undertaken. In retrospect, the remarkable fact is not that such ominous peril has arisen in the now-aborted trip of Apollo 13, but that the actually hazardous trips to the moon and back by Apollos 8, 10, 11, and 12 were accomplished in safety.” (NYT, 4/15/70)
Washington Post: “Lindbergh gave up a continent, as the astronauts gave up a planet, because he had measured the risks and found them reasonable, for all the possibility of disaster lurking around the corner—it does so every day for men and nations. So if we are going to apply the glories, we must confront the dangers along the way. All we can do now, as that unlikely looking craft limps back from the moon, is to hope that the men who ride in it and the men in Houston who guide it can find what Lindbergh found. ‘Somewhere in an unknown recess of my mind,’ he wrote T’ve discovered that my ability rises and falls with the essential problems that confront me. What I can do depends largely on what I have to do to stay alive and on course.’ ” (WPost, 4/15/70)
Baltimore Sun: “The safety record of the Apollo program has, except for one hideous ground accident, been a perfect one. Perhaps we have too easily assumed that therefore all expeditions would begin and end without serious and unforseen breakdown, without the torments of suspense when the line between splendid accomplishment and bitter tragedy is drawn very fine. The truth is, of course, that exploration, especially in a realm new to man, can never be free of deadly hazards. But the astronauts and the men associated with them in their ventures have always known it.” It was clear astronauts were equal to emergency, “but they remain at the mercy of machinery which in some still unexplained way has failed them. The rest of us can only wait from desperate hour to hour, trusting that superlative skill, universal hope and fervent prayers will prevail over cruel chance.” (B Sun, 4/15/70)

April 17:	President Nixon issued statement following safe return of
Apollo 13 astronauts: “From the beginning, man’s ventures into space have been accompanied by danger. Apollo 13 reminds us how real those dangers are. . .of the special qualities of the men who dare to brave the perils of space. It testifies, also, to the extraordinary concert of skills, in space and on the ground, that goes into a moon mission. To the astronauts, a relieved Nation says ‘Welcome home.’ To them and to those on the ground who did so magnificent a job of guiding Apollo 13 safely back from the edge of eternity, a grateful Nation says ‘Well done.’ ”
In proclamation designating April 19 as national day of prayer and thanksgiving for safe return of Apollo 13 astronauts, President said: “The imperiled flight and safe return of the crew of Apollo 13 were events that humbled and inspired people all over the world. We were humbled by the knowledge that in this stage of man’s exploration of space, a safe splashdown of an imperiled mission is in its way as successful as a landing on and safe return from the Moon. We were inspired by the courage of the crew, the devotion and skill of the members of the NASA team on the ground and by the offers of assistance from nations around the world.”
President spoke with Apollo 13 astronauts by telephone from White House to U.S.S. Iwo Jima in Pacific. He told them he would like to present them the Presidential Medal of Freedom in Hawaii on following day. President then announced intentions at White House press briefing. He would go “first to Houston, where we will pick up the two wives, and then go on to Hawaii. .. .what these men have done has been a great inspiration to all of us. I think also what the men on the ground have done is an inspiration to us. How men react in adversity determines their true greatness, and these men
have demonstrated that the American character is sound and strong and capable of taking a very difficult situation and turning it into a very successful venture. .. in recognition, also, of the men on the ground, I am going to present the Medal of Freedom tomorrow in Houston. . . to the Apollo 13 crew on the ground who have made these very difficult decisions on the spot, decisions that had to be right.” (PD, 4/20/70, 538-40; Text)
•	NASA held series of three Apollo 13 post-recovery press conferences
at msc hosted by NASA Administrator, manned space flight officials,' and technical specialists. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, said although mission “must be recorded as a failure, there’s never been a more prideful moment in the space program.” Most impressive aspect of mission was “tremendous effectiveness in team work of our ground support operation .... From every state . . . we’ve had people. . . working to backstop the many different system decisions that had to be systematically and methodically faced up to and made. . . . The Flight Operations Directors . . . certainly demonstrated that flight controllers can operate under these very adverse conditions. They’ve been able to do things in a far shorter period of time than we’d ever thought possible be-1 fore.”	’
Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said basic procedures used for every phase of mission were predetermined. “For example, the burn made behind the moon . . . was a standard emergency burn that would be used in case the service propulsion system would not work on a normal lunar mission going into lunar orbit. Each one of these steps had been predetermined and also simulated. But putting them all together into a sequence of steps . . . and working out some of the detailed procedures on how to save power and how to save batteries; how to save water; those things were determined during the course of the flight, both by the men ... on the ground and by the astronauts.” (Transcript)

O.	Paine, and Astronaut Frank Borman there. Collins and Anders had set up “squawk box” into Mission Control outside President’s office and briefed President and his staff on developments. President’s chief concerns had been CM-SM separation, and crew’s safety and physical condition. Collins said, “The fact that we had this incident really changes very little. We have always known that such a situation could develop and he [President] does not feel that it should unduly cloud the future when it comes to space exploration.” (Transcript)

the mission.’ ” President told group, “After what happened this tumultuous week, let’s not take American wealth and strength for granted. . .where machines failed, we had to turn to man, and man came through.” President said it had been “proudest day of my life and in the life of the country.” Vice President Spiro T. Agnew said “social levelers of the New Left” would seize on Apollo 13 neardisaster to demand space budget be “soaked down into the nearest slum.” It would be “shortsighted tragic blunder” to heed warnings of “fair weather friends” of space program who were “readying the life-boats for a quick exit.” (Hope, W Star, 4/18/70, A2)

Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, MSC Director, observed that mission had not been complete failure. Spacecraft had gone around moon—feat that would have caused sensation two years before. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, said later in day, “I’m a little tired and bedraggled but I’m feeling 10 or 20 years younger than I did yesterday.”
In New York, thousands watched recovery on giant TV screen at Grand Central Terminal. Loud applause sounded when capsule appeared in sky, at splashdown, and when astronauts appeared. Hot dog stand operator at Vanderbilt Ave. and 47th Street assured pas-sersby, “It’s all right.” Long strands of multicolored ticker tape and bushels of confetti poured from skyscraper windows. At City Hall, Mayor John V. Lindsay said, “Now they are safely back and New Yorkers join with men everywhere in saying’welcome home.’”
Church bells pealed throughout Nation. Traffic came to standstill in Indianapolis, Los Angeles reported no crime for brief period, and dice stopped rolling in Las Vegas briefly.

Mission Operations team at MSC. Citation read: “We often speak of scientific ‘miracles’—forgetting.. .that these are the product of hard work, long hours and disciplined intelligence. The men and women of the Apollo mission operations team performed such a miracle, transforming potential tragedy into one of the most dramatic rescues of all time. Years of intense preparation made this rescue possible. The skill, coordination and performance under pressure of the mission operations team made it happen. Three brave astronauts are alive and on Earth because of their dedication, and because at the critical moments the people of that team were wise enough and self-
fiossessed enough to make the right decisions. This extraordinary eat is a tribute to man’s ingenuity, to his resourcefulness and to his courage.” Award was accepted by Sigurd A. Sjoberg, Director of Flight Operations, on behalf of himself, Glynn S. Lunney, Milton L. Windier, Gerald D. Griffin, and Eugene F. Kranz. Following award cereriiony President and Mrs. Nixon left Houston for Honolulu with Apollo 13 astronauts’ wives, Mrs. James A. Lovell, Jr., Mrs. Fred W. Haise, Jr., and parents of bachelor astronaut, John L. Swigert, Jr.
In Honolulu, President Nixon presented Presidential Medal of Freedom to Apollo 13 astronauts. He said in part: “we have received over 100 messages from foreign governments—from the Soviet Union, from Poland, other countries behind the Iron Curtain, from countries in the free world. This is truly a welcome from all the people of the world to three very brave men.” Citation on each medal read: “Adversity brings out the character of a man. Confronted suddenly and unexpectedly with grave peril in the far reaches of space, he demonstrated a calm courage and quiet heroism that stand as an example to men everywhere. His safe return is a triumph of the human spirit—of those special qualities of man himself we rely on when machines fail, and that we rely on also for those things that machines cannot do.
“From the start, the exploration of space has been hazardous adventure. The voyage of Apollo 13 dramatized its risks. The men of Apollo 13, by their poise and skill under the most intense kind of pressure, epitomized the character that accepts danger and surmounts it. Theirs is the spirit that built America. With gratitude and admiration, America salutes their spirit and their achievement.” (PD, 4/27/70,548-50)

New York Times: “Only in a formal sense, Apollo 13 will go into history as a failure . . . Apollo 13’s booster rocket was sent crashing into the moon on schedule, and that did produce some useful and important scientific data. But in a larger sense, Apollo 13’s flight was enormously productive. The emergency which so gravely endangered its crew turned this flight into a crucial—though unintended— experiment in space rescue .... The lessons learned from this near-disaster will help save spacefarers who are still unborn. And Apollo 13’s ordeal must raise more insistently than ever the question of creating an international space rescue organization with the rockets, crews, and other necessities required to give aid to distressed travelers in space.” (NYT, 4/18/70)
Cleveland Plain Dealer: “The very real triumph of Apollo 13, the successful return of a crippled craft, could help the United States space program. What NASA can learn from its inquiry into the cause of the accident could further advance space science and technology —and safety. Certainly further evaluation of the space program’s timetable is in order. But man learns from his failures as well as from his spectacular achievements.” (C Plain Dealer, 4/18/70)
New York News: “President Nixon has very fittingly proclaimed tomorrow a day of national thanksgiving. And with that attended to, the U.S. space research and exploration program should proceed full-speed ahead, with special reference to more manned moon shots, and the sooner the better. To falter or fail now would be. . .unworthy of Americans or America.” (NY News, 4/18/70)
Nature: “One of the striking features of the past days has been the sheer competence of the people who have been concerned on the ground as well as in the sky. As always, NASA has put on a good show, and there is more to this than the mere capacity to keep a stiff upper lip or even to diminish real dangers.” NASA had functioned “superbly” during daring exploits. “A part of the secret has been that there have been enough men on hand to think of everything, or
nearly everything. Another has been the logic of the planning.” Conduct of Apollo would be “monument to the way in which pure reason can accelerate complicated technical developments. Nothing decided in the next few months should diminish the importance of this brilliant demonstration. Those who are inclined to complain that there had been an accident should, rather, wonder why it has not happened before.” (Nature, 4/18/70* 197)

Washington Post: “The footprints are still imperishably graven on the lunar dust and the flag still flies on the surface of the moon, but it all seems more distant, unreal and unattainable now. The loud bang that rocked Apollo 13 and echoed back to us from outer space last week did more than challenge our comfortable assumptions about manned space flight. It reminded us how much we have taken for granted, how much has been achieved and how far man has yet to go.” (WPost, 4/19/70, Bl)
Washington Sunday Star: “. . .men, the world over, instinctively recognize the metaphysical importance of the reach into space. Lovell, Haise, and Swigert were not just three Americans on a dangerous mission. They, and those who will follow, are ambassadors of life to new, unknown regions. The success of these first halting steps into space has brought a new vision to a slightly weary world and given mankind a new pride in its humanity. It is a gift without price. It is an offering that must not be withdrawn because of a momentary setback and a dramatic demonstration of the dangers that have always been present.” (W Star, 4/19/70)
Philadelphia Sunday Bulletin: “Of all the machines man has made to plumb the depths of space, surely none has served him better or more faithfully in desperate circumstances [than the LM].

•	Max Lerner described reactions to Apollo 13 accident in Philadelphia
Evening Bulletin: “What was I doing, glued to the TV screen like a zombie with the blood drained out me .. .? What was wrong with me—and with millions of others? ... we had all played the game of apathy up to that moment. . . confident that Apollo 13 was just one more sure-thing deployment of what man already proved he can do. The flight reports had to compete for newspaper space and, in some newspapers, were slipping into the inside pages.” After news of oxygen tank explosion “astronauts were no longer either three invincible heroes or three stooges for ‘the Establishment,’ but simply three human beings caught in space a quarter-million miles from home .... Through the plight of our proxies ... we caught a glimpse of how perilous man’s whole enterprise is, how tragic, in fact, his whole existence is in this shaky cosmos that runs by laws until you hit the unexplainable.”
Apollo 13 was “a tiny, mobile version of the earth, with a power failure and the shortage of water and a danger of polluted air and the erratic fortunes of communicating and the image of three men having to read their instruments with a flashlight in the darkness of the cabin.” (P Bull, 4/20/70)
•	Apollo 13 editorials:
National Observer: “At a time when Americans were becoming bored with successful flights to the moon, the ordeal of Apollo 13 reminded the nation of the dangers and difficulties of space. But because of courage, care, and uncommon resourcefulness—because, in fact, of history’s most dramatic field expedient—the astronauts made their way safely back to earth. The first walk on the moon was a wonder of wonders, but the return of Apollo 13 was the gladdest moment of them all.” (National Observer, 4/20/70)
Wall Street Journal: “Assuming all feasible precautions are taken, then, the issue of death potential should not really be a major factor in assessing the space program, and particularly the very costly moon program. That program should be judged on whether any gains from it are proportionate to the totality of its costs. Some scientists and laymen believe the costs are disproportionate. At any rate, that is the proper criterion for weighing the future of space exploration, not the admitted and awesome danger of death in eternal orbit.” (WSJ, 4/20/70)

between U.S. and U.S.S.R. efforts in nuclear weapons field at AP annual luncheon in New York: From 1965 to 1967 U.S.S.R. had more than tripled its inventory of strategic offensive nuclear weapon launchers—from 500 to 1700, including 200 heavy bombers—and quadrupled total megatonnage in its strategic offensive force. U.S. in same period had not increased established level of 1710 strategic nuclear missile launchers, had reduced heavy bomber strength of 780 by over 200, and had reduced megatonnage by more than 40%. “Except for the minimum ‘hedge’ that safeguard will provide, we have not responded to the Soviet strategic offensive buildup with new deployment programs. We did not respond in past years because the United States deliberately chose to assume that the Soviet buildup was aimed at achieving a deterrent posture comparable to that of the United States. We have not responded this year because. . .we fervently hope that salt can render such a response unnecessary.” (Text)
April 20-24: American Geophysical Union held annual meeting in Washington, D.C.
Cal Tech physicist Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg said detailed studies of Apollo 12 moon rocks had shown preliminary estimates of their age to be off by some 800 million yrs. Evidence from Apollo 11 and 12 lunar sample studies indicated moon—and possibly earth and some major planets—had at least one period of sustained turbulence, lasting about 300 million yrs and beginning some billion years
after moon and rest of solar system originated. Solar system was estimated to be 4.6 billion yrs old. At news conference following meeting, Dr. Wasserburg said he uid collaborator, Cal Tech physicist Dr. D. A. Papanastassiou, had found age of lava-born Apollo 12 rocks to be 3.4billion yrs, rather than preliminary estimate of 2.6 billion yrs. Apollo 11 rocks were found to be 3.65 billion yrs old. Evidence indicated both areas of moon had been formed from same sustained process lasting some 300 million yrs. There was “widespread outpouring” of lava over sea regions of moon about 3.5 billion yrs ago.

April21: Apollo 13 Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr., and Fred W. Haise, Jr., described their initial reaction to Apollo 13 accident to press at msc. Lovell explained: “Fred was still in the lunar module, Jack was back in the command module in the left-hand seat, and I was halfway in between the lower equipment bay.. .when all three of us heard a rather large bang, just one bang. Now, before that, Fred. . .had actuated a valve which nominally gives us the same sound. . .so when this bang came we really didn’t get concerned right away, but I looked up at Fred and Fred had that expression like it wasn’t his fault, and we suddenly realized that something else had occurred, but exactly what we didn’t know.”
Swigert said he had felt vibration accompanying bang and then noticed master alarm and main bus B undervolt light. “I transmitted to Houston that we had a problem and proceeded to. . .look at the voltage. . .[which] at that time was completely normal. . ..” Swigert thought bang had occurred in LM and Haise, in lm, thought it had occurred in cm.
Lovell said his first impression was “that we had had an electrical problem that caused this bang.... That quickly went away and then I looked out the window and saw this venting and my concern was increasing all the time. It went from I wonder what this is going to do to the landing to I wonder if we can get back home again. It was apparent.. .that the only way to survive the situation was to transfer to the lm. ...”
Lovell said decision on date, crew, and destination of Apollo 14 would be made after debriefings and investigation by Apollo 13 Re-
view Board. If NASA “wants this crew to go back to Fra Mauro, we’ll be glad to go. If they decide to send another crew or not to go to Fra Mauro, that’s their decision.” (Transcript)

Dr. Paine said: “The Apollo 13 mission was a failure. We did not succeed in America’s third lunar landing attempt and we were therefore unable to explore the moon’s Fra Mauro formation. This hilly region remains a high priority objective in our lunar program. . .. We cannot yet say which of the remaining Apollo missions will be sent there. Although the Apollo 13 mission failed, we regard the recovery actions that followed.. .as a gratifying success which will contribute greatly to the nation’s space flight competence.” There was no reason “why this setback should be—or should be made to be—the occasion for a major change in the course of the nation’s space program. We have clearly demonstrated the basic soundness of the Apollo system and of our operational procedures. ... From a technical standpoint, there is no question but that we are prepared
to move forward in the 1970’s with the space program we have outlined to you....” Dr. Paine said President Nixon “fully shares this view.” (Testimony)
Dr. Petrone testified: “This long arduous voyage continuously presented the challenge to balance the spacecraft systems required to perform necessary functions against the availability of consumables, of water, electrical power, oxygen, and the lithium hydroxide to remove the carbon dioxide. The options available to flight and ground crews in every case permitted acceptable courses of action to be selected. During this emergency situation, the remaining systems performed in an outstanding manner meeting the unusual demands placed upon them. At the same time, the flight and ground crews demonstrated exceptional confidence in meeting these sets of unusual circumstances.”
Mission ended with “set of consumables which were within about two percent of what we had predicted back at 63 hours or about seven hours after the problem occurred,” Lunney told Committee. “If the consumable posture. . .had worsened or if we had absorbed another failure. . .we would have had to resort to scheduling communication times with the crew.” Although probably within 12 hours to 24 of running out of most critical consumable, water, “had we proceeded into.. .duty cycling the communications gear onboard, we probably could have stretched that period.”
Astronaut Lovell described crew’s feelings during crisis: “We soon realized that our only hope of survival was to go into Aquarius, power up its systems and use the systems and the consumables on board. . .for a return home. And it was here that we realized that it was now a case of survival.” Spacecraft was on trajectory that “would have entered us in a sort of permanent orbit, some . 230. . .thousand miles [370 000 km] in apogee, and maybe a thousand [1600 km] or so in perigee. ... Again, the ground came through, and gave us. . .the free trajectory burn, which was required to get us back to earth. My main concern at this point was to get this spacecraft back within the earth’s atmosphere.” (Transcript)

current controversies over cost and efficiency of F-lll and C-5A aircraft during Seventh Space Congress at Cocoa Beach, Fla.: “If we in military development have been remiss, I would say it is because we not only failed to fully communicate the difficulties involved in pushing the state of the art, but we also neglected to stress the uncertainties between known design parameters on paper and the hardware that ultimately results. To the intense competition for finite resources, and to a flood of paper studies, we reacted with overoptimism and neglected to properly qualify the normal uncertainties of development or the technical risks involved.” Advancing state of the art was “synonymous with working beyond the boundaries of the certain and the known. As long as we operate at these outer limits of science and technology, performance, schedule and cost are inevitably going to be, at best, elastic parameters. The alternative is to stand pat with the F-4, the B-52, and the C-141. Such an alternative would be hardly supportable in even a static world.” (Text)

May 1: Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, held press briefing at MSC on Apollo 13 Review Board’s progress in investigation of accident that aborted April 11-17 mission: Combination “of all the data from telemetry, from all the testing of all the analytical work and perhaps information from photographs” would be required “to determine the most probable cause or causes” of April 13 accident. Board believed most probable sequence of events was: Short circuit in oxygen tank No. 2 caused combustion within tank. “This in turn caused the pressure and a temperature within the tank to increase. The tank then ruptured. This rupture. .. caused the pressure in the compartment in which the tank is located to increase which then caused. .. the big covering panel in the Service Module to blow off.” Panel hit high-gain antenna and knocked it out, causing brief loss of data.
Preflight events of possible significance included change of motors of fans inside tank at Beech Aircraft Co. plant early in manufacture. “Later on the tank, itself, was.. .moved from one spacecraft and installed in spacecraft 109 and during the removal from spacecraft.. .106, it was jarred or dropped an inch or two [5-10 cm].... Finally, during the loading and unloading of the tank during the countdown demonstration tests at the Cape there was an anomaly which made it very difficult to get the oxygen out of the tank. This was several weeks before the flight and a new procedure not previously tried was used in the detanking”—gaseous oxygen “was pumped into the tank and released again, the heaters were turned off and on....”
Board was investigating connection between events and accident and would submit final report to Dr. Low and Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, about June 1. (Transcript)
• Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences favorably reported H.R. 16516, NASA FY 1971 authorization bill, with amendment reducing total authorization to $3,316 billion—$285 million less than $3,333 billion requested by Administration. Committee’s recommended total—providing $2,606 billion for R&D, $32.5 million for construction of facilities, and $677.3 million for research and program management—was lowest recommended by Senate Space Committee since 1961 and $399.6 million less than total recommended by Committee in FY 1970.
Committee rejected House increase of $130.5 million over Administration request for Apollo program. It also rejected increases of $139.5 million for space flight operations, $5.6 million for ATS project, $2.3 million for selected aeronautics research efforts, $500000 for technology utilization program, and $2.05 million for construction of Earth Resources Technology Laboratory “at this time.” It restored House cuts of $1.5 million to advanced manned missions

•	Impact of space requirements on U.S. computer industry was dis-
cussed by Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, at ARCS (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists) Foundation Annual Scholarship Awards Banquet in Houston, Tex.: “In Project Mercury, ground-based computers were only required to determine quickly and accurately booster cut-off conditions. In Apollo, however, computers are used throughout the mission in real time, to calculate the trajectory to the moon and back, to compare three separate solutions for the lunar descent, to record and analyze thousands of bits of telemetered spacecraft information, to compare these to predicted values to detect trouble, and . .. to monitor the well-being
of the crew. For Mercury, the computer program contained 40 000 computer words; for Apollo, a 1 500 000-word program was needed, while at the same time, the speed of the computers has increased sevenfold.”
U.S. computer industry was doing $8 billion worth of business annually, paid highest average wages of any U.S. industry, and was “one of the most rapidly growing.” In 1960, U.S. exported $48 million worth of computers; in 1969, $728 million dollars worth. “U.S. computer exports have increased by over 1400 percent in the first decade of the space age. This impressive record was built on excellence of performance through continuing technological superiority. In a large measure it was the stimulus of NASA’s requirements that brought about these technological advances in the computer industry.” (Text)

•	Analysis of photo of Phobos, largest of two Martian moons, taken
138 000 km (86 000 mi) from Mars by Mariner VII was discussed in Science by New Mexico State Univ. astronomer and Mariner project scientist Bradford A. Smith, jpl photo-enhancement techniques had indicated Phobos was nonspherical and was larger and had darker surface than previously thought. Satellite’s limb profile measured 18 by 22 km (11.2 by 13.7 mi) and was elongated along orbital plane. Phobos had average visual geometric albedo of 0.065, lower than that known for any other body in solar system. It seemed probable Phobos had not formed by accretion around primordial Mars, but was captured at some later time. (Science, 5/15/70, 828-30; NASA Release 70-66)

May 17: Sert II (Space Electric Rocket Test), launched Feb. 3, had reached halfway point of six-month endurance test in space with ion engine operating satisfactorily for more than 2000 hrs, NASA announced. Experiment to determine whether electric rocket operation would interfere with radio communications between spacecraft, electric propulsion system, and nearby space indicated there would be no problem. Experiment to measure effects of ion thruster efflux on silicon-cell solar array showed solar cells were being adversely affected. As ions were emitted through molybdenum grid, small particles of grid broke off (sputtered) and were deposited on nearby surfaces, reducing ability of test patches to convert solar energy into electric power.
Controllers had turned off electric bombardment engine for sever-. al hours March 7 to avoid damage during solar eclipse when Serf II intersected eclipse path on two orbits with sharp loss in electric power from solar cells. After engine was restarted it continued to function satisfactorily. Only problem had been Feb. 7 failure of miniature electrostatic accelerometer, one of four methods of measuring engine’s thrust.

With our spacecraft. . .we simply combine the harshest requirements imposed on both aircraft and missiles. And the difficulties will be compounded as the Air Force and NASA jointly develop reusable boosters, shuttles and tugs for the space transportation system.” (Text)

May 19: Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, commented on May 7 action of House in reducing by $136 million NASA FY 1971 budget request, during appropriations hearing before Senate Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Independent Offices: “I cannot state specifically now what actions NASA would have to take to meet a reduction of this amount, but coming on top of the actions already taken to accommodate to the $3,333 billion budget request.. .the effect would surely be a major blow to this nation’s efforts to carry out a balanced space program, hold our teams together, and move out, however slowly, toward the goals of the future. We would have to reexamine again all aspects of the program and decide what further delays, terminations, and retrenchments have to be made.”
In r&d, NASA would have to forego all but two of 11 construction projects needed to satisfy requirements of approved projects, reduce hazards, or improve basic operational efficiency in key activities. In research and program management, cut would require reduction-in-force of at least 1300 NASA civil service employees in addition to reduction planned in FY 1971 budget. “Based on past experience, a reduction-in-force. . .has an impact on three to five employees for every employee reduced. This means that 20 percent of the NASA work force would be disrupted, and our already hard-hit pjant communities further depressed.” (Testimony)

May 20-29: Thirteenth annual meeting of Committee on Space Research (cospar) of International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) was held in Leningrad. Soviet Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin sent message: “International cooperation in space exploration and in the use of outer space for peaceful purposes must be based on the development of mutual understanding and trust among the peoples.” There was “growing cooperation on an international scale in space research” and. “further progress in this field can open up still greater prospects for mankind.”
Among 32 NASA officials and scientists attending meeting were Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator; Gerald M. Truszynski, Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition; and Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong.
Armstrong received tumultuous welcome from predominantly Russian audience, AP reported. During question-and-answer period before his report, Armstrong said that when he viewed earth from moon, “I thought it was impossible that a little island like that in the sky could have so many problems on it.” He had found it “more pleasant on the moon than on earth as far as gravity is concerned.” In report on experiences on moon, Armstrong said, “Since the sky is black the impression is somewhat like being on a sandy athletic field at night that is very well illuminated with flood lights.” Further improvement in mobility of pressure garments would improve ability of astronauts to carry out lunar experiments. At later session when Armstrong attended as observer, guards had difficulty restraining cheers of audience, which included 800 Soviet delegates and 420 representatives of 30 countries. AP said it was “dramatic and unusual” tribute to foreign visitors in U.S.S.R.

Rate of meteoroid impact or surface movement was low in area of Ocean of Storms where Apollo 12 and Surveyor III had landed. Camera and several portions of Surveyor spacecraft had coating of One dust stirred from lunar surface as Apollo 12 LM descended nearby. Only other change observed in Surveyor was that its white paint had turned to tan, “partly due to deposition of material on the spacecraft.”
nas-nrc submitted United States Space Science Program, comprehensive summary of scientific research in space science in U.S. during 1969: “Popular interest in the space program, which reached a high point with the first successful lunar landing, has diminished somewhat. Furthermore, a reassessment of national priorities has resulted in reduced financial support for space research and technology during the past year, and the support will probably be even more limited this year and next. It is our intention, despite these limitations, to try to maintain a reasonably balanced program, with continuing effort in all areas of space research in which we are currently engaged and to support mutually advantageous international cooperation in space research wherever possible.” (Text)

to the claims of SST critics that harm will result from the plane’s development, [and] there are some very real threats to the national interest if it is not put into production on schedule.” Planned SST flight rules would confine aircraft’s noise to airfield. There was “no scientific support” for allegation that supersonic flights at 18 300 m (60 000 ft) would pollute upper atmosphere and change world’s weather. Overpass of SST at supersonic speeds would not disrupt earth’s natural environment.
Without SST program, “United States would surely lose its world leadership as an aircraft supplier.” Loss of SST sales, “combined with the increased purchase by U.S. airlines of foreign-built super-sonics, is estimated to result in an unfavorable swing of some $16 billion in balance of payments through 1990.” Halt or slowdown in SST program “would be equally serious to the domestic economy.” (Text)

May 28: In letter to Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.), Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, replied to inquiries on design, cost, and operation of space shuttle: “NASA and dod have been working for more than three years on the preliminary analysis of alternate approaches and concepts, and on the research and technology effort needed to determine whether it is appropriate to develop reusable vehicles that will substantially reduce the cost of operating in space. We have concluded that this is an achievable objective. We are convinced that availablility of these vehicles will lead to significant changes in our concepts of operation in space environment as well as reductions in costs. Accordingly, we selected contractors oh May 12 to proceed into the second or definitive phase of detailed study, comparative analysis, and preliminary design directed toward facilitating the choice of a single program approach . . . .

Report of nas-nrc Space Science Board recommended biological precautions taken after lunar flights be taken before flights as well. Preflight quarantine period should be instituted to permit acute disease to express itself, prevent contact and infection of astronauts by general population, and permit crosscontact of flora and exchange of microorganisms among spacecraft crew. During last two weeks before launch, astronauts’ contacts should be limited to essential technical crew held under same isolation regulations.	.
Report called for extensive and periodic screening of astronauts by immunological tests and “microbiological surveillance” of astronauts’ families and close associates before and after missions. Astronauts with even minor respiratory infections should be barred from mission because they might “result in greatly accelerated clinical responses under space-cabin conditions if transmitted to other astronauts.” (Text)

•	Medical experience in Apollo 7 through 11 was summarized by Dr.
Charles A. Berry, msc Director of Medical Research and Operations, in Aerospace Medicine: “The 3105 hours of exposing man to spaceflight during the Apollo program have added greatly to knowledge of man’s response to space travel.” Spacecraft cabin environment had been “suitably maintained”; radiation environment had been “benign,” with no solar flares occurring; crews had adapted well to weightlessness; and improvements had been made in inflight food. Body-weight losses which continued to occur were not entirely due to body fluid loss. Supplying potable water had been effective and “great strides have been made in removing gas bubbles in the water. Work-sleep cycles had been improved and bioinstrumentation had continued to function well.
“Although a preflight preventative medicine program has been difficult to conduct, it has been effective in the later Apollo missions in reducing pre-, in-, and postflight illnesses, which had occurred in all flight phases and were usually viral upper respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.” Although crews had adapted to motion environment, “this area will require continuing attention.”
Cardiovascular deconditioning had been identified after flight, along with “significant decrement in work capacity in immediate postflight period.” Postflight neutrophilia had been observed after crew recovery. Loss of red cell mass observed in Gemini program had reoccurred only during Apollo 9, indicating that hyperoxia was responsible. Even small amount of nitrogen in atmosphere might protect red cells from lytic action of oxygen. Microbiological studies had shown that organisms transferred between crewmembers and that organ-
ism’s growth was favored by shifts, eva on lunar surface during Apollo 11 was conducted within expected energy costs, at average of 1200 btu per hour. It appeared lunar surface time could be extended safely. (Aero Med, 5/70, 500-18)

Ni-kolayev and Vitaly I. Sevastyanov, was launched from Baykonurat 12:09 am Baykonur time into orbit with 249-km (154.7-mi) apogee, 236-km (146.6-mi) perigee, 89.3-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass said cosmonauts would conduct extensive program of scientif-
ic and technical research in “solitary orbital flight,” including medical and biological research on effects of space flight on man, studies of earth’s geography and atmosphere, research into “physical processes in near-earth space,” and checkout of spacecraft systems. Launch and pictures of crew in spacecraft were televised in Moscow about one hour after liftoff.
Five hours after liftoff Tass reported cosmonauts were “coping well with conditions of weightlessness and carrying out the flight program.” Only anomaly had been dirtying of windows from engine fired for midcourse maneuver after fifth orbit, Tass said. Systems were functioning normally and Nikolayev had begun “experiments linked with the investigation of human peculiarities as an element of the control system in different dynamic operations.”
Tass issued daily bulletins that described routine of space flight chores and experiments: “While one cosmonaut runs a vacuum cleaner, the other brews coffee or shaves.” Cosmonauts performed strenuous physical exercises each day in special “load suits,” practiced manual maneuvers of spacecraft, and photographed earth and sun. By June 8 Soyuz IX had completed 100 orbits and 147 hrs of flight—record for man-hours in space in Soviet space program— with all systems functioning satisfactorily and with crew demonstrating it could “withstand well the complex impact of the factors of space flight and retain high efficiency.” Insomnia, only problem reported by crew, had been overcome.
On June 19 Tass announced Soyuz IX had softlanded 76 km (47 mi) west of Karaganda, Kazakhstan, after orbiting in space for 17 days 16 hrs 59 min and setting new world record for manned space flight endurance.

•	Review of Apollo 13 accident was nearing completion and understand-
ing of accident was good, LaRC Director Edgar M. Cortright, Chairman of Apollo 13 Review Board, told press at MSC. Final report had been delayed pending completion of “critical tests being carried out which will help pin down some of the details of what took place.” One of the key tests at msc was related to special detanking and checkout procedures before launch. Tests had found faulty thermal switches and “demonstrated that if these thermal switches, had failed ... the temperatures ... in the heater tube assembly could have exceeded 1000 degrees F. [800 K] in some spots,” hot enough to bake teflon-coated wires and destroy insulation.
Actual flight tank at Beech Aircraft Corp. would be “cycled back through the same series of detanking operations that took place on the 02 tank ... from Apollo 13.” Other tests were being conducted at msc, arc, and LeRC on “the ignition and combustion processes in the tank.” Preliminary data suggested explosion resulted from failure of switches before launch and overheating of heater tube during detanking which destroyed insulation and sparked fire in tank.

Wendell Willkie’s “One world” was rapidly becoming Buckminster Fuller’s Spaceship Earth, socially, economically, technically and environmentally, Dr. Eggers said. “It is essential, therefore, that we begin to view the earth in all its finite reality and recognize that ‘exponential projections’ of the society of man and his works on earth are not only undesirable (if not impractical), but indeed they become unreal carried into the indefinite future. Accordingly, we do better to think in terms of the ultimate equilibrium we would like to see man achieve with and on spaceship earth, and from this vantage point we are drawn naturally to considerations of how best to approach and find the desired equilibrium.” Population projections thus “would be expected to evolve . . .in accordance with satisfying the requirements of dynamic stability of the society of man in relation to his environment both natural and artificial. Technology, from earth-based to space-based, must play a massive role in this evolution because it will be crucial to effective earth resources management and distribution, and yet it must.be compatible with the earth’s environment.” (Text; A&A, 10/70, 38-50)

•	Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong’s May 24-June 5 visit to
U.S.S.R. was reviewed in Christian Science Monitor: “To those few Russians who saw him, the first man to walk on the moon was unquestionably a big hit. But overall, his 12-day goodwill visit was an unobtrusive affair that stayed very much in the realm of Soviet officialdom.”
Armstrong had arrived in Leningrad May 24 to attend May 20-29 cospar Conference. “Although he was in Leningrad for five days, only one Leningrad newspaper made any mention of him and Russians for a long time were not aware he was even in the country.” It was only after his arrival in Leningrad that Armstrong was invited by Soviet government to stay longer in U.S.S.R. He had “no exposure to Soviet public” during Novosibirsk visit. In Moscow, press had given more coverage. Armstrong had told press he had been “most emotionally moved” by meeting with Mrs. Yuri Gagarin and Mrs. Vladimir Komarov, widows of Soviet cosmonauts. (Saikow-ski, CSM, 6/5/70)

June 7-10: American Astronautical Society held 16th annual meeting in Anaheim, Calif. Francis M. Stewart, MSFC Shuttle Engine Manager, and Ryndal L. Wetherington, NASA Hq. Space Shuttle Propulsion Manager, presented paper on main propulsion requirements for fully reusable space shuttle engine concept and new approaches to engine development and testing. Throttling to only 50% thrust satisfied system’s needs and was baseline requirement. Value of one second of specific impulse had been calculated at $25 000 000. Payload sensitivity of space shuttle concepts under study was 6900-8900 newtons (1500-2000 lbs per sec) of impulse. Minimum impulse per second in basic requirements represented 96% efficiency, “which has not been achieved in any rocket engine to date.”
Reusability requirement might be most difficult of all. “One can speculate that if we can do it in aircraft engines, why not rocket engines? But we are talking about heat fluxes and turbomachinery characteristics in the shuttle engine that extend well beyond those experienced in the engines of the [Boeing] 707, 747, or even the military high performance aircraft. It is yet to be shown if we can fly 100 missions (or even 10 or 20) with this high performance engine, and achieve the confidence and maintainability which the airline operations have in hand. .. .reusability adds a new dimension to rocket engine development.” (Text)
Prof. Yu. K.

Prof. Khodarev said: “We would like to see concrete lists from American scientists of instruments that we could place on the moon for research. Then we can explore further avenues for cooperation in space. We can’t decide how to transport things there until we first decide what we want to take.” There was general acceptance of U.S.S.R. space efforts among Soviet people “but people are looking for a direct payoff—they want something for their money.” Khodarev said U.S. and U.S.S.R. could “cooperate in a Martian program as well as in intense investigations on the moon.” He suggested area for primary investigation from lunar station would have to be decided. “Do we want to look at the moon, or do we want to look into the cosmos from the surface?” During panel discussion Robert L. Lohman of NASA’s Space Station Task Force invited Prof. Khodarev to attend NASA meeting on advanced space programs at ARC later in year.

June 15: Apollo 13 Review Board accident report was released by NASA at Hq. news conference. LaRC Director Edgar M. Cortright, Chairman of Review Board, said accident “was not the result of a chance malfunction in a statistical sense but, rather, it was the result of an unusual combination of mistakes coupled with a somewhat deficient and unforgiving design.”
After assembly and acceptance testing, oxygen tank No, 2 that flew on Apollo 13 had been shipped from Beech Aircraft Corp. to NR in apparently satisfactory condition. “It is now known, however, that the tank contained two protective thermostatic switches on the heater assembly which were inadequate and would subsequently
fail during ground test operations. ... In addition, it is probable that the tank contained a loosely fitting fill tube assembly. . .which was loose when it left the plant. . .[and] was subsequently displaced during handling. . .[and] led to the use of improvised detanking procedures. . .which almost certainly set the stage for the accident.”
Special detanking procedures at KSC subjected tank to extended heater operation. “These procedures had not been used before and the tank had not been qualified by test for the conditions experienced. However the procedures did not violate the specifications which governed the operation of the heaters. ... In reviewing these procedures before the flight, officials. . .did not recognize the possibility of damage due to overheating.
“The thermostatic switch discrepancy was not detected. . . . Nor did tests identify the incompatibility of the switches with the ground support equipment at KSC. ... As shown by subsequent tests, failure of the thermostatic switches probably permitted the temperature of the heater tube assembly to reach as much as 1000 degrees Fahrenheit [810 K] in spots during the continuous eight-hour period of heater operation. From that time on the oxygen tank. . .was in a hazardous condition when filled with oxygen and electrically powered.
“However it was not until nearly 56 hours into the mission that the fan motor wiring possibly moved by the fan stirring of the fluid contents of the tank short circuited and ignited the wiring insulation by means of an electric arc. The resulting combustion in the oxygen tank probably overheated and failed the wiring conduit where it enters the tank and possibly a portion of the tank itself. The rapid expulsion of high pressure oxygen which followed possibly augmented by combustion of insulation in the space surrounding the tank blew off the outer panel. . .of the service module, caused a leak in the high pressure system of Oxygen Tank Number 1, damaged the high gain antenna, caused other miscellaneous damage and aborted the mission.”
Board recommended that cryogenic oxygen storage system be modified to minimize use of combustible materials and remove materials that might short-circuit from contact with potential ignition sources and that system be rigorously requalified; onboard warning systems be reviewed and modified; consumables and emergency equipment be reviewed to determine whether potential for use in “lifeboat” mode should be enhanced; msc continue special tests and analyses under way to understand better the accident details; standard procedures require “presentation of all prior anomalies” whenever significant anomalies occurred in critical subsystems during final preparations for launch; NASA thoroughly reexamine all spacecraft, launch vehicles, and ground systems to identify and evaluate potential combustion hazards and conduct additional research on materials compatibility, ignition, and combustion in strong oxidizers at various g levels; and msc reassess all Apollo spacecraft subsystems and engineering organizations responsible for them to ensure adequate understanding of subsystems at subcontractor and vendor level.
Cortright said thermostatic switch discrepancy and incompatibility of switches with ksc ground support equipment was “a serious oversight in which all parties [NASA, NR, and Beech] shared. . .. The accident is judged to have been nearly catastrophic. Only outstanding performance on the part of the crew, Mission Control and other members of the team which supported the operations successfully returned the crew to earth.” (Transcript; text)

June 16: Edgar M. Cortnght, LaRC Director and Chairman of Apollo 13 Review Board, summarized report of Review Board before House Committee on Science and Astronautics and commented: “Total Apollo system of ground complexes, launch vehicle, and spacecraft constitutes the most ambitious and demanding engineering development ever undertaken by man. For these missions to succeed, both men and equipment must perform to near perfection. That this system has already resulted in two successful lunar surface explorations is a tribute to those men and women who conceived, designed, built, and flew it. Perfection is not only difficult to achieve, but difficult to maintain.

•	USAF released summary of findings of C-5 Review Board headed by
Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Dean of MIT School of Engineering. Board concluded: C-5A flight performance met Lockheed Corp. contract guarantees at current weight of aircraft; change actions applying to contract had not reduced required flight performance; landing gear design system was “based on good engineering principles backed by adequate tests and is basically sound”; landing gear problems that had occurred could be related to large number of components required to meet aircraft’s landing and ground handling requirements. “It is essential that correct procedures be established, documented, and made available to train crews in proper procedures.”
Major recommendations on C-5A subsystems were: reconfigure triple-redundant pitch, roll, and heading sensor assemblies from two attitude heading reference units (ahrus) and one inertial measurement unit (IMU) to three ahrus, retaining IMU for navigation only; provide triple redundancy for fail-operational pitch, roll, and heading information fed to cockpit displays; substitute state-of-the-art weather and mapping radar for multimode radar (mmr) for transport mission until reliability for other modes had been demonstrated by mmr. Board found static tests had demonstrated 80% of design ultimate strength, while full-scale test article had accumulated only 1500 simulated hours of life. It recommended additional modifications to wing structure and program for tracking use of each individual C-5A aircraft by load recorders, to adjust inspection intervals and monitor remaining life. It also recommended acceleration of all tests, to identify problems in laboratory rather than in service; second wing-fatigue test; and choice by USAF of one of several proposals to enable wing to meet static strength requirements, (dod Release 507-70)
•	Physicist Dr. Ralph E. Lapp testified before Subcommittee on Econo-

Such a decision will shift NASA’s priorities from sensational manned space ventures to space science and its applications. If the U.S. space program is restructured to this new pattern and the Apollo manned lunar program
is allowed to run out, it should be possible to effect further economies in the NASA budget___” When nasa shifted to science base “it
would be desirable that the scientific community give some expression of its sense of priorities for space science with respect to the rest of science. The quest for new knowledge of the solar system must be reckoned as pure or basic or fundamental research. As such, it should be related to the federal support of all other basic research.” (Testimony)

•	NASA announced award by LaRC of $1077 000 contract to General
Electric Co. Space Div. for flight experiment to make year-long global measurements of carbon monoxide concentrations using advanced spaceborne sensor. By mapping portions of earth’s atmosphere with high, low, and average concentrations of poisonous gas, scientists hoped to identify “removal sinks” in which carbon monoxide was changed into another compound. By defining removal mechanisms, scientists hoped to be able to predict whether carbon monoxide concentration would increase in future and to what degree, (nasa Release 70-102)

•	Discovery that velocity of sound waves through Apollo 11 and 12
moon rocks was roughly one third that through earth’s rocks was reported in Science by Edward Schreiber of Queens College, City Univ. of New York, and Orson L. Anderson of Lamont-Doherty Observatory. Scientists compared sound velocity in various earth materials with that of lunar samples. Materials which exhibited “compressional velocities that are in consonance with those measured for lunar rocks” included provolone, emmenthal, muenster, and cheddar cheese—“which leads us to suspect that perhaps old hypotheses are best, after all, and should not be lightly discarded.” (Science, 6/26/70,1579-80)
•	Nixon Administration policy toward Federal graduate aid was dis-
cussed in Science by John Walsh: There were signs “the Administration is veering away from a policy'of changing the primary form of direct federal support to graduate education from fellowships and
training grants to guaranteed loans. For those who feared that the prevailing system of federal grants was to be supplanted there is some consolation that the grants are headed down but not out.” While NASA had liquidated sustaining university programs, agency would still provide indirect support of graduate students through research assistantships financed under $75 million in research grants to universities approved in past budgets. (Science, 6/26/70,1559-61)
•	Possible pollution of stratosphere by SST was discussed in Science:
“An environment issue that has been intensifying in recent weeks is the question of whether exhaust products added to the stratosphere by the SST could produce significant environmental changes.” Most meteorologists agreed gaseous exhaust products other than water would present no special problems. Water was “more likely to be a problem because stratospheric water concentrations are generally low as the result of condensation in the troposphere.” Water accumulated in troposphere could change radiation balance of earth; initiate cloud formation, thus increasing amount of solar energy reflected into space; or lead to decrease in ozone concentration of stratosphere, “thereby allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth’s surface.” However, there was not enough information available to predict whether persistent clouds would form, since no research flights had been made in cold areas of tropical tropopause and above Arctic and Antarctic, which were believed to be saturated.

•	mit oceanographer Dr. Henry Stommel commented in Science, on
prospects for physical oceanography: “Is the dynamics of the ocean similar to or fundamentally different from that of the atmosphere? Only measurement will tell, and it will have to be measurement at a level of technological sophistication quite beyond the present level and beyond that proposed for routine monitoring. Access to somebody’s monitoring system, or to a few years of ship time, will not suffice to obtain the kind of information the scientist needs about the oceanic velocity field. Some carefully designed measurement programs are going to be needed—on a scale larger than an oceanographic institution can manage but smaller than the space program. To be useful scientifically, these programs will have to give first priority to questions of hydrodynamics. To date there is little indication they will do so.” (Science, 6/26/70,1531-6)

K.	Javits (R-N.Y.), submitted amendment to H.R. 17548, FY 1971 Independent Offices and hud appropriations bill which would reduce NASA R&D appropriation by $110 million—amount requested by NASA for design and definition of space shuttle and station. Sen. Mondale said: “This project represents NASA’s next major effort in manned space flight. The $110 million.. .is only the beginning of the story. NASA’s preliminary cost estimates for development of the space shuttle/station total almost $14 billion, and the ultimate cost may run much higher. Furthermore, the shuttle and station are the first essential steps toward a manned Mars landing.. .which could cost anywhere between $50 to $100 billion. I have seen no persuasive justification for embarking upon a project of such staggering costs at a time when many of our citizens are malnourished, when our rivers and lakes are polluted, and when our cities and rural areas are decaying.” (CR, 6/29/70, S10057-8)

June 30: Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, reviewed results of Apollo 13 accident investigations and announced postponement of Apollo 14 mission to Jan. 31, in testimony before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. LaRC Director Edgar M. Cort-right, Chairman of Apollo 13 Review Board, summarized prepared statement before Committee. Recommendations of Apollo 13 Review Board [see June 15] would be implemented before Apollo 14 was approved for launch, Dr. Paine said, csm systems would be modified to eliminate potential combustion hazards in high-pressure oxygen. Unsealed f&n motors would be removed from oxygen tanks and additional oxygen tank would be added to Apollo 14 CSM. Electrical wiring within high-pressure oxygen systems would be limited to stainless-steel-sheathed wires, and Teflon, aluminum, and other potentially reactive materials would be used as little as possible and kept away from possible ignition sources. Spacecraft and Mission Control warning systems would be modified to provide more immediate and visible warnings of system anomalies. MSC was
reviewing spacecraft emergency equipment and procedures and use of csms and LMs in “lifeboat” modes.
ossa, OMSF, and oart had been directed to apply Review Board recommendations throughout NASA and submit report on assessment and actions taken or proposed by Aug. 25.
Lessons of Apollo 13 would be disseminated throughout industry and technical community. Dr. Paine had forwarded copy of Review Board report to Soviet Academician Mstislav V. Keldysh “so that lessons which might be learned from our accident can be applied to prevent a similar hazard to Soviet Cosmonauts.”
Aerospace Safety Research and Data Institute at LeRC would conduct additional research on materials compatibility, ignition, and combustion at various g levels and on characteristics of supercritical fluids, expanding its review of oxygen handling in aerospace programs. Research would “be of direct long-term benefit to NASA in. . .future programs, and will help other sectors of the economy.” Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel would review NASA management processes in implementing Review Board recommendations and Apollo 13 Review Board would reconvene later in year.
Postponement of Apollo 14 mission would move Apollo 15 launch date to July or August 1971, Dr. Paine testified. It was too early to detail costs and budgetary impact of modifications and program changes necessitated by Apollo 13 accident but best current estimate would be “in the range of $10 to $15 million of increased costs, which we plan to handle within our total Apollo budget.”
NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers presented specific plans for reassessing all Apollo spacecraft subsystems. Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, outlined actions planned to carry out Review Board recommendations. (Transcript)

During June: Hypersonic aircraft technology and applications were discussed in Astronautics & Aeronautics by Dr. Alfred J. Eggers, Jr., NASA Assistant Administrator for Policy; Richard H. Petersen, Senior Research Scientist in arc Mission Analysis Div.; and Nathaniel B. Cohen, special assistant in NASA policy research program. Because of long-life requirements of its structure, it was unlikely that hypersonic transport would be developed until operational experience was available on some other hypersonic aircraft. Therefore, hypersonic transport would benefit not only from technology developed for space-shuttle vehicle, but very probably from experience gained during shuttle operation. Operating experience with high-temperature structures would help immensely in developing longer life structures for hypersonic transport and gain considerable new knowledge of hypersonic aerodynamics. In contrast to situation in aerodynamics and structures, technology program being planned by NASA to support development of rocket propulsion for shuttle would not contribute significantly to hypersonic airbreathing-propulsion-system technology. Current generalized scramjet research program had amply demonstrated feasibility of such engines. Developing airbreathing propulsion for either hypersonic transport or second-
generation airbreathing 1st stage for space shuttle would require applied program focused specifically on scramjet. (A&A, 6/70, 30-41)

July 2: In letter to Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, Elmer B. Staats, U.S. Comptroller General, recommended that award of ATS-f and ATS-G contract to General Electric Co. be reconsidered because of ambiguity in NASA’s instruction to competitors and one-week extension granted GE to submit its revised proposal. “It is our [gao’s] opinion that the established award selection procedures were not followed and that the procedures which were followed were defective.”
Within two hours of receipt of GAO recommendation, Dr. Paine issued statement: “On April 9 I requested the GAO to conduct a review of the events leading to the selection of the General Electric Co. rather than the Fairchild Hiller Corp. to build two Applications Technology Satellites.
“The General Accounting Office has reported to me that the Fairchild Hiller Corp. may not have been accorded an equal opportunity to submit a winning bid because of a one-week extension granted to General Electric who turned in the lower bid.
“At the time the award was made, this time disparity was not known to the selecting officials.
“NASA will therefore reopen the bidding to Fairchild Hiller and General Electric in strict accordance with our procurement regulations.” (CR, 7/9/70, SI0975-7; NASA Release 70-119; Text)
Daniel J. Fink, Vice President and General Manager of General Electric Co. Space Div., issued statement in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Pa. Conclusion of gao report “seems to rest on the single detail that Fairchild’s proposal was submitted one week earlier than ours. .. .both parties had the opportunity to inform NASA when they could submit their proposal and both parties responded accordingly. The Fairchild implication that this difference in time could have been used unfairly by General Electric by our learning our competitor’s price and changing ours is a shocking allegation. No such ‘leak’ occurred, and the gao report specifically states that there is no evidence to support that allegation.” Fink said facts were “that both parties competed hard for this important space program which has the potential of contributing greatly to our well being in this country and in several foreign countries where this communications satellite will be used.” (Text)

July 8: Apollo 11 commander Neil A. Armstrong held press conference on his reactions to first anniversary of manned lunar landing July 20, 1969: “I really had hoped, I think, that the impact [of lunar landing] would be more far-reaching than it has [been], I had hoped that it might take our minds away from some of the more mundane and temporal problems that we as a society face. ... I think if we could. . .direct our attention a little farther into the future, to try to foresee problems that are going to occur in the next years and decades, then perhaps we could be attacking these solutions from the
front side when it’s. . .more easy to provide a viable solution and a meaningful one.”
While scientific discoveries resulting from Apollo II had been numerous and were still continuing, Armstrong felt “actual discovery, or revelation, was that man could in fact live on the moon in a rather normal fashion.” This was “necessary key to all future plans for the use of our natural satellite, whatever they may be and however they might develop.”
Armstrong described his feelings in looking at moon from earth: “I see the moon from the back yard as a friendly place. And I see a lot of landmarks. I can no longer look at it just as a spot in the sky; but, rather, I actually pick out, of course, the Sea of Tranquility, Clavius, Aristarchus, and places I know and have flown by.”
Asked if he expected to fly in space again, Armstrong said, “I’d be surprised if I don’t have the option of buying a ticket.” (Transcript)
•	Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, Director of OST and Presidential Science Advis-
er, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development on need for adequate Federal science policy: “Science and technology policy.. .must be formulated on an evolutionary basis, continuously under review and subject to change with changing conditions. It must be a policy that can be implemented both by the Aministration and by Congress and one which will be supported by the public.” Policy should provide “strong base of science” and “mechanisms for using science and technology to meet changing problems of national concern.” It should “recognize that policies and events wholly outside the field of science and technology may strongly influence our r&d expenditure level.”
Dr. DuBridge told Subcommittee some of nation’s “most valuable and productive research projects” had been lost because of FY 1970 amendment to dod appropriation bill which banned defense-financed studies unless they had direct relation to military missions. (Testimony; Cohn, WPost, 7/9/70, A7)	_

•	In Science editorial, Brown Univ. scientist Dr. A. Hunter Dupree out-

Yet, a reordering of the relation of the scientific community to the Department of Defense cannot be postponed.” Scientific community needed to pay more attention to environmental problems. Space program “must find a role for itself with predominantly scientific objectives and a steady state of funding.” Social sciences must receive greater emphasis. Justification of Federal support for research in universities must emphasize goal of building healthy institutions in national interest. And support for education “must contemplate a national research program with a radically different mix of disciplines from that recently prevailing.” (Science, 7/10/70,131)

But the ingenuity and industry which have added so much to the effectiveness of the military atom have not yet been matched by corresponding political accomplishment aimed at protecting all mankind, at guaranteeing there will be no successors to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Public knowledge about atomic energy was focused on weapons, power plants, and Project Plowshare to find peaceful uses for atomic explosions but much of aec’s funding went for projects like atom smashers, including 200-bev accelerator under construction at Batavia, 111., for $250 million. U.S. had spent about $49 billion on atomic energy since 1940, with about two thirds for weapon development.

July 18: President Nixon issued statement on Congressional action and Government spending: There was “persistent and growing tendency” in Congress to approve increase in expenditures “without providing the revenue to pay the costs.” It had become “almost a cliche to say that all we need do to resolve this dilemma with regard to our Federal budget is to cut space and defense outlays and ‘change our national priorities.’ Let’s set the record straight. We have changed our national priorities.”
In proposed FY 1971 budget, spending for human resources (45%) exceeded defense spending (32%) for “the first time in 20 years.” To accomplish “this massive change in emphasis, military and space expenditures were cut by some $6 billion.” But continuation of pattern of Congressional action would substantially increase expenditures. President asked Congress to establish “firm ceiling on total expenditures,” within which he could determine priorities. (PD, 7/20/70,940-1)

11	Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., with NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, visited Apollo 11 spacecraft exhibit at state capitol in Jefferson City, Mo., and received plaque from Missouri Gov. Warren E. Hearnes. Later they flew to New York, where they presented 113 g (4 oz) lunar sample to U.N. Secretary General U Thant. Sample would remain on exhibit at U.N.
Presenting sample, Dr. Paine said: “What the full significance of Apollo will be to the world of the future, no one can yet predict. We must await the verdict of history. But as we continue to learn and to explore, I am inclined to think that our first moon landing may some day be thought of as the turning point when man first demonstrated that he can open new worlds, where eventually exciting new extraterrestrial societies will be founded. Mankind will move onward to settle and colonize other worlds, and the United Nations will encompass new territories, if not new dimensions.”

NASA appropriation “has been reduced significantly and one frequently hears that federal military and space expenditures for R&D are to be reduced for some years to come; the nation seems determined to mitigate the damage which has been done to our natural environment, but flounders in the attempt; our nation is engaged in the painful exercise of assessing and reassembling our priorities; and our country now seems uncertain in what light, and with what resolution, it should view the pace of future scientific progress. Our national apparatus for the conduct of research
and scholarship is not yet dismantled, but it is falling into shambles. Morale of the scientific community is lower than at any time since World War II. Yet, new fields of scientific exploration and application clamor for attention and funding.” U.S. lead in science ‘‘is in jeopardy.” Loss of lead “bodes ill for our future national security and for the vigor of our economy.” (Testimony)

Shuttle Technology at LeRC in Aviation Week & Space Technology: “Problems facing the development of the system were far more evident than solutions.” Lack of resolution had led to decision to hold another conference in nine months, by which time NASA “will have produced some key solutions.” It was clear at meeting “that experts in a number of fields differ with their colleagues on selection of such basics as thermal protection, design configuration, materials, integrated avionics, operations and crew systems.” (Av Wk, 7/27/70, 17)	.	.

July 28: Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, submitted his resignation, effective Sept. 15. In letter to President Nixon at Western White House, Dr. Paine said: “Now is an appropriate time for a change of command at NASA, and this coincides with my wish to return to private life. During my direction Americans orbited the moon and walked on its surface, achieving our boldest national goal on time and within budget. We have made the transition to the post-Apollo internationally oriented space program of the 1970’s, and the Congress has approved the new direction and pace in the 1971 budget. We will shortly publish a prospectus for man’s conquest of space through the year 2000 which charts a long-range plan for future progress. . . . It has been a privilege and honor to have led the nation’s space program through critical times. . . .Iam most grateful to you for having given me this unique opportunity to serve my country during mankind’s first journey to another world.”
Dr. Paine later told press in San Clemente, Calif., he had accepted challenging position with former employer, General Electric Co., involving “important national problems and technical opportunities outside aerospace and defense” fields and assured them that resignation had “absolutely nothing” to do with budget cuts.
President accepted resignation with deep regret and expressed gratitude for Dr. Paine’s “outstanding leadership” of U.S. space
program: “Your contribution to man’s knowledge of the Earth as well as the heavens has been major, and the course you have done so much to set will help guide our efforts for years to come. . . . You have earned a unique and permanent place of honor in the history of man’s exploration.” (PD, 8/3/70,997; Lyons, NYT, 7/29/70)

•	Canada’s plans to launch first comsat by end of 1972 had been set back
because of controversy over who should build it, Peter Dempson reported in Christian Science Monitor. Hughes Aircraft Co. of California had bid $30 million for 12-channel comsat with 12% Canadian components. RCA Canada Ltd. of Montreal had bid $35 million for 8-channel comsat with 65% Canadian components and insisted on cost-plus contract that could raise cost to $100 million.
Telesat, government agency formed in 1969 to develop Canada’s comsat program, preferred Hughes because of lower bid and because Hughes was pioneer in spacecraft construction. RCA supporters argued that selection of rca would enable Canada to build up competent scientific team, thus adding substantially to space knowhow that constructed Alouetteland Alouette II, with extra cost well worth it. If kept in Canada, they argued, project would provide employment for up to 1200 skilled and semiskilled workers in Quebec, where unemployment was high. (CSM, 7/28/70)

•	Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, held press conference at
NASA Hq. to comment on his resignation, submitted July 28: “When I faced up to the job in the Space Agency. . .there were two major responsibilities. . . . One. . .was the meeting of the commitment. . .[to] land on the Moon within the decade. . .and the second was to lay out the post-Apollo program which would follow. . . . The action that was taken yesterday by the Congress in conference, which essentially gave us more than ninety-eight percent of the monies that the President had approved for the 1971 budget, but more importantly followed a very intensive review by Congress of the proposals we had made for the new space program of the seventies, in many ways represents a major step forward in the second concern which I had, which was to lay out the post-Apollo program and secure initial approval for it in the Administration and the Congress.”
NASA “had reached the point where the person who heads up the space program should be prepared now to devote very many months to the prosecution of this new program. . .and it was my conclusion that this was an excellent time for a change of command at NASA, since, for personal reasons, I could not give it the many months of continuing activity which would be required.”
Questioned about future space projects, Dr. Paine said he had found “great depth of support” for space program in U.S. and in foreign countries. Space program was valuable to Nation and world, was on solid foundation, and would probably be funded by Government on its present level or a little higher. He identified key issues facing NASA in FY 1972 budget as future of Apollo program, particularly with suspension of Saturn V production and continuing need to reassess best use of each booster, and question of relative priority within limited resources of space shuttle, space station, space tug, scientific missions, application of satellite programs, and increased aeronautical r&d. “It’s very important. . .that we take a very long-range view because, the direction that the space program takes in the 1970’s is indeed going to cast a shadow through to the end of the century.” (Transcript)

ESRO was evolving as center for scientific and applications satellites and was interested in developing satellites for meteorology, navigation, and air traffic control. Less successful had been European efforts to obtain independence in satellite launching through eldo.

This could be changed by cooperation in the post-Apollo programme. Europe could reserve the right to buy boosters for any non-military application.” Cost might be problem since “second league nations together spend approximately $300 million a year on space—an order of magnitude less than the
United States and probably the Soviet Union.” (Gatland, Science Journal, 7/70,77-80)

August 1: The Economist commented on resignation of Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, “just at a time when the governments of western Europe are considering whether to throw what passes for their space.programmes, in with Nasa’s.” European governments “scare easily and do not co-operate easily with each other, let alone with the Americans, whom they subconsciously suspect of always having the technical emasculation of Europe in mind. Dr. Paine, placid, patient and unusually sensitive—for a Washington man—to other people’s susceptibilities, handled them as gently as nervous horses. A successor who is less imaginative, or more inclined to wear his emotions on his sleeve, will undo much of this work. This will not do much harm to the American space programme, but for Europe to miss this chance would be tragic.” (Economist, 8/1/70, 43-4)

Study had indicated increase of water vapor induced into stratosphere by supersonic aircraft favored formation of clouds and that fine particles from jet engine exhaust would double global averages of particles, with unknown effects. Particles reflected sunlight back into stratosphere and tended to warm it. Report recommended program to measure lower stratosphere for water vapor quantities and sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and hydrocarbons—fine particle matter.

Telegraph: “White House officials appear to share the belief that
Congress will react more favorably to post-Apollo if it can be launched internationally, on the grounds that it would increase stability between nations, and in the long term cut the cost of major space programmes. For N.A.S.A. it would have the added advantage that such a programme, once begun, would be difficult for a new American administration to halt or cut back dramatically.” Europe held “high card” in negotiations toward international space program. “N.A.S.A. needs a decision early next year so that the post-Apollo programme can be placed before Congress as an international venture.” Europe would insist on conventional U.S. launch vehicles for commercial and scientific satellites in decade it took to make space shuttle operational. “Then the European Space Launcher Development can be scrapped and the money invested in post-Apollo.” If Europe and U.S. “start the ball rolling in space cooperation, there are still more exciting projects.” (London Sunday Telegraph, 8/2/70)

Looking well into the future one can imagine world-wide power transmission networks which will take full advantage of time zone differences and seasonal diversities to equalize the overall global daily demand for electricity. Transmission of large power over such distances may be brought about by cryogenic superconducting cables which are presently under development. Also, power may in the future be transmitted by microwaves or by light.” It might be possible “to convert large amounts of electrical power into lights with a laser beam, transmit this light between continents by satellite and then reconvert the energy to electricity.” (Text)	,

•	Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for
Planning, urged strong role for a centralized science and technology agency but also continued strong mission agency roles in support of basic research—in statement to Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development of House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “.. .in the formulation of a national science policy—or perhaps more appropriately.. .of guidelines in this area—I would
recommend a strengthened role for a centralized agency, with larger responsibility for the development of academic science, and, concurrently, a continuation of the role of mission agency support of basic research deemed important to their missions. Increased responsibility must also be borne by the central agency to help coordinate the efforts of the mission agencies in their dealings with the academic community, a coordination which opens up new opportunities for academic science, and the various agencies, rather than inhibits new approaches. The coordination must not become simply another means of attempting to eliminate duplication, but a mechanism to spotlight areas of opportunity and need where new research, new technology, and new applications can be initiated.” (NASA Activities, 9/15/70)

•	USAF satellite launched July 23 “was placed in an unusual orbit which
is especially suited to taking photos which could be used to police the ceasefire in the Middle East,” Aviation Week and Space Technology editorial noted. “The orbit was an inclination of only 60 deg., in contrast to most reconnaissance satellites. ... Since the satellite went into its unusual orbit two weeks prior to the [Middle East] cease-fire, it should have been possible to obtain photos of Soviet missile deployment prior to the truce, if that is its intended function. If the U.S. has obtained such photos by satellite, this fact as well as the pictures themselves would be closely guarded. ... Reconnaisance satellite pictures are among this nation’s most closely guarded secrets.” (Av Wk, 8/31/70)

•	Development of inexpensive, pocket-size laser for possible use in
communications systems was announced at Bell Telephone Laboratories news conference at its Murray Hill, N.J., facility. Laser was semiconductor device that operated continuously at room temperature and could be powered by flashlight batteries. Single high-frequency light beam could carry thousands of TV signals, telephone calls, or other messages and might find greatest application when picture phones, high-speed computer conversations, and general communications needs expanded beyond existing carrying capacity. Bell scientists predicted laser ultimately would be pen-light size, cost a few dollars, and last a human lifetime. Laser included crystal semiconductor smaller than grain of sand, which operated on small currrent, eliminating need for extreme cooling. (Brody, NYT, 9/1/ 70)

Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit Institutions, Fiscal Year 1969 (NSF
70-27). Federal obligations to universities and colleges totaled $3453 million in FY 1969, second consecutive year in which Federal support increased by 2%. Federal obligations for academic science programs including R&D increased by 0.05%, from 2350 million in 1968 to $2361 million in 1969. r&d amounted to $1495 million in Federal obligations during FY 1969, 5% increase over 1968. Increase was accompanied by $47-million drop (45%) in Federal r&d plant investment, to $57 million, lowest level in 1963-1969 reporting period. (Text)
•	Time commented on resignation of Dr. Lee A. DuBridge as ost
Director and President’s Science Adviser: “Although he had initially warned the Administration that [budget] economies could turn the U.S. into a second-rate scientific power in some areas, he later seemed too willing to accept the cuts. Still, DuBridge could be an effective behind-the-scenes advocate.” He had helped persuade President Nixon to curtail use of defoliants in Vietnam, played key role in decision to ban germ warfare, and helped focus attention on environmental problems. “But in the face of the Administration’s tightfisted mood, it is doubtful whether he could have staved off the research cutbacks even if he had protested more vigorously.” (Time, 8/31/70,48)
During August: Boeing Co. announced it had built operational prototype of noise-suppressing sst engine inlet for testing with GE4 turbojet engine. Tests, to be completed by end of November, were to demonstrate compatibility and installed performance characteristics of propulsion system components. Inlet included movable centerbody that, when moved to aft position, created sonic wave in throat region, preventing emanation of most high-frequency sound from engine compressor components during landing approach. Boeing said movable centerbody feature, combined with sst’s rapid takeoff climb, would result in better takeoff and landing characteristics than those of Boeing 707 subsonic aircraft.

•	Mariner-Mars missions in 1971 were described by team of jpl scien-
tists headed by Dan Schneiderman in Astronautics & Aeronautics: “The first of these voyages of exploration begins. . .when, between May 6 and June 3, two Mariner-type spacecraft will rise from launch pads at Cape Kennedy on the way to Mars to become the first spacecraft to orbit that planet.” To obtain maximum scientific information, two identical spacecraft would perform separate missions, A and B. Each spacecraft would orbit Mars for 90 days in differing inclinations and periods. “Together they will cover 70% of the surface, permitting the study of seasonal effects. The information gained will help in selecting suitable landing zones for the unmanned Viking project which will land an instrument package on Mars.” Missions would carry six science experiments including TV experiment. TV pictures would enlarge understanding of dynamic characteristics, history, environment, and surface physiography of Mars and improve maps of surface. They were not expected to provide direct evidence of possibility of life, but to furnish indirect evidence of Mars’ suitability as habitat for life. (A&A, 8/70, 64-77)
•	Lawrence Lessing said in Fortune that satellites were “only hope in
sight” for comprehensive air traffic control: “Growing congestion and delays are seriously impairing U.S. and international airline
operations, and air-traffic control is at the nerve center of the congestive problem. For nearly a decade leading scientists have urged the development of an advanced space-satellite system for navigation and traffic control. Indeed, such a system is the only hope in sight if air traffic is to grow to its full potential through the rest of this century. Only now, under the pressure of events, is this proposal reaching a critical point of decision.” (Fortune, 8/70, 11586) .
•	International participation in erts program was discussed in Astro-
nautics A Aeronautics by John Hanessian, Jr., and John M. Logsdon, of George Washington Univ.: “Broad participation in erts. . .makes sense only if a global operational Earth-resources-survey system follows. The design and institutionalization of such a system will test the ingenuity of national and international policy makers, and any steps which may make their task less complex are desirable. Widespread international involvement in the ERTS program would be such a step. And it would.. .serve [both] the needs of many nations of the world and the national interest of the U.S. Many constraints on broad participation in erts stem from the level of funding and the pace now planned for the program. Thus it falls within the power of the U.S, to eliminate them. This we should do.” (AAA, 8/70, 56-63)
•	Significance of Soyuz IX in Soviet efforts toward permanent space
station was discussed in Science Journal: Although engineering tests and scientific observations had been made during June 2-19 mission, “major emphasis was on bio-medical problems of weightlessness and post-flight adaptation to normal terrestrial conditions.” Indications that cosmonauts’ systems were slow in readapting to normal gravity had prompted Soviet doctors to suggest it might be necessary to create artificial gravity in permanent space stations and in spacecraft on protracted journeys to planets. Soyuz had been described as “prototype space bus able to accommodate three cosmonauts in comfort and to commute with ease to orbital stations disembarking and taking on passengers through a forward hatch.” How rapidly U.S.S.R. advanced to this goal depended on many factors, “not the least the perfection of the new launch vehicle.” (Gatland, Science Journal, 8/70, 5,7)

ed by Albert J. Kelley, Dean of Boston College School of Management, in Astronautics A Aeronautics. “In the quest for application of technology to domestic and other internal problems, aerospace management with its ability to marshal resources to solve complex problems may well be the greatest [space program] spinoff. In addressing current and emerging problems, the most urgent tasks will be to identify the parts of the problem that can be solved by existing technology, to recognize the parts of the problem that need more r&d, to identify the resources needed to solve all elements of the problem, and to organize the resources and efforts and get the job done,” (AAA, 8/70,46-52)
•	Air Force and Space Digest editorial by John L. Frisbee advocated
“show and tell” method of alerting U.S. public to Soviet nuclear threat: “Today’s public skepticism about the realities of Soviet nuclear power, and its intended uses, is somewhat reminiscent of
the skepticism that existed in the fall of 1962, concerning allegations of Soviet missile-site construction in Cuba. That earlier skepticism disappeared when photos of the Cuban missile sites, taken from high-flying U-2 aircraft, were made public.” One way to awaken U.S. public to current Soviet threat “might be to release some of the satellite photography on which US analysis of the threat is based.” (AF/SD, 8/70,8)

September 2: NASA FY 1971 interim operating plan news conference was held in Washington, D.C. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, said principal decision was “how best to carry out the Apollo and other existing programs to realize maximum benefits from them while preserving adequate resources for the future. ... In our discussions, it became clear that the vitality of our national space program depends on a determined and vigorous continuation of plans for a reusable space shuttle followed by a space station in the manned flight program”; early development of erts, ATS, and HE AO; Grand Tour unmanned flights to distant planets; unmanned Viking Mars landers; Pioneer flights to Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter; and ‘a healthy aeronautical research program.”
“With all of these considerations in mind. . .actions have been taken that will effectively reduce NASA’s FY 1971 budget request of $3,333 billion to an interim operating plan of $3.2687 billion.. .and to minimize NASA’s budgetary requirements for future years.” Budget request for Apollo was being reduced by $42.1 million to $914.4 million by canceling Apollo 15 and 19 lunar missions and by phasing down manpower levels at major Apollo facilities more rapidly. Although Lunar and Planetary Missions Board and nas-nrc Space Science Board had strongly recommended, after special review, that NASA carry out all six remaining lunar landing missions, NASA had “most reluctantly concluded that a reduction. . .should be made.” Remaining Apollo missions would be redesignated 14 through 17 and would be flown before start of Skylab operations in November 1972. Schedule would allow additional flexibility by providing Apollo hardware for possible use in Skylab, space station, or other programs where manned operations or heavy boost capability would be required. Advanced mission studies would be reduced by $1 million.
Tracking and data acquisition network operations would be reduced $8 million by reducing number of manned flights and by more rapid phasedown in operating levels. Construction of facilities would be reduced to $25 million by deferring Polymer Research Laboratory at arc, Calibration Laboratory at MSC, and Multispectral Photo Laboratory at msfc and by rehabilitation and modification effort and facility planning and design. Research and program management minimum operating budget would be established at $678.7 million, amount included in previous appropriations bill and $13.6 million below NASA’s FY 1971 request.
Dr. Paine said NASA had concluded “that it is prudent and realistic. . .to make these decisions now.. .to avoid more drastic and disruptive actions which would result if the decisions were postponed until later in the fiscal year. We also no longer have the capability to prepare in parallel two Apollo spacecraft, as would be required to maintain an option to reach a later decision on the number of Apollo missions.”
Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers explained Apollo schedule changes: Apollo 14 would be launched as planned Jan. 31, 1971, followed at six-month intervals by Apollo 16 (renamed Apollo 15) with advanced capability for greater exploi-
tation of lunar exploration, Apollo 17 (renamed Apollo 16), and Apollo 18 (renamed 17), last launch in series. Beginning with Apollo 15 launch in July, eva would be increased from two periods to three and man-hours per mission, from 18 hrs to 40 hrs. Weight of landed scientific payload would be doubled, from 227 kg to 454 kg (500 lbs to 1000 lbs); SM experiment package would be added; and range and efficiency of surface operations would be increased by improved suit mobility, improved life support system, and addition of lunar roving vehicle. Crew for new Apollo 15 would be same as previously planned—Astronauts David R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, and James B. Irwin.
Skylab core module would be launched by Saturn V in November 1972, as scheduled, and would be revisited by Saturn IBs and csms up through June 1973. Beyond that, activities would be “at a standstill as far as orbital operations are concerned until the shuttle comes on line, hopefully in the 1976-77 time period.” (Text; Transcript)

•	Venus radius controversy was discussed in Science by mit scientist
W. B. Smith: Scientists had finally arrived at a consensus in interpreting certain data from Mariner V and Venus IV after “ebb and flood of recent opinion about Venus’s lower atmosphere as seen
from a moderately invariant (and biased) point of view—that of the ‘radar radius.’ ” Smith and associates had reported accurate determination of Venus’s radius in mid-1966. Value, derived from earth-based radar observations, was 6055.8 km (3762.9 mi). “In early 1967, two Mariner 5 experimenters visited us to ascertain our very latest value and our confidence in it, stressing the importance of the radius for the forthcoming Mariner 5 flyby.” Earliest Mariner V reports had shown Venus IV data inconsistent by about 24 km (14.9 mi) and asymmetry between night and day refractivity profiles of Venus. “The central question was: are the surface pressure Ps and Temperature Ts 19 atm and 553 K [536°F] as derived from Venera 4 data, or about 100 atm and 700 K [800°F] as derived from Mariner 5 data plus the radar radius?” Soviet scientist V. R. Eshleman had suggested that 2:1 ambiguity had occurred in altimeter. After reexamination of time systems used by Mariner V experimenters, Venus-centered distance of ray path had been decreased by 8.85 km (5.49 mi), “confirming our independent estimate of 10 km [6.21 mi] for this displacement. As a result, the refractivity profiles became nearly symmetric.” (Science, 9/4/70, 1001-2)

NASA’s cancellation of Apollo 15 and 19: Dr. Thomas Gold, Cornell Univ. astronomer and member of President’s Science Advisory Committee, had said, “It’s like buying a Rolls-Royce and then not using it because you claim you can’t afford the gas.”
Dr. Harold C. Urey, lunar expert and Nobel Prize winner, had said, “I think the American people and Congress should realize that the moon is an extremely old object. .. .this gives scientists a way of studying an object that goes back to the very beginning of the solar system.” Saving of $40 million by cancellation was “chicken feed” in view of $25 billion already spent on Apollo program.
Former scientist-astronaut Dr. Brian T. O’Leary said, “The scientific community has become disenchanted with NASA. The present decision seems ridiculous.” (NYT, 9/4/70, 9)
•	Editorials on Apollo program cutback:
New York Times: “Throughout the last decade this newspaper opposed the top priority then accorded Project Apollo on the ground that too much money was being diverted from urgent social needs. But now that these huge sums have been spent the need is to obtain the maximum yield, scientifically and otherwise, from that investment. Surely, NASA, which has been able to reach the moon, can find a better solution than the one now offered for adjusting to austerity in space research. One desirable alternative would be to enlist foreign resources in the exploitation of Apollo technology, perhaps by offering to send teams of British, French or Soviet astronauts on the journey pioneered by Apollo 11.” (NYT, 9/4/70)

•	Press comment on Apollo program cutback:
Washington Post editorial: “There has rarely been a major program that has gone up the hill and down again as fast as has the manned space program. Just a year ago NASA was riding high on the success of Apollo 11. Now it is scratching operations and scrambling for money to keep even a portion of the original program and its progeny in business. This, in our view, is bad because if it is carried too far it threatens to turn the entire manned space effort into the most spectacular (and most expensive) stunt in history instead of the first step in a genuine effort to learn a little more about some of the secrets of the universe. NASA’s decision to focus on the future rather than on a full study of the moon will help at least to keep the option of a worthwhile space program open.” (WPost, 9/6/70, B6)
Richard D. Lyons in New York Times: When U.S. politicians first proclaimed national effort to land men on moon influential scientific leaders had scoffed. “A decade later the scythe of discontent with Apollo has swung full circle. Now it is the politicians who are attacking the program while the scientists wring their hands over lack of support.” Nixon Administration had “not been kind to the space program, although the President repeatedly stated that he supports
it enthusiastically. The main reason is money, or the lack of it, which was almost no object when Apollo was bom.” (NYT, 9/6/70, 4:7)
•	End of ‘‘galloping science” was predicted by Kenneth W. Boulding of
Univ. of Colorado in Washington Post: “The scientific revolution and science-based technology represent a kind of takeoff from the old world of classical civilization. The ‘flight’ of development cannot go on forever. At some point there must be a re-entry into Spaceship Earth. This re-entry will present acute difficulties. If, however, we have a clear view of the nature of the problem, a certain optimism about our power to solve it is entirely reasonable. The one great cause for optimism indeed is the clear fact that the evolutionary potential of the human nervous system is very far from having been exhausted and that there is no nonexistence theorem at present about continued human learning.” (WPost, 9/6/70, Bl)

•	If Anglo-French supersonic transport Concorde emerged from test
series with reputation intact, it would “in its builders’ eyes confirm its image as the spearhead of European technology, and the last defense against American domination of the aviation industry,” Stephen V. Armstrong said in Washington Post. Public attention was focused on aircraft’s sonic boom. West Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, and Holland had said they were likely to ban supersonic flight over their territories because of boom. Instruments in Oban Cathedral in Scotland during recent Concorde 002 tests had shown boom produced between 10 300 and 20 700 newtons of pressure per sq m (1.5 and 3 psf)—equivalent of thunder, bac officials had predicted Concorde would produce no more noise than this in commercial service. Concorde opponents were concerned about U.S. reports that supersonic airliners could change weather patterns by condensing water vapor in atmosphere. Airlines had options on only 74 Concordes but bac was saying it could sell minimum of 200 by mid-1970s for $24 million each and was considering construction of larger model, which would hold 200 rather than 150 passengers. Concorde had already cost more than $1 billion and was expected to cost $650 million more by 1973. No one expected it to make enough to cover this expenditure. (WPost, 9/7/70, A13)

September 9-11: Lunar Science Institute in Houston, Tex., sponsored seminar on moon findings.
At meeting on future of Apollo, scientists proposed crater Tycho near moon’s south pole and Descartes, hilly region near Ocean of Storms, as sites for two of remaining four Apollo program lunar landings. Cal Tech geologist Dr. Leon T. Silver said, “If you had only two missions left to make, you’d send one of them to Tycho.” Tycho offered samples from area of one of last collisions of large meteor with lunar surface, samples from moon’s original southern hills, and samples from deep within moon that had come to surface after impact that had created Tycho. Flight path to and from Tycho would enable astronauts to photograph and examine almost half visible face of moon from lunar orbit. Astronauts could leave scientific instruments less than 1609 km (1000 mi) from moon’s south pole, to give earth-bound scientists listening post on lunar region that would otherwise go unexplored. Surveyor VII photos had shown Tycho landing to be strewn with many varieties of rocks. Difficulty with Tycho landing was that Apollo crew might have to use so much fuel getting to it that they would not have enough to return if they encountered difficulty on approach, Astronaut Charles M. Duke, Jr., said. Donald K. Slayton, msc Chief of Flight Crew Operations, said NASA was studying possibility of Tycho landing: “Our position so far is that Tycho is a bad place. ... But, if we can figure the reasonable way to do it.. .and decide it’s a reasonable place to go, then Tycho becomes a candidate for landing.”
Descartes, second site favored by scientists, contained relatively young volcanic material and also crust on surface away from volcanic highlands that might be as old as moon itself. It was thought to
be one of two Apollo sites where tnoonquakes might be occurring; other was hills of Fra Mauro, Apollo 14 landing site.
Dr. Alfred E. Ringwood of Australian National Univ. told seminar he had concluded from study of Apollo 11 and 12 lunar samples that moon once had heat source 160-480 km (100-300 mi) beneath surface that was emitting 1500 K (2200°F) temperatures. Heat had emanated from abundance of radioactive minerals in moon’s depths, he proposed, and partially melted moon’s inner rock, which then flowed to lunar surface through pores or forced its way upward as it expanded where pores did not exist. Upswelling rock, Dr. Ringwood said, caused lunar features visible on moon’s face. He speculated that moon had lost most of its radioactivity and heat 2 billion yrs earlier.
Dr. Charles P. Sonnett, ARC scientist, said he had found “little bumps” of magnetism along lunar surface when studying signals from instruments left on moon. Bumps suggested that radioactive heat was coming to surface and causing parts of moon to behave as if they had magnetic field. Moon was “strong and rigid to depth of 200 mi [322 km],” Dr. Sonnett said, “but I believe that all you need is a porosity of about 10 per cent in that crust to have a warmer and more plastic material leak to the top.”
Dr. Rolf Meisner of Univ. of Hawaii said analysis of data from Apollo 12 lunar seismometer led him to believe that moonquakes could not be caused by breaks in moon’s crust but were caused by warm gases escaping from beneath lunar surface in response to earth’s increased gravitational pull. He had recorded 14 moon-quakes, all of which seemed to come from about 240 km (150 mi) east-southeast of seismometer in Fra Mauro hills, where Apollo 14 was to land in February 1971.
Dr. Thomas Gold, Cornell Univ. astronomer, argued that lunar maria contained dust and not lava. Lack of electrical activity of surface material and the way Apollo moonquake detectors had reacted to tremors and impacts could mean there was deep deposit of powder. Acoustical signal from Apollo 12 lunar seismometer was “compatible with a deep layer of a very homogenous nature in which the speed of sound is uniform.” (O’Toole, WPost, 9/12/70, A3; 9/13/70, A27; Hill, H Chron, 9/13/70)

• Misgivings about NASA’s cancellation of Apollo 15 and 19 missions were expressed by 39 leading lunar scientists in letter to Rep, George P. Miller (D-Calif.), Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “The NASA policy leading to the cancellation appears to be one favoring the early construction of large manned
earth orbital systems following after Skylab A, and the effort and funds saved by the curtailment will probably go towards these. The merit of these programs for science or applications should be investigated, and the very important decision regarding their funding should in our view be made a separate step. At present, it appears that the approved and scientifically most fruitful lunar program will suffer in favor of an as yet unapproved program for whose scientific value there is no consensus, and whose purpose is unclear.” (Text)

September 11: Seismic signals obtained from seismograph carried by Apollo 12 crew at epicentral distance of 76 km (47.2 mi) from lm impact differed from any seen on earth, CornellUniv.radiophysi-cists Dr. Thomas Gold and Dn Steven Soter reported in Science. Signal caused by Apollo 12 lm was interpreted in terms of propagation between source and receiver through layer of powder in which sound velocity increased with depth. Increase, due to compaction, extended over several kilometers and led to concentration of seismic waves toward surface. Computer simulations using ray acoustics and based on assumption of randomly undulating lunar surface approximated the observed signal. Seismic amplitudes were enhanced in this medium over solid rock, so that observed signal required less power to be transmitted than previously estimated. (Science, 9/11/70,1071-5)	t

•	Management of U.S. and Soviet space programs were compared in
Science by Dr. Foy D. Kohler, former U.S. Ambassador to U.S.S.R., and Dr. Dodd L. Harvey, both of Univ. of Miami: Programs had been roughly equal in complexity and in input of resources. “If, as has been asserted, the U.S. moon undertaking represented a task equal in technological complexity to the total of all the great tasks performed by man from the building of the pyramids through explosion of the atom bomb, hardly less can be said of Soviet space enterprise.” Soviet investment in space program had been comparable to that of U.S., “if not substantially greater.” Both programs had depended for success on effective organization and use of existing organizations and expertise and both had required extensive organizational and administrative innovations and new management techniques.In both programs most of basic scientific knowledge and technology already existed. Organization and management had been complicated by necessity of serving both military and nonmilitary objectives and by pressures of diverging national interests. Both programs represented “organizational triumphs of a high order.” Aspect of U.S. moon landing now generally forgotten was “that a number of knowledgeable people were convinced it could not be done.”
Programs differed in that “to the Soviet regime.. .the name of the game in space has been ‘the system,’ not scientific and technological excellence as such.” In U.S., National Aeronautics and Space Act “reflected the operation of the representative process at what could be called its best.” Its provisions “subjected space activities to continuing congressional control in accord with long-established processes.” U.S. space effort represented “new sort of partnership between government, industry, and universities. . . a partnership that has benefited and strengthened each of the participants without impinging on their interests and integrity.”
Soviet space effort had had less impact on national economy than had U.S. effort. Soviet sources had revealed continuing shortcomings in computer technology and hardware upon which space program was dependent. Soviet scientists and technologists not directly engaged in space program did not receive direct knowledge of space program’s technical discoveries and innovations and were denied use of research tools and techniques employed. “The Soviets themselves are evidencing increasing agitation over their inability to match the United States in transferring ‘great prestige’ and ‘great accomplishments’ in science and technology to meet the general needs of society.” Authoritative statement indicated U.S.S.R. intended to triple space expenditures in next few years, while in U.S. “prevailing national mood seems to be moving strongly against investments for the future in favor of maximum utilization of resources for the immediate betterment of conditions of life.”
This raised question, “Has the whole operation represented but another highly successful one-shot exercise in crisis management, or has it represented incorporation into American society of a new way to organize, systematically and purposefully, the development and use of scientific and technological resources to the furtherance of national goals?” (Science, 9/11/70,1049-56)
September 12-24: U.S.S.R. launched Luna XVIunmanned lunar probe from Baykonur at 6:26 pm local time (9:26 am edt). Tass said purpose of mission was to explore moon and near-moon space and reported all systems were functioning normally.
On Sept. j7 LunaXVIentered near-circular lunar orbit with 110.1km (68.4-mi) altitude. Tass said ground controllers put spacecraft into elliptical orbit with 104.6-km (65-mi) apolune and 14.5-km (9mi) perilune. Rocket firing thrust spacecraft toward moon and braking rockets were fired 295 m (968 ft) from lunar surface. Main braking rockets were shut down 19.8 m (65 ft) above surface and Luna XVI softlanded on moon’s Sea of Fertility at 10:18 am Baykonur time (1:18 am edt ) Sept. 20. Scientists at Bochum Observatory in West Germany monitored spacecraft’s signals and reported TV pictures transmitted during and after landing were of excellent quality.
After collecting lunar samples and performing other undisclosed experiments, Luna XVI lifted off from moon. It had spent 26 hrs 25 min on lunar surface. Tass announced that spacecraft’s mission was the “solution of a radically new task—automatic unmanned delivery of lunar ground to earth.” Samples, Tass said, were obtained with earth-operated electric drill that penetrated to 350 mm (13.7 in) and were placed in container by a “manipulator” and hermetically sealed in. Spacecraft’s landing stage was used as launch pad for liftoff from moon on command from earth. After liftoff spacecraft entered “ballistic trajectory of flight to the earth close to the predetermined one.”
Luna XVI entered earth atmosphere at 10:00 am Baykonur time (1:00 am edt) Sept. 24 and parachuted onto steppes of Kazakhstan 26 min later, after 11-day 16-hr mission. Capsule containing lunar samples was recovered by helicopter for delivery to Soviet Academy of Sciences.
Luna XVI was first unmanned spacecraft to land on moon and return to earth with lunar samples. In last mission in series Luna XV

•	Washington Post editorial on President’s Sept. 11 statement on air pi-
racy: “It is particularly important that Mr. Nixon recognizes the cardinal need to deprive hijackers of a safe haven. One of the scandals of international diplomacy is that the proposed treaty to require all countries either to extradite or punish hijackers did not go into effect long ago. It would be unwise, however, to await ratification of this treaty by all the countries concerned: airline security is too important to wait on national politics. What is required is suspension of airline services to countries that cannot or will not crack down on hijackers. Mr. Nixon calls upon the international community to take ‘joint action’ to this end. This. . .does not go far enough. The United States should unilaterally suspend air services to offending countries. By its example and influence, it should constrain other governments to follow suit.” (WPost, 9/12/70, A18)

September 14: Dr. Thomas O. Paine addressed Economic Club of Detroit in last public appearance as NASA Administrator. He summarized NASA projections of potential space advances to year 2000-advances U.S., U.S.S.R., Western Europe, and Japan, alone or in concert, would have industrial and economic resources to realize. For both America and other countries, response to challenge would “determine their futures.” _
New space transportation system—with reusable space shuttle to make return trips to orbit with passengers and cargo, permanent orbiting space station, and automated and manned space tugs for emplacing and recovering satellites and for transportation between orbits—was “bridge to our future in space.” Space shuttle would be “nasa’s major single effort during the next ten years.”
New approach to large payloads based on shuttle booster stage would offset termination of Saturn V after completion of Apollo lunar landings by 1972. Skylab program scheduled to start during 1973 would provide basis for final design of space station. Integrated lunar exploration in early 1980s could use station in lunar orbit as platform for descent to any portion of moon’s surface for up to 14 days. Broad, vigorous, unmanned program to explore planets in 1970s would be start of orderly program to visit every planet in solar system, blazing trail for manned trips to Mars and Venus before end of century.
“The space in orbit two hundred miles [320 km] above the earth can be thought of as a vast new continent, equal in area to the surface of the entire globe.” Discovered only a dozen years ago, new continent would “become increasingly important as the leading world source of global information and communication services and then, inevitably, as a new home of men from earth.” Beyond solar system, automated and manned astronomical probes would “extend our understanding of the universe through more intensive investigations in optical and radio astronomy and space physics.” Before century’s end, man might find answers to “the overwhelming questions of man’s origin, his destiny, and of his uniqueness as the bearer of intelligence in the universe.” Man “may indeed be unique— but the odds against it approach a thousand billion billion to one. ... Every experiment so far has been negative, but the search will continue. ... We do not know what may exist, but we are upon the verge of knowing.”
Of Apollo program Dr. Paine said, “History may record that the substitution of major international technical competition, in place of war, was the great and unprecedented peacekeeping breakthrough of our era.” Benefit on international social and technical change was “evident to all.” (Text)
• Three of nine USAF volunteers began test at msc to determine man’s physiological tolerance to reentry loads expected on space shuttle missions. Subjects, whose reactions to shuttle reentry profile had been measured after 24 hrs rest Sept. 9-11 would rest in bed seven days before riding centrifuge in “eye balls down” reentry configurations at 2.5-g to 4.5-g levels for up to 6 min 10 secs to determine what effect prolonged “eye balls down” reentry acceleration would have on space shuttle crew members and passengers after long periods of weightlessness. Normal space shuttle reentry mode of MSC

•	House Committee on Science and Astronautics published For the
Benefit of All Mankind: A Survey of the Practical Returns from Space Investment (H. Rpt. 91-1446): Space Research “already has produced an extremely broad range of concrete benefits, not only to the American citizenry but to the people of many nations. The flow of ‘hard benefits’ has grown from a trickle to a stream, and it is widening to a river, as expanding technology uncovers more and more ways of improving man’s mode of existence.” Report cited tangible benefits in business, medicine, transportation, construction, new fabrics, and new materials. Future benefits “of even greater impact” included use of satellites for more efficient management of earth’s natural resources, use of satellites in crime detection, and possible development of hospitals in space “which would offer gravity-free treatment to patients with heart ailments.” Illustrations, based on existing or impending technology, were the “extra dividends which are a fallout of ingenious application of space experience by business, industry, commerce, Government, the medical profession, and the academic community. Those dividends already paid, coupled with those in sight for the near-term future, affect practically every facet of human convenience and concern. They promise continuing and increasing return on the space investment for the benefit of mankind on earth today.” (Text)

September 15: Dr. Thomas O. Paine’s resignation as NASA Administrator became effective. He was honored at Bolling afb reception and testimonial dinner given by Dr. George M. Low, who would be Acting Administrator until appointment of successor.
Dr. Paine told guests he believed requirements of U.S. space program “are not understood at the highest level of our official life” and said he was confident NASA budget would be approved despite President’s Aug. 11 veto of Independent Offices and HUD appropriations bill. U.S., he said, “must be the first nation to put in the first skylab and space stations. We must look to the post-dog-sled era of lunar exploration and develop a more permanent type of lunar exploration.” Dr. Paine warned that NASA must “face the reality that in the 70s the Soviet Union will attempt to overtake us. ... We will be tested against a strong and vigorous Soviet program.” U.S. had “held out the olive branch.. .but if the cold war is extended into space, then NASA will be ready to meet any threat that may develop in space.” According to Washington Evening Star, it was first time Dr. Paine had publicly cited threat of Soviet military supremacy in space. Later, in interview following dinner, Dr. Paine said he meant NASA’s charge was to keep U.S. in forefront of space technology and to be ready to hand that technology to dod if required. He believed defense against icbm might yet be space-based. If so, NASA should be in technologically superior position because of space station, shuttle, and other concepts. (W Star, 9/16/ 70, B8, C7)

Could they provoke or inspire the 126 member governments of the United Nations to concur on a modest advance of the rule of law in international affairs to deal effectively with this crime?” Secretary General U Thant had warned that U.N. had perhaps only another decade in which to become effective or perish. U.N. pioneer Lester Pearson had predicted it would not survive 50 yrs unless it could strengthen machinery to maintain peace and security. “An effective move to restore peace and tranquility to international air travel could be a modest first response to those warnings —if member governments, including the United States, are ready.” (NYT, 9/15/70,44)

•	Summary of confidential dot report on SST to President’s Council on
Environmental Quality was released to press by “qualified sources.” Report recommended that SST development proceed pending study of possible minor harmful effects on environment. More research was needed on temperature increases that would be caused by water vapor and exhaust from SST; airport noise from SST would be higher than desired; and occupants of SST would receive radiation doses higher than occupants of subsonic jets flying at lower altitudes. However, SST’s steep angle of climb should make overall community noise no higher than noise from existing jets. Exposure of SST passengers and crews to high-altitude radiation would be lessened by SST’s greater speed, which would shorten transit time. SST might increase uv radiation reaching earth’s surface and decrease ozone in upper atmosphere, but these effects were “insignificant” and within present-day variations. Possible effect on temperature from increased water vapor should be of no practical significance in temperate and tropical zones, but could be of significance in some isolated polar areas.

•	The Wartime Journals of Charles A. Lindbergh were reviewed by Eric
F.	Goldman in New York Times Book Review: Journals covered 1937-1945, “when the celebrated flyer was in Europe surveying military aviation; the battle between President Franklin Roosevelt and the isolationists, during which Lindbergh stumped the United States as the star speaker of the anti-interventionists. . .; war years when, denied an Air Corps commission, he served as a civilian aeronautical expert in private industry and in the Pacific, also managing to
work in 50 combat missions; and the weeks just after the Nazi surrender, which found him again in Europe, attached to a Naval Mission studying wartime developments in plane design and missiles.”
Journals snowed Lindbergh as “a first-rate mind who was widely informed yet retained certain key areas of na'ivet6, an instinctive tinkerer with a passion for science as an idea and a gifted scientist who worried over the ‘narrow-mindedness’ of the pursuit, a man who read Plato the night before inspecting aviation factories and Dostoevsky in between speeches before roaring crowds, a hard-hitting bombadier screeching down over Japanese installations while he contemplated the beauty of God’s nature and the dignity of man.” (NYT Book Review, 9/20/70,1,42)

President Nixon’s program against air piracy, before House Committee on Ways and Means. As first step, dot had urged ICAO to establish basic principles for effective sanctions: State in which hijacked aircraft landed was obligated to permit passengers and crew to continue journey and to return aircraft and cargo to owners. State to which hijacker fled was obligated to extradite or prosecute hijacker. Multilateral sanctions should be taken against states that failed to fulfill obligations. U.S. had urged ICAO to draft international convention providing legal basis for effective sanctions.
To finance program of placing armed Government employees on U.S. carriers and extension of surveillance equipment at airports, dot had submitted $28-million FY 1971 budget amendment to Senate Appropriations Committee.

•	Soviet press and radio underlined importance of Luna XVI mission.
Tass carried interview with unidentified deputy chief designer of spacecraft, who demonstrated prototype of drill used to obtain lunar
samples and said similar device “will bring one day rock samples from Venus, Mars, and other planets of our solar system to earth. Man will go to other planets sometime in the future, but before this is possible, these planets will have to be explored for a long time by automatic stations. At present, an apparatus of a radically new type has been designed in principle. In the long run it will be modified to suit specific tasks. .. .A flight to Mars will require somewhat different technical solutions than a flight to the moon. But the main complex elements of Luna 16—its ability to take off in the directon of a desired celestial body, make a soft-landing on the surface of the planet, operate on it and then start off in the direction of the earth or the planet from which it started—will remain unshakable.”
In Izvestia Georgy I. Petrov, head of Soviet Institute for Space Research, said man would still play a role in lunar research, but only in limited way. He said short visits by man appeared useful but he proposed manned orbiting moon stations equipped with automatic spacecraft capable of descending to moon, moving over surface, conducting scientific research, and returning to orbiting station.

September 22-25: Eurospace, organization of European industries concerned with space, sponsored conference on cooperation in space in Venice, Italy. Theo Lefevre, Belgian Minister for Scientific Policy and Planning and head of European Space Conference, reported on his Sept. 16-17 negotiations with U.S. Government. He confirmed that, in return for European commitment to participate in development of space shuttle and related hardware, U.S. would launch European spacecraft until shuttle was available. Charge for each launch would not exceed cost of rocket and its firing.
Predominant theme of conference, was that reusable shuttles would substantially lessen cost of practical uses of space. There was little talk of manned space stations or exploration of other planets. Discussions centered on use of satellites for communications, air traffic control, and weather forecasting. European public had become “cool to manned space flight,” New York Times said. ESRO head, Dr. Herman Bondi, said at conference, “We have grown up with the impression that everything in space is devilishly expensive.” Belgian aerospace executive Maurice Desirant said European efforts at joint space programs had been handicapped by pressures to perform national feats. Now, however, European countries had become “more and more aware of the dangers.” They had seen money wasted on duplicated efforts which had achieved limited results.
Lefevre said that, to be effective, European contribution to major space effort must be under leadership strong enough to override any differences arising from “divergent technical points of view, reasons of industrial competition, economic whims for national politics or finances.”

September 26: First published eyewitness account of lunar samples brought from Sea of Fertility by Soviet Luna XVI was given in Izvestia by B. Konovalov: Lunar dust turned greenish and sometimes reddish under direct light but in general looked like “dry mud.” Later New York Times said Izvestia correspondent Konovalov had been permitted to observe lunar material at special Soviet Academy of Sciences laboratory in Moscow, where initial examination was taking place. Exact location of laboratory and names of top officals in Luna XVIprogram were being kept secret.
Konovalov had reported container of samples had been placed in cylindrical stainless steel chamber with portholes. Pumps had sucked oxygen from chamber and sterilizing gas had been injected. Chamber had been filled with helium gas to prevent reaction with moon samples. Then container, which included moon rock and its electrical drill, had been opened for observation. Rock had been placed on steel trough containing scale divisions. Some material would be taken in special bags to other laboratories for examination. Konovalov’s reference to lunar “dust” had been first use of term by Soviet journalist, New York Times said. Previous references had been to “lunar surface,” “lunar ground,” or “lunar rock.”

September 27: U.S. space program problems were described in Washington Post by Thomas O’Toole: U.S. needed to begin development of space shuttle “now, which in a way is the worst possible time for it.” Country was “weary of big new space projects, particularly while the spectacular Apollo project is -still unfolding. . . . Also, the space agency is without an appointed administrator, which means that NASA cannot exercise its full role with Congress or the
White House.” NASA managers “go on sailing a skipperless ship. But what they find more disturbing is the feeling that nobody at headquarters cares whether the ship gets a captain or not.” It was no secret that “men who run the space program are deeply disappointed in the Nixon Administration.” They felt “that the White House neither understands nor cares to understand what the space program means or what it can do for the country.” There was feeling Congress had ceased to care, too. House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on nasa Oversight had canceled hearings on Apollo future because, “outside of Rep.

dustry was traced in Air Force magazine by Karl G. Harr, Jr., aia President. Increased performance had increased complexity. Average 1944 combat aircraft had carried 454 kg (Vi ton) of avionic gear; 1948-1950 counterpart needed three to five times as much.
Weapon revolution did not signify end of manned aircraft era; it brought forth “new family of aircraft of substantially improved capability.” First operational “barely supersonic” 1954 fighter had been followed by succession of more advanced fighters. “The complexity curve took a sharp upward turn, taking the cost curve with it,” with corollary decline in numbers of aircraft produced. Fewer aircraft were needed because of individual aircraft’s superior performance.
With advent of supersonic aircraft production, guided missile output became significant portion of industry workload. Big push had come in 1954 when missile procurement topped billion-dollar level for first time.
“Undoubtedly, the space program was the dominant influence in history’s most explosive decade of technological advance. There were two primary contributing factors: breadth and acceleration.” Breadth of program required continual probing of new research frontiers across spectrum of almost every scientific and technological discipline. “The acceleration of effort imposed by the lunar-landing timetable necessitated a forcing of technology, compressing into one decade the normal advance of several.” (AF, 9/70, 84-8)

•	Sales of military and civilian aircraft in 1970 would drop to $14 billion,
down $3.4 billion from 1968 peak, Dan Cordtz wrote in Fortune. Employment was off 15% from 1969, “with further Substantial layoffs already announced.” Evidence was mounting “that future volume simply will not support the present number of competitors.” Outlook was “ruinous scramble for a permanantly shrunken market, with some companies squeezed out of aircraft production and even the survivors forced to subsist on meager rations. A decade ago, a dozen airframe manufacturers were able to thrive; a few years hence, its is difficult to see profitable business for more than three or four.” (Fortune, 9/70,114-7, 199-201)

Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers and program officers gave status of programs, plans for 1970s, and studies leading into 1980s.
Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, announced selection of Hadley-Apennine site for lunar landing of Apollo 15, scheduled for launch July 25, 1971. Site, cut by large gorge along base of mountains, was 3° east of moon’s center and 25° north of lunar equator on edge of Sea of Rains. Apollo 15 crew would collect material from base of Apennine Mountains, examine Hadley Rille area, sample fresh-looking mare and volcanic-like features, and deploy ALSEP. Apollo 16 would be launched in January 1972 and Apollo 17, in June 1972. High-priority landing sites were Copernicus, Davy, Descartes, and Marius Hills.
To improve CSM return capability in emergencies after landing on moon, an LM descent battery and third tank would be added to Apollo 14 SM. Additional potable water would be generated and stored on way.tomoon.
Douglas R. Lord, Deputy Director of Space Station Task Force, described plans for 12-man space station weighing 49 985-54 400 kg (110 000-120 000 lbs) that could remain in earth orbit for up to 10 yrs.
Richard J. Allen of Space Shuttle Task Force said NASA was developing plans for shuttle with 100-mission reusable capability. Myers said dod was “very much involved” with shuttle activities. “We have a joint committee operating with the Air Force. . .for continuous communication and review of requirements.” He saw “possibility of international cooperation on certain flights and [U.S.] military use of the vehicle on others.” Myers said he had discussed with European officials possibility of participation in space shuttle program on three levels: orbit-to-orbit space tug, “cleanly separable and easily interfaced piece of equipment” that would probably be managed by European consortium and financed with European dollars; subcontracts from American companies to European contractors without transfer of American money ; and use of technological contributions from European national space activities and national aircraft establishments.

released by Planning Steering Group for erc closing. Report was prepared by Deputy Administrator for Administration Boyd C.
Myers II, Steering Group Chairman, and members of group; ERC Task force; and DOT. Following ERC closing on June 30, 1970, new DOT center functioned “reasonably well.” All but 85 former ERC employees had jobs; NASA had programs and equipment it needed. DOT had ample equipment for new center and 27 universities were pursuing new work relevant to NASA interest. “Most important, the government and the nation were in a position to fully utilize a national capability of nearly $60 million in facilities and equipment and over 740 highly capable people on new programs. NASA had retained the highest priority work and related equipment.” Move was almost completed in six months but personal equipment packing and shipping and disposition of leased space would take about 60 days.
Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator at time of ERC closing, had directed disposition priorities: people first, program second, and physical facilities third, with every employee placed in appropriate job at higher salary. “While these objectives could not be entirely achieved sequentially, there was no question about the prime importance Dr. Paine placed on the actions affecting each individual employee.” (Text)

We should gamble not on a questionable investment, but on the ability of our economy and our prestige to withstand the impact of losing one part of one industry’s market if the Concorde lives up to its sponsors’ expectations. The ssTprogram should be shelved.” (W Star, 10/4/70, Bl)
October 4-10: Twenty-first International Astronautical Federation Congress was held at Constance, West Germany. During opening session Klaus von Dohnanyi, Parliamentary Secretary to West German Minister of Education and Science, appealed to nearly 1000 participants to preserve peaceful nature of space research and prevent space technology from producing “fresh weapons escalation.” Apollo 13 Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr., and Fred W. Haise, Jr., and Apollo 9 Astronaut (now msc Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager) James A. McDivitt attended Congress.
Soviet scientist Dr. K. Y. Kondratyev described October 1969 experiment in which Soyuz VI and VII spacecraft had been observed simultaneously from on>. aircraft at 7900-m (26 000-ft) altitude, from one at much lower altitude, and from ground, to determine atmospheric distortion of observations of earth surface from space. Additional observations from Soyuz IX in June 1970 and automated measurements from unmanned Cosmos CCXLIII launched Sept. 23, 1968, had combined to show fully equipped space station could clearly identify forms and densities of vegetation; chart geologic formations in inaccessible regions; identify soil suitable for agriculture; trace origin of fungus blights; sight outbreaks of blight and pinpoint forest fires; chart ground temperatures, identifying trends in volcanic activity and mountain building; detect erosion patterns invisible from ground; record seasonal flow patterns in watershed; monitor spread of pollutants; monitor seas for fish movement and evidence of pollution; and transmit photos indicating safe shipping lanes in Arctic ice pack areas. Dr. Kondratyev said orbital space station could be developed within next 5 to 10 yrs and be equipped with sensor system to scan earth at wide range of wavelengths for remote sensing of environment.

Dr. Charles A. Berry, msc Director of Medical Operations, and Prof. Oleg G. Gazenko, Director of Soviet Institute of Biomedical Problems, said selection of crews for longer space missions would require special personality testing to identify persons of more dominant type for assignment of roles compatible with that trait. Dr. Berry said he thought use of multinational flight crews was good idea but chances for Orbiting International Laboratory (oil) in near future seemed slim because of problems of language, attitudes, and prejudices such as food preferences. “We can’t have a restaurant with a very large menu.” In interview, Dr. Berry and Prof. Gazenko discussed flashes of light experienced by astronauts in space with eyes closed or in darkened spacecraft. Dr. Berry believed flashes might be produced by heavy cosmic ray particles—atomic nuclei of intermediate weight—that produced ionization in eye retina, affected nervous system, or caused light flashes within eye fluid. Dr. Gazenko said heavy cosmic rays were insufficiently frequent to account for flashes. Soviet cosmonauts had not experienced phenomenon. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/12/70, 19)
Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Vitaly I. Sevastyanov said muscles of Soyuz IX crew were so atrophied after June 2-19 mission that they stood up with difficulty and walked with peculiar stamping steps. On landing they were so weak that ground crew had to assist them from hatch. Sensation of heaviness lasted 10 to 11 days. Crew had performed antiatrophy exercises during mission but more intensive exercise program might be needed for flights to other planets, with simulation of gravity included. Cosmonauts felt effects of weightlessness were not dangerous unless experienced for more than one month. Soyuz IX cosmonauts displayed photos of June 2 launch and colored films taken inside spacecraft during 18-day orbit. Nikolayev said cosmonauts had slept with head down before launch, to become accustomed to rush of blood to head that had bothered previous cosmonauts and astronauts on early part of flights. Soyuz spacecraft had three sections: orbital module in which cosmonauts slept, exercised, and played chess; central module with three windows and couches for use in liftoff and reentry; and third module containing service equipment. Both orbital and service modules were jettisoned before reentry. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/10/70) Indian government scientists H. G. S. Murthy, E. V. Chirnis, and K. S. Karnik urged U.S. and U.S.S.R. to share economic benefits of space exploration with developing nations. “International cooperation in global planning of assistance for the operation of meteorological communications and navigation satellites will go a long way in helping developing countries. National space programs in developing countries are not a luxury, but a necessity.” (Benedict, AP, Huntsville Times, 10/7/70)
Third International Symposium on Space Rescue was held as part of iaf congress. Cochairman P. A. Campbell said letter from Soviet Academy of Sciences had nominated for first time four Soviet engineers to serve on IAF’s 11-nation committee studying space rescue. Later AP quoted iaf Congress sources as saying Soviet engineers might meet with U.S. experts at MSC in November.
Herbert Schaefer and Dr. Jack W. Wild of nasa Advanced Manned Missions program said space rescue vehicles would have to be versatile, with several payloads kept at hand to deal with variety of emergencies. Standardized docking system would be needed on all future manned spacecraft to permit rescue by any nation. NASA Assistant Safety Director Philip H. Bolger said, “The rescue of stranded astronauts is a concern recognized by all nations and therefore provides a common base for establishing international cooperation.” It was too late to develop rescue system for four remaining Apollo flights, but reliability of Apollo spacecraft was being improved. Bolger said Skylab three-man space station scheduled for 1972 launch might have double protection—spacecraft that could be separated and returned to earth and standby rescue rocket at ksc. (AP, W Star, 10/8/70, A4; Sullivan, NYT, 10/8/70,4)
LeRoy E. Day, Manager of NASA Space Shuttle Task Group, described system characteristics of space shuttle: “It should be a fully reusable two-stage vertical take-off and horizontal landing space vehicle” that could transport 11 340 kg (25 000 lbs) to the design reference orbit of 500 km (310 mi) at 55° orbital inclination. Shuttle “must have a large internal cargo bay which will give it the capability of carrying a variety of manned and unmanned payloads to low earth orbit. The large internal payload compartment will allow the shuttle to deliver to low earth orbit both a satellite and a high energy stage for a synchronus orbit or a planetary mission. We expect the gross jift-olf weight. . .to be approximately 1.6 million kilograms [3.5 million lbs] fully fueled and with the payload on-board.” Rocket engines would be one of most critical subsystems “For both the booster and the orbiter we will use high pressure hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines which can be throttled to keep the acceleration during ascent to less than 3 g’s.” (Text)
Dr. George E. Mueller, General Dynamics Corp. Vice President and former NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said U.S. space shuttle could be “golden transport” to carry passengers between any two cities on earth in an hour in 1980s. Shuttle could be converted easily to transport flying to 130-km (80-mi) altitude and plunging back to target city at approximately 18 500 km per hr (11 500 mph). Rocket-boosted aircraft would take off vertically, eliminating noise problem. Other nations might purchase U.S. shuttle for $50 million. (AP, B Sun, 10/10/70, A3)

•	Space applications of plutonium 238 were discussed by Dr. Glenn T.
Seaborg, aec Chairman, at Fourth International Conference on Plutonium and Other Actinides in Santa Fe, N. Mex. Most noteworthy use of plutonium-238-powered, radioisotope thermoelectric generator (rtg) had been as SNAP-27, power source for Apollo 12 experimental package left on moon, rtg’s were “of particular interest as space electric power sources for missions requiring a long life and high reliability, where there are long periods of darkness or great distance from the sun, or where orientation or other problems tend to reduce the effectiveness of solar cells as an energy source.” Significant number of future space missions might require plutonium 238 power source.
Element “finds another extremely important use in space as the power source for waste disposal.” Heat from plutonium 238 decay would both produce bactena-free drinking water from waste products and incinerate waste itself. After Apollo, exploration of moon might continue with robot vehicles. “The maintenance and servicing of space stations and nerva engines in space may be done more easily and safely by robots than by man.... Nuclear power would be an obvious candidate power system.” (Text)
•	American Institute of Physics held meeting at Rockefeller Univ. in
New York. Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of Rockefeller Univ., received Karl Taylor Compton Award for distinguished statesmanship in science.
During interview following meeting Dr. William D. McElroy, NSF Director, said NSF had begun testing use of large teams of scientists from different disciplines under Federal funding as new approach to basic scientific research. -NSF had allocated $70 million in 1970 for studies of pressing national and social matters.
Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, MIT Provost and science adviser to President Kennedy, said priorities had been misplaced. He advocated a national science policy. “If I invented a new military system to stop tanks, I could get $100 million at the snap of my fingers. But if I say we want to develop a new method of medical care, I don’t know if I could raise $ 10 million. ”
Dr. Harvey Brooks, Harvard Univ. Dean of Engineering, said: “The central problem is how science can be reasonably responsive to social problems without destroying itself as science. The health of science depends on its capacity to develop its own intellectual laws. If it attempts to become too responsive, it loses its integrity, and I see a danger of that happening now.” (Reinhold, NYT, 10/6/ 70,1)
October 6: Termination of manned space flight within three years was urged at Washington, D.C., press conference by four Senators and space scientists Dr. James A. Van Allen of Umv. of Iowa and Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ. Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) said, “I want to shift spending from space extravaganzas to needy programs.” Sen. Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.) said, “The space shuttle. , .should not be allowed to go forward until the proper role of manned versus, unmanned exploration has received a fuller examination than it has to date.” Both Senators, with Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) and Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), favored continuation of four remaining Apollo flights and three-mission Skylab program but called for ending manned flight on their completion. Dr. Van Allen advocated unmanned space program after Skylab that would devote two thirds of its funds to direct applications of space with remainder devoted to “scientific experiments to examine the solar system.” Dr. Gold said, “If we fritter away our limited resources on unwanted further demonstrations of manned flights [U.S.S.R.] may, with much smaller means, get way ahead in all the areas that really count.” He predicted that, if space station was built, it would be “focal point of anti-science and anti-intellectual-ism which is very much in predominance today.” (Lyons, NYT, 10/7/70,21)

•	Discovery of tektite glass in Apollo 12 sample 12013, reported June
5th by gsfc scientist Dr. John A. O’Keefe, was debated in Science by Dr. O’Keefe, Univ. of Houston geologist Elbert A. King, Jr., and lrl scientists R. Martin and Weldon B. Nance.
Analyses of sample by King, Martin, and Nance had led them to conclude that “there is no existing chemical or mineralogical observation or data that uniquely support the idea that tektites originate from the moon. There are abundant chemical data that support a close genetic relationship between tektites and terrestrial rock materials. These data have been presented or summarized by numerous authors. Tektite glass has not been found in samples from Apollo 12 (or Apollo 11).”
Dr. O’Keefe responded: “They find that the material is crystalline rather than glassy. The crystals are, however, evidently rather fine; from statistical considerations it can be judged that the agreement of the two major-element analyses given for samples of only a few tens of millograms is likely only if the crystals are of the order of 100m m [0.04 in] or smaller in diameter. This raises the question whether they are the products of devitrefication. In any case, the former existence of a liquid of this composition seems to be implied. Evidence of somewhat similar liquids was found in the Apollo 11 sample.” (Science, 10/9/70, 199-200)
•	Analysles of argon in Apollo II crystalline rocks at LRL were reported
in Science by MSC scientist Dr. Donald D. Bogard, State Univ. of New York scientists Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer and Dr. John G. Funkhouser, and Max Planck scientist Dr. Josef Zaehringer. Crystalline rocks from Sea of Tranquility had yielded potassium-argon dates as old as 3.8 billion yrs. Crystalline rocks from Ocean of Storms gave potassium-argon ages as old as 2.8 billion yrs. Scientists concluded that maria were ancient lunar features. Potassium-argon ages of rocks from Ocean of Storms showed more argon loss than rocks from Sea of Tranquility, indicating Ocean of Storms rocks had experienced more severe shock effects or longer cooling rates.

•	Thermal properties of lunar magnetic rocks at high temperatures were
evaluated m Science by Univ. of Oregon volcanologists Tsutomu Murase and Alexander R. McBirney: “Thermal conductivity of a synthetic lunar rock in its melting range is about half that of a terrestrial basalt. The low conductivity and increased efficiency of insulating crusts on lunar lavas will enable flows to cover great distances without being quenched by high radiant heat losses from the surface. For a given rate of heat production, the thermal gradient of the moon would be significantly, steeper than that of earth.” (Science, 10/9/70,165-7)
•	Implications of failure of Mariner VI and VII uv experiments to de-
tect emissions associated with nitrogen in Martian atmosphere were discussed in Science by Harvard College Observatory and SAO astronomer A. Dalgarno and M. B. McEIroy of Kitt Peak National
Observatory. Examination of physical and chemical processes causing nitrogen emission in Martian airglow had shown that if atmosphere was uniformly mixed, mixing ratio of nitrogen to carbon dioxide of 5% was consistent with observational data on uv dayglow of Mars. If magnitude of the eddy coefficient in atmosphere was similar to that for earth, this limit was reduced to less than 0.5%. (Science, 10/9/70,167-8)

October 13: NASA Hq. press briefing cited background events leading to scheduled U.S.-U.S.S.R. Moscow meeting on compatible space docking procedures and hardware [see Oct. 12]. Arnold W. Frutkin, Assistant Administrator for International Affairs, said government-to-government discussions with U.S.S.R. had begun in 1962 “when some substantive possibilities were explored and. . .first agreements were reached.” These had included coordinated meteorological satellite projects, joint mapping of earth’s magnetic field in space for joint use of Echo satellites, and joint approach to publication of U.S. and U.S.S.R. achievements,in space medicine and biology. There had been “continuing overtures” since 1962, which “moved to a more accelerated pace beginning in.. .April 1970, when Dr. Paine took a personal interest in the problem and addressed a number of letters. . .to academician Keldysh.. .President of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.”
Compatible docking procedures had been discussed for first time by Dr. Paine and Soviet academician Dr. Anatoly A. Blagonravov in New York in April 1970. Subject had been discussed on subsequent Moscow visits by Dr. Philip Handler, NAS President; Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator; and Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman. First formal proposal for exploration of subject had been made by Dr. Paine in letter to Keldysh July 31, 1970.
Frutkin said U.S.S.R. had chosen compatible docking for discussion out of “long list of initiatives from the U.S. side.” Space rescue and joint experiments had not been discussed. Release of news of impending U.S.-U.S.S.R. discussions’ [at future iaf space rescue committee meeting] from iaf conference in Constance, Germany,
Oct. 8 had been coincidence; NASA overtures had been direct, not through iaf. (Transcript)

gineers unemployed “and this number could easily double next year.1’ Major concern was “that in the future a new shortage of scientists and engineers will arise, based on the growing disenchantment with the unstable labor market for such skills,” Implications were clear: “We are losing the capability to react to a national crisis, should the need arise; we are losing the capability to undertake an Apollo-like adventure, should we in the future desire to do so; and we are losing a capability that today provides an inflow of dollars that exceeds the net positive balance or payments.”
Cost of U.S. space program in 1970 was $3.4 billion—decrease of $2.5 billion since 1966. In terms of Federal budget, $3.4 billion represented 1.7% or $17 for every person in U.S. “At the same time we are spending $400 per person for our domestic programs. ... In fact, this year’s increase in our expenditures for domestic programs was more than twice the NASA budget." Cancellation of entire space program would not significantly affect Federal spending on domestic programs. “But without the space program, without the capabilities it represents, what would become of the ‘scientific and technological lead’ this generation of Americans gave so much of themselves and their resources to achieve?” (Text)

Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, said in speech at meeting: “nasa and the aerospace industry are not uniquely qualified to solve our domestic problems. The domestic problems, including those of the physical environment, are largely social, economical, and political. The need for new technology, for research and development, does exist in some areas, but certainly is not the driving force in obtaining solutions.” Solutions “must come from sociologists, economists, and politicians—not engineers and scientists. We in aerospace should. . .assist wherever and whenever we can: We have developed techniques of management that may apply; there are technological problems that we are qualified to tackle; and there are areas where space technology, and the applications of space technology, apply directly. We should assist, but we should not think or encourage others to believe that we can solve all of our domestic problems.”
Space program had “one major deficiency—a gap in manned space flight after Skylab, a hiatus of four years or more when no American will be in earth orbit, or anywhere in space.” Gap had to be accepted because of lack of funding. Decision to cancel Viking or delay space shuttle would be wrong. “Viking is the major scientific experiment of the decade, and a delay in starting the shuttle would only delay the hiatus, not eliminate it.” If shuttle development was advancing when gap occurred, Dr. Low believed gap would not be “unacceptable.” NASA was building “the next generation of space vehicles, a generation that will far surpass existing capabilities to explore space, to use space, to live and work in space.” (Text)
Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) told meeting: “Our space program is being viewed with increasing skepticism. Future historians will smile at the irony of our situation. Immediately following the fantastic feat of sending men to the surface of the Moon and back in safety, our national resolve in expanding this effort faced a mounting wave of domestic criticism. The irony of homo sapiens for the first time standing upright on his planet and not availing himself of his full ability to explore and experiment in the universe. The irony of not moving forward as aggressively as possible from a new beginning almost as fundamental as the beginning of life itself.” (SBD, 10/23/70, 23)

October 20-27: Zond VIII automatic space station was launched by U.S.S.R. from Baykonur and placed on lunar trajectory. Tass, breaking traditional secrecy surrounding Soviet space missions, announced launch and said purpose was “to carry out physical research along the flight path and the near-moon space, take pictures of the lunar surface, of the earth and the moon at different distances, check on improved on-board systems, units and the construction of the spacecraft. Under the flight program Zond 8 will round the moon on Oct. 24, then change to an eastward path and return to earth on Oct. 27.”
On Oct. 24 Tass announced that Zond VIII had circled within 1120 km (696 mi) of moon, studied space, photographed moon, and was returning to earth. Spacecraft splashed down in Indian Ocean Oct. 27 and was recovered by Soviet vessel Tama. Tass said spacecraft brought back “extremely important photographs needed for studies of the geological and morphological qualities of the moon.”

But we also recognize that our program, in addition to its intrinsic value, sets the pace for much of the technological development of this country and promises to do so for the foreseeable future. ... We do not believe that we could long survive and prosper without this preeminent technological position. Therefore, we have to stand and fight off the stampede by other groups to acquire funds now being channeled into our national technology through NASA and the Department of Defense. It is a veritable ‘run on the bank.’ The withdrawal slips carry such catch terms as relevancy, poverty, pollution, and housing, and are designed to shame us into sacrificing our space program and national technology in the name of ‘humanity.’ I would reverse the logic and say—in the name of humanity we should maintain our national technology.”
Cortright also described nasa-dot-dod experimental program to introduce v/stol aircraft into commercial use: “We have chosen the externally blown flap and augmentor wing jet stol airplanes for initial attention. Jet vtol aircraft will come later. . . . We envision a combination of v/stol and high-speed ground transportation as offering the best hope for continued mobility as the megalopolis continues to spread.

•	Dr. Donald J. Williams, Director of National Oceanic and Atmospher-
ic Administration’s Space Disturbances Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., revealed plans to study space weather by squirting small blobs of electrically charged gas out of earth-orbiting satellite. He told 1970 Meeting of Interagency Conference on Weather Modification at Virginia Beach, Va., noaa would fly simple experiment on small geophysical monitoring satellite. “When activated 22 300 miles [35 900 km] above the nighttime earth, the device will trigger a self-quenching flow of electrons into the upper atmosphere. Our proposed experiment in modifying space weather requires interacting with our environment in a scientifically significant yet totally non-destructive way.” If initial release of plasma from satellite caused artificial aurora scientists would “be able to deduce the exact shape of the magnetic field line that passes through the satellite’s position. In addition, the. . .experiment should provide information on diffusion of plasma along field lines, diffusion across field lines, and electric fields deep in the magnetosphere.”
Naturally occurring electron-precipitation events were accompanied by many terrestrial effects, including auroral displays, radiopropagation disturbances, and intense, short-lived fluctuations of earth’s magnetic field. If noaa experiment enhanced precipitation from magnetosphere into ionosphere scientists “would then be more certain of the natural processes that cause storms and should be able to improve our predictions of radar clutter and the quality of polar radio communications in future, naturally occurring storms. Once we know more about the magnetosphere, the triggering mech-
anism of electron precipitation events and their enhancement into geomagnetic storms, we can then consider ways to modify or control such storms when they occur naturally. Thus, the small noaa experiment riding piggyback on a geophysical satellite may be our first step toward ultimate control of our space environment.” (noaa Release 70-85-285)

During October: Scientists at Boeing Space Center in Kent, Wash., were studying piece of Surveyor III, 5 cm (2 in) long, returned from moon by Apollo 12 astronauts, to determine why original white paint had discolored, Boeing Co. said. White paint reflected intense solar rays in space and helped prevent heat buildup inside spacecraft. Boeing researchers thought paint degraded in space because of contaminating film from rocket exhaust, constant proton bombardment, or other radiation from sun. If discoloring came from contamination, paint could be restored to whiteness through oxygen plasma process. If paint had changed through radiation damage, Boeing could replenish depleted atoms. Results of study would enable
Boeing to renew reflective paint of future spacecraft which might need to function for 10 to 20 yrs. (Boeing Release S-0788)
•	Time was ripe for U.S.-European space partnership, William Leavitt
said in Air Force and Space Digest. “Europe. . .seems to be working, at long last, toward the creation of a European ‘nasa’ that would bring together the expertise, and create a focus for energies and resources, of the principal European countries.” In U.S., “prestige-fired fiscal support of multibillion-dollar space projects is rapidly shrinking.” There was opportunity for real partnership. “More cooks in today’s kitchen would enrich the broth. To such a combination, the U.S. could bring its vast experience of the past decade and certainly some significant funding, even in a tightened money situation. The Europeans could bring fresh enthusiasm, a good deal of skill, financial support, and developmental philosophies that might be a good deal more frugal, since they have been accustomed to small budgets. Money and time could be saved all round.” (AF/SD, 10/70, 66-7)

•	Progress of Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) was de-
scribed in Astronautics & Aeronautics by essa scientist David S. Johnson. NASA’s Itos I, launched Jan. 23, was in sun-synchronous orbit. Operational sounding capability would be added to system in
1972.	Third-generation operational satellite was planned for 1975 launch. Synchronous Meteorological Satellite scheduled for 1972 launch would be operational prototype of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite that would complement Itos I. Initially, U.S. would keep one geostationary spacecraft operating continuously. It was hoped second would be launched before first garp global experiment scheduled for one-year period about 1976.
France and Japan were considering synchronous satellites for first garp global experiment, esro and U.K. might build polar-orbit meteorological satellites for experiment. U.S.S.R. was operating meteorological satellites in quasi-polar orbit and was developing sounding instruments. Space-based observing system apparently would furnish major portion of data for garp global experiment, by which time “U.S. operational meteorological satellite system will approach the coverage needed, except for the four synchronous satellites. Promising signs of significant contributions towards these have come from other countries.” (A&A, 10/70, 28-32)

Well elaborated and tested compartments of space vehicles and individual stages of carrier rockets will be used as the main units of those stations.” Orbital stations could be orbited in assembled state by carrier rockets or in parts, with one or two dockings. Station crew could be delivered by transport space vehicle and crews exchanged. One of main tasks of stations would be medical and biological experiments. Orbital stations would be created “of block design, assembled in circumterrestrial orbit in parts,” with maximum 10-yr life and 12- to 20-member crew. Petrov saw advisability “of very large multipurpose orbital base stations” for crews of 50 to 70 and, ultimately 100 to 120. U.S.S.R. had in view not simply space station but system of space stations. (AF Mag, 6/71,54-9)

November 3: Lunar samples returned by U.S.S.R.’s Luna XVI (launched Sept. 12) contained less titanium and zirconium oxide and more ferric oxide than Apollo 11 samples, Soviet Academy of Sciences Vice President Aleksander Vinogradov was quoted as saying. Luna and Apollo samples “have an equally high content of space originated inert gases” but in overall composition the Luna XVI samples more closely resembed those from Apollo 12. Luna XVI material was fragmented basaltic type containing 70 chemical elements; granularity of soil increased with depth. Spherical, glazed formations of congealed droplets similar to those found by Apollo
crews were present. Specific heat of lunar soil did not depend on density, Vinogradov said, and, “on the average, corresponds to terrestrial rocks, while heat conductivity is characterized by extremely low values, considerably below those of the best heat-insulating materials on Earth.... It may be assumed that the general course of differentiation of the substance of the Earth and of the Moon and probably of other planets of the terrestrial type proceeded by similar routes, although reached different stages of development.” (SBD, 11/3/70,8-9)

•	Seismic data from impacts of Apollo 12 lm and 3rd stage of Apollo 13
booster (S-IVB), relayed by seismic station installed on lunar surface by Apollo 12 astronauts, were described in Science. Team of
lunar scientists headed by Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal seismic investigator for Apollo program, made report. Unusually long reverberations suggested “that the lunar mare in the region of the Apollo 12 landing site consists of material with very low seismic velocities near the surface with velocity increasing with depth to 5 to 6 kilometers per second [3.1-3.7 mps] (for compression waves) at a depth of 20 kilometers [12.4 mi]. Absorption of seismic waves in this structure is extremely low relative to typical continental crustal materials on earth. It is unlikely that a major boundary similar to the crust-mantle interface on earth exists in the outer 20 kilometers [12.4 mi] of the moon. A combination of dispersion and scattering of surface waves iqiplies the presence of heterogeneity within the outer zone of the mare on a scale of from several hundred meters (or less) to several kilometers. Seismic signals from 160 events of natural origin have been recorded during the first 7 months of operation of the Apollo 12 seismic station. At least 26.. .are small moonquakes. Many.. .are thought to be meteroid impacts.” (Science, 11/6/70, 620-6)

November 9: Ofo Orbiting Frog Otolith and secondary payload, RM Radiation/Meteoroid satellite, were successfully launched by NASA from Wallops Station at 1:00 am est by four-stage Scout booster. Two spacecraft separated 9 min after launch and entered orbit with 528-km (328-mi) apogee, 299.7-km (186.4-mi) perigee, 92.8-min period, and 37.4° inclination. Countdown had been aborted five times since original August launch date because of bad weather, instrument malfunctions, and death of frogs.
Primary objective of 132.5-kg (292-lb) Ofo was to obtain information on functioning and adaptability in weightlessness of vestibule, portion of inner ear which controlled balance, by studying two male bullfrogs (Rana castebianca) on board. Through microelectrodes surgically implanted in vestibular nerves leading from sensor cells in frogs’ otholiths, scientists would be able to study for the first time electrical response of otolith sensors under weightlessness and simulated gravity provided by centrifuge for at least three days. Frogs had been chosen for flight because their inner ear mechanism functioned similarly to man’s and because they were small and amphibious. Onboard spacecraft they were submerged in water with oxygen composition controlled by instruments. After several hours in orbit frogs were in good condition and spacecraft was transmitting data satisfactorily.	'
Primary objective of 21-kg(46-lb) RMsatellite was to demonstrate feasibility and accuracy of advanced radiation dosimeter concept in space and to verify, in flight, operation of instruments to be used on long-duration flights to study meteoroids for at least three months.

said in New York that 10-yr investigation indicated Aviatrix Amelia Earhart, who had disappeared over Pacific in 1937, was alive and living in U.S. They believed woman called Mrs. Guy Bolam, who claimed to have flown with Earhart, was Earhart herself and that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan had been intercepted in 1937 mission for U.S. Government by aircraft from Japanese carrier, held captive throughout World War II in Imperial Palace in Tokyo, and released when Emperor Hirohito bartered her life for his exemption from trial as war criminal. Col. Klass had written book Amelia Earhart Lives: A Trip Through Intrigue To Find America’s First Lady of Mystery, published by McGraw-Hill.

November 10-22:	U.S.S.R. launched Luna XVII unmanned lunar
probe from Baykonur at 7:44 pm local time (9:44 am EST).Tass said purpose of mission was to explore moon and near-moon space and check new systems and reported all systems were functioning normally. During flight to moon 36 communications sessions were held
with spacecraft and data on parameters and systems were transmitted. Midcourse maneuvers were conducted Nov. 12 and 14 and on Nov. 15 Luna XVIIentered lunar orbit with 85-km (53-mi) altitude, 1-hr 56-min period, and 141° inclination.
Luna XVII softlanded in moon’s Sea of Rains Nov . 17 at 8:47 am Baykonurtime (10:47 pm ESTNov. 16). Spacecraft released Lunokhod I, self-propelled vehicle placed on moon to conduct scientific investigations. According to drawing and models shown on Moscow TV, Lunokhod I looked like large silver pot-bellied tub about the size of small automobile with ei^ht spoked wheels apparently powered by solar energy and batteries. Tass said Lunokhod I carried flags and pennants with Soviet coat of arms and Lenin’s bas relief and was equipped with scientific apparatus, instruments and control systems, and radio and TV devices. Lunokhod I left Luna XVII descent stage at 11:28 am Baykonurtime (1:28 am EST) Nov. 17 by special gangway and traveled 20 m (66 ft) from spacecraft to begin experiments. Tass said vehicle’s movement could be controlled automatically or by ground controllers following televised information on position and character of surrounding lunar surface.
Between Nov. 17 and Nov. 22, 10 radio and TV sessions were held and large amount of data was transmitted. Chemical composition of surface layer of lunar soil was analyzed with x-ray spectrometer and mechanical properties of lunar soil and transportability of vehicle were investigated. In addition, Tass said, “an instrument was used which has a punch for soil intrusion, and a system of sensors for measuring forces acting on the wheels.” Panoramic pictures of lunar landscape were taken, in which tracks made by Lunokhod I, details of lunar surface, and parts of vehicle were clearly visible. Tass said TV cameras, “designed for surveying and evaluating the route traveled, provided the necessary information for travel in the conditions of uneven, broken terrain. At some points. . .the incline reached 14 deg. Along the path, Lunokhod encountered. . .deep craters the detours to which were ensured byithe operators (on Earth).”
On Nov. 22, after five days on lunar surface, Lunokhod I was commanded to terminate operations in preparation for lunar night. Tass said vehicle had competed “a complex of tests.. .and a wide program of tests of its mobility” and had traveled 197 m (646 ft). Vehicle was moved to an “assigned position” where it would remain stationary during lunar night and solar panels were closed.
Luna XVII was first unmanned spacecraft to land on moon and deploy automatic lunar explorer. Last mission in series, unmanned Luna XVI(Sept. 12-24), had landed on moon and returned to earth with lunar samples. (Sov Rpt, 12/4/70; GSFC SSR, 11/30/70; SBD, 11/20/70,81-2; Clarity, NYT, 11/18/70,1)	'

November 12: Delays caused by sun’s gravity in return of radio signals by Mariner spacecraft had verified Einstein theory of relativity, jpl astronomer Dr. John D. Anderson said in report to Conference on Experimental Tests of Gravitational Theories at Cal Tech. In tests begun April 30, Anderson and team including Dr. Duane O. Muhle-man of Cal Tech and Dr. Pasquale B. Esposito and Warren L. Mar-
tin of JPL had taken several hundred radio measurements of Mariner VI and VII in wide-range solar orbit using precise distance-measuring system and 64-m (210-ft) Goldstone antenna. Experiments tested validity of theory that velocity of light was slower in gravitational field near sun than in interplanetary space where gravitational fields were weaker. “Our experiments to date show that Einstein’s predictions are right, to within 2 to 4 per cent. The best measurements we have thus far indicate a maximum delay of about 204 microseconds for Mariner VI, as compared with an expected 200 microseconds using Einstein’s theory.” Findings cast doubt on more recent theories of Dr. Charles Brans and Dr. Robert H. Dicke that Einstein’s formulations could be incorrect by 1% “If the Brans-Dicke theory were correct, the time delay would be much less. . .perhaps about 186 microseconds. .. .if the much older Newtonian theory were correct, there would have been no time delay at all.” (nasa Release 70-200)

Aldrin, Jr.; Apollo 12 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard F. Gordon, and Alan L. Bean; and Apollo 13 Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr., and Fred W. Haise, Jr.
Vice President said award ceremony was “perhaps the most significant since NASA was founded. Those individuals we honor have accomplished goals that required over a decade of vision, hard work, determination and courage by thousands in the NASA, industry, and university research and development team. ... NASA has had an outstanding beginning, successfully meeting its challenging mission and goals.... Though some reordering of national priorities and some fiscal constraints will not permit us to do all the things we would like to do in the immediate future, the future still holds many challenges and wonderful opportunities.... I am proud of you, the President is proud of you. We salute you.”
Dr. Low said NASA could look forward to new achievements in program designed “to maintain that hard-earned lead, but one that also recognizes the many other problems that we as a nation must face. Today,we are moving forward on all...fronts—we have accepted the challenge of the future—a challenge in aeronautics, a challenge in science, a challenge in applications, and above all, a challenge in the exploration of the unknown.”

Dr. Gast had said Soviet analysis of material, reported at Oct. 28 Moscow news conference, indicated same relative abundances of some 11 major elements as found by U.S. scientists in Apollo 12 lunar samples from Ocean of Storms. Both differed significantly from relative abundances found in Sea of Tranquility rocks and soil returned by Apollo 11. Most striking difference in Sea of Fertility and Ocean of Storms material was titanium content. Sea of Tranquility material contained. 10% titanium dioxide; all soil and rocks from Ocean of Storms and Sea of Fertility contained under 5%. Dr. Gast said Sea of Fertility sample provided 50% additional data to that known previously on chemical composition of lunar surface.

•	News conference on results of Apollo 12 lunar surface experiment’s
was held at NASA Hq. Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, said first anniversary of alsep was “scientific and technological triumph. The design specification was for one lunar day and night. Our design goal was for one calendar year.” Year after deployment alsep had received and processed over 6500 commands, had undergone 2600 533-K (500°F) swings of temperature, and was still being operated remotely 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week.
Astronaut Alan L. Bean said unmanned vehicle, such as U.S.S.R.’s Lunokhod I, could not explore surface as well as men could because men could deploy more equipment more effectively, perform more experiments, and collect more samples. He noted that Apollo 11 had collected 22.7 kg (50 lbs) of samples; Apollo 12, 34 kg (75 lbs); and Luna XVI, 90 g (0.2 lb).
Dr. Gary V. Latham of Columbia Univ.’s Lamont-Doherty Geological Laboratory said seismic events were being recorded at rate of about one per day; some were impacts from grapefruit-size meteoroids and some appeared to be small moonquakes. In region of Apollo 12 station there were at least nine places at which moon-quakes occurred “every month at or near the time when the moon comes closest to earth in its monthly orbital cycle.” Most active zone for moonquakes was about 193 km (120 mi) southeast of al-SEP, near rilles in Fra Mauro crater, Apollo 14 landing site.

Alley as reporting. Accuracy was determined by shortness of pulses and accuracy with which travel time of pulses to moon and back could be measured. New lasers being developed might cut accuracy margin to less than 25 mm (1 in) and could produce reflections bright enough to be observed in telescopes of small observatories. Dr. Alley was chairman of committee of international specialists seeking to encourage widespread ranging of lunar reflectors such as French laser reflector landed on moon by Soviet Luna XVII.

Washington Post editorial commented on Soviet Lunokhod I: “The appearance of this vehicle, as well as the landing on the moon and return to earth of Luna 16, makes it clear that the Russians hope to regain some of the prestige they lost in the race to land men on the moon.... In terms of the American space program, this new success of the Russians should have little impact other than to persuade the administration and Congress not to cut back its funds any further. There is no logical reason for NASA to go like gang-busters in an effort to match the Russians in unmanned space exploration since the decision has already been made to proceed with a scaled down and more rational space program. The first big trophy in space activities went to the Russians, the most recent big one to the Americans, and it is reasonable to suspect that future ones will be divided between the two nations.” (WPost, 11/20/70, A26)
•	Science editorial commented on comsats: The communications satel-
lites have a variety of applications. . . . One application that will probably be implemented fairly soon is aeronautical and ship communication. Radio works well on line of sight but is undependable at distances greater than 300 miles [483 km]. Many ships have been lost while radio operators were trying in vain to communicate their peril. Midocean aeronautical navigation represents another growing need which could also be filled. Satellite enthusiasts point to other potential uses. One of these is Picturephone, which now requires about 100 telephone circuits for a single two-way conversation. High-capacity; low-cost satellite circuits would help to make feasible large-scale use of this device. Perhaps more distant but of great
consequence would be exploitation of future inexpensive communications for use in educational television. Constructive applications of satellites are now a reality, and extension of technological potentials will have profound and global consequences.” (Science, 11/20/70)

•	Significance of Soviet flights to moon was discussed by Dr. George M.
Low, Acting NASA Administrator, in letter to Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Luna XVI and XVII, launched Sept. 12 and Nov. 10, had been “technically impressive; but as isolated events, their importance to science and technology is relatively minor.” U.S. still held technological leadership with Apollo 11. U.S. had had four men on moon and U.S.S.R. none. U.S. had returned 56 kg (123 lb) of lunar material and U.S.S.R. had returned 85-113 g (3-4 oz). U.S. had placed automated station on moon that had functioned for more than year. U.S. had gained “enormous amount” of lunar information; U.S.S.R. had added very little.
In overall trends, however, U.S. launch rate was decreasing while Soviet rate was increasing. In 1970 to date, U.S.S.R. had placed 74 payloads in space, to 31 by U.S. “They have seldom missed a launch window in the exploration of Venus and Mars; our planetary program has many gaps.” U.S.S.R. had continuing manned space program and capability, with Zond spacecraft, for manned circum-iunar flight. Soviets had stated intention to orbit space station before U.S. and reportedly were developing booster of Saturn V class while U.S. had suspended Saturn V production. U.S.S.R. was spending more money on space annually than U.S. “.. .when we view Luna 16 and 17 in the context of trends in our program and theirs, then we must be concerned about our future in aeronautics and space—about our position of leadership that we have worked so hard to achieve.” (CR, 11/30/70, S19002)

Erratic motions were caused by variations in earth’s gravitational field. Satellites were attracted and pulled downward more as they passed over high areas and attracted less over low areas. Scientists had concluded that if earth were round orbits would be perfectly elliptical. Instead, bulges and depressions covered earth in two bands— high band with neck across North Pole and ends stretching over Europe and West Africa on one side and Pacific Ocean on other; low band over South Pole with ends over North America and Asia.

During November:	usaf total-force concept for 1970s was described
in Air Force and Space Digestby Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force: Increased numbers and total payload of Soviet icbms and Soviet deployment of abm system could reduce effectiveness of U.S. land- and sea-based missiles. “We are deploying abm protection for our missile fields and strengthening the penetration capability of our missiles with the deployment of mirv. But . . .effectiveness of our missile forces will tend to vary, depending upon the length of time it takes us to respond to new Soviet capabili-
ties.” Dispersed manned bomber force with quick reaction would provide stability. “It might be possible to undermine the effectiveness of either missiles or bombers alone, but to counter both at the same time would be a vastly more difficult problem.” B-l bomber represented most economically feasible means to retain stabilizing capability. “Given the decade of leadtime involved, we must expedite the development of this aircraft.” With Soviet fighters “becoming superior to our own,” air-to-air combat was “primary concern in our development of the F-15, which will have superior capability for close-in, highly maneuverable combat” and “provide the effective weapon system necessary to defeat any enemy fighter. . . .we are convinced that effective close air support will continue to be a vital mission.. .and that an aircraft especially tailored for that role is required. . . .we are proceeding with the development of the A-X. To modernize our airlift capability, we are relying heavily on the C-5, which will produce a revolution in air mobility.” In 1973, “with the C-5 in the inventory, projections indicate that we will be able to move an Army division with equipment and six fighter squadrons with support units to Europe in less than one week.” (AF/SD, 11/70,68-71)

• Test flights of Anglo-French supersonic transport Concorde had gone well and protests against its sonic boom had been “less than expected,” AP article reported. Big hurdle would come in spring when
U.K. and France .would decide whether to go into full production. Decision would depend on number of aircraft ordered by then. To date, 16 airlines had taken options on 74 Concordes, with first batch going to Pan American World Airways, Air France, and British Overseas Airways Corp. None had made firm commitment to buy and U.K. and France had assured foreign airlines they could revoke their options if Air France and boac backed out. AP said major airlines doubted Concorde would be profitable. It would carry 130 passengers, against Boeing 747’s 490, and require more fuel than conventional jets. At possibly $52.8 million, its cost would be about five times that of conventional airliner. Concorde’s only selling point was speed. It would halve flying time across Atlantic to IVi hrs.

•	DOT’S SST development environmental impact statements and com-
ments received by DOT on draft statement from other agencies were transmitted to Council on Environmental Quality by James M. Beggs, DOT Under Secretary of Transportation. Statement, required by National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, said development of two prototype SSTs “will not give rise to any long-range environmental problems.” Possible adverse environmental consequences arising from fleet operation of SSTS represented “only possible effects on long-term productivity of environment.” Such effects “remain in the realm of speculation at this time.” Prototype development “would not involve an irreversible commitment of any environmental resources.” Prototype would demonstrate performance, economics, safety, and environmental qualities of sst design before large-scale production of ssts. Government research application to sst environmental factors included; LaRC r&d program to determine feasibility of tubular noise-suppression technique for sst engines, noise reduction and control at source program, system analysis of aircraft noise abatement, university research program to develop and expand noise research interest within educational institutions, theoretical and experimental studies of structure and turbu-
lence levels of ssts to reduce sideline noise and turbomachinery noise, LeRC, studies of noise reduction potential of suppressors and engine cycles, and work on control and evaluation of noise on receiving end, including human factors. Other sst environmental programs were: dot-nasa-usaf high-altitude-radiation research program and noaa air-transportation atmospheric weather-modification research program.

Papers represented attitudes of Government, aerospace industry, and academic community on objectives of national space program during next decade and funding level needed to support program. Statements had been prepared for hearings, originally scheduled for September and October 1970, that had been canceled because of press of legislative business and ‘‘uncertain status of the NASA appropriation measure” for FY 1971 because of Presidential veto.
Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, had urged that “new initiatives proposed for the 1970s represent not only a space program that will maintain our Nation’s leadership, but also an opportunity to utilize resources which will otherwise remain idle or grossly underemployed. In this sense the ‘real cost’ to the society of NASA’s programs for the 1970s is very low and the cost-benefit of these programs correspondingly high.”
Dr. Thomas O. Paine, Vice president and Group Executive of General Electric Co. and former NASA Administrator, said in statement that U.S.-U.S.S.R. discussion on common spacecraft docking had been “excellent step forward” in space programming. “The United States, Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan should also work more closely together in the forefront of space science and technology, eliminating duplicative projects and obsolescent developments for purely nationalistic purposes. Space activities are inherently global; they challenge us to develop new international institutions as advanced as our technologies. Attractive new international arrangements should also be established for the developing nations to help them take full advantage for new application opportunities.”
Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, urged vigorous space program with space shuttle as “cornerstone.” Answers to question “Why go to the moon?” would not be found in budget books and cost-benefit analyses but
“in the hearts and minds of men, who, responding to a mystical, metaphysical imperative, join hands and reach out to the stars.”
Committee found “clear consensus. . .that a vigorous aeronautics and space effort is in the National interest, since it sets the pace for the country’s technological advancement. There is also general agreement that a revitalized space program, given strong direction and adequate funding, is needed for the United States to retain its technological preeminence in the decades ahead.” (Text)

December 12: Uhuru (Explorer XLII) (sas-a) Small Astronomy Satellite was launched for NASA by Italy at 1:45 pm local time (5:45 am est) from San Marco launch platform off coast of Kenya. Four-stage Scout launch vehicle boosted 142.9-kg (315-lb) satellite into orbit with 572-km (355.4-mi) apogee, 531-km (330.0-mi) perigee, 95.7-min period, and 3.04° inclination. Primary objective was to develop catalog of celestial x-ray sources by systematic scanning of sky in 2- to 20-kev range.
Satellite—first equippeed with sensitive instruments to detect high-energy x-ray sources in space—would pinpoint location of x-ray sources; transmit data on intensity, frequency, and time variation; and map diffuse x-ray background. NASA controllers would maneuver satellite from ground by energizing electromagnet in attitude control system. Electrical energy caused electromagnet to act like compass needle, aligning itself to north-south lines of earth’s magnetic field and permitting controllers to point spacecraft to any direction.
December 12: Uhuru (Explorer XL]I) Small Astronomy Satellite was (aimdied into an equatorial orbit by Italy Iron the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya, East Africa, on Kenya’s Independence Day. “Lfhuru" was the Swahili word for “freedom." Boosted by a four-stage Scout vehicle to map x-ray sources both within and beyond the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite was the first launched for the United States by another country. At left Mrs. Marjorie Townsend, project manager, discussed satellite performance with a colleague during p re flight tests at Goddard Space Flight Center.
During first day of operation Uhuru was expected to collect more data than had been obtained with sounding rockets in past eight years. Satellite’s Jong observing time, rather than the few minutes for sounding rockets, would permit observation of x-ray sources from 30 to 50 times fainter than those observed thus far, probably increasing number of observed x-ray sources from 540 to several hundred.
Uhuru was first in series of three explorers in Small Astronomy Satellite program to survey sky above earth’s atmosphere and identify x-ray, gamma-ray, UV, and infrared sources. It was first U.S. satellite launched by another country. Under NASA and Univ. of Rome agreement NASA provided booster and satellite; Italian team, trained at Wallops Station, conducted assembly, checkout, and launch services on cost-reimbursable basis, sasb would be launched in October 1971 and SAS-C in December 1972.

•	NAS released Venus: Strategy for Exploration, report of NASA-sup-
ported study by scientific panel chaired by Harvard Univ. astronomer Dr. Richard M. Goody and Kitt Peak National Observatory astronomer Dr. Donald M. Hunten. Report urged unmanned scientific study of Venus with Planetary Explorer spacecraft, 385-kg (850-lb) “universal bus’’ capable of carrying entry probes, orbiters, balloons, and landers. Estimated cost of unmanned Venus probe program was $ 100-million total for first three missions and up to $25 million for each succeeding mission. Program would be undertaken in addition to planned NASA program of planetary exploration.
Panel urged Venus exploration because information on cloud cover blanketing planet and planet’s carbon dioxide atmosphere could contribute to understanding of general atmospheric systems, including earth’s, and conflicting theories could be tested with relatively simple measurements. Determination of concentration of hydrogen atoms and compounds could reveal whether oceans once covered Venus and, if so, what happened to them. Panel urged that higher failure risks be accepted for Venus missions to lower equipment costs, that experimental operations be simplified, that landers be permitted to impact on Venus, and that NASA cooperate with space organizations of other nations in planning and carrying out investigations.

• Experiment to determine if ozone was trapped in solid carbon dioxide polar cap of Mars was described in Science by Univ. of Colorado and York Univ. of Toronto, Canada, scientists. Experiment showed that solid carbon dioxide was effective trap for ozone at temperatures as high as 156 K (-179°F). “Ultraviolet reflection-absorption spectra of ozone in solid carbon dioxide at 127°K [-231°F] indicate that the ozone observed over the polar cap of Mars may be trapped in solid carbon dioxide.” (Broida, Lundell, etai., Science, 12/25/70, 1402)
December 26-31: aaas held 137th Annual Meeting in Chicago. Thirteenth Annual Meeting of Society for the History of Technology (shot) was held Dec. 26-30 in conjunction with aaas meeting.
Dr. Edward H. Teller, physicist and atomic scientist of Univ. of California, advocated abolition of secrecy surrounding U.S. scientific research “so we can clearly understand what we are talking about ” in growing debate over impact of science and technology on society. “Secrecy in science should be abolished so that the democratic process can be better able to work in making the decisions on how science is applied.” (Wilford, NYT, 12/28/70,1)
Dr. Bentley Glass, retiring aaas president and Academic Vice President of Univ. of New York at Stoney Brook, said number of scientists and technologists in U.S. had doubled in decade to form 20% of professional labor force. Growth rate was much faster than that of population and could not surpass limit of about 25% of professional force. Dr. Glass believed that the greater the volume of research, the less likely any one project would produce truly original results. “It is in fact becoming more and more difficult, as scientific knowledge grows, to make a totally new and unexpected discovery or to break through the dogmas of established scientific views.”
SHOT session on Perspectives of Apollo History, chaired by Dr. James Lee Cate of Univ. of Chicago with Dr. John M. Logsdon of George Washington Univ. as commentator, presented sample narratives: “Space Science and Automatic Spacecraft Behind Apollo” by R. Cargill Hall, jpl Historian; “The Saturn Family of Rockets” by Dr. John S. Beltz of Univ. of Alabama at Huntsville; and “The Apollo Command Spaceship” by Dr. Loyd S.

Jeffrey V. Odom, manager of National Bureau of Standards metric study, told aaas seminar that report on metrication would be submitted to Congress in August 1971. Report was expected to include recommendations for gradual conversion to metric system in U.S., possibly over 10 yrs. New York Times, noting metric system proponents, emphasized that 90% of nations in world already used system and that U.K. expected to be almost completely converted by 1975, said NASA was first U.S. Government agency to convert to
system in its scientific and technical publications. (Wilford, NYT, 12/29/70, 17)
Stewart L. Udall, former Secretary of the Interior, in aaas speech accused science establishment, particularly nas, of failing to exert moral and political leadership on issues of technology impact on man. He proposed that consumer advocate Ralph Nader organize team of young scientists to make “dispassionate and intensive study of the National Academy and the whole scientific enterprise in this country.” (Wilford, NYT, 12/31/70, 3:6)

December 27: NASA- announced Stanford Univ. scientists were measuring solar wind in 61-million-km (38-million-mi) space between sun-orbiting Pioneer VI(launched Dec. 16, 1965) and Pioneer VIII (launched Dec. 13, 1967). Purpose of experiment was to study influence of solar wind on earth’s long-term weather cycles and obtain information on solar workings for particle physics. ARC-managed project would continue until May 1971; spacecraft would hold almost fixed position 100 million km (62 million mi) from earth until that time. Measurements were obtained by determining way radio signals between Stanford’s 46-m (150-ft) antenna and Pioneers were slowed by interplanetary electrons. Stanford scientist Dr. Thomas Croft had said measurements were “probably the most accurate ever made of the density of free electrons in the solar wind.” (nasa Release 70-217)
December 28: NASA held press briefing on preliminary results of Uhu-ru (Explorer XLII) Small Astronomy Satellite (launched Dec. 12). Mrs. Marjorie R. Townsend, sas-a Project Manager at gsfc, said launch went smoothly and only few minor anomalies had occurred so far: “We are running at higher temperatures than we anticipated seeing at specific angles with respect to the sun. . . .Because of this it took us longer to despin than we had anticipated. The despin dumps a lot of excess [heat] into the spacecraft so we had to turn it on for a while and then turn it off. . .until we did get it into nominal operation. As of this morning sas-a is working perfectly.” (Transcript)

Dmitriyev. Soviet leadership was swinging full circle back to belief that Soviet approach was distinctly superior to that of U.S. Automatic spacecraft were cheaper than manned spacecraft but Soviet efforts were encompassing across-the-board capabilities—manned as well as unmanned. Main directions were systematic research in near-earth space using automatic vehicles and manned craft, moon and circumlunar space as testing ground for Soviet cosmonautics, and research of distant planets, primarily Venus, with aid of automatic devices. Recent Soviet accomplishments had paved way for significant breakthroughs in all of these directions. (AF Mag, 6/71, 54-9)

During December: Discovery of two galaxies possibly only 10 million yrs old—one thousandth the age determined for galaxies under “big bang” theory that all material in universe had exploded in one place 10 billion yrs ago—was reported in Astrophysical Journal by Hale Observatory astronomers Dr. Wallace L. W. Sargent and Dr. Leonard Searle. Galaxies, about 100 light years in diameter against 100000 for larger galaxies, contained only 1000 to 100 000 stars of short-lived blue type. Milky Way galaxy contained 10 billion stars, including those capable of living billions of years. If newly discovered galaxies were young, they would provide first evidence that galaxies evolved from infancy to old age and that galaxies could be created after “big bang.” Dr. Sargent and Dr. Searle tentatively concluded that galaxies were “dense intergalactic clouds of neutral hydrogen in which the formation of massive stars is proceeding vigorously while the formation of low-mass stars is suppressed.” (As-trophysical Journal, 12/70, LI 55-9)
•	Results of international deliberations on definitive working arrange-

assembly. Board would represent investors. Each member of board would have vote proportional in weight to his country’s investment. System would reduce maximum voting percentage of U.S. from 52%!to 40% and attempt to avoid veto power for either one nation or small group of major users. Assembly of delegates from each member country would decide by simple majority whether to raise subjects for action, which would then take two-thirds majority to pass. Permanent agreement proposed six-year transition period during which ComSatCorp would remain as systems manager. Three international consulting firms would report best form of management organization during transition period, intelsat guideline would be to contract out as many functions as possible to avoid bureaucracy detrimental to efficiency.

Ratio of total r&d expenditure to gnp would drop from 3% in mid-60s to 2.7% in 1971 as r&d gains failed to keep pace with growth of economy. Federal r&d support rose 1% a year over past five years but in real terms support showed 3% annual decline. Over same period, non-Federal funding grew 10% annually in current dollars and 5% annually in real terms. Space and defense r&d efforts declined as emphasis shifted to other programs. DOD’s intramural r&d spending declined, as did dod basic research spending. (Text)
•	nsf problems in stabilizingiU.S. basic science research during FY 1971
“with budgetary squeezes on mission-oriented agencies such as NASA, and aec, and Mansfield-amendment effects rippling through dod,” were described by nsf Director William D. McElroy in interview published by Astronautics & Aeronautics magazine: “We can identify positively right now the order of $70 million [in basic science research] that has been previously supported by other agencies. .. .we don’t have $70 million additional money to pick that up, so there is going to be a squeeze here.” Though nsf FY 1971 budget would show $73-million increase over FY 1970 amount of $438 million, only $10 million could be earmarked for picking up programs cut by other Government agencies, (A&A, 12/70, 12-14)
During 1970: U.S. orbited 38 spacecraft in 28 launches—including Apollo 13's CSM Odyssey, lm Aquarius, and S-IVB stage intentionally crashed onto moon. U.S.S.R. orbited 88 payloads in 81 launches; France, 2; Italy, 1 (for NASA on NASA launch vehicle); Japan, 1; and Communist China, 1. U.S. total included 21 orbited by dod in 17 launches and 17 by NASA in 13 launches. NASA’s total included 1 launched for NATO and 1 for dod.
NASA’s manned space flight program continued with launch of Apollo 13, but mission was cut short by an oxygen tank rupture. Three-man crew, taking emergency measures and using lm as “lifeboat,” returned safely to earth after looping around moon. Analysis of Apollo system and modifications necessary to prevent or meet future emergencies and reevaluation of Apollo program caused re-
scheduling of Apollo 14 from 1970 to early 1971 and reduction in number of remaining Apollo missions from six to four.
Unmanned program included orbiting of Intelsat-III F-6, Intelsat-Ill F-7, and Intelsat-III F-8 comsats for ComSatCorp; Noaa I meteorological satellite for noaa and prototype meteorological satellite Itos I; NASA’s Nimbus IV in support of world weather program; Uhuru (Explorer XLII) Small Astronomy Satellite (launched for NASA by Italy); Serf II Space Electric Rocket Test; and Ofo Orbiting Frog Otolith, carrying two bullfrogs. Launched as secondary payloads were Oscar V(U.S.-Australia) amateur radio-propagation satellite carried on Itos I; DOD’s Topo 7 geodetic satellite, on Nimbus IV\ RM Radiation/Meteoroid Satellite, on Ofo; and Cepe Cylindrical Electrostatic Probe Experiment, on Noaa I.
Almost 100 scientific sounding rockets were launched to altitudes between 160 and 1600 km (100 and 1000 mi) to study space physics and astronomy, including 19 during solar eclipse. One of the 19 detected unexpectedly high amount of neutral hydrogen streaming into earth’s atmosphere. Meteorological sounding rockets included 46 Nike-Cajuns and more than 200 boosted Dart and Areas rockets. About 60 high-altitude balloons—including one carrying Strato-scope II optical telescope—were launched to altitudes as high as 45 700 m (150 000 ft).
In joint NASA-USAF lifting-body program M2-F3, HL-10, and X-24A lifting-body vehicles made 22 flights. HL-10 reached mach 1.86 (1970 km per hr; 1224 mph), setting new lifting-body speed record. M2-F3 made its first glide flight and X-24A made its first supersonic flight, reaching 1223 km per hr (760 mph).
In aeronautics, YF-12A aircraft made 60 flights in joint nasa-usaf research program. Boeing 747 jumbo jet began commercial operations, and maiden flights were made by usn F-14A Tomcat air superiority fighter, Lockheed L-1011 airbus, and Douglas DC-10 airbus. C-5A cargo transport was delivered to Charleston afb for operational use. SST development continued—amid much debate over costs, sonic boom, and environmental pollution—with Congress approving funding through March 1971. Full-scale hypersonic research engine was tested for first time in LaRC’s 8-Foot High-Temperature Structures Tunnel at mach 7.4, and thick supercritical wing was flown on modified usn T-2-C aircraft. Other aeronautical research included studies on runway slipperiness, v/stol avionics, aircraft noise, landing radar, and pilot warning indicators.
dod space program included orbiting of last two Vela nuclear detection satellites, Topo I geodetic satellite (launched by nasa), and U.K.’s Skynet B military comsat (launched by nasa).
In joint NASA-AEC effort, SNAP-19 and SNAP-27 radioisotope generators completed one year of continuous operation on lunar surface, candidate fuel element for nerva completed 10 hrs of electrical corrosion testing, and Peewee-2 experimental reactor was fabricated and delivered for testing in early 1971.
U.S.S.R.’s 88 payloads included 72 Cosmos satellites, 2 Lunas, 1 Zond, 1 Soyuz, 1 Venus, 2 Intercosmos, 4 Meteors, and 5 Molniya Is. Unmanned Luna XVI landed on moon and returned to earth with lunar samples. Luna XV/flanded on moon and released Lunokhod I unmanned explorer that traveled across lunar surface and conduct-
ed experiments by ground command. Venus VII landed on planet Venus and transmitted data on Venusian surface and atmosphere. Only manned mission was Soyuz IX, which carried two cosmonauts on 18-day earth-orbital mission, a new space endurance record.
Two countries orbited their first satellites: Japan launched Ohsu-mi and Communist China launched Chicom I. France launched two satellites—Dial, carrying West German wika minicapsule, and Peole applications satellite. (Pres Rpt 71)
• In 1970 NASAreviewed!priorities and redirected activities to conform to new national goals and budgetary restraints under Nixon Administration, which directed increased funding toward solution of nation’s inflationary and environmental problems. Year was transition from dramatic successes of 1960s to new plans for 1970s and beyond, with balanced aeronautical and space program.
Major administrative event affecting NASA was resignation of Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, effective Sept. 15. Dr. Paine, who had been nominated NASA Administrator by President Nixon March 5, 1969, returned to General Electric Co. as a Vice President. Dr. George M. Low became Acting NASA Administrator. In March Dr. Wernher von Braun, msfc Director, was sworn in as Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, and in May NASA Planning Board was established under his direction for coordination of NASA planning.
NASA adjusted time-phasing of future programs to avoid commitments to excessive funding, but progress was made toward new goals and objectives announced in March. Design, development, and testing for Skylab program went forward and fabrication of flight hardware was begun. System characteristics for space shuttle, key element in program for late 1970s, were established and study contracts were let for vehicle and engine. Program definition studies for space station neared completion, erts spacecraft design was completed and aircraft flights tested remote-sensing devices for gathering earth resources data from space. Two flight spacecraft for Mariner Mars ’71 missions were progressing toward final testing. Mission design for Grand Tour of outer planets later in decade was completed and conceptual design of key elements of spacecraft established. NASA continued aeronautical and space studies in conjunction with dod, dot, noaa, and other agencies—including nasa-faa v/stol avionics program.
Scientific analysis of 56 kg (123 lbs) of lunar material from Apollo 11 and /2and data from Apollo experiments contributed significant knowledge on moon and possibly universe, including finding that moon was formed 4.5 billion yrs ago. gsfc research in optical methods for data processing experimented in applying lasers and coherent optics to analysis of large volumes of data from spacecraft.
During year NASA’s research centers expanded work on applications of space technology to fields of medicine, engineering, agriculture, manufacturing, safety, and environmental sciences.
NASA FY 1971 appropriation of $3,269 billion was $64 million below $3,333 billion requested and $428 million below FY 1970 appropriation. Lowest budget since 1962 necessitated cutbacks and deferrals which NASA Administrator termed “austere.” Cost of NASA
space program in 1970 was $3.4 billion—1.7% of total Federal funding, or $17 for each person in U.S., against $400 per person for domestic program funding. Despite its challenging goals for the decade, nasa officials warned of increasing U.S.S.R. competition for space superiority. Observers expressed fears that cutbacks in aerospace industry jeopardized U.S. ability to sustain and capitalize on previous space successes and to maintain technological superiority.

• In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched U.K.’s Skynet B military comsat for dod, Nato I military comsat for NATO, and Oscar V radio propagation satellite for U.S. and Australian amateur radio operators. Italian crew, trained by NASA, launched NASA’s Uhuru on NASA launch vehicle.
U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement was reached on procedure for joint efforts to design compatible rendezvous and docking systems for manned spacecraft. Since European Space Conference had indicated that major participation in U.S. space transportation program would probably mean end to Europa III launcher program funding, esc was assured U.S. would continue to make reimbursable launch services available for European payloads for peaceful purposes. Such participation was understood to mean at least 10% of developmental costs of space transportation system, or about $1 billion.
During year NASA held briefings for U.N. Outer Space Committee and invited u.n. and specialized agencies to participate in International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey System in 1971. Discussions were held with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico on agreements to extend cooperation in earth resources area; experimenters from 28 countries signified intention to submit proposals to analyze data acquired by erts.
Joint working group meetings were held in India and U.S. on satellite instructional TV experiment for ats-f. nasa and aid began 18-mo experimental project with Korea in application of aerospace technology to Korean economic problems. NASA and Canadian government signed agreement to study application of augmentor-wing concept to v/stol aircraft. Agreement was concluded with U.K. to test-fly NASA’s XH-51 rigid-rotor helicopter in U.K. and to share data.
Agreements for new projects were reached with Netherlands, U.K., and Italy. Netherlands agreement called for cooperative development ana launch in 1974 of small astronomical satellite (ans) with one U.S. and two Dutch experiments to investigate stellar uv and x-ray radiation. U.K. agreement was for 1973 launch of uk-R x-ray satellite, fifth in Ariel series. Italian agreement established principles for nasa launch on reimbursable basis of Italian Sirio satellite to study wave propagation and electron flows in magnetosphere. nasa accented experiment from French National Laboratory for Space Astronomy to study stellar uv emissions from Skylab and accepted instrument developed by French National Laboratory for Stellar and Planetary Physics for investigating solar chromosphere structure from osO-i, scheduled for 1973 launch. Assistance was accepted from U.K.’s Jodrell Bank Observatory in planning activities of radio science team for 1975 Project Viking Mars probe.
New sounding rocket agreements were signed with Australia, India, Spain, and Sweden, and negotiations were held with France for cooperative upper-atmosphere sounding rocket launchings at Kour-ou in French Guiana.
Lunar material returned by Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 was studied by 54 foreign principal investigators in 16 countries in addition to U.S. scientists. (A&A 70; Pres Rpt 71)
•	Aerospace industry sales continued anticipated decline in 1969, to

Increase reflected delivery of wide-bodied jet transports. Space sales continued decline, to $3,606 million from $4,272 million in 1969, beciause of completion of Apollo program hardware phase and decline in military space expenditures. Aerospace industry remained Nation’s largest manufacturing employer during 1970, with more than 1 million workers. Employment in aerospace industry declined from average of 1 347 000 workers in December 1969 to 1 067 000 in December 1970.
