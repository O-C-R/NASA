January 7: NASA’s Surveyor VII (Surveyor G), last spacecraft in NASA’s Surveyor Program to analyze lunar surface, was successfully launched from ETR by Atlas-Centaur (AC—15) booster on 67-hr lunar intercept trajectory. Primary mission for 2,293-lb (at launch) spacecraft was to softland on the moon and obtain postlanding TV pictures of lunar surface. As secondary mission spacecraft would determine relative abundance of chemical elements in lunar soil with alpha-scattering instrument; manipulate lunar material with surface sampler in view of TV camera; and obtain touchdown dynamics, thermal, and radar reflectivity data [see Jan. 9—22]. Surveyor VII—which also carried magnets attached to landing pads, mirrors for viewing beneath spacecraft and for stereo photography, and seven special dust-detection mirrors—was first in Surveyor series to carry both alpha-scattering instrument and surface sampler.
Launch sequence for Surveyor VII was flawless, and spacecraft performed nominally. First of two scheduled midcourse maneuvers was so precise that second correction was not necessary; maneuver directed spacecraft toward a point 1.6 mi from center of target area.
Surveyor VII was seventh in series of seven spacecraft designed to prove out design, develop technology of lunar softlanding, obtain postlanding TV pictures of lunar surface, and provide basic scientific and engineering data in support of Project Apollo. Surveyor program was directed by ossa Lunar and Planetary Programs Div.; project management was assigned to JPL; Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle was managed by LeRC; and prime contractor for spacecraft development and design was Hughes Aircraft Co.

January 9—22: nasa’s Surveyor VII, launched Jan. 7, became fifth U.S. spacecraft to sofdand on moon when it touched down in Tycho crater ejecta after 66-hr 35-min flight and began transmitting first of 21,274 detailed television pictures to JPL Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
Landing sequence began when Surveyor VII shifted its normal cruising attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar, main ret-romotor slowed spacecraft to 3y2 mph; retromotor then ejected. Vernier engines cut off at 13 ft above lunar surface and spacecraft landed.
First photos transmitted showed Surveyor VII was resting in rock-strewn area. Later photos consisted of wide and narrow angle surveys, panoramas, and special area surveys of spacecraft and landing area, including closeups of rocky debris on rim of Tycho crater and rugged landscape with prominences and boulders estimated to be three stories high. Stereo pictures were obtained with special mirrors; polarization pictures were taken of lunar surface, geologically interesting rocks, and earth; and photos of Jupiter and earth were obtained. Camera also photographed laser beams directed at spacecraft from Table Mountain, Calif., and Kitt Peak, Ariz., observatories, two of six U.S. stations which directed laser beams. Test, first use of light to communicate over such great distance, was considered highly significant for future use of lasers in communications and measurements in space and on earth and was expected to permit distance between points on moon and on earth to be measured with accuracy of six inches. Special surveys of dust-detection mirrors showed no accumulation of dust. Footpad magnets did not show a significant adherence to particles, but material did accumulate on surface sampler scoop magnet.
Only flaw in mission occurred Jan. 10 when alpha-scattering instrument failed to contact lunar surface after command to deploy had been issued. Photos revealed that although release squib had fired, instrument had remained in background count position. Efforts to dislodge it by rocking solar panel were unsuccessful. After satisfactory bearing-strength data had been obtained, engineers positioned surface sampler on top of alpha-scattering instrument, applied downward force, and successfully released instrument without damage. Alpha-scattering instrument, moved by surface sampler to its initial position over soil, to second position' over rock, and to third position over one-half-inch-deep trench, obtained data for 63 hr 2 min. Surface sampler conducted six bearing-strength tests; excavated several trenches, including one 16 in long and over 6 in deep; turned over large rock for examination by TV
camera; and attracted gravel-size rock with its magnet. On Jan. 22, communications with spacecraft were halted to preserve battery power during cold of lunar night.
Performance of Surveyor VII, final mission in NASA’s Surveyor program to analyze lunar surface, was excellent. Surveyor I (launched May 30, 1966), Surveyor III (launched April 17,-^1967), Surveyor V (launched Sept. 8, 1967), and Surveyor VI (laynehed Nov. 7, 1967) had all softlanded successfully and transmitted'I'pfiptos to earth. Surveyor II (launched Sept. 20, 1966) had failed to softland because of an ignition failure. Communications with Surveyor IV (launched July 14, 1967) were lost seconds before spacecraft was scheduled to softland, and its condition could not be determined, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67-316K; AP, W Post, 1/10/68, Al; upi, W Star, 1/10/68, A3; AP, B Sun, 1/11/68, Al; SBD, 1/11/68, 56; Hill, NYT, 1/12/68, 4; W Post, 1/13/68, A5; Clark, NYT, 1/22/68, 17).

The 460-lb, gravity-gradient satellite, launched to contribute to completion of NASA-managed U.S. National Geodetic Satellite Program (ngsp), carried six geodetic systems for development of a more precise model of earth’s gravitational field and improvement of knowledge of earth’s size and shape: (1) flashing-light beacons with 6,620-candle-sec-per-fIash combined candle emittance to be photographed against background of stars; (2) corner cube quartz reflectors to pinpoint satellite’s position by reflecting a laser beam; (3) three radio transmitters to help determine satellite’s line-of-sight velocity using Doppler shift principle and USN tranet equipment; (4) radio transponder to provide distance between satellite and interrogating USA SECOR network ground station; (5) range and range-rate transponders for simultaneous determination of satellite-to-ground-station range and line-of-sight velocity, using NASA’s stadan system; and (6) C-band transponder systems at stadan stations for calibration and experimentation to determine applicability of C-band radar tracking system to satellite geodesy. Primary mission objectives were to obtain 90 days of precision spacecraft position data, support geodetic positioning of 40 reference control points and 64 densifieation observation sites, and evaluate accuracy of ground-based C-band radars.
Explorer XXXVI was fifth satellite launched in ngsp series and second in geos series.

Scientists said NASA and Boeing Co. were interested in new line of sst research. Electrical discharge—up to 30,000 volts in tests to date—would repel molecules of air and remove them from aircraft’s path; molecules would then flow smoothly around aircraft instead of bunching ahead to cause sonic boom. Scientists admitted electrical discharge could interfere with radio and TV broadcasts and with communications between aircraft and ground. (AP, W Post, 1/19/68, A5)

•	Telescope at Univ. of Arizona’s Planetary Laboratory photographed
Lunar Orbiter V as it appeared beyond left limb of moon’s face. Scientists believed experiment to be first success in sending observable light signals from moon’s vicinity to earth. Some 80 photos were made through 61-in telescope by team of three astronomers under Laboratory’s Director, Dr. Gerard Kuiper, in experiment conducted for NASA and spacecraft’s designer and builder, Boeing Co. Satellite was visible on 52 photos. Boeing engineers oriented Lunar Orbiter V so its shiny panels reflected sunlight toward earth. Astronomers reduced stray light near very bright moon to prevent multiple reflections within telescope from reaching photographic plates. Dr. Kuiper explained that spacecraft resembled 12th-magnitude star in brilliance. These reference data,
used with radar tracking data, would enable scientists to locate more precisely center of mass of moon with respect to its visible limb. Lunar Orbiter V was crashed on the moon Jan. 31. (nasa Release 68-34; NYT, 2/20/68,19)
January 22: NASA’s Apollo 5 (AS—204) unmanned earth orbital mission, delayed for nearly four hours because of ground equipment malfunctions, was successfully launched from ksc Complex 37 at 5:48 pm est in fourth flight of Saturn IB and first flight of 31,700-lb lunar module (LM—1), designed to land two astronauts on the moon. Primary mission objectives were to verify operation of LM ascent propulsion system (aps), descent propulsion system (dps)—including restart—and spacecraft structures; evaluate LM staging; and evaluate 2nd-stage (S—IVB) and instrument-unit (iu) orbital performance.
Launch phase occurred as planned; S—IVB ignited to insert spacecraft into orbit with 138-mi (222-km) apogee, 101-mi (163-km) perigee, 88.3-min period, and 31.63° inclination; nose cone jettisoned; spacecraft coasted for 43 min 52 sec; and LM separated from spacecraft LM adapter. LM entered orbit with 138-mi (222-km) apogee, 104-mi (167km) perigee, 88.4-min period, and 31.63° inclination. Initial 39-sec dps burn, designed to simulate deceleration for descent to lunar surface, was automatically shut down after only 4 sec because of overly conservative computer programming. Ground controllers switched to minimum requirement sequence, an alternate flight plan with shorter total dps firing time and no provision for lunar landing simulation. Second dps engine firing occurred successfully, with 26-sec burn at 10% thrust level and 7 sec at maximum thrust. Third DPS engine firing 32 sec later consisted of 26-sec bum at 10% thrust, 2 sec at maximum thrust, and ascent stage fire-in-the-hole (fith) burn during which the two stages separated and aps engine was ignited simultaneously while dps was being shut down, simulating abort during landing phase. Duration of initial aps burn during abort staging was 60 sec, aps engine fired second time for 6 min 23 sec until fuel was depleted. At end of 11-hr 10min test period, both stages of the lm were left in orbit eventually to reenter and disintegrate.
Apollo 5 mission, adjudged successful by NASA in spite of premature dps engine shutdown, proved out structural integrity of lm; verified in-space operation of dps and APS; and proved value of contingency planning, lm was last major piece of Apollo hardware to have its first test in space. Command module (cm) had been tested during AS—203 mission (July 5, 1966) and with service module (sm) on AS—202 (Aug. 25, 1966) and Apollo 4 (AS-501) (Nov. 9, 1967).

•	At aiaa’s 6th Aerospace Sciences Meeting in New York City, NASA Asso-
ciate Administrator, Dr. Homer E. Newell, compared current space activities with those of past: “Today, as we note the anniversaries of Sputnik, Explorer, and Vanguard, we do well to take stock of where we are and where we are going in Space, for after a decade of unparalleled success we find ourselves having to resell our fellow citizens this greatest adventure of mankind.”
Ten years ago “we could only assert from intuition and prophecy the value of space techniques to science. Today, we can point to a profound influence that space' has had on the geosciences, is having on astronomy, and is beginning to have in life sciences.” Ten years ago, planning for future required organizational and management, as well as disciplinary and technical, capability to achieve objectives. Now it could be based on established capability in science, engineering, and administration; proved reliability of wide variety of launch vehicles; demonstrated ability to use automatic techniques in space and to con-
struct and fly new large systems successfully; and demonstrated capability of man to operate in space. Major problem of mastering space technology was solved, failures were few, and success, once “rare and precious commodity,” became routine.
Budget reductions and postponement of new space missions would continue until resolution of Vietnam war, but long-term outlook for space explorations, research, and applications was good: (1) “the intrinsic worth of the program merits die interest and support of the . . . people”; (2) post World War II babies raised in midst of space age “will in the 70’s become a powerful force of intelligent, highly educated people . . . [who will] want to continue” space exploration; (3) U.S.S.R. would continue vigorous, expanding program, presenting challenge U.S. would have to meet; (4) as U.S. economic growth continued and military expenditures decreased, resources would be available and need for vigorous U.S. space program recognized; and (5) gap between professionals and laymen would be bridged by space-oriented younger generation.
NASA’s key policies were directed toward preserving U.S. space capability and laying groundwork for vigorous program in 1970s. NASA would seek approval from Congress and Executive Branch to initiate programs, increase emphasis on aeronautics and space applications and practical applications on earth, and continue to support development of key advanced technologies.

•	arc scientists Dr. Cyril A. Ponnamperuma and Fritz H. Woeller said
gigantic red spot on Jupiter’s atmosphere might be millions of square miles of red organic dye. Scientists had made large number of electrical energy discharges (lightning) in simulated Jupiter atmosphere of ammonia and methane, atmosphere mix agreed to by most scientists, and had produced quantities of amino acids and other organic materials. Most common product had been organic dyestuff with ruby red translucency. From experiments and spectroscopic and theoretical studies, scientists concluded red spot might result from giant meteor craters in solid hydrogen surface of Jupiter creating vortex in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Since atmosphere might be largely red dye, upwelling caused by vortex would create red spot in top of dense surrounding white clouds. Jupiter was like huge dynamo, rotating once every 10 hr; rapid
alternation of day and night, hence warm and cold, was believed to produce great atmospheric turbulence and electrical energy transfer. (arc Release 68—3)

January 29: President Johnson sent message to Congress on FY 1969 budget.
Praising effectiveness of NASA’s cost reduction efforts, he noted that NASA by utilizing idle, excess, and surplus Government property had avoided expenditures of over $22 million for new equipment and facilities and had saved over $16 million by improving procurement practices. However, to meet urgent national needs in other areas, further reductions still had to be made. “New obligational authority requested for [nasa] ... is about $220 million below the 1968 amount. Expenditures will be $230 million below 1968, $850 million below 1967, and over $1.3 billion less than in 1966. This reduction reflects our progress beyond the costly research and development phases of the manned lunar mission, as well as the immediate need to postpone spending for new projects wherever possible.
“Based on a careful examination of priorities, the 1969 budget provides increases in some areas to prepare for important advances in future years, while deferring other less urgent, new projects. The production of our large Saturn-class space boosters is continued but at a reduced rate. The development of a nuclear rocket engine to increase the capability of our Saturn V launch vehicle is also continued, but at a smaller size and thrust than originally planned, to reduce development cost.”
Planetary exploration would be continued with development of “a new spacecraft for launch in 1973 to orbit and land on Mars. This new Mars mission will cost much less than half the Voyager program included in last year’s budget. Although the scientific result of this new mission will be less than that of the Voyager, it will still provide extremely valuable data and serve as a building block for planetary exploration systems of the future.”
Request for dod, increased “to assure that our defense capabilities remain equal to any challenge or threat,” included funds to: (1) maintain strategic deterrent by converting from Minuteman II to Poseidon missiles with multiple warheads and modernizing manned bomber force with additional F—111B aircraft and improved short-range attack missiles; (2) proceed with procurement of Sentinel missile defense system for defense against possible Communist Chinese threat and revamp air defense; (3) augment firepower, mobility, and readiness of general-purpose forces by improving air defenses with new fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and weapon systems; (4) improve airlift-sealift capability by purchasing additional C-5A aircraft and procuring fast deploy-
ment logistics ship; and (5) continue vigorous R&D effort. (The Budget of the United States Government, FY 1969, 26-9)
•	President Johnson submitted $186.1-billion FY 1969 budget request to
Congress, including $6.76-billion total space budget. Of this sum, NASA would receive $4.37 billion, smallest amount since 1963; dod space efforts, $2,216 billion; AEC space applications, $143 million; and ESSA satellite system, $30.6 million.	:
NASA FY 1969 budget, $218 million less than for FY 1968, provided for $3,677 billion to be spent for R&D (down $233 million from FY
1968	and $557 million from FY 1967); $45 million for construction of facilities; and $648 million for administrative operations. Project Apollo would be kept on schedule, development of NERVA I would be continued, and launch plans would be made for two pioneer flights toward Jupiter and one Sunblazer probe. Research on Earth Resources Observation Satellite would continue, but development would be postponed, ogo program would be phased out after OGO—f. NASA’s $2.5-billion Voyager program would be replaced with a $500-million, four-mission Mars orbiter project. Although NASA’s $2.039-billion Apollo budget request accounted for 47% of total NASA budget, amount for Apollo was $517 million less than for FY 1968, reflecting declining expenditures as program neared its completion. Requested $439.6 million for Apollo Applications (aa) program was less than half of amount originally sought and necessitated cancellation of planned 14-day AAP—1A flight. Some $76.9 million—a $10.1-million increase over FY 1968—was allotted for NASA’s aeronautics program, with most of increase attributed to additional supporting research in subsonic aircraft technology. XB—70 and X—15 research programs would be phased out by December 1968. Space science and applications were allotted $538.2 million, with 18 major NASA launches and 13 non-NASA launches scheduled for 1968.
Major portions of DOD space budget would be spent on mol—$600 million, compared with $431 million requested for FY 1968., Some $60.4 million was allocated for defense and tactical satellite communications programs, and $10.5 million for Vela nuclear test detection satellite program.
AEC space budget—$11 million higher than for FY 1968—included $72 million for Project Rover, with $39 million for nerva system. Most of essa’s funds would be used for development of sensors and satellite system in support of World Weather Watch and improved techniques for warning services, faa’s request included $351 million for SST development, $251 million increase over FY 1968 and one of largest increases given to any domestic program.

•	NASA released transcript of Jan. 27 background briefing on NASA FY
1969	budget, in which Administrator James E. Webb explained how Apollo program had been kept close to schedule in spite of severe budget cuts. Although budget had been reduced $600-million in 1964, NASA had been given great deal of flexibility to reprogram funds. “This in effect permitted the driving forward of the program even though
there were substantial reductions in the plan. I think if you examine all of the very large systems development in the country, you will not find a one that has kept more on schedule, given more for the money, and more nearly realized its goals on time than the Apollo, in spite of the fire, in spite of the reductions. The kind of rolling readjustment that we have had to make . . . has involved very large problems. And the projections we made as to our capability to meet problems of that kind have pretty well been borne out. . . . The fact is within this short period of time the Saturn V has flown. The heat shield on the Apollo has been improved. Service module has been tested. LM has been tested. And we have I think moved about as rapidly as any program—certainly more rapidly than any program of a comparable complexity.”
Webb said NASA and dod were studying closer cooperation “in the area of orbiting laboratories,” such as mol and Saturn V Workshop. He envisioned production of “a basic capability of a rather primitive sort, something like an Antarctic base flown on the Saturn V which could be used for any national purpose.” (Transcript)

Under new budget work on mol development would be increased substantially. “FY 1969 is expected to be a peak year of activity in the MOL program, including the completion of a major portion of the structural test programs on flight hardware, continued fabrication of hardware for the first three flights, developmental test firings of the seven-segment solid motors for the Titan III—M, and installation of the ground equipment in the launch complex.” (Text)

been “exactly on time or within a few hundredths of a second until second stage but still within tolerance limits.’’ Trajectories of both stages had been within expected tolerances, and orbit insertion conditions had been met satisfactorily, (msfc Release 68-17)
•	arc scientists Dr. Gordon W. Hodgson and Dr. Cyril A. Ponnamperuma
had demonstrated by synthesizing molecules in porphyrin group, of which chlorophyll was a member, means by which chlorophyll might have first appeared on earth. By subjecting ammonia, methane, and water in a simulated primitive atmosphere to continuous lightning charges, scientists created new molecular combinations, including some tentatively identified as porphyrins. Such a process of chemical evolution to form of self-sustaining life probably occurred during billion years of earth’s 4.5 billion years. Scientists confirmed synthesis with tests, but warned that materials might not be true porphyrins but structurally related compounds, (arc Release 68-4)
•	Shipment of LM—2, second Apollo lunar module, and associated Saturn
IB launch vehicle to ksc had been postponed pending further evaluation of Apollo 5 mission results [see Jan. 27 and 30]. Initial evaluations of first lm flight, Jan. 22—23, had indicated that second unmanned flight might not be required to qualify spacecraft for manned flight. NASA announced that further “detailed review of Apollo 5 flight data and deliberations by a [nasa] design certification review board in March will determine the final decision.” (nasa Release 68-21).

January 31: Tenth anniversary of first U.S. satellite, Explorer /, launched by abma—jpl team with Jupiter C booster. In defiance of original prediction of three-year lifespan, 30.8-lb stovepipe-shaped spacecraft had traveled 1 y2 billion miles and was expected to continue orbiting through 1968, though silent. Explorer /, currently in orbit with 771mi (1,241-km) apogee, 215-mi (346-km) perigee, and 100-min period, had stopped transmitting data May 23, 1958, after supplying data on cosmic rays, micrometeoroids, and temperature and discovering one of earth’s radiation belts later named after Dr. James A. Van Allen, designer of satellite’s radiation-detection experiment.
At National Press Club Ceremony in Washington, D.C., commemorating anniversary, Dr. William H. Pickering, jpl Director, reviewed

American and Soviet space statistics: “The U.S, has placed about 500 vehicles in Earth orbit to 250 for the USSR. We have had 13 successful missions to the Moon, the USSR 8. Our reconnaissance spacecraft have obtained about 100,000 high-resolution photographs of the Moon; USSR craft have returned about 100. The U.S. has had three successful
missions to the near planets in five attempts. Russia has successfully landed an instrumented package on Venus after an estimated 19 planetary attempts. We have accumulated nearly 2,000 hours of manned space flight time, compared with about 530 for the USSR. Our astronauts have performed multiple rendezvous and docking operations; the Soviets have demonstrated one automatic docking. We have logged over 12 hours of extravehicular activity; the USSR shows 20 minutes.”
Dr. Wernher von Braun, msfc Director, critical of cuts in NASA budget, noted: “nasa has not been able to plan for post-Apollo projects with any degree of certainty. NASA has attempted production of the Saturn IB and Saturn V at the rate of two each per year. Frankly, this rate is too low to maintain the progress and momentum so painstakingly acquired in the space program over the past decade.
“The dismantling of the high competence built up over the years at jpl and [msfc] has already begun. Both organizations are already losing valuable, highly trained people because of the insecurity and the lack of challenging work for them to do. And we face the grim reality of even further reductions and cutbacks. . . . The exploration of space has proven its worth, and has become deeply ingrained into the everyday fabric of our society. . . .” Space program would be examined closely by Congress, Dr. von Braun said, but “NASA’s record of accomplishments and the ability of its management will bear up well under the scrutiny. In determining what our space program should be during the coming years . . . members of Congress . . . [should] give careful consideration to where we are today in space, at the end of our first decade, and where we could be ten years from now, by building on the accomplishments of the past.” (EH; Texts; msfc Release 68—14; Clark, NYT, 2/1/68, 15)
• NASA announced end of Lunar Orbiter project. Lunar Orbiter V, launched Aug. 1, 1967, had obeyed spacecraft controllers and crashed on lunar surface after 1,200 orbits. Final operation of spacecraft had consisted of 18.9-sec burn of velocity control engine at apolune to decrease speed by 64 mph for orbit decay. Impact occurred at 2:58.5 am, est, near equator on moon’s western limb. Destruction of Lunar Orbiter V had become necessary because its supply of attitude control gas was nearly depleted. In concentrating on 36 areas of moon’s face, spacecraft had completed coverage necessary for full photographic survey of moon’s hidden side, photographing and transmitting 212 telephoto and 212 wide-angle pictures of lunar surface. Spacecraft had also been used to provide tracking target to msfn stations and for crew training and computer program verification.
Lunar Orbiters I, II, and III had been crashed on Oct. 29, 1966, Oct. 11, 1967, and Oct. 9, 1967, as their control gas became exhausted. Communications were lost with Lunar Orbiter IV, and it had apparently crashed on lunar surface. During Lunar Orbiter project, since first launch Aug. 10, 1966, 6,034 orbits of moon had been completed and more than 99% of lunar surface had been photographed by orbiting cameras to provide data for selection of eight candidate landing sites for Apollo project. Lunar Orbiter program was directed by ossa and managed by LaRC. Boeing Co. was prime spacecraft contractor, (nasa Proj Off; nasa Release 68-23)
•	Apollo 204 accident was reviewed in Senate Report No. 956, issued
by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: “The thorough investigation by the Apollo 204 Review Board . . . determined that the test conditions at the time of the accident were extremely hazardous. However, the test was not recognized as being hazardous by either NASA or the contractor prior to the accident. The committee can only conclude that NASA’s long history of successes in testing and launching space vehicles . . . led to overconfidence and complacency.” Committee recommended that “safety ... be considered of paramount importance in the manned space flight program even at the expense of target dates” and urged NASA to keep “appropriate Congressional committees informed on significant problems arising in its programs.” Individually, three Committee members—Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), Sen. Edward W. Brooke (R-Mass.), and Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Ill.)—filed more critical separate reports. Sen. Brooke and Sen. Percy stated: “. . . NASA’s curious reticence to supply these facts and figures [Phillips Report] relevant to a thorough evaluation of Apollo program management brought the credibility of NASA and its top management into sharp question [and] this initial lack of candor as to the existence and then the status of the Phillips report threatened one of the essential assets of the space program—the confidence of the American public and their elected representatives.” Sen. Mondale said NASA “has an unfortunate habit of swamping Congress with engineering details and starving it for policy and management information. . . . Congress should be able to count on frank answers to pertinent, responsible, and legitimate inquiries.”
Criticizing Committee’s report, Rep. William F. Ryan (D-N.Y.) said in news release later, “Although the Senate Committee does charge NASA with such misdemeanors as overconfidence and complacency, the report remains a whitewash and an evasion of the real issues involved.” (Texts)
•	Senate Report No. 957, Aeronautical Research and Development Policy,

During January: New knowledge of movement and state of electrons in Van Allen radiation belts that explained movement of electrons into and out of belts and trapped electron activity was reported from three new discoveries. Bell Telephone Laboratories used energetic particle
collectors aboard NASA’s Ats I, launched Dec. 6,1966, to show that high-energy outer Van Allen belt electrons exhibited bunching phenomenon as they drifted around earth in its magnetic field. Bell scientist Charles S. Roberts presented theory that “radio noise in the charged particle gas” surrounding earth was “responsible for the loss of electrons from the Van Allen belts, rather than the mere presence of lightning-bolt-initiated whistlers alone, as previously believed.” At Nov. 16, 1967, meeting, Dr. James A. Van Allen had presented satellite-collected data suggesting that “both electrons and protons enter the outer Van Allen radiation belt” drawn by high voltage generated across earth’s magnetic field, caused by earth’s spin between dawn and evening sides of earthsurrounding magnetic envelope.

•	U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency released Technological In-
novation in Civilian Public Areas, study by Analytic Services Inc. which urged Government to continue support of advanced R&D on domestic problem-solving to prevent economic decline if disarmament agreement were reached. Unless such R&D was funded, study said, it was questionable whether large demonstration projects to alleviate domestic problems could be undertaken quickly enough to offset substantial reductions in defense spending. Defense industry could help solve civilian programs, study concluded, but it questioned whether industry noted for technological innovation would not encounter serious obstacles in orienting its activities to areas which often had resisted innovation in any form.

•	India could be first developing country to orbit her own artificial satel-
lite, according to recommendations of five-man mission of UNESCO. Satellite would be first of “distribution” communications design, more powerful than current point-to-point satellites such as Early Bird I and requiring less complex ground facilities. Operating under long-term plan to end in 1981, India would build 56 ground stations which would bring TV to 25% of population. Network of 160 stations could reach 80% of India’s population. Mission recommended India produce 50,000 home TV receivers by 1970—1971 and enter into bilateral agreement with major space power to purchase satellite and launching services.

•	Payoff from space investment (in satellite applications in extended
weather forecasting, reduced cost, and extended range for telecommunications) was discussed in Space/Aeronautics. Government policy on future satellite applications would depend on four “key study efforts”: (1) study by Presidential Task Force on Communications Policy on status of INTELSAT and its role in global and foreign domestic comsat systems; (2) study by NAS on potential of applications satellites and “an effective cost/benefit strategy”; (3) recommendation by President’s Commission and Council on Marine Sciences for consolidation of Federal efforts in marine engineering and oceanography, and creation of policy framework hospitable to applications satellites; and (4) European organization of firms’ formulation of arguments advocating four regional systems rather than one global network.

•	History of lunar nomenclature and tradition in naming lunar features
was reviewed by Director of Fels Planetarium, Dr. I. M. Levitt, in Air Force and Space Digest. Knowledge from space research had created
complications for specialists who had to name lunar features. In past, craters, mountains, rills, and seas on moon had heen named for scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers. In 1647, Johannes Hevelius had published Selenographica in Danzig, setting stage for naming lunar features. Ground rules were set down in 1932 hy International Astronomical Union (iau) , which formed committee of astronomers to select names.
U.S.S.R. had asked 1967 General Assembly of iau to pass on 153 more names for features on moon’s hidden side. Levitt recommended that names of dead astronauts—both American and Russian—be accepted for lunar nomenclature; later, living astronauts could be similarly honored. Also pioneers in space research—“such as Goddard, von Braun, Gilruth, Newell, Ley, Lovelace, Flickinger, Stehling, and so on” —and astronomers and; benefactors of mankind could be considered. (.AF/SD, 1/68, 66-9)
• William Leavitt in Air Force and Space Digest asked: “Are antiballistic missile systems necessarily provocative and ‘destabilizing’ in the sense that they will inevitably set off a new spiral in the arms race? Many— but hy no means all—scientists answer ‘yes’ to these questions, despite impressions to the contrary.” Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory Dr. Alvin Weinberg, who would answer “no” to abm question, was quoted: “The deployment of abms on both sides has been deplored as the first step in the unending arms spiral that eventually will consume everything, including our vision of abundance. But suppose ABMs and other defensive measures turn out to be effective, and at the same time there is no escalation of offense in unending spiral. The knife-edge of delicately balanced terror would then be blunted.” (Leavitt, AF/SD, 1/68, 72-4)

•	Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, in annual report to Con-
gress, stated before joint session of Senate Armed Services Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that U.S.S.R. had nearly closed nuclear missile gap in 1967 by more than doubling its IBM force. According to intelligence estimates, Soviet buildup could give U.S.S.R. capability of delivering about 1,000 nuclear warheads and bombs; U.S. could deliver up to 4% times that number. Both U.S. and U.S.S.R. possessed strategic forces capable of withstanding surprise attack and retaliating overwhelmingly against the other. “It is precisely this mutual capability to destroy one another, and conversely, our respective inability to prevent such destruction, that provides us both with the strongest possible motive to avoid a strategic nuclear war.” Communist China’s medium-range missiles, and icbms could be operational as a “modest” force in mid-1970s.

In next 10 yr, “as an increasingly important area of scientific and technical research a balanced program in space must certainly be part of the activities of our Nation,” Dr. Kaplan said. “No more noble and useful service can be conceived than one which gives strength to . . . cooperation among the nations of the earth. Space certainly qualifies for such a role.”
Dr. Findlay outlined possible missions “of strong scientific interest” to Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter in next decade. Gen. Betts voiced concern about attitudes toward exploratory efforts; he was “not convinced that we remember, the lesson” of Sputnik /. “Only some two weeks” after its launch, numerous programs were proposed for U.S. satellite—possible only because “far-sighted technical people had been planning for various applications of space for some time, and even though firm military requirements were not available.” (jpl Releases, 1/22/68, 1/31/68; Texts; Wilford, NYT, 2/2/68, 4; SBD, 1/26/68, 38)

Teels had been established Nov. 21, 1963, by Indian National Commission for Space Research (incospar) and to date had launched 52 rockets: 17 American Nike-Apaches, 29 American Judi-Darts, and 6 French Centaures. Rockets launched as part of dedication included two Nike-Apaches, one Judi-Dart, and one Centaure. Payloads contained experiments involving French, Soviet, and American collaboration with India. India’s Dept, of Atomic Energy planned Centaure manufacturing unit at terls, and incospar would build space science and technology center at Veli (near terls) to design and develop space research systems, including vehicle, payload, instrumentation, and ground support.
Mrs. Gandhi said: “This center represents only one facet of the tremendous industrial and technological revolution in which we are involved. . . . Technology is a key. It is a key to knowledge that opens the door to plenty as well as power. In a sense it is a key to independence, for it was the failure to advance technologically which made Asia and Africa dependent and poverty-stricken.” (nasa Release 68-14; WS Release 68—1; India News, 2/2/68, 4; LA Times, 2/3/68; B Sun, 6/30/68)

• President’s authorization request for NASA’s FY 1969 budget was presented by nasa Administrator James E. Webb to House Committee on Science and Astronautics. At $4.37 billion, authorization request was $700 million below FY 1968 request, almost $500 million less than FY 1968 authorization, and $200 million below FY 1968 appropriation. Webb stated: “nasa’s expenditures for FY 1969 will be down $230 million from this year, $850 million below last year, and $1.3 billion less than in FY 1966. The nasa program has been cut. I hope you will decide it has been cut enough and will approve the full amount recommended by the President.
“The FY 1969 request does not meet at all our Nation’s needs in aeronautics and space. It is a compromise—one which I fully support— between needed work toward advances in aeronautics and space which we can and should make, and other overriding requirements. . . . During this period when we are reducing our effort by one-third the U.S.S.R. is still increasing its effort. ... In terms of scientific advance and in applications of immediate economic use, such as meteorological and communications systems, our program has contributed more than theirs. But in terms of the use of large launch vehicles and in the rate of which future greater capabilities are being developed they are and will remain ahead, at our 1969 budget level. The hard fact we now face is that just as we have begun to catch up in large-scale booster operations ... we are cutting back our program while they continue to advance.”
He listed guidelines within “necessary fiscal constraints,” which determined decisions on FY 1969 program and budget estimates. NASA would continue 1968 operating plan for Apollo program while using all-up test concept for Saturn V and Apollo. Complete success in all remaining eight Saturn V flights would be needed for manned lunar landing by “end of 1969.” nasa would reduce numbers of Saturn IB and V and work out with dod future requirements for large launch vehicles under “sharply limited” launch program. Launch of Saturn I Workshop in 1970 would be interim step toward Saturn V Workshop and would be coordinated with later launch of Apollo Telescope Mount. “Practically all” programs had been stretched out, and a number of projects would be phased out.
Scope of new starts would be reduced, with nerva i replacing larger nerva n and “less costly Mariner class spacecraft” replacing Voyager mission. Urgent activities would be expanded in aeronautics and in space applications; for example, noise reduction, vtol and stol, aircraft for remote measurement of earth resources, and Nimbus D for charting atmosphere parameters.
nasa Centers would be reorganized “to retain . . . after reductions [in work force] are made, a limited but strong and well-balanced team of scientists, engineers, program and project managers.”
Webb responded to questions: “There are no signs that the Soviets are cutting back as we are. New test and launch facilities are steadily added . . . and a number of spaceflight systems more advanced than any heretofore used are nearing completion.” Webb forecast Soviet booster with thrust greater than that of Saturn V, resumption of manned space flights, and landing of Soviet instrument packages on Mars in 1969 and 1971. Budget reductions in FY 1968 had compelled revisions, reductions, delays and cancellations in NASA programs. “We can conduct a viable and useful program at these lower levels, hut it will be a sharply reduced one.”
Despite reductions allowing almost no flexibility to work around problems, “we still have the possibility of making the lunar landing before 1970.” (CR, 2/7/68, H926-7 ; 2/12/68, E708-9)
• Testimony on NASA’s FY 1969 Budget request was presented to House Committee on Science and Astronautics by three NASA Associate Administrators.
NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. John E. Naugle, presented ossa’s budget for “an austere program for the immediate future,” yet one that would make “effective use in the years ahead of the capabilities we have developed in the past decade” and that would advance scientific knowledge and useful applications. “New starts are at a minimum,” he said, “but if this budget request is approved, we can continue the most useful of our on-going programs, we can avoid abandoning the field of planetary exploration, and we can hold together teams and capabilities to meet future national needs. ...” Authorization request for ossa for 1969 was for $538.2 million, $14.7 million below FY 1968 operating plan, with “the decrease . . . primarily in the Lunar and Planetary Programs budget, reflecting the completion of the initial automated phase of lunar exploration and cancellation of Voyager.” Space applications budget request had increased for FY 1969 (to $112.2 million) because of “demonstrated value of communications and meteorological programs and the potential value of applying space technology on a global basis.”
NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, Dr. Mac C. Adams, described oart program as “the key to tomorrow’s leadership in aeronautics and space.” He explained: “. . . our FY 69 budget request for the R&D line items ... is $336,800,000, up 5.7 percent over FY 68. The increase is primarily due to increases in effort on aircraft technology [up to $10.1 million] and nuclear rockets [up $6 million], . . . Major changes also included more v/stol research, noise research for subsonic jets, and development of NERVA I nuclear rocket engine at thrust level of 75,000 lb.
nasa Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski presented FY 1969 budget request of $304.8 million for R&D and $21.8 million for construction of facilities and reported that “50 satellites by the end of 1968” would be supported by network while “some 16 new missions” would be launched in FY 1969. For FY 1969, “the great majority of funds requested will be directed toward operating and maintaining present network capability. Much of the existing equipment has been operated almost continuously for at least eight years and must be refurbished or replaced.”
Construction of facilities budget would fund: two 210-ft-dia antennas
for Spain and Australia; power generating plant for Fairbanks, Alaska, tracking station; and Sunblazer antenna. (Testimony)
•	NASA awarded Boeing Co. $3,226,374 supplement to its Saturn V systems
engineering and integration effort, bringing this portion of Boeing’s three-part Saturn V contract to $194.8-million total. Boeing would be responsible for propulsion systems’ preflight and postflight performance analysis for first 10 launch vehicles, (msfc Release 68-28)
February 8: NASA management officials continued to testify on their programs, within NASA’s FY 1969 budget request, to House Committee on Science and Astronautics.
NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, said omsf’s $2.815-billion FY 1969 request was lowest request since FY 1963, $332.8 million below FY 1968, and “almost $700 million below the peak Manned Space Flight budget year, Fiscal Year 1966.” Dr. Mueller included $2,483 billion for R&D, $18.7 million for construction of facilities, and $313 million for administrative operations. Over 80% of total r&d report was committed to Apollo. “The program of Apollo and Apollo Applications Flights, with the development of the Saturn V Workshop and the Advanced Missions studies leading to a space station of longer duration and greater earth orbital capabilities, constitute a minimum effort to continue manned space flight into the early 1970s.” Dr. Mueller warned against failing “to capitalize on the investment in the Apollo Program” and said it was “economically prudent to proceed now with the Apollo Program and the definition study of the . . . long duration space station . . . keystone in the future of manned space flight.”
NASA Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Harold B. Finger, citing 27% decrease in procurement for first three months of FY 1968 below same period in 1967, predicted 94% of procurement dollars going to industry would decrease to less than 90% by end of FY 1969 as industry-developed systems came into NASA for testing and launch. Presenting $ 10-million Sustaining University program budget—equal to 1968 budget but one-third 1967’s $30 million—Finger stressed need for university contributions and combining universities’ “demonstrated competence in physical sciences with their social science strengths to deal with the total impact of the nation’s aerospace effort.” Finger submitted statement of Dr. Richard L. Lesher, Assistant Administrator for Technology Utilization, describing programs “to experimentally test and develop methods for bringing about the multiple use of the new knowledge gained as a result of NASA activities.”
nasa Assistant Administrator for Administration William E. Lilly charged $7.8-million increase in FY 1969 administrative operations budget request (from $640.4-million budget for FY 1968) to cost of 1967 Pay Act and conversion to civil service of certain gsfc support services. He cited personnel reduction of 1,704 positions since freeze on hiring new employees on Aug. 24, 1967. (Testimony)

Past neutral appraisals had generally agreed with Petrovich that U.S.S.R.’s payloads had been heavier and U.S. hardware more sophisticated. Recent contradiction had been intricate softlanding for Soviet Venus IV, Oct. 18, 1967, and successful U.S. test of Saturn V, world’s largest booster, Nov. 9, 1967. Petrovich praised NASA’s broad application of space equipment in practical commercial use of satellite technology for communication, meteorology, and navigation. (Winters, B Sun, 2/9/68, A3)

•	“Space Activities and the National Well-Being” were discussed in speech
before Detroit’s Economic Club by Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight. “It is a measure of how far we have come in space in 10 years,” he said, “to consider that, with the flight of the Apollo-Saturn V last November, and the flight of the lunar module on January 22, we have now successfully flight-tested and proven every piece of the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle, the vehicle the United States will use . . . for the exploration of space for years to come.”
He warned that while U.S. was decreasing its rate of investment in space activities, “Soviets are spending 50 per cent more in terms of real purchasing power than we are. In percentage of gross national product, they are spending 2 or 3 times as much as we are.”
He noted that “when we launched our first satellite, Explorer I, the cost was several millions of dollars per pound of payload to get it up in orbit. With the Saturn V, we are now able to put payloads into orbit for only about $500 per pound. Considering that reduction from millions of dollars per pound to hundreds of dollars per pound in orbit over a period of only 10 years, one can foresee reducing the cost to $50 per pound or even $5 per pound for getting into and out of orbit.”
Saturn V development should move U.S. ahead during next year, but U.S.S.R. would soon surpass U.S. “as the full impact of the resources they are putting into their space program at this time becomes evident. And I would expect that by 1971 or 1972 we will be significantly behind them in terms of all of the aspects that we now know will be characteristic of space flight.” (Text)
•	Radar map of planet Venus had been produced by Cornell Univ. scien-
tists from computer-assembled data. Radar-astronomy data had been gathered by world’s largest radiotelescope at Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory in Puerto Rico. Principal scientist Raymond F. Jurgens said map was equivalent to what largest optical telescope on earth could obtain were it not for thick cloud cover obscuring Venusian surface. Measurements had been made in 1964 and 1967 when Venus was nearest earth, 26 million miles away. Cornell’s Center for Radiophysics and Space Research Director Thomas Gold concluded from measurements that Venus’ surface material was denser than moon’s. Scientists confirmed that Venus rotated with same face toward earth each time it passed nearest earth. Radar observations revealed rough areas near plan-
et’s equator and probable steep mountain range in southern hemisphere. One-third of Venus had already been mapped; data needed for map of almost entire planet were available. (AP, NYT, 2/13/68, 30)

•	Lockheed Aircraft Corp. engineer John W. Jones was granted patents
3,369,455 and 3,369,485 for new rocket-launching technique with potential military and space applications. Rockets encased in liquid-filled plastic sheaths were fired from a gun, after which sheath fell away, solid propellant ignited, and rocket continued on its own power. Jones said high-altitude research probes could be conducted using seven- or eight-inch gun at one-half to one-fourth cost of present methods. Protective sheath and liquid permitted use of new thin-walled military rockets which had better flight performance and traveled twice as fast as standard artillery shell.

•	Explaining decision to develop flight-rated nerva engine at 75,000-lb
rather than 200,000-lb thrust level, NASA Manager of Space Nuclear Propulsion Milton Klein told House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Advanced Research and Technology Subcommittee that lower level would be suitable for most missions in which nuclear rocket was significantly advantageous. It was “substantially off-optimum for manned planetary landing missions,” but with manned exploration delayed, “less emphasis is now properly placed upon that mission, and the 75,000-pound-thrust nerva class is appropriate. . . . The 75,000-pound-thrust nerva gives somewhat better payload performance for orbital operations missions which start from low Earth orbit and involve a single Saturn V launch,” but its use for manned planetary missions “entails a significant performance penalty.” Further development might be required “to extend operating time and to accommodate more extensive clustering and staging if such a mission were to be undertaken.” (Testimony)
•	Within limited budget, nasa was “attempting increased emphasis on As-
tronomy” using manned spaceflight capabilities, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. John E.

February 21—22: NASA successfully launched six Nike-Apache sounding rockets carrying chemical cloud experiments from NASA Wallops Station between 6:17 pm and 6:02 am est. Seven launches had been scheduled, but second launch was postponed because of payload problems [see Feb. 26]. Rockets ejected vapor trails during descent between 50- and 90-mi (81- and 145-km) altitudes to measure wind velocities and directions at various altitudes in upper atmosphere. Nike-Apache launched at dawn carried sodium experiment which created reddish-orange trail. Other five payloads consisted of one triethylborane (teb) and four trimethyl-aluminum (tma) experiments which formed pale blue and green clouds. Rocket carrying TEB was equipped with photometer to observe airglow in sunlight for vertical profile of atomic oxygen. Other five payloads carried Langmuir probes for measuring electron energy distribution. Data were obtained by photographing continuously motions of trails from five ground-based camera sites. Launches were conducted for GCA Corp. under gsfc contract. (WS Release 68—3; nasa Release 68—32; NASA Rpt srl)

February 23—24: Results of 13 experiments carried on board Biosatellite II (launched Sept. 7 and recovered Sept. 9, 1967) were discussed by scientists at nasa—nas symposium in Washington, D.C. Experimenters reported that radiation in weightless state caused greater damage to plant and animal organisms than radiation on earth. Affected most severely by weightlessness and radiation were young and actively growing cells and tissues and cells with high metabolic activity. Animal cells were least affected by weightlessness. Generally, plants had difficulty maintaining proper orientation; some plant structures, mechanisms, and biochemical activities were affected.	'
Analyses of effects of 45-hr flight on individual experiments, compared with control group on earth, revealed that pepper plant leaves twisted and curled downward and wheat seedling roots grew upward and sideways. Radiation experiments showed: wasp nurse cells and primitive egg cells slowed activities, allowing time for repair of radiation damage; two strains of bacteria grew substantially faster and tolerated radiation better, and viruses hosted by these bacteria appeared to be less effective in harming bacteria than on earth; twice as many flour beetle offspring died, and beetles suffered 50% more of characteristic wing defect; tradescantia plant had greater cell death and pollen abortion; and both adult and larval stages of vinegar gnats suffered greater chromosome damage, (nasa Release 68—35)

•	nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, oart, Charles W.
Harper, in statement before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, explained NASA’s increased emphasis on aeronautics. Air transportation “has grown to dominate the long range transportation systems” and “has created an industry of great importance to the economic strength of the nation,” showing $850 million in export value in first 10 mo of 1967, more than any other product, according to Dept, of Commerce. NASA planned to direct major effort at providing noise suppression, increasing aerodynamic and propulsion efficiency and advanced avionics, while avoiding “major new airport complexes” by increasing development efforts for v/stol aircraft.
Harper presented FY 1969 aircraft technology budget: $91.3 million for r&d, $20.6 million for “other NASA support applicable to aeronautics,” and $54.5 million for administrative operations (AO) (for both OART and non-OART). He said, “A large part of the most fundamental aeronautics research is carried out by nasa scientists using nasa facilities. . . . Without this continued support the foundation of the whole program is in jeopardy and the research supported by R&D funds is much less effective.” (Testimony)

Aircraft noise program would pursue efforts to suppress noise by acoustic treatment of engine nacelles (with results expected from McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Aircraft Co. investigations by October 1969 and January 1970), by engine redesign (with construction of engine components in Quiet Research Engine Program initiated in FY 1969), and by operational techniques. Major NASA program in flight dynamics and propulsion in support of sst program would be continued. Phase III of Hypersonic Research Engine (hre) program, test of hre on X—15 in flight as well as on ground, would not be conducted because of X—15 program termination. Major emphasis in general-aviation technology would be on flight safety, with flight tests of “typical twin-engine vehicle” at frc in FY 1969. (Testimony)

February 27: NASA Administrator James E. Webb began testimony on President’s authorization request for NASA’s FY 1969 budget before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. He outlined significant NASA achievements and said “remarkable series of successes shows how far we have come since the beginning of the Space Age ten years ago. . . . Today . . . success is treated almost routinely, no matter how difficult the task or how significant the achievement.”
Describing budget as “a compromise,” he said President “was forced, in spite of his conviction as to the importance of a larger effort in aeronautics and space, to accept reductions. . . . This means that for NASA 1968 and 1969 are . . . years in which we will be completing programs started in previous years and endeavoring to make limited further advances. Under these conditions we will devote a major effort to stabilizing our organization and the resource base we have built.” (Testimony)
•	NASA’s university program, operating at lower level because of reduced
funding, was also changing to meet changing requirements, NASA Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Harold B. Finger told Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Emphasis in predoctoral trainee grants had shifted from earlier need to replenish “national reservoir of engineers and scientists who had advanced training in space sciences” to “current and future needs . . . for engineers trained in design and development of complex engineering systems . . . and for	people	trained in
management ... of large-scale research and development programs.” Finger declared “importance of the university participation in the nation’s space program is equal to or possibly greater now than in the early 1960’s,” but cited decreases in predoctoral trainee grants to 75 in FY 1968 from about 800 in 1967 and over 1,300 in 1966. No new funding awards for new university facilities were anticipated for FY 1968 or FY 1969. Multidisciplinary research had been reduced to about one-half 1967 level.
In Technology Utilization program, Finger believed some of greatest benefits would come from “the storehouse of information that we are building that permits easy public access to the large masses of data and information” in many disciplines. (Testimony)

•	Press conference on preliminary scientific results from NASA’s Surveyor
VII, which landed on moon Jan. 9, revealed spacecraft could make safe landing in highland area with “major ejecta blanket” (rim of debris ejected from center of crater). Data indicated Tycho region of moon’s surface contained larger rocks, fewer craters, and thinner debris layer than did maria. Fine particles and rocks near Tycho crater had higher albedo, or lighter color. Iron content was lower, accounting for lower density. In Tycho region, where iron group of elements was less concentrated, reflection of light from moon’s surface was greater than from area where iron group elements existed in greater concentration. Low iron content was “probably strongest direct evidence” that moon had undergone chemical fractionation, suggesting it “has been hot, has been melted at least partially, and has been differentiated into different types of rock.” (Transcript; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 2/29/68, A8; W News, 3/21/68)
February 29: NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. John E. Naugle, described OSSA programs before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Three-year budget history of Space Applications program was one of very few in OSSA “showing a steady rise” and increase for FY 1969 was primarily due to increase in Earth Resources Survey Program.
“Together with user agencies—the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and Navy—we are studying the feasibility of applying space technology and techniques to such Earth resources disciplines as agriculture and forestry resources; hydrology and water resources; geography, cartography, and cultural resources; and oceanography and marine resources. Data are now being obtained by flying with electronic and electro-optical sensors over geographical areas ... to permit correlation of remote sensor data with actual conditions. ...

Teague (D-Tex.), Subcommittee Chairman: “. . . the general posture of the programs is good [but] the Apollo program, with its inherent complexity, has had and can be expected to have a variety of problems. Yet this study identifies the fact that confidence in the governmental-industrial team accomplishing this work is well placed.”
Report found “that the NASA industry team is continuing to effectively employ its resources in the solution of those problems which currently face the program. NASA has indicated that, given the stretchout in the Apollo program caused by the Apollo 204 accident, nasa is not constrained by total funding for the Apollo program during [FT] 1968. The continued reduction in total effort in the Apollo program as the program passed its peak effort in fiscal year 1967 is beginning to cause dislocation in the contractor and nasa center effort to the extent that personnel that will be needed during the flight portion of the program may not be available in the event a major flight problem occurs. Timely support for the Apollo Applications program and other post-Apollo effort could have a major effect on minimizing this problem.” (Text)

•	U.S.S.R. successfully launched Zond IV automatic research station, Tass
announced. Station was placed in planned flight from parking orbit of artificial satellite and was flying on trajectory close to calculated one to study “outlying regions of near-earth space.” Heinz Kaminski, Director of Institute for Satellite and Space Research at Bochum, West Germany, said mission “must be regarded as a preliminary phase for a planned flight to the moon.” Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, said he had “hunch” Zond IV was not intended to fly around moon. Apparently station made no attempt to orbit moon. One source said that after journey of about Sl/2 days, station reached “apogee . . . comparable to lunar altitude.”
Zond I, launched April 2, 1964, failed in attempt to reach Venus, and Zond II, launched Nov. 30, 1964, suffered communications failure on route to Mars. Zond III, launched July 18, 1965, obtained photos of far side of moon. (W Post, 3/3/68, A17; 3/4/68, A14; 3/8/68, A12; AP, W Star, 3/4/68, A3)

March 3—9: Radio signals which scientists speculated possibly could have been from extraterrestrial civilization had been received by Cornell Univ.’s antenna at Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory in Puerto Rico. U.K. astronomers during February had proposed such signals might originate with pulsating neutron stars. Arecibo’s Director, Dr. Frank D. Drake, would investigate all possibilities of natural origin. He believed four- to five-month study might determine whether signals came from planet in orbit around another star. Dr. Drake said Arecibo observations had confirmed all signal properties reported by U.K., including regularity and variable intensity of signals. (Sullivan, NYT, 3/10/68, 1)
March 4—16: NASA’s 1,347-lb Ogo V (ogo—e) Orbiting Geophysical Observatory, carrying 24 experiments in most comprehensive study of particle-wave processes in space during period of maximum solar activity, was successfully launched at 8:06 am est from etr by Atlas (SLV—3A)-Agena D booster, being used for first time. Spacecraft entered highly elliptical earth orbit with 92,078-mi (148,186-km) apogee, 168-mi (271-km) perigee, 63.3-hr period, and 31.3° inclination. Primary mission objective was to acquire correlative scientific data at high information rates in magnetic fields, energetic particles, and plasma disciplines through leading quadrant of magnetosphere into geomagnetic tail, both in interplanetary medium and within large sec-
tions of magnetosphere. Secondary objectives were to demonstrate technological capability of OGo’s three-axis stabilization system in highly eh liptical orbit for extended operations of 135 days or more and to conduct electric-field, gamma-ray, and radioastronomy observations.
On March 16, second of two 30-ft-long extendable antennas was deployed to complete post-launch checkout and NASA reported Ogo V was operating satisfactorily. All experiments except one, low-energy electrons and protons experiment, which had stopped operating March 11 when input power apparently failed, were acquiring data effectively. Data provided first observations of hydrogen cloud surrounding earth (geocorona), first detailed measurements of electric fields at shock and magnetospheric boundaries, and first spark chamber observations of gamma rays. .
Ogo V was fifth spacecraft in NASA’s six-mission OGO series, last OGO planned for highly eccentric orbit, last spacecraft to be launched by Agena launch vehicle, and last to be launched from Complex 13. Agena would be replaced by Atlas-Centaur, and Complex 13 would revert to usaf. Scientific instrumentation for Ogo V’s 24 experiments had been provided by six U.S. universities; four groups from U.K., France, and the Netherlands; four Government centers; and two private companies. Ogo V joined three other operational OGOs—Ogo / (launched Sept. 4, 1964), Ogo III (launched June 6, 1966), and Ogo IV (launched July 28, 1967)—in providing data for studies of earth’s environment and solar-terrestrial interactions during period of maximum solar activity. Ogo II, launched Oct. 14, 1965, had been turned off in November 1967. Of 85 experiments assigned to four missions still operating, 68 were still obtaining useful data, including 12 for which instrumentation was working after 42 mo in space.
OGO program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction. LeRC was responsible for Atlas-Agena launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations. (nasa Proj Off; nasa Releases 68—38, 68—53; LeRC Release 68-14; upi, M Her, 2/25/68; W Star, 2/27/68, A9; NYT, 3/5/68, 17; W Post, 3/6/68, A7)

It is planned to emphasize the space applications and the supporting research and technology programs.” He called for best in talent for achieving manned planetary flight “in the course of man’s exploration of space.” (Text; AP, NYT, 3/30/68, 31M)
• Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf, Ret.), former afsc Commander, delivered Dr. Robert H. Goddard Lecture to National Space Club in Washington, D.C. He warned the U.S.S.R. had moved forward steadily with new and more diversified strategic threat highlighted by development of orbital missile and sophisticated space systems. U.S. comparative missile strength, he noted, was declining steadily, with emphasis still on updating existing force. “What is missing so far in our military space program is the necessary high priority research and development aimed at protecting us in the high ground of space. In space, as elsewhere, the
Soviets say one thing—even sign agreements—but consistently do whatever is in their own self-interest. The orbital missile is merely the latest example of their policy. In light of their development of an orbital missile, it would be totally irresponsible ... to assume that we do not need to initiate any r&d to prepare us to meet a Soviet space threat.”
Attributing loss of endorsement of national space program to change in national value scale because of Vietnam and domestic problems, Gen. Schriever said: “The old criteria, national security and national prestige, are no longer the only justifications for our space efforts, important though they are.” If public understood “the practical, dollars and cents worth of the program to this country and to the world,” they would support it. U.S. was on verge of receiving annual return larger than its annual investment in space, and within one decade, “those returns should be several times our annual investment.” (Text; Aero Tech, 3/11/68, 16)	.

March 5: NASA launched 198-lb Explorer XXXVII (Solar Explorer B), second joint project of nrl and NASA to measure solar emissions, from NASA Wallops Station by four-stage Scout booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 545 mi (877 km) ; perigee, 324 mi (521 km); period, 98.8 min and inclination 59.4°. Primary nasa objective was to place satellite in planned orbit and provide tracking and telemetry support, nrl objectives were to continue and augment overall solar x-ray monitoring program into ascending portion of 11-yr solar cycle; perform temporal measurements of x-ray emission intensity and spectral quality of solar flare emission; correlate measurements with optical and radio ground-based observatories; and provide real-time solar monitoring information. International scientific community had been invited to acquire solar radiation data from satellite.
Although Explorer XXXVII did not enter planned circular orbit,
orbit achieved would satisfy scientific objectives. Expected lifetime was one year. First nrl—NASA solar monitoring project, Explorer XXX (iQSY Solar Explorer), had been launched Nov. 18, 1965, and had ceased operating Nov. 20, 1967. Explorer program was directed by OSSA.

•	NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology,
Dr. Mac C. Adams, told Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that House Committee on Science and Astronautics cut of $48.3 million from request for FY 1969 nerva program “would essentially wipe out the entire program. With the $11.7 million authorized by the House Committee [see March 1]—it is not clear that would even cover termination of the contracts. ... We would immediately have to start termination of not only the engine development, but also termination of the technology work. I feel that we would waste a very valuable investment.”
Dr. Adams described “substantial progress” in OART programs in 1967: initial acoustic absorber tests showed reduction in jet transport noise; parawing (steerable parachute) showed promise for spacecraft and precise military landings; static firing of 260-in-dia solid rocket motor had reached 5.9-million-lb thrust in 80-sec test; NERVA had been successfully tested at full power 60 min; all major components of SNAP—8 nuclear turbo-generator system had completed 1,800 hr of endurance tests, one exceeding 13,000 hr; and new Beta cloth for astronaut clothing had passed wear and flammability tests. In “beneficial crossflow between engineering and life sciences,” he named development of garment to give physicians three-dimensional data on heart activity, new blood velocity meter, and sensor to measure blood pressure in heart—small enough to be threaded through hypodermic needle and derived from instruments developed for small flight models for wind-tunnel tests.

rial Dinner in Washington, D.C. “The public’s knowledge and understanding of space exploration have been broadened by the remarkable achievements of the first decade of the space age, hut a great many people in the space program are deeply concerned about an apparent decline in popular support of space activities.” Space achievements had been well publicized but “the capability that made these feats possible, the underlying science and technology, the inherent value of delving deeper into the mysteries of the atmosphere and space, and the mechanism by which increased scientific knowledge enhances economic and social progress are apparently little understood or appreciated on a wide basis.
“Up to now we have had to devote our full energies to working on the means by which we reach into space. Now that the pipelines are filling with space hardware, more and more of our preoccupation is turning toward the question of what can be done to assure that the people who have supported our program . . , receive the full range of benefits which can be derived from space exploitation.” (Text; CRS 3/12/68, E1769)

sion Director, Will jam C. Schneider, described flight planning activities for Apollo missions up to landing on the moon. Apollo 6 mission, originally scheduled for launch March 21, would be postponed until April because of “erratic behavior” in service module’s helium check valves. Since Apollo 5 had been so successful, Apollo 6 objectives had been “downgraded to secondary” and primary objective would be to evaluate launch vehicle. New optimum injection method in which S—IVB would be launched toward moon would be used but rest of mission would be basically same as Apollo 5, he said. NASA would continue mission planning, “so that we have the option to select a lunar orbit mission if as a result of previous flights we felt it was technically the best thing to do.” (Transcript; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 3/16/68, 1)
•	Univ. of Illinois sociologist Alexander Vucinich in Science described
problem of relationship of science to morality which prompted leading Soviet scientists to search for broader cultural autonomy of science. “Moral law has become a by-product of science; science, in official Soviet ideology, is a structural component of Soviet society, while the moral code is only a superstructural derivation.” He traced growth of critical reassessment made by individual members of Soviet Academy of Sciences who looked to “the broader cultural effects of modern science and the ongoing technological revolution” under stimulation of considerable relaxation of political and ideological controls which resulted from Stalinist policies.

Our scientific knowledge of Mars and Venus . . . has been advanced tremendously by . . . unmanned, instrumented probes. . . . American astronauts, who have a total of almost 2,000 hours in space to their credit in the Mercury and Gemini Projects, will begin the third phase of manned space flight this year with the first manned launches in Project Apollo. These achievements in space, fruits of the advanced science and technology of our times, mark the first decade of the Space Age as one of the finest periods in American history. And they are forerunners of even greater discoveries and widespread applications to come during our second decade in space.”
Dr. von Braun credited nasa Administrator James Webb’s direction with adaptation of systems approach to space research without which “we would never be able to go to the moon.” Approach, Dr. von Braun believed, could also be tested on river pollution and satellite communications.

We are convinced that we can get what we need but we want to stop now to make certain that we do get it.”
Very reason for existence of sst program was belief “that this is next logical step in development of civil aeronautics.” Supersonic travel was first step toward hypersonic flight, he said. “Unless we take it now it’s going to be many years before civil aviation advances beyond subsonic flight—if ever.” Biggest problem facing sst program was sonic boom. “We have made all our program decisions ... on assumption that supersonic flights over land may not be permitted. We are reasonably certain ... we can operate over the oceans on an inter-continental basis,” and have sufficient market to assure profitable program.” (Text; Seattle Times, 3/21/68; Hudson, NYT, 3/21/68, 3/24/68, 23)

If conquest of space served no other purpose, it would provide “new mental and emotional horizons which our age needs more desperately than most people yet realize.” Yet there were signs U.S. space effort was “grinding to a halt, as its initial crisis-induced momentum is exhausted.” U.S. might well be “Sputniked” again in early 1970s.

During March: Special essa task force recommended environmental science and service agencies take early, joint steps toward national effort for development and use of earth-oriented space technology. In Man’s Geophysical Environment: Its Study from Space, task force predicted future space platforms would be able to acquire global geophysical data on unprecedented scale for environmental disciplines. It recommended combination of manned and unmanned space vehicles—rather than either alone—and warned that orbiting environmental observatories might provide data too rapidly for effective use unless data handling and display improvements were begun in immediate future. It rated highly spacecraft capability to service and repair manned spacecraft in orbit, to provide semiautomatic mode to operate manned spacecraft after flight crew left, and to launch subsatellites, special probes, and recoverable capsules from orbit.
Among proposals for missions were continuous monitoring of space disturbances to predict spaceflight hazards, global ionospheric mapping, global noise and interference survey, global measurements of absolute ground and sea surface temperatures and surface roughness, and surveys of snow areas, river and lake ice distribution, rain and river gauging, shoals, and sea states.

Employment at Mississippi Test Facility exceeded half of total employment in Hancock County in 1966, while space employment in Houston, Texas, was less than 2% of total employment. Space employment accounted for slightly more than 7% of total employment growth in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi since 1961.
Employment growth brought population growth, caused expansion of school facilities and faculties, raised per capita income, and increased retail sales. Beginning decline of employment in program in 1966 had moderated economic growth, and if funding continued to decline after 1968 communities would have to adjust to sharply contracting employment.

“These additional blows to a plane that still has great potential promise emphasize what most experts have been saying for seven years —the F— 111 has been built the wrong way from the beginning. It reflected former Secretary of Defense McNamara’s insistence, in the name of ‘commonality’ and savings, that the Navy and the Air Force buy one plane for two entirely different missions.
“But, though the Navy’s version may never—as Congress believes— meet the Navy’s needs, the Air Force model has great potential capabilities as a supersonic high- and low-level all-weather fighter-bomber . . . [and] must be developed, tested and utilized to its fullest capability.” (NYT, 4/1/68)

In the brief span of five years, satellite technology has grown dynamically. The possibilities envisioned in 1962 have been greatly exceeded.” Communications, he said, must provide “ ‘network for knowledge’ so that all peoples can share the scientific, educational, and cultural advances of this planet. . . .
“Failure to reach these goals can only contribute to apathy, ignorance, poverty and despair in a very large part of the world. Success in our telecommunications policies can be a critical link in our search for the understanding and tolerance from which peace springs.

April 4: NASA’s Apollo 6 (AS—502) was successfully launched from ksc Complex 39A at 7:00 am est on mission to qualify Saturn V launch vehicle for future manned space flights. Primary objectives were to demonstrate structural and thermal integrity and compatibility of launch vehicle and spacecraft; confirm launch loads and dynamic characteristics; demonstrate S—II/S—IC and S—IVB/S—II stage separations; verify operation of propulsion (including S—IVB restart), guidance and control (optimum injection), and electrical systems; evaluate performance of emergency detection system (eds) in closed-loop configuration; and demonstrate mission support facilities and operations required for launch, mission conduct, and command module (cm) recovery.
Launch Vehicle lst-stage performance was near nominal, but two of five 2nd-stage J2 engines shut down prematurely, causing remaining 2nd-stage engines and 3rd-stage engine to burn longer than planned. As result, spacecraft and 3rd stage entered elliptical parking orbit with 223.1-mi (395.1-km) apogee, 107-mi (172.1-km) perigee, and 89.8-min period instead of planned circular orbit of 115-mi (175-km) altitude. When 3rd stage failed to reignite on command after two orbits as planned, NASA switched to alternate mission, firing service propulsion system (sps) to place spacecraft into trajectory with 13,823-mi (22,225.4-km) apogee. Since insufficient propellant remained after extended burn, second sps bum was not attempted and cm reentered at 22,376 mph, just under planned 25,000-mph rate. Spacecraft splashed down 50 mi off target in Pacific 9 hr 50 min after launch and was recovered in good condition by U.S.S. Okinawa. Preliminary assessment indicated four of five primary objectives were attained, even though
launch vehicle performance and S—IVB restart and guidance control (optimum injection) were not fully successful [see April 11 and 24], Apollo 6 was second flight for Saturn V launch vehicle and boilerplate lunar module (lm) and fourth for operational Block I command/serv-ice module (csm). Spacecraft had been modified to include Block II heatshield and instrumentation for unmanned configuration, delete crew provisions, incorporate new unified quick-operating hatch and movie camera to record launch escape system (les) jettison and reentry conditions, and relocate sequence camera for earth landmark photography. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo program was directed by nasa Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, msfc for Saturn launch vehicle development, and ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by gsfc under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 68—54K; W Post, 4/5/68, A18; upi, W Star, 4/5/68, A3)

•	arc scientists Dr. William L. Quaide and Verne R. Oberbeck had developed
method of calculating lunar soil depths using measurements based on Lunar Orbiter photos and Surveyor photos and surface analyses, nasa announced. Studies indicated that many of moon’s smaller craters and much of soil and fragmental material on lunar surface were result of meteoroid impacts. By simulating impacts in laboratory and comparing results with photos of lunar craters scientists identified four crater types: (1) craters with up to 12-ft dia, round bottoms, and depths 25% of their diameter; (2) craters with 12- to 22-ft dia, flat bottoms, and central mound; (3) craters with 22- to 30-ft dia, flat bottoms, and no mound; and (4) craters with diameter greater than 30 ft with second crater gouged in flat bottom. Thick layer of fragmented material, calculated by new method to be up to 20 yd deep, coincided with densely cratered areas to support impact theory, (nasa Release 68—59; SBD, 4/5/68, 202)

•	msfc issued report on preliminary results of April 4 Apollo 6 flight. Al-
though “basic source of the difficulties” had not yet been determined, scientists and engineers speculated that wires carrying cutoff commands to the malfunctioning engines were interchanged. First stage had performed as planned and stage thrust was near predicted during first portion of flight. Second stage had performed satisfactorily through 1st-stage boost, 2nd-stage ignition, and early portion of 2nd-stage powered flight. First indications of anomaly were decreasing temperatures on main oxidizer valve and its control line on fifth engine and steady decrease in second engine’s yaw actuator pressure. Third stage performed satisfactorily through first bum and orbital coast. Although engine and stage prestart conditions appeared normal, engine received start signal, and valves opened properly, engine did not restart. Initial data suggested that leak in one of two propellant lines to engine’s augmented spark igniter might have caused insufficient or inadequately mixed propellant for proper start condition.

April 16: nasa Associate Administrator, Dr. Homer E. Newell, summarized Earth Resources Survey program at Fifth Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment at Univ. of Michigan’s Institute of Science and Technology in Ann Arbor. Prospects in field were promising. Greatest use of satellites for earth survey to date was for meteorological data, including global cloud-cover photos, cloud motion, and ocean temperatures, but U.S. still lacked “much of the data essential for worldwide long-range weather forecasting,” such as data on three-dimensional fields of density, wind velocity, temperature, and water vapor within the atmosphere.
Major contributions expected from research in other fields included: completion of geodetic programs which would permit determination of relative positions of any two points on earth with improved accuracy; monitoring of sea surface state, evaluation of marine biological resources, and surface observations of conditions of interest to oceanographers; and improved identification of spectral signature of various species for agriculture, forestry, and geology.

•	John N. Wilford described in New York Times front page article decline
in U.S. space expenditures since 1966: “Under pressure from the war in Vietnam, civilian space spending has dropped from $5.9-billion in the peak year of 1966 to $4.8-billion this year, and it is expected to drop much lower in the fiscal year starting in July. Employment in space work at private companies, universities and Government centers has declined from 420,000 in 1966 to fewer than 300,000 today, and it is still dropping at the rate of 4,000 a month.” Signs of decline were clearly visible, in “ghost towns” that were once test sites, and in removal of numerous projects from NASA’s post-Apollo plans. Fortunately, impact of cutback was softened because NASA had not replaced many personnel who ordinarily left agency each year and because personnel dismissed were absorbed by growing aircraft industry and expanding military space program. But there was a growing feeling “that once astronauts have landed on the moon, they will have no other place of significance to go for several years because of sharp budget cuts. These cuts have trimmed to the bone all preparations for future missions. It is as if the astronauts are heading for a dead-end on the moon.” (NYT, 4/16/68, 1)

in support of NASA FY 1969 budget from U.S. scientists. Dr. Harry H. Hess of Princeton Univ. presented statement for record by National Academy of Sciences President Dr. Frederick Seitz. Space program, Dr. Seitz said, was “the latest and one of the greatest human exploratory adventures in a long sequence that has enriched mankind. It offers us the promise of extending the range of our domain ... to the entire solar system. We can expect many benefits along the way, some of conceptual and some of direct material value . . . but those which will prove to be the most rewarding are probably, in the main, still hidden from us over the horizon.”
Dr. John A. Simpson of Enrico Fermi Institute and Univ. of Chicago noted: “Researches in space have made, through the bold programs which NASA established with universities in the early 1960s, major contributions to the critical problems of generating, developing and retaining first-class scientific manpower. . . . The great fear at present ... is that the momentum established will be dissipated by the preferentially deep budgetary cuts made by NASA in those areas which most affect the universities.” He stressed “deeply felt conviction”
that U.S. was “in danger of unwittingly destroying what we wish to save and need . . . pre-eminence in science and technology which is crucial for each major problem of the nation, from poverty to war.” Actions taken in Congress in 1968 might “largely determine whether the U.S. will retain its leadership in the space sciences.”
Dr. Simpson urged early start of Pioneer concept since it was “absolutely clear that discoveries important for the progress of science and technology may be made by . . . experiments and observations on spacecraft moving outward from the orbit of the Earth . . . the program is not a gamble and a hope, but an objective of high importance and certain to produce fruitful results.” (Testimony; NYT, 4/24/68, 24; W Star, 4/24/68, A21)

U.S.S.R. and Western Europe, Dr. Marvin L. Goldberger, professor of physics at Princeton Univ., said at 105th Annual Meeting of National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. Dr. Goldberger, chairman of symposium on current advances in high-energy physics, and other physicists attributed threatened loss of leadership to budget cutbacks and U.S. failure to develop apparatus for producing colliding beams of high-energy particles which would permit exploration of realms of physics inaccessible by other experiments. Plans for accelerators at Stanford Univ. and at Weston, 111., provided for storage rings for experiments, but there seemed to be no early prospect for their construction.

•	In statement to Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences,
Milton Klein, Manager of nasa—aec Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, summarized progress of nuclear rocket program. Major milestone has been achieved with “operation in late 1967 of a single reactor for 60 minutes at its design power of 1,100 megawatts, a duration capability adequate for most missions.” Technology phase of nerva program was nearing completion and next step was to develop engine to flight capability, funds for which were included in FY 1969 budget request, he said. No action deferring this step could be taken without losing a major portion of capability in this field. Nuclear rocket was “a focal point for pushing forward frontiers of technology . . . [and] only major advanced propulsion program in the Nation.”
High performance of nuclear rockets had been demonstrated in nine consecutive power reactor tests. Solid base of data and underrating had been built for development of flight-rated NERVA engine. “Development of the nerva engine at this time,” Klein stressed, “would capitalize on this investment and provide a major fundamental advance in propulsion capability. Its high specific impulse will provide a broad mission versatility for the high-payload, high-energy missions . . . inevitably included in a viable space program.” (Testimony)

•	Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of Marshall Space Flight Center, told
Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences he was greatly concerned about future of entire space program without propulsion capability of nuclear rocket program. Nuclear propulsion was “a must for our future space needs.” Failure to proceed into development phase would result in “losses of experienced personnel and cost-increase effects on the total program. ... A one-year delay in funding could result in as much as two years delay in having an operational nuclear engine.”
Nuclear vehicle as 3rd stage on Saturn V could significantly improve payload and mission versatility, and improved capability could be utilized “to improve mission effectiveness, to increase the mission and payload reliability, and to extend the spectrum of potential missions in the late 1970’s and the 1980’s. Equally important . . . for high energy missions requiring the launch of two or more Saturn V’s, with subsequent rendezvous in earth orbit, we will be able to reduce the number of Saturn V’s needed through the utilization of a nuclear vehicle,” at substantial cost savings.
In response to questions by Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.), Dr. von Braun said space program was “cutting edge of our technology advancements and of many advances in the applied sciences . . . [because] no other program . . . involves so many branches of technology and science.” Reduction in NASA’s S60-million NERVA request to $11 million recommended by House would be disastrous because to make manned space operations useful, “plenty of payload” was required.

Humphrey for greatest annual achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in U.S.
In ceremonies at Smithsonian Institution’s Air and Space Museum, Humphrey called U.S. space program “a splendid challenge and a noble mission . . . one whose practical benefits for today are exceeded only by its promise for tomorrow. “I urge every American to support the future development of our space program, and I . . . shall do so with pride and vigor.”
Humphrey said Nation had decided to commit resources “to venture in space for one primary reason: We believe that this mission to the far-out will produce many down-to-earth benefits for men. ... In fact . . . the nation that is first in science and technology has a chance to be the first to overcome some of the perplexing problems that have beset mankind since the beginning of civilization.” Space research “has vastly expanded our capabilities in navigation, communication and meteorology. It has given us new products and processes in such fields as agriculture, photography, metallurgy, and oceanography.” Techniques “that are going to put a man on the moon are . . . exactly the techniques that we are going to need to clean up our cities . . the systems analysis approach ... is the approach that the modern city of America is going to need if it’s going to become a livable social institution.

•	In last of three McKinsey Foundation lectures NASA Administrator
James E. Webb discussed “Executive Performance and Evaluation.” NASA program at peak level had employed more than 400,000 full-time workers and 20,000 contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers and drawn on more than 150 universities, in addition to 8,000 NASA-supported professors, scientists, and technicians. It had worked with urban communities on problems, reclaimed wasteland, constructed massive buildings, and developed new transportation means. NASA would not be viewed in history as unique but was likely “to prove a prototype.”
As Administrator, Webb said, his purpose was to work toward environment within which NASA could be as innovative in the management of all its activities as it was in its scientific and technical work. Large-scale endeavor required executives of unusual type and had to be designed to enable executives to perform in an unusual way. (Text)

•	NASA, NAS, and NRC would be “taking a long close look” at applied satel-
lites capable of producing concrete benefits to mankind, James J. Haggerty, Jr., wrote in Journal of the Armed Forces. Study, recommended in nas report released Feb. 8, would focus on economic aspects. Among new areas of application proposed were: forestry-agriculture satellite to survey and identify vegetation resources through standard and infrared photography; oceanographic satellite to predict fish locations, isolate plankton areas, and improve ship routing and weather detection through use of sensors; hydrological satellite to aid in management of water resources and to facilitate weather forecasting; and geological satellite to extend process of using airborne sensors to detect minerals, oil, and gas. Group also would study economic benefits of advances in existing applied spacecraft, such as “advanced weathersat” to interrogate high-altitude weather balloons and broadcast satellite to promote “extremely broad program of education and culture.”
NAS report had set dollar values on benefits: savings of $8 billion annually in agriculture and construction alone from two-week weather forecasting; $5 million in management of municipal water supplies; and “hundreds of millions” in potential saving to shipping, fishing, and coastal engineering industries, but satellites would have to be developed at “considerable investment.” (Haggerty, J/AF, 5/18/68, 9, 19)

•	“The seven fat years of the space effort are ended, and the seven lean
years have begun,” William Hines wrote in Washington Sunday Star. During FYs 1962—1968 Congress had granted nasa more than $30 billion. In FY 1969 agency would be limited to slightly under $4 billion. Transition from fat to lean was “completely understandable.” NASA had received favored treatment because it had high-priority goal, but with attainment now in sight, NASA was no longer in priority position. “Beginning of the end” came in FY 1967 when funding fell nearly $250 million from 1966 level. Budget for FY 1968 was down $400 million from FY 1967, and cut from FY 1968 to 1969 probably would be close to half billion dollars. With current inflation added, NASA “will be lucky to have $4 billion,” he said. Agency would be operating in 1969 “at an economic level lower than that of six years ago when the moon program—and the fat years—were just getting started.” (W Star, 6/9/68, E7)

June 17: Tests to evaluate propellant lines for J—2 engine had been successfully conducted in vacuum chamber at Arnold Engineering and Development Center, B. J. Richey reported in Huntsville Times. Engineers had discovered that frosting which enveloped lines and provided extra protection when engine was fired at ground temperatures failed to form in vacuum or simulated vacuum, so lines burned through. Lines leading to engine’s augmented spark indicator, believed to have caused engine shutdowns and restart failure during Apollo 6 flight April 4, had been redesigned and strengthened without affecting engine performance.

•	Washington Post editorial suggested House-approved bill H.R. 3400
granting faa authorization to control aircraft noise might cause conflict of interests by instructing FAA to consider safety, “technical practicability,” and “economic reasonableness” as well as noise. Many citizens would feel FAA already considered these criteria “too much.” Nor could it be ignored that faa also was charged with building U.S. SST potential “boom maker.” House bill merited Senate support, however, as a first step. Its significance was “that finally the demands of the public are being heard in Congress over the roar of aircraft, airline, airport, air-traveler and air-bureaucrat interests too little concerned with noise.” (W Post, 6/17/68, A18)

•	Apollo 7 spacecraft, which would carry three astronauts on 11-day
earth-orbital mission in late 1968, was undergoing combined systems tests at KSC. Unmanned and manned altitude runs would follow, before spacecraft would be sent to Cape Kennedy to be placed on Saturn IB launch vehicle. Saturn had undergone tests and checkout on Launch Complex 34 for several months.
NASA announced Apollo mission—which would demonstrate performance of spacecraft’s command module (cm), service module (sm), crew, and support facilities—would begin with mid-morning launch, carrying commander Walter M. Schirra, Jr., CM pilot Donn F. Eisele, and lm pilot Walter Cunningham into earth orbit. During second revolution, crew would separate Apollo from rocket’s upper stage and perform transposition and simulated docking maneuver similar to one to be performed on lunar mission. Reentry under manual control of crew would culminate in splashdown in Atlantic at approximately 7 am EDT on 11th day. (nasa Release 68—108; ksc Release 285-68)
•	ARC reported that 90 U.S. scientists at ARC working group sessions had
agreed electromagnetic systems would provide best data on moon’s interior and recommended three techniques, magnetometer systems, radio-frequency systems, and radar. Magnetometer systems could measure blocking of fluctuating solar magnetic field borne by solar wind by using network of emplacements on moon’s surface. Highly conductive hot lunar core would cut off field completely, while cold core would let most of field pass through. Magnetometer on lunar crawler could make similar measurements to find highly conductive masses of water, lava, or ore. Radio-frequency probes could make inexpensive subsurface surveys through spacecraft radio signals which would penetrate moon’s surface and bounce back to be measured as to wave characteristics. Wave-change data could help define ore, ice deposits, or permafrost. High-frequency radar systems could study lunar surface through radar bounced off moon from earth with return signal received by earth antennas, or beamed from spacecraft in lunar orbit or from lunar crawler at lunar surface, with return signals received by spacecraft or crawler, (arc Release 68—9)
•	Opening session of 3rd Eurospace U.S.-European Conference at Munich
discussed disparity between U.S. and European space funding. Total spent on Western European space research in 1967 was $300 million, 0.005% of gross national product of cooperating countries; NASA budget was 14 times that amount. West German Minister for Scientific Research, Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg, proposed merger of ELDO and ESRO, 10% increase in total funding, and possible cooperation with U.S. in
developing launch vehicle lor use after 1975. International Space Research Committee Vice President Richard W. Porter urged increased cooperation with NASA, which already had concluded bilateral agreements with several countries for scientific satellite launchings, eight of which had proved successful thus far. Some 42 countries were working with U.S. on meteorological satellite programs; 11 were cooperating oil communications projects. There were 20 tracking stations in 11 countries cooperating in U.S. launching projects and 395 foreign technicians, engineers, and scientists had worked in U.S. space centers. European industrial sources expressed hope system could be evolved for joint U.S.-European work on projects. (InteraviaAirLetter, 6/19/68, 1)
•	Dr. Gardiner L. Tucker, Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engi-
neering (Electronics & Information Systems), told Military Operations Subcommittee of House Committee on Government Operations dod would proceed with new phase of Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs), procuring more than three advanced synchronous satellites and developing over six new ground terminals. Funding of satellites, which would use very narrow-beam steerable antennas illuminating 1,000- to 2,000-mi-dia area of earth, would start in FY 1969. dscs satellites would be comparable to Intelsat IV series under consideration for commercial service.
New dod phase represented technological advance over advanced dscs considered in 1967 but was less ambitious in cost and size, with cost range of $100—200 million, contrasted with earlier $500 million. Current system had 25 satellites in orbit and operational, each equipped with switch to turn it off after six years in orbit. Number of terminals had grown from original two in field and seven transportable to worldwide operational system with terminals near Washington, D.C., and in New Jersey, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Guam, Australia, Korea, Okinawa, Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, Ethiopia, and Western Germany, plus six shipboard terminals.
Cooperative programs with Allies in satellite communications included procurement of two synchronous Skynet satellites for U.K. as part of Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (idcsp) with first launch scheduled for mid-1969. Joint efforts were under way to ensure operability of U.S. and U.K. satellites and terminals, and work was under way to procure two Skynet satellites for NATO under program similar to that of U.K. First launch was planned for late 1969, with U.S. controlling satellite. U.S. had signed Memorandum of Understanding with six NATO countries establishing joint testing program utilizing Les V experimental satellite, launched July 1, 1967.

•	Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd testified before Senate Com-
merce Committee’s Aviation Subcommittee in support of S. 3645, proposing airport development and airways systems improvement. By 1974, revenue passenger-miles flown by U.S. airlines were expected to rise to 200 billion, more than double 1967 level; hours flown by carriers, from 5.2 million in 1967 to 8.6 million, increasing 65%; and general aviation hours flown, 50%, from 21.9 million to 31.8 million. Air carrier fleet would increase from 2,272 aircraft to 3,320 and general aviation fleet would increase from 104,706 to 160,000. Aircraft handled by faa towers would more than double, as would those han-
died by FAA route control centers. Increase in speed and quality of aircraft also would increase demand for use of FAA facilities.
S.3645 would authorize direct loans for potentially viable airports when reasonable private financing was unobtainable and grant up to 50% of cost for projects attributable to service by subsidized carriers. Federal assistance would be available only for development projects related to landing areas and safety facilities. DOT would be required to submit National Airport System Plan within two years.

•	In letter to Sen. Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.), Chairman of Senate Armed
Services Committee, Secretary of Defense Clark M. Clifford said that “it would be a serious mistake to eliminate construction and procurement funds in fiscal year 1969 for the deployment of the Sentinel System.” Program represented 12 yr of R&D at cost of $3 billion, he said, and time had come “when we can no longer rely merely on continued research and development but should proceed with actual deployment of an operating system.” Congressional decision to eliminate deployment funds would disrupt work under way and lose two years in availability of operating system which was important to U.S. security.
Senate coalition responded with letter from Assistant Defense Secretary Paul C. Warnke acknowledging one-year delay in Chinese ICBM program and that Sentinel ballistic missile defense system had “also slipped a little.” (Text; Finney, NYT, 6/20/68, 24; Corddry, B Sun, 6/20/68, AS)

•	Analysis of data returned by Pioneer VIII had led arc scientists to spec-
ulate that earth’s magnetic tail, extension of its magnetic envelope (magnetosphere) blown out by solar wind to resemble comet’s tail, might be shorter than the 200 million mi suggested by certain theoretical calculations. When Pioneer VII flew through tail region at 3.5-million-mi distance from earth after Aug. 17, 1966, launch, it found long period when solar wind was completely or partially blocked out, suggesting spacecraft had observed end of organized tail region. Conditions encountered in tail area by Pioneer VIII at 1.75 million mi from
earth after Dec. 13, 1967, launch, were similar. However, instead of smooth cylindrical structure expected at smaller distance, Pioneer VIII found conditions resembling turbulent wake, leading some scientists to conclude tail was shorter. Others, including Pioneer Project Scientist, Dr. John Wolfe, believed tail might include successively turbulent and smooth areas, (arc Astrogram, 6/20/68; AP, NYT, 6/22/68, 53)

“We recognize, nonetheless, that it is but one of many costly and sometimes competing activities.

•	Nearly 1,000 scientists and educators attended “crisis” meeting called by
New York Academy of Sciences to demand science be declared “disaster area” because of threatened $6-billion Federal budget cut. Federal R&D funding, after decade of average 22% annual expansion, had risen only 2.5% annually since 1964, while number of scientists had risen 20%. It was feared resulting crush would damage U.S. leadership in sci-
ence and technology. MIT Provost Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner said, “If the Congress continues to do what it is now doing we’ll wake up with another sputnik in a decade.” Federal R&D funding had risen from $74 million in 1940 to $16.9 billion in 1968 with October 1957 “shock of Sputnik” giving greatest impetus. Cut of $6 billion would mean “we’re going to cut not only into the fat, but into the flesh of lots of areas,” Dr. Donald F. Hornig, President’s Science Adviser, said. NASA’s sustaining university program had been one of chief casualties of recent cutbacks with budget slashed from $45 to $10 million yearly, forcing drop from 1,300 to 50 training grants which had produced more than 1,000 Ph.D.s since 1961. Government officials had chided scientists for being ill-prepared for leveling of Federal support and for alleged detachment from political realities. (Reinhold, NYT, 6/21/68, 1)

June 24: nasa Administrator James E. Webb testified before Senate Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Independent Offices that NASA was still uncertain as to exact levels at which a number of projects could be included in FY 1969 operating plan and that at House-passed $4.008-billion appropriations level NASA’s aeronautical and space activities would have to be sharply curtailed. “We will have to reduce and stretch out ongoing programs and eliminate or defer the work that would have enabled us to continue the research and development . . . looking toward a future resumption of tests and missions which will soon grind to a halt.” Because of reduced budget, Webb said, nasa would have to accept one-year gap in Saturn V production, discontinue production of Saturn IBs, delay initiation of nerva development, either severely limit all proposed planetary orbiter missions or eliminate 1971 or 1973 missions, and curtail work toward using space systems for direct economic benefits.
If NASA budget were further reduced under Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, requiring $6-billion reduction in Federal expenditures in FY 1969, result could be disastrous to goals of national space program. Although NASA would do everything possible to fulfill commitment to Apollo program and would continue on smaller scale programs of greatest and most immediate national importance, further budget cuts would require complete termination of Saturn production and cancellation of production of associated manned spacecraft; elimination of Titan-Mars 1973 missions and possible elimination of Mariner-Mars 1971 missions; and further delays, curtailments, and cancellations which might require more harsh steps such as canceling orders for hardware already under contract and mothballing entire installations.

June 24—27: Fourth International Symposium on Bioastronautics and the Exploration of Space was held in San Antonio, Tex., under sponsorship of afsc’s Aerospace Medical Div.
In keynote address Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of nasc, noted no other program had given such impetus to technological and economic growth as national space program. “Those who oppose adequate spending on space technology are deliberately or inadvertently campaigning for a lower standard of living for our people, a declining Gross National Product for our Nation, and a secondary position in strength to that of the Soviet Union.” U.S. investment in space to date, he said, “has mostly been an investment in the future, the returns of which can be lost in large measure if we lack the vision and the vigor and the desire to keep this country great by maintaining a vigorous space effort.
“Every major power and every nation eager to raise its standard of living and world influence strives to participate in space technology and space exploration. It certainly would be ironic if the United States, as the world’s leader in international cooperation and the world’s leader in standard of living, were to abandon or even neglect the source of such strength. I believe it might be labeled the worst mistake in history.” (Text; CR, 6/24/68, E5775—6; SBD, 6/25/68, 267; Aero Daily, 6/25/68)
Gen. James Ferguson, AFSC Commander, said bioastronautics problems and provisions could have serious impact on mission performance, space station design, cost, and operations. Principal problems included those of crew rotation, crew size, compartment volume per crew member, radiation exposure, versatility of astronauts, station atmosphere, and prolonged weightlessness. In one study, savings from doubling crew rotation intervals from 30 to 60 days ranged from $220 million to $470 million per year, depending on altitude. Savings from increasing
from 60 to 90 days were another $100 million a year. For same cost, slightly longer interval could support two more astronauts. Crew rotation intervals of two or more months should he goal. “If a future station can be expected to be useful over a period of many years and its cost can be amortized accordingly . . . efforts to achieve long crew rotation intervals have a very large potential payoff.” (Text; Aero Daily, 6/28/68)
Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, MSC Director, described 100-man orbital workshop that could be operational by late 1970s.

Baton-shaped station would revolve around hub in center which would serve as spaceport and zero-gravity laboratory. Crew would live and perform some work in 240-ft arm on one side of hub. On other side, 375-ft arm would house engine which would spin entire station at 3.5 rpm, creating centrifugal force to serve as artificial gravity.

Arthur C. Clark, co-author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, suggested that most earth inhabitants could not be very objective about possibility of extraterrestrial life because they were too “geocentrically minded,” still considering earth the center of the universe. “The whole history of astronomy teaches us to be cautious of any theory purporting to show that there is something special about the earth. In their various ways, the other planets may have orders of complexity as great as ours. Even the moon—which looked a promising candidate for geophysical simplicity less than a decade ago—has already begun to unleash an avalanche of surprises.
“The discovery that Jupiter is quite warm and has precisely the type of atmosphere in which life is believed to have arisen on earth may be the prelude to the most significant biological findings of this century.” If we discover no trace of extraterrestrial life, he said, “even such a negative finding would give us much sounder understanding of the conditions in which living creatures are likely to evolve—and this in turn would clarify our views on the distribution of life in the universe as a whole.” (Leavitt, AF/SD, 8/68, 59-62)

Clarke’s The Promise of Space. Clarke had described chronology of Apollo decision as “politics and astronautics combined” and had written: “The verdict of history may well be that the United States made the correct decision even if from dubious motives.” Dr. Jastrow said Clarke “seems to betray a point of view that the primary purpose of the space program is, or should be, the exploitation of its scientific potential and the search for knowledge in the space around the earth and on the other bodies of the solar system.
“My own view is that he is mistaken. Spacecraft have yielded important scientific discoveries , , . but it seems clear to me that preservation of national security, and not scientific research per se, was the motivation for the Kennedy proposal. Kennedy acted out of a deep gut instinct, shared by the Congress and the American people, that the United States had been presented with a major challenge to which it must respond effectively or pay a heavy penalty. The decision on the
expanded space program may have been accelerated by the events of the spring of 1961, but the Soviet challenge . . . was permanent.”
Dr. Jastrow saw promise of space as “dollars-and-cents return in increased productivity in the U.S.” To Clarke it was “the universe—or nothing.” (W Post, Book World, 6/30/68, 1; CR, 7/9/68, E6290)

•	Scientists were pressing NASA to prepare “Grand Tour” mission of succes-
sive unpowered flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune to take advantage of configuration which occurred once in 179 yr. Alignment of planets would permit trip time as low as 8 yr rather than 30. Next opportunity would occur during 1975—1981 period, with 1978 and 1979 regarded as best launch years. Tour was described by Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. engineer Brent W. Silver in Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets as “feasible and worthwhile.” It would be “waste of natural resources to pass up this opportunity,” he said. Studies indicated mission could be mounted with existing technology, but NASA, because of budgetary cuts, had yet to authorize it. JPL study had postulated nine-year tour including use of electric propulsion for sustained power between planets. MIT- project, beginning with exploratory Jupiter probes in 1972, would cost $80 million annually over 17 yr and would use 1,000-lb spacecraft launched by Titan III—C with Centaur upper stage.

posit 5,000 or 10,000 passengers on the ground almost simultaneously. . . . Now is none too soon to begin planning for handling such masses of people. . . . The vast size of the giant new planes ahead is dwarfed only by the enormity of the unprecedented problems they pose.” (NYT, 7/1/68, 30)

Apogee motor was fired July 7, placing Explorer XXXVIII into planned near-circular orbit with 3,654.3-mi (5,881-km) apogee, 3,641.2-mi (5,860-km) perigee, 224.4min period, and 59.2° inclination. On July 8, yo-yo despin mechanism reduced spin rate from 93 rpm to 2.8 rpm. As primary objective, spacecraft would measure intensity and direction of radio signals from cosmic sources in 0.5- to 10-mhz range, not normally observable from earth. Secondary objectives were to place spacecraft into circular orbit of about 3,728-mi (6,000-km) altitude and to obtain useful data during first 30 days in orbit, for detailed study of dynamic spectra and decay rates of sporadic radio bursts. Spacecraft was expected to provide first low-frequency radio map of Milky Way and additional data on low-frequency signals from Jupiter and sun.
Explorer XXXVIII was equipped with unique antenna system consisting of two antennas made of four i/j-in-dia booms which could be deployed up to 750 ft each, to form X-shaped array.

•	NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E.
Mueller, addressed joint meeting of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (aiaa) and Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute (casi) in Montreal: Systems engineering concept applied to management “was pioneered and developed in aerospace programs and is being increasingly applied as a powerful tool in the management of other major enterprises.” In NASA most extensive application was in Apollo program. Factors unique to manned space flight had contributed to management approach, including “sheer size of Apollo program, larger in . . . lead time, money, organization and technological development than any previous program.” Special feature was high reliability and safety required. And space program had been executed under scrutiny of press, public, Congress, and scientific community.
Weight and volume budgeting were critical. High cost of flight-testing space vehicles made maximum ground testing necessary, as well as all-up (concurrent rather than sequential) flight testing. Vehicle was as complete as practicable for each flight, to obtain maximum information from minimum number of flights and provide earliest possible system readiness. Open-ended mission concept was used to accomplish as many flight objectives per vehicle as consistent with safety and mission success. Review of status throughout mission determined length of mission. Redundant, or alternate, means of operation reduced ability of single failure to endanger crew or mission. Prime design consideration in all manned space flights was safety. (Text; UPl, H Chron, 7/10/68)

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, discussing implications of FY 1969
budget reductions at AAS Symposium in Denver, Colo., said he did not find public support for space program declining. Rather, “many people who in the years following 1961 ascribed to the space program a separate, special, top priority status are now realizing, as the national leadership in the space program has understood all along, that the space program must be regarded as only one of a number of essential activities of high priority to which the country must devote substantial resources. . . . The investments made in NASA may well add greatly to the value of investments we will have to make in these other fields.”
NASA was “very much in business, and it will stay in business. We are accepting the challenge of the time and will continue a hard-hitting, technically sound program aimed at the most important objectives of the future.” But he described cutbacks as well as elements of strength. “We are doing all we can to avoid terminating completely such important activities as the unmanned planetary exploratory program, but it is not likely that we will be able to proceed with the Titan/Mars 1973 missions.” Saturn I Workshop would be delayed and, “for a number of years to come, missions to use the manned space flight capabilities developed in the Apollo program will be very limited.” Reductions to a budget already “sharply reduced will have many very serious effects on the U.S. position in aeronautics and space. They are only the most recent in a series of cutbacks and, in effect, constitute something like final ratification of a decision . . . that the United States will not, at this time, take the steps necessary to continue the advances of the recent years.”
Outlining NASA’s program, Webb said two flyby missions to Mars in 1969 were largely paid for. “Even at our reduced levels, I believe we can follow the 1969 missions with two orbiter missions in 1971, but will probably have to postpone for another year the start of work on the two Titan-launched orbiter and lander missions which we had hoped to fly in 1973.” The 1969 missions “were initiated three or more years ago. We are approaching the end of our approved flight programs. The number of new projects started each year has sharply dwindled since 1966 and we will soon see years go by when we will have very few flights. We may see a gap of 2 years in our manned flight program after the landing on the moon, and a second gap, equally long, after the Saturn I Workshop.
“Perhaps the most fundamental decisions ahead lie in the field of large launch vehicles. Can we gap the production of Saturn V or will we have to terminate it?” Question required reexamination of uses of Titan III and of possible development of new, less costly launch vehicles.
“Especially important” in this period was continuation of broad program of advanced research for future national needs, including broad university program. (Text)
Sen. Gordon Allott (R-Colo.) told aas Symposium: “. . . in the thirty minutes I spend talking about the space program this morning four Tiros satellites . . . will have monitored 10 cloud covers above 40 million square miles of the earth’s surface. . . . During this same period, the Goddard Space Flight Center . . . will have received 340 minutes of data from 37 active satellites; and the NASA communications network around the globe will have sent and received over 750 messages dealing with information obtained from these satellites. . . .
“Already the beneficial changes wrought by man’s incredible inventive genius have made their mark. When NASA launched Early Bird for Comsat three years ago, for example, it boosted the capacity of the transatlantic telephone system by 50%. The AIAA has already estimated that this new industry will be grossing $200 million by 1975. . . .
“Obviously, this is not all. Too often, it seems, those interested in giving an accounting of the $30 billion invested in the space program stop once they have demonstrated technological spin-off or . . . unmanned
communication and weather satellites. The crowning achievement of the space program has really been what man himself, in space, has accomplished during this past decade. For man has ventured into the hostile, mysterious world of space.” (CR, 7/18/68, S8901—3)

•	James C. Elms, Director of ERC, discussed “the NASA Biomedical Pro-
gram in Perspective” before Third Annual Meeting of Assn, for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation in Houston. “Despite the rapid advance of biomedical techniques since World War II, the main thrust of the activities was directed toward studying sick individuals in a normal environment. The manned space program has provided the opportunity for intensive controlled study of a select group of normal and healthy individuals in an abnormal and stressful environment. By so doing, we have achieved a better definition of the range of normality of the healthy organism which, in turn, is useful in the study and understanding of disease.”
Interaction of space and medicine had led to many medical applications of aerospace hardware. Application of electron probe microanalyzer—used for chemical analyses of microelectronic circuits—to study of red blood cells had led to unexpected clues in study of blood cancer. System to monitor heart rate, respiration, and galvanic skin response was being considered for use in measuring efficiency of dental anesthetics on children and in training teachers for retarded children. Accomplishments of bioelectronics research in interdisciplinary electronics environment included remote measuring technique for eyepointing direction, meaningful measurement of aerosol concentration and size distribution, and automatic tracking system to identify thresholds of mental alertness.

Their observations indicated that proposal that polarimetric, spectrometric, color, and albedo measurements of light and dark areas on Mars proved limonite was major soil constituent was irreconcilable with proposal that variations in size of particle could be responsible for albedo difference between light and dark areas. They showed relative albedo was reversed from blue to red for limonite samples with different-sized particles. Observations of Mars revealed no blue-red albedo reversal between areas. Although evidence was insufficient for choice between hypotheses, they believed Mars soil was most likely, for geological reasons, to be composed of silicates stained or coated with ferric oxides.

During July: Ralph Kinney Bennett in Data scored U.S. complacency in year which might “see some of the greatest Soviet space spectaculars of the decade.” In U.S., he said, early glamour of space race had faded and NASA projects were neither as ambitious nor as well-funded as they once were. In contrast, he noted, U.S.S.R. showed signs of “a new spurt of activity, new technical accomplishments above our planet, an accelerated assault on the moon and dark rumblings of advanced military uses of the threshold of space. The time for a Soviet resurgence could hardly be better.
“. . . Soviets are badly in need of a great techno-propaganda feat to reassert their influence on world public opinion. . . .” Soviet hold on
European satellite nations had shown evidence of advanced erosion. “Their position in relation to the rest of the communist world is no longer clearly defined.” U.S.S.R. was spending estimated $9 billion a year on space and half that sum went toward military applications of space technology. “There is an American attitude ... of waiting until you get burnt before you shed complacency. When Sputnik I burnt us, we came back with a vengeance. Now complacency has set in again. Perhaps we will feel the fire from the Soviets in space before this year is out and react accordingly. But in space technology . . . it’s a tough way to play the ball game.” (Data, 7/68)
• Paul G. Thomas discussed “Earth-Resource Survey from Space,” in Space/ Aeronautics. Program called for: first mapping of earth to ultimate scale level of 1:25,000; first mapping of global sea state and surface temperature to help shipping, fishing, and weather forecasters; monitoring hydrological cycle to assist watershed planning and prediction of botanical responses; measuring plant vigor and impact on supply and price of earth’s food; measuring geographical surface phenomena to permit geologists to home in on mineral deposits and further arguments in morphology of planet earth. Signatures and their rapid analysis were major stumbling blocks in program. “Although there are about 50 geological signatures on record and about 100 for agriculture and forestry, each represents a one-of-a-kind situation . . . and, oddly enough, there is often more variance within a species than there is between species.”
As remote sensing concepts emerged, it was “apparent that successful earth-resource surveillance will not be simply a matter of lashing together existing technology into pseudo-systems and hoping for benefits. The human effort and development funding needed to fully implement a system for earth observation from space will make the lunar landings look like a walk to the corner candy store. Thus the shift in emphasis to cost/benefit studies, new to the space age, is certainly not without foundation. If, on the other hand, an optimized system cannot—or should not—be realized, we should be willing to stumble a bit to find out.” (S/A, 7/68,46-54)

August 5: U.S.S.R. was expected to make more successful launches than U.S. during 1968 for first time since 1957, with both nations emphasizing military goals, Howard Benedict of Associated Press wrote. In
1957,	U.S.S.R. had launched two Sputniks, U.S. had launched none. In
1958,	U.S. had launched five to U.S.S.R.’s one; thereafter, U.S. had maintained substantial edge, building to 73-46 margin in 1966. In 1967, U.S. had led by only one launch, 67—66. Through 1967, U.S. had had 400 successful launches, with 532 payloads orbited. U.S.S.R. had had 240 launches with 289 payloads. In 1968 to date, U.S.S.R. had successfully launched 40 rockets with 40 payloads; U.S. had launched 22 rockets with 31 payloads, 23 fewer than in 1967, while U.S.S.R. launches had increased by five.
Reasons for decline in U.S. launch rate were NASA budget cuts and improved instrumentation and data recovery in military launches (60% of U.S. firings). U.S. military payloads in 1968 numbered 22 to U.S.S.R.’s 24 out of total 40. Tracking experts had reported 16 of 1968 U.S.S.R. satellites on reconnaissance assignments, with 13 reentering after 8-day orbit, two after 12 days and one still aloft. Sole U.S.S.R. Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (fobs) test, Cosmos CCXVIII, had been launched and returned to earth in less than one orbit April 25. Drop from nine fobs tests in 1967 indicated U.S.S.R. might have perfected at least first stage in FOBS development.
Neither U.S. nor U.S.S.R. had launched men into space in 1968 but experts listed Cosmos CCXII and CCXIII launchings April 15 as forerunners of manned lunar mission. In 1968, U.S.S.R. had launched nine scientific satellites, three for navigation, and two each for communications, weather, and deep space probes. U.S. had made two unmanned Apollo rocket and spacecraft tests, five scientific payloads, and one moon shot. (Huntsville Times, 8/5/68)

•	Naval Research Laboratory scientists Dror Sadeh, Stephen Knowles, and
Benjamin Au reported in Science observations made in two experiments in which an apparent decrease in frequency of radio or light waves was detected when optical path was in vicinity of a mass. Radio waves skirting earth and sun appeared to increase in wavelength, leading scientists to reason that all lights crossing portions of universe would be similarly affected by mass of objects along the way. Effect could account for part of “red shift” (shift in spectra of distant galaxies as they receded from earth), chief tool for measuring expansion rate of universe which, in turn, was used to measure age of universe. Thus, if observations by nrl scientists were confirmed, they could necessitate revision of long-standing estimates of age and expansion rate of universe. Experimenters, however, indicated their findings appeared inconsistent with results from “round-trip” experiments, such as those obtained during past year when radar impulses were bounced off Venus and Mercury.

August 10: NASA’s 860-lb Ats IV (ats—d) (Applications Technology Satellite) was launched from etr by Atlas-Centaur booster on mission to evaluate gravity-gradient system for spacecraft stabilization in synchronous orbit and to obtain data on experiments during first 30 days in orbit.
Centaur ignited, successfully injecting spacecraft into elliptical parking orbit with 475.8-mi (765.7-km) apogee, 115.4-mi (175.7-km) perigee, and 29.1° inclination. Centaur engines, which were to have reignited to inject spacecraft into 22,300-mi-altitude synchronous equatorial orbit west of South America, failed to ignite. Since programmer did not receive accelerometer burn indication, it did not issue command to separate and spacecraft and Centaur stage remained joined, tumbling uncontrollably, in parking orbit. Three attempts to fire apo-
gee kick motor were unsuccessful because firing was inhibited by separation switches. Efforts would be made to operate all experiments possible, but information beyond proof of operation was not expected. Although exact rate and direction of tumble had not been determined, preliminary assessment indicated rate was too high for successful boom deployment.
Ats IV was fourth in series of seven satellites designed to improve spacecraft technology, develop long-life control systems, advance spacecraft communications, and improve long-range weather predictions. First spacecraft to be placed in earth orbit by Centaur booster, Ats IV was 56 in in dia, 72 in long, and would have been 251 ft across with gravity-gradient rods fully deployed. Spacecraft carried four applications technology experiments—gravity-gradient stabilization system, day-night Image Orthicon Camera (ioc), microwave communications experiment, and ion engine—and no science experiments. Ats I (launched Dec. 6, 1966) had exceeded its test objectives and was still operating satisfactorily. Ats II (launched April 5, 1967), though judged a failure because of eccentric orbit, had transmitted some useful data. Ats III (launched Nov. 5, 1967), last ats spacecraft scheduled to be launched by Atlas-Agena D booster, had operated successfully and transmitted color photos of earth. ATS program was managed by GSFC under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 68—127; upi, NYT, 8/12/68, 34; AP, P Inq, 8/12/68; Lewis News, 8/16/68,1)
•	Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
Flight, told British Interplanetary Society in London: “I believe that the exploitation of space is limited in concept and extent by the very high cost of putting payload into orbit, and the inaccessibility of objects after they have been launched. Therefore I would forecast that the next major thrust in space will be the development of an economical launch vehicle for shuttling between earth and the installations, such as the orbiting space stations which will be operating in space.” Dr. Mueller said efficient earth-to-orbit transportation system would be needed to shuttle thousands of tons of material in and out of space, operating in mode similar to that of large commercial air transports and compatible with airports. Same technology could be applied to terrestrial point-to-point transport. (Text)

neers described arms (Application of Remote Manipulators in Space), concept being pursued under $68,000 NASA contract to study feasibility of orbiting robots to refuel, resupply, and repair crippled spacecraft on signals from earth. They could be in operation by mid-1970s and, if successful, could extend useful lifetimes of communications and weather satellites and, possibly, could inspect or disable hostile spacecraft. One plan was to launch 600-lb robot attached to 1,000-lb tender or “home base” satellite. With repair kit orbited on distress signal from regular satellite, robot would rendezvous and repair disabled satellite directed by a ground controller by radio signals transmitted via the tender. After each repair robot would return to tender. Engineers estimated robot could remain in orbit four to five years and would have paid for itself after 12 repairs. (Wilford, NYT, 8/13/68, 4)

August 14: nas—nrc Space Science Board urged NASA to use developing technology of fully automated systems in planetary exploration rather than manned flights, which it felt were not “essential for scientific planetary investigation at this stage.” Recommendations on priorities were made in Planetary Exploration, 1968—1975, prepared by panel of 23 scientists who met during week of June 9 to reappraise 1965 study in light of rapid development in science and severe cuts in NASA budget.
Report called 2% for planetary exploration out of NASA FY 1969 budget “totally inadequate.” It recommended diversion of funds from manned missions to instrument exploration, including biennial flights to orbit Venus and Mars until 1975; dropping capsule on Mars in 1973
to detect life signs and a major lander later, perhaps in 1975; multiple-drop probe of Venus’ surface in 1975; Mercury flight in 1973; and priority Jupiter flybys in 1972 and 1973. Panel advocated pursuit of planets in economical way: use of existing Pioneer spacecraft in Venus and Jupiter missions, elimination of second spacecraft in all missions unless “clear gain . . . will result from such double launches,” and use of single launch for both Venus and Mercury missions by scheduling them when planets were in alignment (same technique could be used for “Grand Tour” of major planets in 1977, when they would be aligned in space). Referring to U.S.S.R. exploration, report said, “We certainly believe we cannot abandon this broad area of space activities to our competitors.”
Report also recommended strong support for radioastronomy, including development of major new observatory primarily for planetary study, and continued support of ground-based optical planetary astronomy. It proposed coordinated, informal contact with Soviet scientists on possibility of joint planning of planetary exploration.

Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, at Vienna conference discussed three results of U.S. manned space flight program to illustrate contributions to space exploration. Program had proved man could live in space and man could do useful work in space and it had created technology to make these possible. In first category, nasa, nas—nrc Space Science Board, nsf, arpa, dod groups, universities, and others had conquered problems of weightlessness in space, heavy acceleration and deceleration forces, air supply and pressure required for breathing in space, psychological problems presented by isolation, and problem of radiation.
Successful termination of Mercury and Gemini programs had proved man capable of existing in space. His capability to do useful work in space had been proved by successful rendezvous and docking of spacecraft, by space photography, and by extravehicular activity. Pervasiveness of space technology had been demonstrated by range and variety of thousands of products, including Saturn V launch vehicle, world’s largest flight vehicle, and integrated circuit, one of world’s smallest manufactured items.
Dr. Mueller said: “Our civilization has been built upon our accumulated knowledge of the natural laws of our environment. All of our inventions have been the result of the application of these natural laws. Advances in our civilization have always followed after discovery of some one of the missing links in our chain of knowledge. ... We know that many of the missing links . . . will he supplied ... as we move man with his accumulation of experience and his sophisticated equipment for exploration, into a new laboratory . . . the laboratory of the moon and outward to our solar system. ... If all of us, from all nations, are sufficiently creative, abundantly inventive, and freely adaptive, we have it within our power to improve the lives of every man, woman, and child.” (Text)

August 15: At closed meeting at Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. in July, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, had said contractors’ disregard of planned delivery dates for Apollo equipment amounted to a “disease” in the project, New York Times reported. Apollo Program Director l/g Samuel C. Phillips was quoted as saying, “The lunar landing next year is within our grasp, but we don’t have a hold of it because of the disease Dr. Mueller cited.” Project was running two years behind schedule, with first manned Apollo flight expected no earlier than mid-October and earliest lunar landing in a year. Dozens of contractors in $24-million program, urged to meet tough specifications for mission safety and success at same time, were obsessed with checking and double checking all systems as result of Jan. 24, 1967, Apollo fire. Lunar module (lm) regarded as pacing item of project, had undergone only one flight test. First lm for manned flight had developed problems in rendezvous equipment. Dr. Mueller had said rate of changes in lm was three times that of Apollo command module, whose rate of changes, in turn, was four times that of Saturn V rocket. He said changes placed added burden on technicians who should be concentrating on launching operations, not on vehicle modifications. (Wilford, NYT, 8/15/68,16)
• Washington Post editorial saw scheduled mirv test as threat to success of missile-limitation talks between U.S. and U.S.S.R. “Perhaps it will prove possible to level off the arms race despite MIRV, although it is generally acknowledged that this weapon raises special inspection and stability issues of its own. If talks do stick, however, the Administration must be prepared to bend on MIRV. . . . No one seriously claims that there is any immediate military justification for it; deterrence works without it and the antimissile system it was designed to penetrate evidently is in low gear. It may be acceptable for MIRV to be tested in order to ease the Administration’s internal tensions and electoral exigencies. . . . But it would be intolerable to let MIRV spoil the missile talks. They hold more promise of mutual security—the only genuine kind there is—than any new weapon can provide.” (W Post, 8/15/68, A20)

in sun-synchronous orbit with local equator crossing time between 2:35 pm and 2:55 pm so that daily Advanced Vidicon Camera System {Avcs) pictures of entire globe could be obtained regularly and dependably. Satellite achieved nearly polar, sun-synchronous, circular orbit with 918-mi (1,477.9-km) apogee, 895-mi (1,440-km) perigee, 114.9-min period, and 101.7° inclination. Drift of only 0.002° per day out of sun-synchronous orbit meant it would take perhaps 15 yr to change equator crossing time by 1 hr and added considerably to expected useful lifetime.
An advanced version of cartwheel configuration, 325-lb cylindrical Essa VII carried two avcs cameras for global weather coverage. Photos would be stored onboard satellite on magnetic tape until readout by essa’s Command and Data Acquisition (cda) stations at Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Island, Va.
During first 42 orbits, spacecraft underwent orientation maneuver to place it in wheel mode and spin rate was adjusted. By Aug. 23 all spacecraft systems bad been successfully programmed and excellent pic-
tures had been read out directly, as well as sequences stored for remote readout.
ESSA financed and managed TOS system and would operate spacecraft after NASA completed checkout later in month. GSFC was responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of spacecraft in orbit.

August 17: In letter to President Johnson, Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario (D-Conn.), Chairman of House Subcommittee on Science, Research and Development, urged reorganization of environmental science activities of Federal Government and asked that responsibility for development of weather modification programs be given to Environmental Science
Services Administration (essa). His committee, originator of NSF Amendments Act of 1968 which became effective July 18, was interested in implementing section which relieved NSF of that responsibility as of Sept. 1.
Rep. Daddario stated three beliefs: “1. The weather modification program involves the development of environmental understanding which is crucial to the protection of our planetary resources; it should be supported and pursued without significant hiatus. 2. In light of the nature of the program and the present administrative organization of the executive branch, it seems clear that weather modification should become part of the portfolio of the Environmental Science Services Administration. 3. At the same time, there is considerable doubt whether the Environmental Science Services Administration should remain part of the Department of Commerce; therefore consideration should be given to executive reorganization which might either relocate the Administration or give it independent status.” (Text; W Star, 8/23/68, A4)

August 19: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Deputy Administrator, announced elimination of lunar module (lm) operations from first manned Apollo/ Saturn V flight, Apollo 8. msf would begin planning and training for alternate, low-earth-orbit, manned command and service module (csm) mission for December launch but no final decision on precise mission plan would be made until after Oct. 11 Apollo 7 flight results were evaluated. LM 3, delayed in checkout, would be flown in 1969 on fourth Saturn V with CSM 104 since preliminary studies had indicated many Apollo objectives scheduled for later flights could be obtained by using Apollo 8 csm mission. Two problems in Saturn Apollo systems—vertical oscillation, or pogo effect, in 1st stage of Saturn V and rupture of small propellant lines in upper stages—had been corrected and solutions verified in extensive ground tests.
Plans and changes were discussed in detail at NASA Hq. news conference by Apollo Program Director l/g Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), who blamed checkout problems for six-week delay in Apollo schedule. “It is our view,” he said, “. . . that the probable flight readiness of lm 3 is perhaps in February, but it is in the February-March time period.” He said important advantage of flying Apollo 8 in 1968 was opportunity for earlier experience in operation of Saturn V and CSM than could otherwise be obtained. In response to questions Gen. Phillips said lunar landing next year was “clearly possible.” He also announced reassignment of crews: redefined Apollo 8 mission would have crew of Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr., and William A. Anders; crew originally assigned to this mission—James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, and Russell L. Schweickart—would fly on Apollo 9 with lm. New backup crew for Apollo 8 was Neil A.

•	JPL researchers Dr. Arvydas J. Kliore and Dan L. Cain in Journal of
Atmospheric Sciences reported findings similar to July 15 findings of Martin Marietta’s Allan R. Barger that surface air pressure on Venus might be 75 or 100 times greater than that on earth, or four to five times greater than that reported by U.S.S.R. scientists from data supplied by Venus IV spacecraft. Kliore and Cain concluded that Venus IV either had landed on 15-mi-high Venusian peak undetected by earth radar or had stopped transmitting before it reached nlanet’s solid surface.
Precise radio tracking of Mariner V—U.S. spacecraft which had completed flyby mission by crossing Venus orbit Oct. 19, 1967, 24 hr after U.S.S.R. had reported parachute landing on Venus—had enabled Kliore and Cain to calculate position of spacecraft’s radio beam, relative to Venus’ center. Resulting profiles indicated Soviet probe had penetrated to radial distance of 3,774 mi from Venus’ center, which point Soviets had taken to be Venus’ surface. U.S. radar studies had shown Venus radius of only 3,759 mi. If radar data were accurate, Venus IV measurements were made at 15-mi altitude and reported conditions far less extreme than on surface. U.S. measurement of Venus surface temperature greater than 890°—900° F was consistent with estimates from passive radio astronomy and with results of radiometer experiment conducted by Mariner II in 1962, when surface temperature was found to be 800° F.

There has been a world-wide increase in awnreness of the values and practicality of space flight. The nations of the world have become more conscious of the economic benefits of the space program, and the public is becoming increasingly aware of the values derived from space technology.

Persons advocating big cuts in space program were “doing this country a disservice.” Much of high U.S. gross national product was result of prior investment in r&d. “This Nation invests more per capita in research than any other nation in the world and that is a major reason why we have a higher standard of living. The space program is the most active, economical, and productive stimulus to research and development in history. We cannot afford to slow it down . . . unless we think we can afford less investment in the elimination of poverty, less expenditure for health improvement, less income for an expanding population, and less readiness in the realm of national security.” Space program cost, though large, was “not really so expensive when we figure that we are spending less than 1% of our Gross National Product for a technological capability that increases the rate at which this Nation becomes wealthier and more powerful by many times 1%.” (Text; B Sun, 8/29/68, A5; AP, LA Times, 8/29/68)

September 1968
September 1: In Baltimore Sun William J. Perkinson warned against “A Czechoslovakia In Space.” He said experts explained U.S. and other free-world nations “must insure that future Russian leaders will never be able to blackmail nations or whole continents of nations into submitting to the will of such Soviet leaders the way the leaders of the Kremlin forced Czechoslovakia to yield through the invasion of that country on the night of August 21.”
By marrying technology of “spook,” or hovering, satellite with that used to produce mirv and by use of more powerful rockets, “it would be possible to launch truly ‘orbiting men-of-war’ that could be used far more effectively to cow any nation than the most powerful of gunboats were able to do in the days of ‘gunboat diplomacy.’ ” Blackmail might not occur, if arms limitation treaties granted each nation right to board and inspect all heavy satellites in orbit. “But even that right would have to be backed up by means of spacecraft and spacemen capable of exercising that right. That ... is why the invasion of Czechoslovakia is certain to spark new interest in manned space flight.” (B Sun, 9/1/68, 3)

•	U.S. News & World Report said story of how U.S. had been steadily
stripping away “some of the most valuable military secrets of Soviet Russia for the past five years” was being revealed in bits and pieces. At heart of story were spy satellites orbiting earth. Powerful spaceborne cameras could photograph in detail objects less than one foot in diameter from 150-mi altitude. “Ultramodern” radar circling in outer space now penetrated cloud covers and forest vegetation to reveal hidden missile sites, tanks, and even troops. Infrared sensors could detect submarines and missile launching. Electronic sensors could monitor atomic explosions and pick up telephone messages from deep within U.S.S.R. or Communist China. President Johnson had said spy satellites alone made U.S. space investment worthwhile.

September 15—22: Zond V automatic space station was launched by U.S.S.R. and placed on lunar trajectory from parking orbit of another satellite to explore outer space and test spacecraft systems, Tass announced. All systems were functioning normally. Speculation in Moscow, later confirmed, was that spacecraft would attempt to circle moon. On Sept. 18 Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of U.K.’s Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, said spacecraft had passed within 1,000 mi of moon and was returning to earth and predicted U.S.S.R. would attempt to recover it. West Germany’s Bochum Observatory agreed that Zond V was returning but insisted spacecraft had circled moon. U.S.S.R. initially denied both reports, but two days later, confirmed that Zond V had circled moon Sept. 18 and was continuing its flight. Tass said spacecraft had flown within 1,200 mi of moon and obtained data on physical
characteristics of outer space near moon. Research mission had been completed and spacecraft was continuing to relay information to space stations.
Zond V’s reentry and splashdown in Indian Ocean Sept. 21 was recorded by U.S., U.K., and West German space scientists, but U.S.S.R. made no official announcement until Sept 22. Tass then said Zond V had circled moon, explored space near moon, reentered at 11,000 mi per sec, softlanded by parachute in predetermined area, and was recovered by Soviet recovery ship—becoming first circumlunar spacecraft recovered on earth. “During the flight the station’s systems and aggregates for maneuvering on the trajectory and for returning to the Earth were tested. Flight control systems of the station and the radio-engineering means for measuring the parameters of its trajectory ensured the successful execution of the programme.
“The successful flight of the ‘Zond—5’ automatic station over the Earth-Moon-Earth route, and its return to the predetermined area are an outstanding achievement of Soviet science and engineering. Another scientific-engineering problem has been solved, and broad prospects have been opened up for further research of outer space and planets of the solar system by automatic space stations which bring back research data to the Earth.”
Tass announcement that atmosphere and pressure “remained within the limits of their present range” supported earlier speculation that Zond V carried prototype passenger cabin with atmosphere of artificial helium mixture which would be used by cosmonauts on future flights. Later Tass report quoted Soviet Prof. Leonid I. Sedov as saying spacecraft had special heat shield and was slowed down during reentry by “air resistance” and, “at a comparatively small height,” by parachute.
Zond V was fifth spacecraft in Zond series and first Soviet spacecraft to land in water. Zond I (launched April 2, 1964) had failed in attempt to reach Venus and Zond II (launched Nov. 30, 1964) had suffered communications failure enroute to Mars. Zond III (launched July 18, 1965) had obtained photos of far side of moon; Zond IV (launched March 2, 1968) apparently had reached apogee comparable to lunar altitude and had burned in earth’s atmosphere on reentry, (gsfc SSR, 9/15/68; 9/30/68; W Post, 9/16/68, A17; 9/19/68, A25; 9/23/68, Al; NYT, 9/16/68, 29; 9/21-23/68, 1; Moscow News, 10/5-12/68, 3)
September 16: At White House press conference nasa Administrator James E. Webb announced his resignation, effective Oct. 7, his 62nd birthday. He wished to retire to devote his time to interests in education and foreign and urban affairs after 25 yr in Government and nearly 8 yr as nasa chief. President Johnson would name Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Deputy Administrator, to succeed him as Acting Administrator. Webb would remain as consultant to Dr. Paine until Jan. 20, 1969.
Webb told press: “I leave NASA well prepared and with a conservative financial structure to carry out the missions that have been approved. They will go forward. What we have not been able to do under the pressures on the budget has been to fund new missions for the 1970’s. So, there is going to be a period when there will be fewer flights than would, in my view, have been important to do. . . . We planned with the President’s leadership in 1961 and his recommenda-
tions to President Kennedy to develop an ability to fly six Saturn V’s per year and six Saturn I’s per year. . . . Under the reductions in the budget beginning in 1964 ... we have reduced that anticipated flight schedule, or production schedule, [until] we have now cancelled the production lines on both these boosters. . . . what we will have to do is develop a new base of technology for the next generation of boosters [and] . . . the country will have to look with great care into what it is it wants to do with those boosters that will be in storage.”
Answering query, Webb said, “I am not satisfied with the program. I am not satisfied that we as a nation have not been able to go forward to achieve a first position in space. What this really means is that we are going to be in a second position for some time to come. ... I am satisfied with what we have developed in every field and that we have been flying three successful generations of spacecraft. ... I think now the question is what will the fourth . . . be. We have a vast amount of capability. As the U.S.S.R. proceeds to fly and remains in the number one position, we will have the capability to start new programs as the need is clearly indicated. . . . We have worked up to a work force of 420,000 people. At the end of this fiscal year, we will be down to just over 200,000. So we have shown the administrative capability to build up and then to reduce without losing pace in the program.” Webb said NASA had decided to man third Saturn V flight in December. “We did calculate that we needed 15 Saturn V’s in program to make sure we would do the Lunar landing. We have funded eight. . . . Now we can only fly seven. So the real question is can we make the landing by number seven?”
A good many people, Webb said, have tended to use space program “as a sort of whipping boy. . . . But in essence, if it were not for the fiscal problems faced by the President and the Director of the Budget I would believe that the program would have been supported in the Congress and in the country at a higher level than it has been.” Webb thought U.S. had reached parity with U.S.S.R. 2y2 yr earlier except in large boosters and spacecraft. If U.S. could have had 12 Saturns a year in late 1967 or 1968, “I think we would have forged ahead.” Instead, “while we are reducing down to half to two-thirds of our program, they are still increasing.” Webb said current U.S space program had created capability that could be used for major efforts in exploration if adequately funded. “Any danger to the United States that would come from the Russian program would be visible in time to use this capability to start out. But they are going to have the reality and the image of being out in front for a number of years to come. How dangerous that is, you will have to judge yourself.” (Transcript; Sheehan, NYT, 9/17/68, 1; Kilpatrick, O’Toole, W Post, 9/17/68, Al; Dobbin, B Sun, 9/17/68, A9)

•	NASA launched series of three sounding rockets from NASA Wallops Sta-
tion. First Nike-Cajun carried gsfc experiment to 42.6-mi (68.6-km) altitude to determine ozone concentration and water vapor distribution as a function of altitude and obtain finite data during parachute de-
scent from 43.4-mi (70-km) altitude. Basic payload design proved operational. Rocket performance was good; peak altitude was 6% below predicted. Instrumentation’s tone ranging was lost after payload despin and new AB signal replacing FM signal slowly deteriorated after liftoff. Radar tracked all systems from liftoff to impact. Although parachute was not fully deployed during descent and aluminum oxide hydrometer failed to project because of spring malfunction, key events occurred within two seconds of predicted times and significant data were obtained. Midair-retrieval attempt was not successful, but payload and parachute were recovered.
Second Nike-Cajun carried GSFC payload to 73.1-mi (117.6-km) altitude to obtain vertical profile of temperature, pressure density, and wind data between 21.8- and 59-mi (35- and 95-km) altitudes by detonating 19 grenades and recording their sound arrivals at ground. Rocket performed satisfactorily. Grenade timer malfunctioned and instead of ejecting 19 grenades during ascent, vehicle ejected 1 grenade after apogee during descent and 12—14 grenades which detonated at sporadic intervals during descent. Final destruct grenade destroyed payload before impact. Some significant data could be correlated from ground arrivals.
Areas sounding rocket carried U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station payload to 34.5-mi (55.5-km) altitude to measure ozone concentration at 18.6- to 37.5-mi (30- to 60-km) altitudes by observing solar UV light attenuation by ozone during parachute descent. Rocket performed nominally; altitude achieved was within 10,000 ft of predicted. Instruments performed satisfactorily and good data were obtained.

•	Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Deputy Administrator whom retiring Ad-
ministrator James E. Webb had said would be named Acting NASA Administrator by President Johnson, represented “new breed of scientist-administrators making their way into government,” said John Lannan in Washington Evening Star. Unlike Webb, he was new to Government, having come up through “the scientific ranks of the sprawling General Electric Co. over a period of 19 years.” As Webb’s chief deputy since March, Dr. Paine had been authorizing and signing major announcements but had yet to confront Congress. He and Webb saw eye-to-eye, he had said, on agency’s current program emphasis, which had been criticized as too heavily oriented to manned flight. “I am a very strong supporter of doing as much as we can in planetary areas.” Dr. Paine said, “but it’s one of those cases where you’ve got limited resources and you’re trying to do all the things you can. You’ve got to do things in aeronautics; we’ve got to finish up the Apollo program; and we’ve got to do more in earth resources (surveying them from space) here on this planet.” A lot of NASA’s future “is in the questions that we’ll be raising as we continue to probe the planets.”
On balancing space needs against problems of cities, Dr. Paine felt U.S. suffered from “what I would call almost a national hypochondria ... in many ways crippling some of the forward-looking things we’re able to do. ... I feel that one of the very highest priority matters is the war on poverty and the problems of the cities. But in the meantime, we’re making . . . a lot of progress in the civil rights area and really, this nation is a good deal healthier than we’re giving it credit for today.” He was confident of a resurgence of public interest in space once the Apollo program got underway.

September 18: nasa launch from etr of Intelsat-III F—1, first of four Intelsat III comsats scheduled for 1968—69, failed to reach orbit when three-stage Long-Tank Delta booster, on maiden flight, pitched backward and was exploded several thousand feet above Atlantic. NASA Launch Director Robert Gray said booster encountered trouble in gyroscope system controlling pitch rate 20 sec after blastoff. Launch vehicle became erratic and uncontrollable, pitching backward 1 min 2 sec into flight, and 6 sec later ETR safety officer sent signal to destroy vehicle. Delta fuel tanks had already begun to tear apart and burst into flame. Pieces of booster and satellite fell into ocean 12 mi off Florida. Experts were studying radio data to determine cause of failure, which ComSat-Corp said would not have significant effect on 1968 revenue. Delay in completing cycle of four Intelsat Ills would be felt in 1969; ComSatCorp officials termed it “major blow” to plans for early full-scale global system.

•	At international symposium in Washington, D.C., sponsored by NAS and

In polar regions, earth’s magnetic lines of force plunged almost straight down, leaving considerable area “accessible to space. Charged particles mov-
ing rapidly could escape local entrapment by planet’s field. U.S satellites had observed such particles rising toward space at supersonic speeds. They climbed vertical magnetic force lines and wound up in long tail which protruded from earth on side away from sun (distortion of earth’s magnetic field by solar wind of charged particles flowing continuously from sun). Univ. of California scientist Peter M. Banks was credited with deducing existence of polar wind. (W News, 9/18/68, 18)

orbit could control entire air traffic of U.S. and 18 could handle entire world’s air traffic, according to trw Systems Div., which demonstrated system during Air Force Assn, meeting in Washington, D.C. Satellites would serve as reference points for aircraft in flight, ships at sea, or mechanized ground equipment and could locate user’s longitude and latitude to accuracy within 60 ft and his altitude to within 120 ft. They would operate like comsats but, instead of relaying messages from point to point, would beam signals to aircraft. By taking bearings on any two satellites, computerized unit in aircraft could pinpoint aircraft’s location by radio. Militarily, system could lead to accurate allweather bombing capability and armored column movements in poor terrain or weather, or help infantrymen in the field. For civilian air traffic control, it could overlap existing equipment and eventually phase it out. (Lannan, W Star, 9/18/68)

•	Washington Post commented on resignation of James E. Webb as NASA
Administrator: “Virtually from scratch, with the country in a swivet over Soviet prowess, James E. Webb took over the Nation’s feeble space program and drove the United States firmly into the space age. ... he created—in the civilian space agency—the largest and most labryrinthine engineering organization in American history. ... In his eight-year stewardship, NASA proceeded under presidential and Congressional flogging toward the goal of a manned lunar landing ‘in this decade.’ It achieved repeated successes and hut a single important failure—the fire that claimed the lives of three astronauts last year.
“It is characteristic of this self-effacing, organization-minded man that he should choose to retire now at his 62nd birthday, practically on the eve of the Apollo launching—a career-capping event if ever there was one. His purpose is to hand NASA over to his lieutenants before the change of administration, on the theory that the agency will thereby have a better chance of riding out next year’s power transfer. The country is fortunate that Mr. Webb is in good health and determined to apply himself vigorously to further the Nation’s understanding of the space age. For him this is far more than a matter of projectiles and orbits; it goes to the heart of the necessities and the aspirations of a great modern society.
“Whereas Mr. Webb leaves NASA with its current mission adequately funded and its capabilities well formed, he does not leave it with a set mission beyond landing on the moon. This is hardly his fault. The fading American taste for competition with the Russians in space and the rising competition of other claimants for Federal funds explain NASA’s uncertain estate; its budget has been cut $1.4 billion in four years. ... it will be up to the next Administration and the next Congress to chart America’s future in space. That they have a choice is the singular achievement of Jim Webb.” (W Post, 9/18/68, A22)

Questioned about safety, mission commander Schirra said, “when we go over the sill for launch day, we will consider that all those risks that are appropriate for this type of mission are either understood by us or that they are low enough that we have a very, very high probability. . . . We would like 10.8 days and we will do our best to do it. . . . We’ve had a goal that is rather a hard one to achieve, particularly one that we have to follow on when we lost three of our compatriots, and we don’t want any mistakes ... to happen again. We have not been the ‘kid-around’ types that we might have been in the past, we’re much more serious about it, because this is a much more complicated machine and there are many, many more people involved in it. ...

We have basically lived with it at the plant [and] at the Cape . . . and if somebody even takes a small component off it, we become furious and say, ‘Why did you remove it?’ We expect answers immediately . . . that is the way we are working.”

•	Washington Sunday Star commented on resignation of NASA Administra-
tor James E. Webb: “The abrupt announcement, which was notably lacking in the customary ceremonial niceties, was the final confirmation that NASA’s honeymoon is definitely over. The relationship between the space agency and Congress must rank as perhaps the longest, and in many ways the happiest, official honeymoon on record. For six years, hardly a frown or a cross word came between the blossoming agency and the guardians of the nation’s treasure. The amiable and loquacious Webb proved himself an able administrator who knew his way around in the bureaucratic jungle. Through Mercury and Gemini programs, NASA virtually had only to ask, and Congress was ready to give. Then came the Apollo tragedy.” But Jan. 27, 1967, fire did not cause the change of heart. “It was ... a catalyst that speeded the process. But a growing coolness was bound to develop . . . for the basic economic
fact is that America simply cannot continue to meet NASA’s ever-expanding economic demands—not, at least, without a critical weighing of those demands against the nation’s existing domestic, diplomatic and military obligations. . . .
“Long before the tragedy that threw the timetable into a shambles, the conflict between America’s technical ability to move men into space and America’s ability to pay the freight could be seen by those who cared to look ahead. . . . Congressional reluctance to commit the nation to further, open-ended expenditures in manned space flight is therefore inevitable. But equally inevitable is the dismay—and in some cases the bitterness—of NASA officials. Webb and his lieutenants can take justifiable pride in what has been accomplished in the brief span of the space age. . . . They have solved problems quickly and accurately that men have never faced before. In the process, they pulled together a scientific and technical team unequalled in the peacetime history of this country. Now they are watching that massive army disband. . . .
“Man will someday go to the planets and beyond. But that day must wait until the breakdown of nationalistic barriers makes possible a truly united world space program. Meanwhile, the United States should concentrate on the development of more sophisticated machines, less costly rocket systems and closer cooperation between the military and civilian space programs to avoid wasteful duplication. America’s space effort must not end with the Apollo program. It must be diverted into equally exciting and frequently more rewarding channels of unmanned space exploration.” (W Star, 9/22/68, Cl)

conference astronaut training for possible manned moon-orbiting mission later in 1968 was under way. “We will do the maximum the systems will allow,” he said, “and the maximum you could foresee would be lunar orbit.” Decision in November, after evaluation of Apollo 7 data, would determine if Apollo 8 crew—Astronauts Frank Borman, William A. Anders, and James A. Lovell, Jr.—were to attempt lunar orbit in December, nasa Deputy Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, pointed out that plans for possible manned lunar mission had been made long before U.S.S.R.’s Zond V circumlunar flight.
In Oct. 11 Apollo 7 launch, Schneider said, earth orbital flight was set to run up to 10 days 19 hr at altitudes from 120 to 150 mi. Primary objectives were tests of command and service modules with crew, tests of ground control facilities, demonstration of capability for rendezvous with spent rocket section, and eight firings of service propulsion system. Schneider said he would rate Apollo 7 a success if “we get rendezvous and stay up three days to accomplish our main objectives.”
Discussing plans to follow Apollo program with lunar exploration program Dr. Paine said, if forced to choose between Apollo Applications program in earth orbit or lunar exploration, NASA “would be most reluctant to give up manned lunar exploration,” as an area “man is uniquely qualified to contribute to” and one “of enormous scientific interest and importance.” (Transcript; Wilford, NYT, 9/24/68, 26; Cohn, W Post, 9/24/68, Al)

Before May failure, agency had compiled “almost incredible” launch record, said Thomas O’Toole in Washington Post. Sources close to NASA had said agency was conducting fourth investigation to determine whether there was “something systemic at the root of the trouble.” One theory was that decline in NASA launch activity in 1968, with 42 attempted launches thus far compared to 69 at same time in 1967, had caused similar drop in attention to detail. Second theory was that layoffs and turnover in launch crews had cut down efficiency and introduced element of inexperience.

tee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology that, while nasa was “maximizing . . . technical support of the dod within the framework of their systems approach to new military aircraft,” major changes in civil aeronautics made that situation “more complicated for NASA and the nation.” Growth of air transportation, decline in development of military aircraft whose technology was directly applicable to civilian use, and ground transportation’s saturation had created era in which “it is not simply enough to build aircraft which are bigger or fly faster; rather, future advances in aeronautics must also take the form of aircraft which complement the nation’s overall transportation systems while operating harmoniously with the constraints imposed by urban environments.”
Basic issue facing nasa and U.S. in civil aeronautics R&d was proper role of Government in fostering its advances. “In my view, government actions to stimulate the development of advanced aircraft transportation system should be such as to leave the maximum initiative and business risk in the hands of industry. The government [might] carry promising new technological principles . . . into experimental hardware, but only to the point of demonstrating the soundness of the principle involved, and only when this demonstration is essential and would not be otherwise undertaken.

Harper told Committee accelerated research was needed not only on supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, but in development of quiet subsonic jets with steeper landing patterns, helicopters with greater safety and less noise, and stol aircraft for interurban transport.

From President Kennedy’s glowing picture of Americans in space we have slipped into a program put together in fits and starts—fits brought about by a realization of how much it would cost to do it right and starts caused by a basic desire never to be second to anybody. Because of this, there is no use in seizing upon Zond-5 as a reason to go all-out to beat the Russians in a race for men on the moon. Our program . . . ought to move at its own pace. If that pace is sufficiently rapid to bring American astronauts to the moon first, fine. If it is not, so be it.

Influential Congressmen sided with him against their colleagues who challenged the wisdom of the space program and the quality of the Webb management. . . .
“If Richard Nixon is elected President, it is a dead certainty that he would not want to keep Webb on as NASA Administrator. Hubert Humphrey might also want his own man. But even if Webb could stay in the job, it’s probably all for the better that he quit now. The investigation following the Apollo accident permanently soured his relations with some members of Congress.

September 28: U.S.S.R.’s Zond V automatic research station had apparently suffered series of errors during reentry that could have been fatal if men had been on board, John Lannan reported in Washington Evening Star. According to one unidentified U.S. source, Zond V had entered atmosphere and “skipped” back out as planned, but then skipped along top of atmosphere and reentered “at a peculiar angle.” Reentry caused g forces and heat loads that would have been fatal to crews if aboard, and spacecraft landed thousands of miles short of its intended landing area, which was probably on land in Soviet territory.
Chicago Tribune later supported theory that Zond V’s reentry was a disaster and reported that U.S. sources said evidence indicated spacecraft had: (1) failed to circle as close to moon as intended, and was thus unable to obtain useful photos of possible landing sites; (2) reentered earth’s atmosphere at angle much steeper than planned, causing friction temperatures that would have killed cosmonauts; and (3) landed in water accidentally instead of in Soviet territory as planned.

Magnification capability of Ranger and Surveyor opened way “for lunar and planetary investigations of a type and scope undreamed of before we learned to use the rocket technology.” Saturn V launch “demonstrated that we can have . . . the big-booster capability and the launch rate capability in which we have been behind the U.S.S.R.” Utility of Essa IV was “far beyond any we can achieve in any other way. It works ... all around the world, and feeds information into something like 296 stations in the United States and about 86 in 45 other countries. It is truly a working bird. . . .
“I do not believe our Nation could have long continued as a great power if we had not built up the means to conduct operations in space. ... I believe we would have sacrificed our chances to keep pace in the technological competition that is the crucial test of our times. . . . We would have denied to ourselves the tools and the knowledge necessary . . . [for] problems that beset us and the rest of mankind the benefits that surely will follow from the full development of space applications.” (Text; W Post, 10/13/68, B5)

October 1: NASA 10th Anniversary: National Space Club presented special award to President Johnson at White House citing his legislative and executive leadership of national space program. At Space Club dinner in Washington, D.C., Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N. Mex.) and Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) presented retiring NASA Administrator James E. Webb award for his outstanding contributions to national space effort. In telegram tribute to Webb, President Johnson said, “The Nation is in his debt. He will be deeply missed but gratefully remembered as his dreams continue to become reality in the years ahead.”
Telegram from Vice President Hubert Humphrey said, “The span of achievement which measures a decade of space progress is one which should be a source of pride to all of us. Now a new decade beckons, with new challenges, and new opportunities. And, such is the nature of the space age that we dare not become complacent about our rate of progress or the scope of our past accomplishments. It is unthinkable that we would allow ourselves to be surpassed in technology by any other nation. I have never questioned that space endeavors have contributed significantly to the strengthening and enrichment of our whole society, through a teamwork approach by private industry, our universities, and the Federal Government. By means of this program we have vitalized our economy, developed improved methods of management, stimulated our educational system, produced new goods and services, added to our store of scientific knowledge, and buttressed our national security.” Telegram from Republican Presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon said, “The space program must continue to be one of our national imperatives, and it must be supported at a level assuring efficient and steady progress.”
Anniversary ceremonies also included open house and annual awards presentation at msfc Sept. 28—29. (nsc Newsletter; Texts; Marshall Star, 9/25/68,4)
In anniversary statement issued by White House President Johnson said: “. . . not all of nasa’s accomplishments have been out of this world. Satellites have given us a new look at the world’s weather. . . . They have given us intercontinental television broadcasts, and broken down the technical barriers to worldwide communications. NASA has brought us advances in medical science, education, mapmaking, geology, transportation, and a host of other areas that promise a better life for us here on Earth. Its intensive research and development efforts have given us new materials, products and processes; raised our standards of reliability and advanced managerial techniques. These advances, together with the useful facilities it has built, will be lasting national assets long after the Moon landing is ancient history. . . .
“In the years ahead—as in the past decade—our foremost motive is to make men wiser and life on earth more meaningful. And on the mile-

stone of this rewarding effort, we renew our dedication to the guiding principle we expressed 10 years ago at nasa’s launching: that our further mastery of space may continue to be ‘for the benefit of all mankind.’ ” {PD, 10/7/68,1435-1436)
During its first 10 yr NASA had completed 234 major U.S. and international launches plus thousands of sounding rocket launches. Of 234 major launches, 189 were launch-vehicle successes and 174 were spacecraft or mission successes, with two missions still under evaluation. For these launches NASA had developed rockets ranging from 88,000-lb thrust to Saturn V with 7.5-million-lb thrust capable of sending nearly 100,000-lb payload to moon.
First phase of manned flight program, Project Mercury, had begun seven days after NASA was established. Six manned Mercury flights had proved man could go into space and function as pilot-engineer-experimenter for up to 34 hr weightless flight before returning to earth. Gemini program announced in 1961 had demonstrated work could be performed in orbit outside spacecraft in more than 12 hr extravehicular activity. Gemini included 52 experiments, among them 17 scientific—in astronomy, biology, geology, meteorology, and physics. Seven rendezvous techniques and nine dockings had been accomplished during Gemini. More than 2,000 hr manned spaceflight experience gained through
Mercury and Gemini had contributed heavily to Apollo, including 16 flights of unmanned Saturn launch vehicle which had confirmed Apollo engineering concepts and qualified all systems for manned missions. Although Apollo fire on Jan. 27, 1967, had delayed manned missions, it had resulted in safer spacecraft and improved suits for astronauts.
Ahead were two manned missions for 1968 and possibly five for 1969, culminating in landing of U.S. astronauts on moon. Facilities at NASA installations in U.S. were worth more than $2.5 billion and peak 35,000 staff included some of Nation’s top scientists. Industrial work force had peaked at 400,000 and was dropping to 200,000. NASA had established global tracking network capable of communicating with vehicles as far away as far side of sun. Its aeronautics program conducted R&D on noise abatement, flight safety, supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, lifting-body vehicles, and v/stol aircraft, nasa’s technological advances included development of new electronic parts, alloys, adhesives, lubricants, valves, and pumps, as well as progress in miniaturization. More than 2,500 technical innovations applicable in industry, medicine, and other nonaerospace activities had resulted from 10 yr of nasa progress. In Christian Science Monitor, Neal Stanford said, “It is . . . science satellites and the new technology developed that are counted on to return to the tax-paying public the dividends that some say will make space the best investment man ever made.” (Marshall Star, 9/25/68, 5; Wilford, NYT, 10/1/68; CSM, 10/5/68)
In Washington Sunday Star special report, “A Decade in Space,” John Lannan commented on NASA’s 10th anniversary: “. . . the space agency’s real promise for improving the general welfare of mankind as set forth in the Space Act which brought it into being has apparently been too slow in being fulfilled. The fact that the space investment is only now starting to pay off, and at an increasingly rapid pace, is going unnoticed in the glare of present problems, past mishaps and the imminence of the Apollo venture. Where NASA’s real goals lie are in the future—the near future and the near earth. Spin-off, the serendipity of technology, has long been used as a justification for the vast sums poured into space, but little beyond Teflon-coated frying pans have impinged on the tax-payer’s mind.” (W Star, 9/29/68, Al)
NASA Assistant Administrator for dod and Interagency Affairs Jacob E. Smart wrote in Space Digest: “The tenth anniversary . . . marks the end of a decade of concerted effort across a broad front to advance the nation’s capabilities in aeronautics and space. It has been a decade of accomplishment that has few peers in this country’s history. . . . the good working relationships . . . between NASA and DOD have been of immeasurable benefit to them both, and the nation’s space effort is the stronger for it. . . . with the prospect of tighter budgets likely, the maintenance of such relationships—and their improvement—assumes an increasing importance. The need to stretch the appropriations dollars to the maximum may be partly met by fresh efforts to find common ground where cooperation will produce economies as well as mutual benefits.” (Space Digest, 10/68, 68—70)
In Space Digest Gen. James Ferguson, Commander of afsc, described “A Decade of Cooperation—The Military-NASA Interface.” afsc’s FY 1969 NASA support expenditures “amounted to millions of dollars and thousands of man-years in effort. The sums of money, and,
more important, the human technological resources we are currently expending on the nation’s space programs are of great consequence since they are the foundations of our future benefits. ... we are acutely aware that the fate of future generations lies in space. ... It is a sad commentary to state that technology has provided us with the means to conduct wars. But it is heartening to realize that one day technology will provide us with the means to prevent wars. {Space Digest, 10/68, 71-3)	_

The . . . planning must consider not only the aircraft in flight as a system, but also the entire problem of moving people from destination to destination,” requiring “planning and resources on a considerably larger scale than are now available.”
NASA’s responsibility for U.S. aeronautical research “should continue.” DOD had used NASA research, augmenting it for defense as necessary, with “excellent coordination for many years.” Military R&D was specialized, but much was transferable to civil aviation. Long-term goals of smokeless combustors and silent aircraft would be of mutual benefit, sage air defense computer system had contributed to faa radar beacon system and new national standards. Much improved altimetry reporting came from dod development for high-performance jet aircraft. Common digitizer was joint dod—faa project, as was TPX—42 airport traffic control facility. Eleven aircraft carriers had pilot “hands-off” capability for blind landing. Microwave scanning-beam landing systems were in testing. Collision avoidance, v/sTOL, and cargo-handling R&D had civil application. (Text)

Dr. Burke’s experiment measured signals from newly discovered quasars to determine amount of bending they underwent in passing the sun. If light, in form of quasar radiowaves, was bent, Einstein theory would receive added support; if it was not bent as much as he predicted, or if astronomers were unable to detect significant bending, theory would remain intact until further proof was provided, (nrao Proj Off; Lannan, W Star, 10/1/68, A9)

October 3: Aurorae (Esro /) satellite, designed, developed, and constructed by European Space Research Organization under July 8, 1964, NASA— ESRO agreement, was successfully launched by NASA from WTR by four-stage Scout booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 952.1 mi (1,532.2 km) ; perigee, 158.9 mi (255.8 km); period, 102.8 min; and inclination, 93.8°. Primary NASA mission objectives were to place Aurorae into planned orbit and provide tracking and telemetry support. The 185-lb cylindrical satellite carried eight experiments to study aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and other related phenomena of polar ionosphere, representing six different organizations from U.K., Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. All experiments were operating as planned, and their scientific objectives were being achieved.

•	nasa Deputy Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, presented NASA FY
1969 interim operating plan to Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Although President Johnson had not yet signed appropriations bill, Bureau of the Budget had indicated nasa’s share of $6 billion .expenditure reduction might amount to $350 million. This
meant limitation of use of FY 1969 appropriations to $3.85 billion, Dr. Paine said. “Our actions also have had to be constrained by our current instructions within the Executive Branch to hold expenditures to a minimum in 1970 as well as in 1969, and to be prepared for the eventuality of budgetary limitations in FY 1970 even more restrictive than those in FY 1969. I am personally convinced that the nation’s space program requires an increase in funding in FY 1970 and I am hopeful ... we will succeed in establishing the need for a significant increase. Until this decision is made ... we have no alternative but to proceed with an interim operating plan . . . which, where possible, holds open options we can exercise in FY 1970 if the budget is higher but which does not overcommit us if the FY 1970 budget is lower.”
Plan retained $2,025 billion authorized for Apollo program—$14 million below budget request. It reduced authorized $253.2 million for Apollo Applications to $150 million, amount “required to work toward the important but sharply limited and deferred Apollo Applications program we now propose.” This would include cessation of Saturn IB launch vehicle production after completion of 14th (Saturn 214) and discontinuation of Saturn V at completion of first 15 vehicles. Single Saturn I workshop and single Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) would be launched in early 1970s. Authorized $5 million for advanced missions would be cut to $2.5 million, for continued studies related to manned earth-orbital and lunar missions. Authorized $136.9 million would be reduced to $132.1 million for physics and astronomy, with level of effort in supporting research and technology and data analysis approximately 10% lower than in FY 1968.
The $92.3 million authorized for lunar and planetary exploration would be cut to $75.8 million, with $6.8 million for lunar and $69 million for planetary—to support Mariner-Mars 1969 mission, reacquisition of telemetry from Mariner V, and Mariner-Mars 1971 mission. Plan also supported in FY 1969, at reduced funding level, capability to conduct Mars mission during 1973 opportunity in keeping with NAS recommendation [see Sept. 19]. Overall scope of mission would be reduced and schedule compressed. Operating plan provided for construction of two 210-ft antennas for Mars and other missions during 1970s. Launch vehicle procurement authorization of $115.7 million would be cut to $100.2 million and bioscience from $33 million to $32,7 million, which was $15 million below budget request and required slip of 6—12 mo in 21-day Biosatellite missions.
Space applications authorization of $98.7 million would be retained; program change necessitated by May 18 destruction of Nimbus B would result in launch of replacement, Nimbus B2, in spring 1969. Aeronautics r&d budget would remain at authorized $74.9 million, while FY 1969 effort in nuclear rockets would be limited and nerva development deferred until 1970, when $7.5 million withheld in FY 1969 could be added to allow total of $39.5 million. Interim plan.would provide $178.4 million for basic research, space vehicle systems, electronics systems, human factor systems, space power and electric propulsion systems, and chemical propulsion—at reduction of $21.5 million from NASA’s budget request. Work in long-endurance life-support-equipment technologies would proceed as planned but in other areas research and technical development would be reduced, especially efforts
in support of advanced space missions. Tracking and data acquisition budget would be reduced from $289.8 million authorized to $280 million, providing full Apollo schedule support but limiting support for spacecraft aloft and on future missions.
Construction of facilities funds had been reduced from $39.6 million authorized to $21.8 million appropriated. Operating plan would increase figure to $35.7 million by transferring funds from R&D appropriation. Facility planning and design funds were reduced from $3 million requested to $1 million. Interim operating plan anticipated transfer of $20.1 million from R&D to administrative operations, bringing total to $623.3 million instead of $603.2 million in authorization and appropriations acts and $648.2 million requested by NASA in budget. Dr. Paine emphasized that administrative operations appropriation did not cover only “administrative” expenses; it covered direct costs of operating NASA laboratories, research centers, development centers, and launch centers.
nasa Administrator James E. Webb told Committee: “. . . when you use words such as ‘Congress consistently has supported the Apollo program,’ you must add ‘at a minimum level.’ We have clearly indicated in every budget that the basis on which we were going forward with this support by Congress was one that did not take into account unusual risks and happenings and was, in effect, based on success in all these efforts.” Webb said NASA Apollo funding was related to success on various operations and did not include “a return to test flight on the Saturn IB should we not be able to make the shift to the big rocket after this next flight.” From 1961 to 1969, Webb said, “we have not had the funds to proceed except in a manner that would permit us, within the total budget, to do this lunar landing within this decade and on an all-up systems test basis. So the excruciatingly painful period of all-up testing on the Saturn V is yet ahead of us.” (Testimony; Transcript)

John E. Naugle, NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, said: “During the next few years . . . our efforts in astronomical observations, in space applications and in planetary exploration, should receive priority. ... In astronomy, perhaps more than in any other scientific discipline, major progress has been achieved when a new observing technique is used. In the next several years we will provide our astronomers with such new observational tools—telescopes and detectors in space above the absorbing and obscuring effect of the earth’s atmosphere. ... we envision a complementary program using both manned and automated observational platforms leading to permanent observatories in space in the next 10 to 15 years. On the other hand, OAO, oso, and the small astronomy satellite will carry the burden of automated observation, while the Apollo Telescope Mount provides us with early experience in the contribution man can make in astronomy. Before very many years, it should be possible for us to move into astra-type systems in which we combine the best of both techniques, i.e., long-term automated instruments in orbit of a cost and complexity which justify their being serviced and maintained by man. . . .
“Although . . . post Apollo plans are much more modest than previously announced, even at these reduced levels, it should be possible to carry out some important near-earth and extended lunar missions following the Apollo landings. However, there remains no clear picture as to the future of manned space flight beyond the use of the launch vehicles and rockets left over from Apollo. The resolution of the future goals of manned space flight must await the . . . next administration.” (Text)

This attitude is particularly perilous in the realm of defense. ... In few areas of development is activity so intense and productive as in Soviet military research and development.” While U.S.S.R. graduated twice as many scientists annually as U.S., American scientific community was “demoralized” by wavering attitudes toward R&D. “Scientific activity cannot be turned on and off like a faucet. The withdrawal of support disperses highly trained research teams, closes vital facilities, loses spinoff benefits, and disrupts development momentum. . . . The United States must end this depreciation of research and development in its order of national priorities. ... It would be an urgent goal of my administration to devise effective means by which it could cooperate with industry and the academic community in an effort to make maximum use of scientific advances to help solve major national problems. . . .

If some doomsayers are to be believed, the vast U.S. space science and technology establishment put together during the last decade will be systematically dismantled once the manned Apollo landing has been accomplished because nasa has ‘no clear mandate’ to go on; cornfields will reclaim the great rocket and spacecraft-testing sites . . .; the solar system will become the exclusive playground 'of Soviet cosmonauts.” Yet NASA’s mandate to explore space “for the benefit of all mankind” had been set down in legislation establishing the agency and did not end with the moon.

Mueller, addressed Ninth National Conference of United Press International Editors and Publishers in Washington, D.C.: “For the conception and construction of the equipment necessary to the safe transport of men into space and for their accomplishment of productive tasks in that new atmosphere, a new mix of professional and scientific disciplines has been created which has forced cooperation between engineers and medical doctors. Many of the technologies which are essential to our sending three men to the moon and back did not exist a few years ago. They had to be invented, adapted or developed. . . .
“We now have the giant boosters which have released man from his atmosphere, and . . . life support systems that can maintain him in space. As a result of the cleanliness requirements of the space program wre have the largest ‘clean rooms’ in the world—rooms which hospitals are now emulating. . . . Over 600 computers now comprise the largest and most advanced communications system in the world. The fuel cell, which had Iain dormant for many years, was activated to power spacecraft in orbit. Thirty public utility companies now have a $27,000,000 program for the adaptation of the fuel cell for home power units. We had to know on a real-time basis how fast the hearts of the astronauts were beating while they were in space . . . how much oxygen they were using, and how their muscles were responding ... so we invented another new system, biosensor to computer to data gathering equipment, and through communications network to the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston—from 100 ... or 800 ... or from of a million miles out in space. And a half a dozen newly formed companies are now manufacturing these adapted space-created instruments for the use of doctors and hospitals here on earth.”
In conclusion Dr. Mueller quoted the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, first Deputy Administrator: “None of us knows what the final destiny of man may be—or if there is any end to his capacity for growth and adaptation. Wherever this venture leads us, we in the United States are convinced that the power to leave the Earth-—to travel where we will in space—and to return at will—marks the opening of a brilliant new state in man’s evolution.” (Text)

October 11—22: NASA’s Apollo 7 (AS—205), first manned mission in Apollo lunar landing program, was successfully launched from ksc Launch Complex 34 at ll:02 am edt by Saturn IB booster. Primary objectives were to demonstrate command and service module (csm) and crew performance; demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support facilities; and demonstrate csm rendezvous capability. All launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft, carrying Astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Jr. (commander), Donn F. Eisele (cm pilot), and R. Walter Cunningham (lm pilot), entered initial orbit with 177.8-mi (286.1-km) apogee, 138.2-mi (222.4-km) perigee, 89.9-min period, and 31.6° inclination. Saturn IB 2nd stage (S—IVB) manned control test was completed with excellent results, and S—IVB separated from csm on schedule. Crew successfully transposed csm and simulated docking by maneuvering csm to within four or five feet of S—IVB.
President Johnson sent message to Apollo 7 crew: “Everything in the Presidential office came to a halt as Foreign Minister Debre of France and I watched with mounting excitement the magnificent launch of the Saturn. . . .” Message was relayed from Air Force I as President flew from Washington to visit former President Harry S. Truman.
On second day Schirra told ground controllers crew was too busy to set up portable camera for live TV coverage because of minor but time-consuming difficulties. Astronauts had to pump waste water manually from spacecraft, Schirra and Eisele had trouble with their biomedical harnesses, Schirra had head cold symptoms, spacecraft evaporator
system required maintenance, and hatch windows blurred and were bordered by mysterious “small hairs like fuzz.” Crew fired sps engine for 10 sec and 8 sec to set up rendezvous and maneuvered csm to within 70 ft of tumbling spent 2nd stage, simulating techniques to be used on future flights if LM were to become disabled in lunar orbit. Crew took close-up photos of lm adapter attached to 2nd stage. S—IVB reentered earth’s atmosphere Oct. 18 and splashed into Indian Ocean.
On third day crew, which had already accomplished half its objectives, photographed clouds and earth and continued checking out spacecraft systems. Power failure in spacecraft’s Ac electrical system was quickly restored, but overloading prompted officials to reschedule third SPS burn 20 hr sooner than planned. Burn positioned and sized ellipse for CM reaction control system deorbit in case of emergency and set up auxiliary gaging system test. Astronauts, all with head colds, appeared on national TV for 7 min for first time live from space. Crew displayed hand-printed signs bearing greetings from “the lovely Apollo room high atop everything.”
Second live telecast for 11 min Oct. 15 showed closeups of spacecraft interior and astronauts so clear that observers could read astronauts’ lips. Third TV appearance Oct. 16, which included nine-minute tour of spacecraft, won astronauts honorary membership in American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Later, crew successfully fired sps engine for fourth burn, demonstrating 20,500-lb-thrust engine’s minimum impulse capability. As spacecraft passed over Hurricane Gladys in Gulf of Mexico, astronauts photographed storm and relayed data to Weather Bureau hurricane center. They also took pictures of “long plume” of air pollution. Crew continued spacecraft checkout, guidance and navigation procedures, and TV operations on seventh day, but fourth telecast was smudgy. Successful 67-sec fifth SPS burn—longest to date—was performed out of plane to test auxiliary gaging system and readjust ellipse for lifetime and CM reaction control system deorbit.
On ninth day astronauts showed viewers exceptionally sharp pictures of main control panels in fifth TV broadcast and performed close-order drill to demonstrate movement in weightless environment. Sixth SPS burn, essentially duplicate of fourth minimum impulse test burn, was successfully conducted. Seventh burn, on following day, adjusted time phasing for backup sm reaction-control-system deorbit burns. At 259:39 get astronauts fired sps engine for eighth time, to deorbit csm for reentry, cm/sm separation, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal, and spacecraft splashed down in Atlantic eight miles north of recovery ship U.S.S. Essex at 7:11 am edt Oct. 22 after completing 163 revolutions. Crew was picked up by helicopter and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown.
All primary Apollo 7 mission objectives were achieved, as well as every detailed test objective and three not originally planned. Crew comfort and safety were enhanced by change in cabin atmosphere to 100% oxygen in flight, hot meals, and relatively complete freedom of motion in spacecraft. Engineering accomplishments included live TV from space and drinking water produced as by-product of fuel cells. NASA’s Ats III applications technology satellite relayed TV pictures to Europe.

manned SPS burns, and largest number of inflight restarts. Manual tracking, navigation, and control achievements included full optical rendezvous, daylight platform realignment, optical platform alignments, pilot control of launch vehicle attitude, and orbital determination by sextant tracking of another vehicle. Mission also accomplished first digital-autopilot.controlled engine burn and first manned S-band communications.
All launch vehicle systems performed satisfactorily; spacecraft systems functioned with some minor anomalies, countered by backup subsystem, change in procedures, isolation, or careful monitoring so that no loss of systems support resulted.
Apollo 7 spacecraft had been redesigned for safety. Original two-piece side hatch had been replaced by a quick-opening, one-piece hatch. Flammability within cm had been reduced by extensive materials substitution, and systems redundancy had been expanded to reduce single failure points. Saturn IB launch vehicle carried less telemetry and instrumentation equipment, to lower weight and increase payload capability. New propellant lines to augmented spark igniter had been installed in J—2 engine to prevent failure which had occurred on Apollo 6.
Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4), despite launch vehicle problems, had attained four of five primary objectives and had been recovered in excellent condition. Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; MSC was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, and KSC for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by GSFC under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; nasa Releases 68-^168K, 68—179; MSC Historical Off; W Post, 10/12—23/68; B Sun, 10/12/68; 10/23/68; W Star, 10/13-19/68; PD, 10/21/68,1492)
October 12: Washington Post editorial noted total cost of space program to date was upwards of $20 billion: “The expenditure of sums of money like these cannot be justified in terms of the military or civilian spinoff, although both have been substantial, or of the knowledge we have gained about the atmosphere surrounding our planet. But they can be justified in terms of the national prestige that is to be won or lost in space and of the inevitable fate of man to pursue knowledge towards its ultimate end in hope of some day achieving a better understanding of what the earth and universe are all about. It is in this latter hope that we cheer the astronauts on, wish them well in their planned 163 orbits of the earth, pray for their safe return, and urge those who make the crucial decisions about the future space program to proceed with all deliberate speed to reach the goal President Kennedy put before us.” (W Post, 10/12/68, A12)
• “nasa’s 10th anniversary was celebrated with appropriate fanfare, but the 11th anniversary of the Space Age, which came during the same week, slipped by with barely a nod of recognition,” James J. Haggerty, Jr., charged in Armed Forces Journal. “It should have been given more attention. The U.S. needs a continual reminder that we were dragged kicking and screaming into space exploration, that the U.S. space program was born only out of reaction to the accomplishments of another nation. . . .
“The summary for 11 years of space launchings shows a total of 881 launches through the Oct. 4 anniversary date. About 400 of all the spacecraft launched still are in orbit.
“The U.S. enjoyed a considerable quantitative lead at the end of the 11-year period. It sent into orbit 564 spacecraft, or 64% of the total, compared with 298 spacecraft, or 33%, for the USSR. . . .
“Manned flights, of course, were confined to the U.S. and the USSR. Through the anniversary date the U.S. had launched 14 flights involving 24 astronauts and 1,993 man-hours; the USSR had made nine flights with 12 cosmonauts piling up 532 man-hours.” (AFJ, 10/12/68, 13)
October 13: New observations from U.K.’s Jodrell Bank Experimental Station indicated distance estimates to pulsars had been 30 times too short. Observations from Australia’s Molonglo Radio Observatory had identified pulsar PSR 1749—28, believed to be three times more distant than 10 others observed to date. Despite great distance, its pulses were more powerful than those of all but one other. From these observa-

October 13—19: At 19th Congress of iaf in New York, Dr. Edward C. Welsh, nasc Executive Secretary, read message from Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Chairman of nasc: “We take considerable pride in the United States with the generally open nature of our space program and in the manner in which we have attempted to cooperate with other nations in space participation as well as in the dissemination of facts and theories gleaned from our space experience. . . . man has now begun to make the space far beyond the Earth’s surface a part of his library of education and his scope of achievement. Now more than ever before the way of the future must be the way of nations working together to harness the forces of nature so that the peaceful pursuits of mankind may flourish.”
Dr. Welsh said: “I would place high on the list of benefits those which flow from increased international cooperation in the field of space. . . . stimulated by the universal desire for knowledge [it] has brought somewhat closer together the peoples of the world. ... as the practical applications of space become more evident in the form of weather predictions, communications, and increased knowledge of the world’s limited natural resources, additional strength is added to the foundation for peace.” (Text)

•	Barron’s editorial criticized concentration of space funding on manned
lunar program rather than on military: “Congress in its wisdom already has curtailed funds for manned flights after the lunar landing— the so-called Apollo Applications Program—and it could usefully wield an even sharper axe. The money might far better go toward the military exploitation of space, which, for the past seven years, has suffered from dangerous neglect. Thus, out of the vast sums spent on space, at most one dollar in six has had a ^military bearing. In turn, with the possible exception of the Manned Orbital Laboratory . . . nearly every cent of the so-called military budget has gone for hardware with a passive or defensive aim, notably satellites for reconnaissance, communications, navigation and weather forecasting. In striking contrast, the Soviet Union has developed and tested ... a weapon aptly known as Scrag, which can hurl a guided missile carrying a nuclear payload of 15 megatons or more into a partial orbit (hence, fractional) round the earth. To anyone in his right mind, FOBS constitutes a gross violation of the outer space treaty, which prohibits the placing of nuclear warheads in orbit. However, according to the confused legal eagles in the State Department and Pentagon (if not to some future hapless populace which finds itself on ground zero), anything less than a full orbit goes. ... In the interest of survival, here is one balance the U.S must move swiftly to redress. . . . The first duty of government is to protect its people. Neither the Kennedy nor the Johnson Administration has honored that trust.” (Barron’s, 10/14/68, 15)

As long as the threat of nuclear war from any source continues, Russia and the United States will be producing ever more sophisticated orbital ‘spies in the skies’. . . . That is why the space program of the United States never is going to be abandoned. It will always be high on the list of spending priorities. The reason is not charming, but basic.

October 27: Lightweight plastic foam invented by ARC scientists Dr. John A. Parker and Salvatore Riccitiello showed promise for industrial fire protection, particularly fuel fires. Extremely light polyurethane with additives formed tough, protective char layer when exposed to flame, while simultaneously releasing fire-extinguishing gases which helped to quench flame. Used to fill airspaces within structures, foam would prevent oxygen from reaching and feeding a fire. Demonstrations had shown it suitable for fire protection in aircraft, spacecraft, homes, and other structures. Other possible uses included automobiles, boats, trains, oil refineries, paint and chemical processing, and laboratories. Foam was resistant to heat flow, making it an excellent insulator, (nasa Release 68-187)

alternative mission possibilities: earth-orbital mission deeper into space, circumlunar flyby, and lunar orbit.
Steps—laid out by Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, and Apollo Program Director, l/g Samuel C. Phillips—were: detailed analysis and review of Apollo 7 results to determine any necessary spacecraft changes; final certification of solutions to Apollo 6 problems; certification of strengthened Saturn V 2nd and 3rd stage fuel lines and elimination of pogo in 1st stage; completion of ground tests before Apollo 8 command and service module (csm) certification for lunar flight; completion of flight computer programs for deep space and lunar missions; rehearsal of CSM operations tests with mathematical models and delivery of Apollo 8 cm computer program; and completion of design certification reviews of launch vehicle and spacecraft subsystems.

But it is important because the United States of America must be first in technology if it is to continue its position in the world. I believe today, as I did when we had our original hearings that created the Space Administration, that the United States must be first.”

Another lesson is that in such major decisions, an independent, technologically competent judgment should be brought to bear on the issue. On the F—111, the President’s Science Advisory Council did not even look at the design features of the aircraft.

November 8: NASA’s Pioneer IX (Pioneer D), fourth in series of five spacecraft designed to provide continuing measurements over solar cycle at widely separated points in interplanetary space, was successfully launched from ETR by Thrust-Augmented Improved Thor-Delta (DSV-3E) booster into orbit around sun. Orbital parameters: aphelion, 0.99 astronomical unit (au), or 92.04 million mi (148.10 million km) ; perihelion, 0.75 au, or 69.71 million mi (112.19 million km); period, 297.55 days; and inclination 0.09°.
Test and Training Satellite Tetr II (tetr—b) carried pickaback on 2nd stage, was successfully ejected after 3rd-stage burnout and entered orbit around earth with 582.3-mi (937-km) apogee, 231.3-mi (373-km) perigee, 97.9-min period, and 32.8° inclination. S-band transponder was operating properly. Tetr 11 was follow-on Tetr 1 (formerly designated Tts 1; launched pickaback on Pioneer VIII Dec. 13, 1967), which was highly successful in testing Apollo communications network.
Primary mission objective of 147-lb, drum-shaped Pioneer IX was to collect scientific data on electromagnetic and plasma properties of interplanetary medium for period covering six or more passages of solar activity centers. As secondary mission, Pioneer IX would: (1) acquire data when highly significant solar event occurred; (2) refine primary 'determinations of earth and moon masses, the astronomical unit, and osculating elements of earth’s orbit; (3) provide synoptic study of solar-interplanetary relations; and (4) provide target for checkout of Manned Space Flight Network equipment and training of operations personnel by launching Test and Training Satellite as secondary payload. Pioneer IX separation, boom deployment, and first solar orientation occurred as planned and all eight experiments were operating properly and returning good data.
Pioneer VI (launched Dec. 16, 1965), Pioneer VII (launched Aug. 17, 1966), and Pioneer VIII (launched Dec. 16, 1967) were all successful and were continuing to transmit excellent data.

Dr. Edward C. Welsh, nasc Executive Secretary, declared: “We must step up the rate at which we tap the vast potential of nuclear energy for the space activities of tomorrow. . . . if we do not make greater use of nuclear energy, we will neglect our mission of learning rapidly more and more about the solar system in which we live and about the planet where we reside. In the field of propulsion, chemical rockets, both liquid and solid, can be vastly improved when combined with the products of nuclear technology.” Combining nuclear stage with Saturn V “will greatly increase that rocket’s power of achievement. . . . Not only will we have the vast power of the atom at our command, but it will be compact, self-contained, long lived, highly maneuverable, and virtually independent of its surrounding environment. . . . Atomic energy will enable the space effort to reach for the infinite.” (Text)

Beggs discussed “Research and Technology for the Future”: “The difference between success and failure of [nasa] missions . . . lies in our knowledge of the flight sciences and our skill for applying this knowledge to the development and operation of space vehicles. ... A natural characteristic of technology is its multiapplicability; an improvement in guidance or communication equipment, for example, may find many uses in space missions as well as non-aerospace applica-
tions. A key to making this process productive ... is a continuing research program . . . that has a good balance between the effort in the scientific and engineering disciplines and in the technologies needed to explore the unknown.” (Text)

Program of Research: 1968—1975, report of NASA-supported study by 31 scientists at Woods Hole, Mass., Aug. 11—24. Report, dated October and fourth by Board to provide guidance for NASA’s programs in space physics, said results of decade of research by artificial satellites were “revolutionary; few of the concepts of the early 1950’s have survived without major revision and totally unexpected discoveries have provided fundamentally new theoretical challenges.” And “results of today’s space research on the physics of the Earth in space become the engineering design data of tomorrow’s civilian and defense applications programs.”
Report defined program of satellite, space-probe, and sounding rocket missions for concerted attack on questions of fundamental physical mechanisms of sun-earth system, in contrast to past decade’s exploratory surveys. It emphasized coordinated investigations, new experimental techniques, and major observation effort during 1974—1975 low solar activity. Recommendations included continued NASA support for balloon, aircraft, and ground-based observations and of advanced development of spacecraft instruments; better means of data handling and adequate support for data analysis; and restoration of NASA program of predoctoral traineeship grants to 1966 level.

(launched June 14, 1967, for flyby of planet Venus) nor U.S.S.R.’s Venus IV (launched June 12, 1967) had reported atmospheric conditions near level of mean surface of planet. Von R.

Dyce of Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory (Puerto Rico) had made new determination of radius of planet, based on concurrent ranging from earth to Mariner V near encounter and to surface of Venus. Extrapolations of measurements had given surface values for mid-latitudes of close to 100 atmospheres pressure and 700°K temperature (within 100°), rather than Soviet values of 19±2 atmospheres and 544° ±10°K. Soviet probe apparently was not designed to work through such thick atmosphere.

• In New York Times Walter Sullivan described “The Sun-Spot Menace to Astronauts.” Apollo 7 and U.S.S.R.’s Soyuz III served as reminders that sunspots were reaching their 11-yr peak. If eruptions were particularly severe, protons were hurled out at almost speed of light. These could penetrate spacecraft. While Apollo 7 astronauts were never in danger, Soviet spacecraft placed in orbits reaching north beyond latitude 51° might “nudge zone” within which protons ejected by sun “rain fiercely on the atmosphere.” Major flare had occurred Oct. 30 just after Soyuz III returned to earth. If astronauts had been in orbit —particularly if they had been outside spacecraft—they could have been subjected to hazardous radiation. Many warnings preceded this event. For moon journey it should be possible to postpone or cut short flight if sun looked ominous. In any miscalculation, radiation exposure to astronauts inside spacecraft would be severe only during most intense outbursts. However, on prolonged journeys to other planets there would be no escape. “It may therefore be necessary to design the spacecraft so that a portion of its interior will be shielded from such radiation.” (NYT, 11/10/68, 7E)
November 10—17: Zond VI automatic space station was successfully launched by U.S.S.R. and placed on lunar trajectory from parking orbit of another satellite to explore outer space and test spacecraft systems, Tass announced. All equipment was functioning normally. Speculation, later confirmed, was that spacecraft would attempt to circle moon on same route taken by Zond V Sept. 15—21. On Nov. 14 Tass announced that Zond VI had circled moon at minimum distance of 2,420 km (1,503.8 mi) and had conducted studies of physical characteristics of near lunar space before continuing its journey back to earth.
Zond VI reentered and softlanded in a predetermined area in Central Asia Nov. 17. Unlike Zond V, which had plunged directly through upper atmosphere, Zond VI skipped across outer layers of atmosphere to reduce its reentry speed and then resumed its descent with aerodynamic forces. Announcing recovery, Tass said Zond VI had for first time tested a “more complex and promising method of the return of spacecraft from interplanetary trajectories—the method of controlled descent with the use of aerodynamical lifting force (aerodynamical quality) of the descending craft. . . .
“The braking of the descending apparatus in the atmosphere . . . was effected along a trajectory with two immersions in the atmosphere. During the first immersion . . . the second cosmic speed ... [11 km per sec, 24,607 mph] was reduced to 7.6 kilometers a second (17,000 mph) through aerodynamical braking. In doing so, the descending apparatus . . . was oriented through the onboard control system in such a way that it, passing through the dense layers of the atmosphere, left them and next continued along the ballistic trajectory until the second immersion . . . [in which] the further lowering of the descending apparatus was also effected along the trajectory of controlled descent with the use of aerodynamical qualities which ensured its return to the Earth in the pre-set district.”
Zond VI was sixth spacecraft in Zond series [see Sept. 15—21]. (AP,

Anders—would be launched from etr Dec. 21 on open-ended lunar orbital mission of at least six days. Spacecraft would circle moon 10 times at 70-mi altitude before returning to earth. Dr. Paine explained: “After a careful and thorough examination of all of the systems and risks involved, we have concluded that we are now ready to fly the most advanced mission for our Apollo 8 launch in December, the orbit around the moon.. . .
“We have reached this conclusion after a long series of intensive investigations of the status of our program, the flight hardware, ground support equipment, status of our training.”
l/g Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Director, cited two categories of new risks with a lunar orbital mission: “In the one . . . the spacecraft propulsion system must operate properly in order to propel the spacecraft back out of lunar orbit and on its way back to earth. And the other category of risks are those that are inherent in being some three days away from the earth as opposed to . . . between a half an hour and three hours which the crew is away from the earth in a low earth orbital mission.” Although increased reliance would have to be placed on dependability of life support and electric power systems and mission would have to take on additional risks, Gen. Phillips said, “The progression of risk between the Apollo 7 mission which we have flown and the Apollo 8 mission which we have designed is a normal progression of risks in a logically stepped development, flight test program.” (Transcript; NASA Release 68—199; Schmeck, NYT, 11/13/68, 1; O’Toole, W Post, 11/13/68, 1; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 11/13/68, 1) Engineer Michael O’Hagan, manager of space and military systems in government contracts dept, of U.K.’s Standard Telephone & Cables Co., told Conservative Party seminar in London U.S. was “actually buying land with mineral rights” in other countries after using satellites to discover its location.

•	nasa released plans for lunar landing experiments. First LJ.S. astronauts
to land on moon in 1969 would place three scientific experiments on lunar surface instead of more complex Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (alsep) originally planned. Change was necessitated by uncertainties in workload required to deploy ALSEP by astronauts in pressurized suits on moon’s surface. Mission’s primary objective would be to prove Apollo system by achieving successful moon landing and safe return to earth. During first landing, two astronauts would leave spacecraft for up to three hours on moon’s surface, making observations and photographing area in vicinity of landed spacecraft, collecting soil and rock samples, and deploying experiments.
Scientific and medical data would be obtained on expenditure of astronauts’ energy, monitoring ability to perform in vacuum, extreme temperature, and 1/6 gravity for planning of longer, more complex missions. Experiments were (1) passive seismometer (self-contained 100-lb
seismic station with earth-moon communications link, designed to last up to one year), (2) 70-lb laser ranging retro-reflector, and (3) 1-Ib solar-wind-composition experiment. They would provide data on internal activity of moon; would provide data to improve measurement of earth-moon distance, fluctuation of earth’s rotation rate, and variations in gravitational constant G, as well as to test theory of intercontinental drift by direct measurements from different continents; and would entrap noble gases (helium, neon, krypton, xenon) from solar wind for analysis.

•	Dr. R. G. Mclver, head of aeromedical research at Holloman afb, N.
Mex., said tests on chimpanzees had shown astronaut experiencing sudden decompression outside spacecraft might live at least three minutes in total vacuum, giving his companions time to get him inside pressur-
ized cabin. Survival of astronauts in ruptured space cabin would depend on presence of one man wearing space suit and thus able to place other crewmen in suits after they lost consciousness. Earlier, scientists had predicted sudden death for astronauts experiencing space vacuum decompression. Revised estimates of life expectancy were based on simulated space capsule experiments with 150 chimpanzees. (AP, B Sun, 11/16/68, A4)
•	Science editorial on NASA administration: “In terms of numbers of dol-
lars or of men, NASA has not been our largest national undertaking, but in terms of complexity, rate of growth, and technological sophistication it has been unique. . . . Keeping all of [its] parts—often working right at the edge of technological knowledge and capacity—finely tuned and in close harmony has been an organization achievement of high order. . . . Ever since the space program began to take shape there has been talk of technological spin-offs. It may turn out that the most valuable spin-off of all will be human rather than technological: better knowledge of how to plan, coordinate, and monitor the multitudinous and varied activities of the organizations required to accomplish great social undertakings.” (Wolfle, Science, 11/15/68, 753)

•	Apollo 8 prime crew—Astronauts Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr.,
and William A. Anders—held press conference at MSC on Apollo 8 flight plan. Commander Borman explained that an important feature of mission’s flight plan was establishment in advance of decision points when crew could decide whether to continue mission as planned or return to	earth: “. . . the	first one	[decision	point]	will be
whether	we commit to	translunar	injection	[from	parking
orbit] or not. . . . But even if we do commit ... we have regular abort times along the course to the moon, so that we could—in case of a system problem . . . stop at any time and come back. Then we finally reach a point where it would be swifter to just go on around the moon than it would be to try to abort. The next great point is before we burn lunar orbit injection.” Once in lunar orbit crew would receive abort data regularly and have option to return to earth every two hours. “The mission, if all works well, will be a relatively simple one,” Borman said. “. . . we designed Apollo, we said we were going to the moon, and . . . finally when we get down to examining the details and saying we are really going, people start getting a little queasy about it. But I have no hesitancy about the hardware.” (Transcript; O’Toole, W Post, 11/17/68, A8)

November 18—19: Conference on Pavement Grooving and Traction Studies was held at LaRC on results of nasa research program into hydroplaning and effectiveness of runway and highway grooving in minimizing accidents on wet pavement. Among papers presented, joint NASA-British Ministry of Technology study of tests at Wallops Station showed 1- by by inch grooving “at least doubled the friction coefficient” of aircraft runway surfaces. Studies by LaRC, California Div. of Highways, and other state highway departments showed grooving of highway pavement was effective in preventing wet-weather accidents. (NASA SP—5073)
Air Transport Assn, of America reported that 15- to 19-mo use at three major airports had convinced airlines that runway surface grooving was “an effective aid in overcoming hydroplaning” during wet landings. Airline operation evaluation had “dispelled earlier fears that grooving might damage runways or aircraft.” (Text; NYT, 11/24/68, 84)
November 18—21: During Geneva conference of iaf on Basic Environmental Problems of Man in Space, Dr. Boris B. Yegorov, only physician to travel in space (launched in U.S.S.R.’s Voskhod I Oct. 12, 1964), told press conference he believed planetary flights would be achieved by 1987. U.S.S.R. was experimenting with 8- to 10-volt electrical shocks administered to improve circulation and stimulate muscles of cosmonauts to enable them to endure strain of returning to earth after prolonged period in confined space capsule. He claimed problem of weightlessness was same for short or long flights and urged immediate planning-for flights to galaxies outside solar system.
Dr. Walton W. Jones, nasa Director of Biotechnology and Human Research, told conference U.S. could keep astronauts in earth orbit a year within 10 yr if U.S. would allocate sufficient resources to project. arc experiments had shown rats subjected to gravitational pull 4.7 times above normal had increased life expectancy. He said after meet-
ing that NASA planned experiments with rats at zero gravitation to determine if aging process was suspended while mem was free from gravitational pull.
Dr. J. F. Kubis of Fordham Univ. emphasized importance of psychological factors in selecting space crews. On long flight, “lack of privacy, crowding, and continuous exposure to interaction will become sources of aggravating stress.” He recommended no more than one in crew with dominant personality.
Soviet scientist Dr. N. N. Gurovsky said condition of two dogs after 22-day orbital flight (in Cosmos CX Feb. 22—March 16, 1966) had aroused forebodings on effect of year-long flights on astronauts. Loss of calcium in bones would make them prone to breaking. Both dogs had .developed liver and intestinal ailments including edemas. Human beings could expect same effects. Earlier reports had noted dogs suffered muscular reduction, dehydration, and confusion in adjusting to walking.

cost of C—5A, world’s largest aircraft. “At the beginning of this program over three years ago, the Air Force estimated that the cost of development and production of the first 58 airplanes would be $2.3 billion. The corresponding estimate for the 120 airplanes ultimately contemplated was $3.1 billion. Current estimates, including economic escalation and all other factors, are $3.25 billion and $4.3 billion, indicating increases of 41% and 39% respectively.” Additional costs had resulted from increased labor and materials costs due to Vietnam war and “unprecedented demand for civilian aircraft,” introduction of new technology, and modifications to overcome technical difficulties.

•	NASA Acting Administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine in speech before aia
Fall Conference in Phoenix, Ariz., said, “Today the United States stand at the crossroads.” In FY 1969 nasa was operating close to “breakpoint” level. Below $4-billion budget level, NASA could no longer “hold together our hard-won capabilities and utilize them effectively in critical programs; some of them would have to be dropped entirely.” Budget above $4 billion would “not only allow us to . . . carry forward major programs, but might permit . . . modest investments aimed at reducing costs of future space activities.”
Pointing to “long-term results of the tremendous technological effort . . . mounted during World War II” and “still being exploited today,” Dr. Paine urged that as “we tackle grave social ills, we’ve got to continue to forge ahead in other areas.'We must worry about how we create new wealth as much as we do about how we better distribute today’s wealth. It would be an international tragedy if America were to turn back now from its forward thrust in space at the end of an astonishingly productive first decade.”
James M. Beggs, nasa Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, discussed three major aerospace needs: increased aeronautical research, low-cost boosters, and use of nuclear energy in space. In aircraft technology, NASA was “increasing . . . effort by increases in old and new aeronautical disciplines in v/sTOL technol-
ogy, and in noise reduction.” Pressing need for boosters as reliable as existing boosters but far more economical, “means a fresh approach to the entire concept of boosters and a critical examination of each step . . . from the drawing board to the end of the boost operation.” NASA was recommending that nerva engine development be continued with engine and stage ready for a mission as early as 1977.

We’ve reached the stage with automatic landings when it’s not necessary to risk human life to get information about the moon. Within a few years this information could be obtained by automatic, unmanned instruments.” Sir Bernard said he was full of admiration for project but added, there was “a dangerous element of deadline beating in it.”
NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, commented, “The purpose is not scientific but to take an important step in developing the capability of landing men on the moon.” In telephone interview from Huntsville, Ala., he said, “We are taking no undue risks.”
Apollo 8 crewman William A. Anders told news conference at KSC, “We are flying primarily an operational mission and we strongly feel that a manned platform in lunar orbit with the operational equipment we have can add significant bits and pieces to scientific knowledge. . . .

November 26: Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told National Space Club in Washington, D.C.,
unique conditions in space suggested use of orbiting space stations for certain manufacturing processes. “For instance, liquid floating in a weightless environment takes the shape of a perfect sphere. Thus, it is conceivable that metal ball bearings could be manufactured in space to tolerances impossible on earth, yet at a cost, including transportation, less than we can now achieve. Perfect bearings would reduce friction and noise levels to the vanishing point. Free-fall casting techniques could be utilized to cast large flawless optical blanks for telescopes and by proper combinations of spinning and electrostatic forces we should be able to shape the surface as well.”
Stable foams for mixtures of liquefied materials and gases, impossible to produce satisfactorily on earth, could be produced in weightlessness, resulting in “a steel foam almost as light as balsa wood with many of the properties of solid steel.” Composite materials like steel of different densities and properties and glass also could be produced.

•	NASA Deputy Administrator for Space Sciences and Applications Oran
W. Nicks described applications of Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter techniques to Mars exploration before aiaa meeting in Washington, D.C. Two 1971 Mariner Orbiter missions would provide new tools for survey of dynamic Mars, arriving when most striking seasonal changes were evident in Southern Hemisphere. Their combined orbits and life expectancies would allow observations of dynamic changes in clouds and surface features over several months. In 1973, two additional orbit-ers would survey Mars from different orbits during different seasons, with support of landing mission as prime requirement. Also planned for 1973 was survivable landing spacecraft to make local measurements of environment, photograph surface and topography, and analyze soil.
“Burning question of immediate concern to you and me will be addressed by use of our new tools,” Nicks said: “Is there life elsewhere? Has life existed on nearby planets and disappeared for any reason? Can nearby planets be made suitable for life?’ Together, orbiters and landers form a powerful team for the study of Mars and for seeking answers to these questions. Together, they will continue to extend our
\
capabilities in what is probably the most challenging, open-ended arena for expansion of science and technology in the decade ahead.” (Text)

•	nasa announced first successful orbital operation of two low-thrust space
engines during five separate tests in two-month lifetime of Ats IV spacecraft. Ion, or electrical engines, producing thrust of less than 20 micropounds, had been fired for total 23 hr and performed perfectly. Ion engines for future spacecraft were ideal systems for countering gravitational attraction between spacecraft, moon and sun, and elliptical equatorial section—to keep satellite stationary for conducting communications, meteorological, and navigational experiments. They had controllable thrust level and direction, higher fuel efficiency, and longer fuel life than Chemically propelled engines. Reservoir of 1/io lb cesium could keep synchronous satellite stationary for more than three years. Before test, propulsion experts had expected ion engine firings might create radio frequency interference. Test showed no interference. Two more ion engines were planned for testing aboard ATS—E, scheduled for August 1969 launch, (nasa Release 68-205)

December 7—10: NASA’s Oao II (oao—A2) Orbiting Astronomical Observatory was successfully launched from ETR by two-stage Atlas-Centaur booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 485.7 mi (781.6 km); perigee, 479.2 mi (771.2 km); period, 100.4 min; and inclination, 35°. Heaviest and most complex automated spacecraft ever developed by U.S., Oao II was 7 ft wide and 10 ft high, weighed 4,400 lb, carried 11 telescopes, and contained 238,000 separate parts.
Primary mission objective was to demonstrate flight operation to support two experiments provided by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Univ. of Wisconsin for at least 30 days. Secondary objective was to obtain scientific data over a range of star magnitudes and wavelengths for at least 50 hr. Experiments would observe interstellar dust and extremely young hot stars in UV portion of spectrum not visible to human eye or earth-based observatories. Satellite would be able to collect six hours of UV data per day—twice as much as had been obtained in 15 yr from 40 sounding rocket launches. Through its complex ground-command spacecraft-attitude system Oao II would be aimed at individual objects in space with precision never before attained by an orbiting satellite. Information from experiments would be radioed to earth as digital data for analysis by experimenters.
By Dec. 10 all spacecraft equipment bad been turned on and operated satisfactorily: satellite had been placed in its sunbathing mode with its solar panels oriented toward sun; its six star trackers had been activated; three of the trackers had been locked on to preplanned guide stars; and satellite had established three-axis stabilization. Smithsonian experiment initial power had been turned on. Wisconsin Experiment Package would be turned on Dec. 11.
Oao II was second in series of four spacecraft in NASA’s OAO program to obtain precise astronomical observations of celestial objects above earth’s atmosphere. Oao I had been launched into almost perfect orbit April 8, 1966, but had failed because of power supply system malfunction and probable high voltage arcing in star tracker. OAO program was managed by GSFC under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 68—186K; ksc Release KSC-68; upi, W Star, 12/8/68, A5; O’Toole, W Post, 12/8/68; AP, W Star, 12/9/68, A6; SBD, 12/10/68, 172; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 12/12/68, A5)

Nixon’s entourage had discussed creation of Cabinet post for science and technology. “The science adviser, in the view of the Nixon entourage, has been unable to streamline the machinery for making science policy. Science, and the problems relating to it, has outgrown its old boundaries. The big problems are interdisciplinary. Their solution requires expertise in many fields, and the cooperation of many departments of government. This has led to a proliferation of interdepartmental committees.” However, “because the creation of a Cabinet post would have major repercussions within the scientific establishment, it is unlikely that such a step will be taken until there has been an extensive study, lasting perhaps a year or more.” (ATT, 12/8/68, 3E)

Johnson presented Presidential Medal of Freedom, Nation’s highest civilian award, to retired NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, “a most distinguished public administrator, ... a farsighted and forceful leader of this Nation in the pioneer exploration of outer space, opening new frontiers of discovery and progress for the American people,” President told 23 Apollo astronauts, NASA officials, Government leaders in space program, and heads of rocket-building firms, “I asked you to come here tonight in the twilight of this administration, so I could pay the respect and the honor and the affection that I felt for the man who has directed your efforts and directed them so well, and so that I could express my personal admiration and respect for you.”
In response, Webb said, “The challenge of space is large and so is NASA. In all such human endeavors, organized institutional efforts are essential, and we know, in the words of Emerson, that they are ‘the lengthened shadow of one man.’ We in NASA know, Mr. President, that you are the man of which our civilian space effort, conducted for the benefit of mankind, is the lengthened shadow.”
At predinner ceremony, document for White House Treaty Room was signed by Apollo 7 astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Jr., R. Walter Cunningham, and Donn F. Eisele; Apollo 8 Astronauts William A. Anders, Frank Borman, and James A. Lovell, Jr.; and pioneer aviator Charles A. Lindbergh. Also in Treaty Room were commemorations of May 21, 1963, visit to White House by Astronaut L.

December 9-12: New York Times and Washington Evening Star published contents of unreleased draft report by Presidential task force appointed in 1967 to formulate national communications policy dealing with rapid technological changes and providing for adequate Government supervision. Report would recommend reorganization of U.S. communications industry to include Government-sponsored monopoly to transmit all international communications—including ComSatCorp satellites and ground stations; AT&T underseas cables; and terminals and switching stations of “record” carriers itt World Communications, Inc., RCA Communications, Inc., and Western Union International, Inc. If ComSatCorp became single international “entity,” committee’s recommendations would preclude it from becoming owner and manager of domestic satellite communications system for which the report would propose pilot program.
Committee claimed single entity could make more balanced investment choice on whether to lay more cables or launch satellites and would eliminate need for duplicate transmission facilities. Conclusions were challenged in dissenting footnote to report by Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of NASC, who said merger would inhibit de-
velopment of satellite technology and reduce technological competition between cables and satellites that could result in lower rates.
Report also would recommend informal merger of postal and telegraph services, with Western Union Telegraph Co. permitted to operate in post offices; relaxation of fcc restrictions on cable TV to protect broadcasters; and Government sponsorship of experimental program to test TV’s usefulness in assisting minority groups.

Scientist, to American Society of Mechanical Engineers and one by Chief XB—70 Pilot for fro, Fitzhugh L. Fulton, Jr., to Flight Safety Foundation—indicated NASA—USAF XB—70 test program was providing valuable information for operation of large supersonic commercial and military aircraft. Results from XB—70’s participation in national sonic boom research program had shown methods used to predict overpressure and extent of boom were generally adequate for aircraft of this size and speed under “standard day” conditions but indicated unusual weather conditions and other factors could affect these predictions. XB—70 program was attempting to define intensity of turbulence at higher altitudes. System to improve stability, lessen turbulence-induced accelerations, and improve passenger riding qualities while lengthening aircraft’s fatigue life was being tested.
New methods of presenting flight and engine information to pilot had evolved from XB—70 program, including digital form for more precise readout. Special warning systems prevented exceeding operating limits and attitude indicator with changeable sensitivity for smoother flight control had been evaluated. XB—70 flight had demonstrated need for further research in basic stability and control characteristics of its class of aircraft. Actual cross-country flight experience had been gained with trip from Edwards afb, Calif., to Carswell afb, Tex., and return. Both reports emphasized that, although XB—70 was not passenger aircraft, it was similar in size and performance characteristics to proposed sSTs and was only operational aircraft approaching SST size and speed, (fro Release 28-68)

December 17: In interview published in New York Times, Dr. Lee A. Du-Bridge, science adviser-designate to President-elect Richard M. Nixon, said problem facing Government was not “Shall Government support and use science and technology, but how shall it do it. What are the priorities. . . .” Fundamental to use of science was knowledge; therefore, “one must have in any modern society a very important and extensive free basic research enterprise establishment, largely in universities, so that new areas of knowledge will be explored.” Basic research budget of country should increase at least 10% annually for next few years. When it came to using this knowledge, “the Government can, and somebody must, direct, set up the goals.”
On space program, Dr. DuBridge said that “the astonishing discoveries” made by launching instruments into space justified further exploration from scientific point of view. When man entered picture as “another piece of the instrumentation that is needed for the exploration,” first effect “is that the costs get large. . . . Apollo landing of a man on the moon is vastly more expensive . . . than the Surveyor landing. ... By the same token, the information returned will be much greater, too. However, as the technology of the spacecraft improves, and our instruments need to get more complex, heavier, or longer lasting, there may very well be a time when putting a man up will actually be cheaper than trying to use automated instruments.” (Sullivan, NYT, 12/17/68, 1).	_

“Apollo 8 has 5,600,000 parts and one and a half million systems, subsystems and assemblies. Even if all functioned with 99.9 per cent reliability, we could expect 5,600 defects. Hence, the striving for perfection and the use of redundancy.” (Text; NYT, 12/19/68, 56)
•	Aerospace sales reached record high of $30.1 billion in 1968, an increase
of almost $3 billion over 1967, Aerospace Industries Assn. President Karl G. Harr, Jr., told Washington, D.C., meeting of Aviation/Space Writers Assn. Commercial aerospace sales increased 39%, to record $6.4 billion; aerospace exports rose 32%, to $3 billion.
Military space programs in 1968 rose 3%, from $1,088 billion in 1967 to $1,121 billion, reported AlA’s “1968 Aerospace Industry Review and Forecast,” which Harr released. N'onmilitary space sales declined 3.7%, from $4,202 billion in 1967 to $4,047 billion in 1968. Sales of products and services for use of aerospace technology in nonaerospace areas—such as marine science, water desalination, crime control, and rapid transit—increased from $2,579 billion to $2,726 billion.
Harr predicted slight decline in total aerospace sales to about $29.6 billion during 1969 because of 25% drop in jet transport sales before
deliveries of new high-capacity aircraft; continuing increase in helicopter, executive, and utility aircraft sales; modest increase in defense and nonaerospace sales; and decline in civil space sales. He noted that in third quarter of 1968 backlog of Government aerospace orders was less than that of other customers for first time since before World War II.

In nasa—usaf—usn program initiated in 1954, flights by three X—15 aircraft manufactured by North American Rockwell Corp. had included more than 82 min of flight at speeds exceeding mach 5 and total flight time of more than 30 hr. Peak altitude reached was 354,200 ft (67.04 mi) and top speed was 4,520 mph (mach 6.7)-—speeds and altitudes never before attained by any vehicle fully controlled by pilot from launch to landing. It had set two official world altitude records of 246,740 ft and 314,750 ft previously. X—15 flight program provided knowledge applicable to design and development of future spacecraft and commercial supersonic aircraft and data on aerodynamic heating in high-speed flight, which could cause deterioration of aircraft structural integrity. X—15 remained only aircraft capable of studying phenomena at hypersonic speeds, space-equivalent flight, and reentry flight.	“

December 21—27: NASA’s Apollo 8 (AS—503), second manned mission in Apollo lunar landing program and first manned mission to orbit moon, was successfully launched from ksc Launch Complex 39 at 7:51 am est by Saturn V booster. Primary objectives were to demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support performance during manned Saturn V mission with command and service module (csm) and to demonstrate performance of nominal and selected backup lunar orbit rendezvous (lor) mission activities—including translunar injection; CSM navigation, communications, and midcourse corrections; and CSM consumables assessment and passive thermal control. All launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft—carrying Astronauts Frank Borman (commander), James A. Lovell, Jr. (cm pilot), and Wiliam A. Anders (lm pilot)—entered initial orbit with 118.4-mi (190.6-km) apogee, 113.8-mi (183.2-km) perigee, 32.51° inclination, and 88.2-min period.
At 10:42 am est 3rd stage burned for second time, injecting spacecraft into lunar trajectory, and astronauts began journey to become first men to leave earth’s gravitational field. Stage and instrument unit separated as planned and service module propulsion system was fired to increase separation distance from 3rd stage, which was trailing 500—1,000 ft behind spacecraft, spewing unused propellants. Crew fired service propulsion system (sps) engine for 2.4 sec, correcting trajectory and increasing velocity by 25 fps.
Second midcourse maneuver, scheduled for second day, was canceled because trajectory was already so accurate that burn would have required velocity change of only 0.7 fps. Borman reported illness, apparently from 24-hr intestinal virus or from reaction to sleeping pills being used during space flight for first time, and Lovell and Anders reported nausea. Crew took navigation sightings and conducted first TV transmission, showing spacecraft interior and earth from 138,690-mi altitude and demonstrating food preparation and movements in weightlessness. Signals were received at ground stations and transmitted to NASA Mission Control Center in Houston before release live to commercial networks.
Second TV transmission, on third day, showed excellent pictures of earth from 201,365-mi altitude, including view of Western Hemisphere in sunlight. Crew pointed out North Pole, South America, Cape
Horn, and Baja California and noted that U.S. East Coast was very cloudy. Earth, they said, was beautiful; water looked royal blue, land areas brown, and clouds bright white. Reflection off earth was much greater than off moon, sm reaction control system’s four rockets were fired for 12 sec to reduce velocity by 2 fps and to make approach to moon closer to 60 mi at nearest point.
On fourth day, Christmas Eve, communications were interrupted as Apollo 8 passed behind moon and astronauts became first men to see moon’s far side, sps engine was fired for 4 min 2 sec, reducing speed by 2,994 fps and placing spacecraft in lunar orbit with 193.6-mi (310.6-km) apolune and 69.1-mi (111.2-km) perilune. In third telecast Anders described lunar surface as “whitish gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints on it. Some of these craters look like pick-axes striking concrete, creating a lot of fine dust.” After spacecraft passed behind moon at end of second revolution, SPS engine burned for 10 sec to reduce speed by 135 fps and to circularize orbit with 70.0-mi (112.6-km) apolune and 69.6-mi (112.0-km) perilune. Lovell said astronauts had “a grand view” of the lunar surface and confirmed that prospective landing sites were satisfactory. He reported that at about two minutes before sunrise a fan-shaped white haze appeared just behind moon’s limb. Crew continued landmark sightings and named numerous unnamed lunar features after other astronauts, NASA officials, and friends. They conducted communications experiment which showed that radio signal from earth to Apollo 8 and back to earth took three seconds to make 460,000-mi round trip.
Third TV transmission during ninth revolution showed heavily impacted mountains described by Anders as “a vastness of black and white, absolutely no color. The sky up here is also rather forbidding, foreboding extents of blackness with no stars visible when we’re flying over the moon in daylight. You can see by the numerous craters that this planet has been bombarded through the eons with numerous small asteroids and meteoroids, pock-marking the surface of every square inch. And one of the amazing features of the surface is . . . that most of the craters . . . have a round mound type of appearance instead of sharp jagged rocks. All, only the newest of features have any sharp definitions to them, and eventually they get eroded down by the constant bombardment of small meteoroids.” The moon is “a very dark and unappetizing place. . . .”
Crew read verses from first chapter of Genesis and wished viewers “good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you—all of you on the good earth.”
On fifth day, Christmas Day, while spacecraft was behind moon completing its 10th revolution, SPS engine was fired for 3 min 23 sec, increasing spacecraft velocity by 3,523 fps and propelling Apollo 8 back toward earth. Spacecraft left lunar gravity at 201,807 mi above earth. At 104 hours mission elapsed time 14-sec reaction-control-system burn increased velocity by 5 fps. Fifth TV transmission showed spacecraft interior, controls, and food preparation. Data analysis revealed sixth midcourse correction would not be necessary because of accuracy of course. Astronauts reported they had slept well and were in “very good shape.” Sixth TV transmission showed earth from 112,125-mi altitude.
December 21—27: rasa's Apollo 8 carried Astronauts fames A. Lovell, Jr., William A. Anders, and Frank Borman (left to right above) out of earth’s field of gravity and into man’s first orbit of moon. In photo at right, Saturn V lifts off from ksc launch complex 39 to put command and service module into initial orbit.
On sixth day crew prepared for reentry and SM separated from cm on schedule. Parachute deployment and other reentry events were nominal and Apollo 8 splashed, apex down, in Pacific about 5,100 yd from recovery ship U.S.S. Yorktown at 10:51 am est Dec. 27, 147 hr after launch and precisely on time. According to prior planning, helicopters and aircraft hovered over spacecraft and pararescue personnnel were not deployed until local sunrise, 50 min after splashdown. Crew was then picked up and reached recovery ship at 12:20 pm EST.
All primary ApoUo 8 mission objectives and detailed test objectives were achieved and, in addition, five not originally planned. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan. Engineering accomplishments included use of ground network with onboard navigational techniques to sharpen accuracy of lunar orbit determination
and successful use of Apollo high-gain antenna, four-dish unified S-band antenna that deployed from SM after separation from 3rd stage. Mission proved capability of Apollo csm and crew, as well as ground support and control systems, to operate out to lunar distances and return through the earth’s atmosphere at lunar velocity.
Apollo 8 was fifth Apollo mission to date, second manned Apollo mission, first manned mission on Saturn V launch vehicle, and first manned operation of Apollo system under conditions for which it was designed. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware.

There is no need here for wasteful rivalry deriving from earthbound nationalistic and political ambitions. In the face of the most breathtaking challenge humanity has ever faced, the only rational response is cooperation to make space an arena of unity and international brotherhood.

Purpose of experiment was to test man’s ability to live in isolation for year, using water and oxygen regenerated from waste products and dehydrated food supplemented by greenhouse-grown vegetables; study effects of various factors on human organism and establish optimum conditions for long isolation; and evaluate effectiveness of self-contained life-support systems based on regeneration of waste products. Daily requirements of astronauts on long voyage included 700 g of food, 2.4 kg of drinking water plus 5.5 kg of water for other purposes, and 800 g of oxygen, amounting to 11 tons of supplies for one-year space voyage. Report said there were no significant changes in body weight and temperature of experimenters except one lost eight to nine pounds before his weight stabilized in five to six months. Electrocardiogram remained unchanged and no dehydration was observed. Pulse and respiration rates had fluctuated before assuming lower level than at start of experiment. Researchers Gherman A. Manovtsev, Andrey N. Bozhko, and Boris N. Ulybshev were reported in good health at conclusion of experiment. (Shabad, NYT, 12/25/68, 38)

•	Washington Post said of Apollo 8: “Above all, perhaps, this Christmas
Eve at the moon and Christmas Day on the way home have told us more about our earth than about the moon. One of the astronauts had wondered on his way to the moon whether, if he were a traveller from another planet, he would think that intelligent life existed on Earth. The answer, from Captain Lovell at least, is that our planet is ‘a grand oasis in the great vastness of space.’ That is an awing insight and it reminds us that man has far to go here at home to fulfill the Christmas
promise of Peace on Earth, Good Will toward Men.” (W Post, 12/26/68, A20)

•	In Washington Post, columnist Joseph Kraft said post-Apollo programs
had been sharply cut in Congress and space spending had been compared unfavorably with money for pressing internal needs. “In this situation, it makes sense for this country to disengage while it is ahead. There is no need for the United States to race Russia to every new milestone in space. On the contrary, what the United States wants is a program closely connected to explicit American requirements—a program of exploration for its own sake, not for the sake of beating the Russians. In that way, this country can continue to develop a capability in space, without having to respond in a panic to the ups and downs that are necessary part of the space business.” (W Post, 12/26/68)
December 26—31: During 135th meeting of aaas in Dallas, Tex., Catholic Univ. of America assistant professor of international relations John M. Logsdon gave paper on lunar landing decision at session of Society for the History of Technology. Prof. Logsdon said President Eisenhower had planned to end manned space flights after Project Mercury but his successor, President Kennedy, had “calculated the costs, weighed the needs, and finally decided that ‘whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.’ ”
Outgoing Presidential Science Adviser, Dr. Donald F. Hornig, recommended reexamination of concept of Federal Dept, of Science since science “has now assumed such importance to the nation that its position would be stronger if it had a voice in the Cabinet.” He advocated annual report on state of science similar to annual economic report and said Office of Science and Technology “could eventually evolve in an office of planning and analysis, looking broadly at national problems with some scientific or technological component, but extending well beyond the purely technical areas.” Under questioning, Dr. Hornig said he agreed with Dr. J. Herbert Hollomon, President of Univ. of Oklahoma and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce, that Federal Dept, of Science, with NSF as its core, might encompass oceanographic agencies, high-energy-physics research currently funded by AEC, ESSA, Bureaus of Census and Labor Statistics, geophysics branches of Geological Survey, and some NIH programs. Dr. Hollomon also suggested NASA be added when it could be included “without having it become the tail that wags the dog.” Dr. Hornig insisted no massive “science agency” should be created to usurp supervision of Nation’s science effort.
Bacteria might have caused gastrointestinal upset suffered by astronaut Frank Borman on Apollo 8 mission, Dr. Rudolf H. T. Mattoni, head of Biological Systems Div. of Nuclear Utility Services, Hawthorne, Calif., told meeting. Effects of weightlessness on bacteria on Biosatellite II flight (Sept. 7—9, 1967) suggested that lack of gravity might have allowed common, normally benign, intestinal bacteria to cause illness like Borman’s.
Drs. Bouilin Browning of St. Thomas Univ. and Irwin Oster of Bowling Green State Univ. reported first experimental evidence that
weightlessness can cause chromosomal damage of genetic significance, based on sperm cells flown 45 hr aboard Biosatellite.
Cornell Univ. map expert, Prof. Arthur J. McNair, said sophisticated photographic mapping by satellites at 140-mi altitude would provide faster, cheaper, broader, and more detailed coverage than now possible by airplane mapping. Single map-making satellite photo, he said, would be equivalent to 1,000 photos taken by aircraft. U.S. could be fully mapped in one year from photos from satellite in near-polar orbit for four weeks. Another 11 mo would be needed for data processing.
Dr. Robert H. Hardie of Vanderbilt Univ. said planet Pluto had appeared to be dimming for past 10 yr. It was moving in 248-yr orbital period to point where it reflected little sunlight and its surface temperature had dropped two degrees. He speculated that planet froze into mass of stone and solid nitrogen as temperatures reached —250° C when facing away from the sun. When bathed in sunlight, planet warmed to —200° C and formed reflecting puddles which astronomers saw as variations in light intensity. (Text; UPl, W Post, 12/28/68, A9; Lannan, W Star, 12/30/68, A3; AP, W Post, 12/30/68, A6) December 27: At White House press conference President Johnson discussed Apollo 8’s effect on U.S. position in space race: “We are very pleased with the progress we have made. . . . Each side has different examples of its achievements. But in the 10 to 11 years since Sputnik I . . . when we didn’t even have a space committee in the Congress, when we were talking about the basketball up there in the air, when we have weathered the storms that have brewed—everyone who wanted to cut anything, the first thing they wanted to cut was the space program —when we have seen the editorial professors inform us that there was really no value in doing all of this anyway, it gives me great pleasure now to see the thrill that even they are getting out of it.”
President described anxiety about complex mission and said he had repeatedly asked himself whether U.S. was ready, whether date selected was best one, whether every possible precaution had been taken, and whether every man had performed his requirements. “About all you can do ... is to pick men that you have confidence in, that you trust, give them the support they need, and then hold on.” Remembering he had “recommended this goal for this decade” to President Kennedy, he said: “There have been many pitfalls every step of the way. I don’t know how many folks have just wanted to abandon it, clip it, cut it, take the money for the cities or the war or just anything else. Space has been a whipping boy.
“So when you see the day approaching when visions, and dreams, and what we said to the Congress when we created the Space Administration back in 1958 are becoming reality, you naturally are hopeful.”
Later, in telephone message to Apollo 8 astronauts, President congratulated crew and said: “You have made us very proud to be alive at this particular moment in history. You have made us feel akin to those Europeans nearly five centuries ago who heard stories of the New World for the first time. . . . My thoughts this morning went back to more than 10 years ago . . . when we saw Sputnik racing through the skies, and we realized that America had a big job ahead of it.
“It gave me so much pleasure to know that you men have done a large part of that job.” {PD, 12/30/68, 1744-50)

In statement distributed by Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., Boris Petrov, Chairman of Council for International Cooperation in Investigation and Utilization of Outer Space, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, hailed “hardware” and “courage” of Apollo 8 astronauts but called attention to “considerable accent” placed on “automatic devices” in Soviet space program. He said, “The Soviet Union is engaged in a large-scale program of planned studies and exploration of outer space, which provides for the investigation of the earth’s upper atmosphere and of near-earth outer space and studies of sun-earth relationships and of our closest space neighbors—the moon, venus and mars, and later, on more remote planets.”
Cuban National Radio called mission “a total success.”
Toss: “Due tribute should be paid to the courage and mastery of Frank Borman, William Anders and James Lovell who have accomplished this outstanding scientific and technical experiment. The successful flight of Apollo 8 ushers in a new stage in the history of space exploration.” Ten Soviet cosmonauts telegraphed Apollo crew congratulations for “another milestone in scientific and technical progress.”
Pope Paul VI, in message to President Johnson: “Giving thanks to God for the successful completion of the magnificent enterprise of the Apollo 8 mission, we congratulate you and the people of the United States of America and particularly the intrepid space travelers, and invoke divine blessing upon all contributing to this noble achievement.” U.N. Secretary General U Thant: “The powerful thrust of the rocket engines, the awesome speeds attained in flight, the vast distances traveled, the precision of navigation and the fidelity of communications, aural and visual, all stagger the imagination and defy the comprehension of man.”

• San Francisco Chronicle said: “In their meteoric flitting about the skies the crew of the Apollo 8 did more than thrill their fellow Americans and pump up the national ego. They drew commendations from directors of the Soviet space project whose considerable achievement they had outstripped.” They made believers of “informed skeptics such as Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Britain’s Jodrell Bank Observatory, who had more than ever scoffed at the value of the moon venture.

at Univ. of Michigan to determine temperatures of earth’s upper atmosphere. Since 1962, concentration and temperature of molecular nitrogen in upper atmosphere had been measured in 22 successful flights under varying conditions of solar activity, from launch sites at Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Wallops Island, Va., and Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Scientists had concluded that upper atmosphere consisted of mixture of gases—electrons, ions, and neutral particles—each of which had distinct temperature. Multiplicity of temperatures could be expected in upper atmosphere of planets, though differences between planetary atmospheres must be more striking than similarities because of differences in atmospheric composition and in distance from sun. It was likely that absence of permanent magnetic field on either Mars or Venus caused further substantial differences between upper atmospheres of these planets and upper atmosphere of earth.

In New York City, there are at least 2,000 people who would rather have watched a football game and were sufficiently incensed to telephone the television networks and tell them so. The blame is not the astronauts’. A whole series of photographs, some taken from instruments actually on the moon’s surface, some in black-and-white, some in colour, had already warned them what to expect. The buck lies on the desks of the men who for the past 13 years have directed the United States’ $32 billion space programme, and spent 70% of it on getting men into space without planning anything constructive for them to do when they got there. . . . The cost of a manned moonshot is put at around $1 billion, and for that sum you could get a whole programme of unmanned moon launches. . . .

It was equipped with four Kuznetsov N.K.—144 turbofan engines. Tass said sonic boom “is almost not felt” on earth because Tu-144 reached maximum speed at high altitudes.
Later, New York Times editorial commented: “The long international debate about supersonic airliners is sure to be stepped up in the wake of the news that the Soviet entry, the TU—144, has made its first flight. Since it has not been claimed that this initial trial reached supersonic speeds, the likelihood is that the TU—144 was kept subsonic on its first outing. But Soviet airplane designers and builders have manufactured enough supersonic military planes to suggest that on a subsequent flight the TU—144 will fly faster than the speed of sound. ... In this country, the Soviet first will undoubtedly spur those who want to pour still more Government funds into the Boeing project to build an advanced supersonic plane that is faster and larger than the TU—144. Fortunately, this country’s technological prestige is now higher than ever in the wake of the Apollo 8 moon journey. That fact should help the incoming Nixon Administration to see that there are better uses for
the nation’s scarce resources than to engage in a supersonic plane race whose economics are dubious and whose product’s contribution to noise pollution is all too loud.” (Shabad, NYT, 1/1/69, 1; UPl, W Star, 1/1/69, A7; Winters, B Sun, 1/1/69, Al; NYT, 1/2/69, 30)

•	National Science Foundation released Federal Funds for Research,
Development, and Other Scientific Activities: Fiscal Years 1967, 1968, and 1969. Federal obligations for basic research, applied research, and development (plant excluded) totaled $16.5 billion in FY 1967 and were expected to total $16.2 billion in FY 1968, first drop since 1955. Obligations had been expected to total $17.3 billion in FY 1969, but, because of appropriations and apportionment actions, probably would be even less than in 1968.
Basic research obligations totaled $2.0 billion in FY 1967 and were expected to be $2.1 billion in 1968. Applied research obligations totaled $3.3 billion in FY 1967, with $3.3 billion estimated for 1968. Originally expected increases in FY 1969 obligations, to $2.4 billion for basic research and $3.6 billion for applied research, probably would not occur because of cutbacks in FY 1969 budget. Development obligations were $11.3 billion in 1967, highest ever reported, but were expected to drop to $10.8 billion in 1968. Originally expected rise to $11.3 billion in 1969 probably would not be achieved. In FY 1967, obligations for r&d plant totaled $620 million, with estimated $517 million for 1968 and $777 million for 1969. dod, nasa, and aec provided bulk of r&d funds, with 90% average share during 1960—66 and 85% during 1967—69. dod, NASA, and aec together supported 60% of Federal research total and more than 95% of development total in 1968.
During 1967—69, 80% of Federal R&D funds were scheduled for extramural performers, chiefly U.S. industrial firms. In 1968 they received 60%. (Text)

NASA Office of Space Science and Applications had participated in 1968 agency-wide planning to detail program objectives and options from which program could be built. Many tools required for future space program had already been developed and many future ventures would require only modest improvements. Spacecraft pointing accuracies and stability would improve, and their lifetimes would increase. More powerful transmitters would communicate data across ever-widening expanses. Spacecraft weight would increase and man would have increasing capability to work and navigate in space. Advances in chemical propulsion, introduction of nuclear and electric propulsion, and new combinations of existing stages, would permit growth of launch vehicle capability to meet mission demands.
FY 1969 support of program recognized need for austerity and provided for continuance of existing programs at economical level and initiation of only “projects of great merit, including those where a unique opportunity might be lost.” Future emphasis would be on applications of space and space technology for benefit of man: surveying earth’s resources, TV broadcast from space, and weather forecasting. Knowledge of Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and other outer planets would be expanded. Introduction of larger, more accurate telescopes would provide man perhaps with “his greatest step in understanding the nature of his universe.” (Text)
•	Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences issued Tenth An-
niversary, 1958—1968 to meet requests for information concerning its historical background, activities, jurisdiction and procedures, legislative record, membership, and staff assistance. Report contained National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended, related legislation—including NASA’s funding history—and Communications Satellite Act of 1962. (Text)
•	Global military expenditures ranked first in world public expenditures.
They had risen from $132 billion to 1964 to $138 billion in 1965, $159 billion in 1966, and estimated $182 billion in 1967—record high level. Preliminary data, said U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Report, World Military Expenditures 1966—67, said current military spending exceeded by 40% world’s expenditures on education by all levels of government and was more than three times worldwide public health expenditure.

During 1968: In 1968 U.S. orbited 64 spacecraft and U.S.S.R., 74. U.S. total included 43 launched by DOD. NASA’s 21 included satellite orbited as secondary payload.
Highlight of NASA’s 10th anniversary year was success in carefully planned series of Apollo missions—including first two manned flights in Apollo lunar landing program. Unmanned Apollo 5 and Apollo 6 completed inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. First manned mission, Apollo 7, carried three astronauts around earth for 11 days, verifying spacecraft operation before splashing down precisely on target. Mission included live TV transmission from space, largest
number of inflight restarts of sps to date, and new record of 781 manhours in space. Apollo program climaxed Dec. 21—27 with highly successful six-day Apollo 8 mission on which three-man crew demonstrated operation of spacecraft systems in lunar environment while world watched live TV coverage via satellite. Spacecraft orbited moon 10 times, providing man with his first trip out of earth’s gravitational field and first look at moon’s far side and proving capability of crew, spacecraft, and support and control systems to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth’s atmosphere at lunar-return velocity.
Unmanned Surveyor VII, NASA’s first launch in 1968 and last spacecraft in Surveyor series, softlanded on moon, conducted on-site analyses of lunar soil, and took part in laser-detection communications experiment.
Applications satellites launched included Intelsat—III F—2 comsat for ComSatCorp and Essa VII and VIII meteorological satellites for essa. Scientific achievements included orbiting of NASA’s Ogo V, Aao II, Explorer XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL satellites and Naval Research Laboratory’s Explorer XXXVII. Oao II—heaviest and most complicated U.S. automated spacecraft ever launched—took first UV photos of stars, returning previously unobtainable data. Explorer XXXVI was successfully used by gsfc as target in first daylight operational laser tracking. Pioneer IX, launched into solar orbit, carried Tetr II pickaback and ejected it into earth orbit where it served as tracking target for nasa’s Manned Space Flight Network.
Some 157 meteorological sounding rockets and 100 scientific sounding rockets were launched, and RAM C—II spacecraft was launched on suborbital mission to obtain data on radio attenuation during reentry.
X—15 rocket research aircraft made 13 flights, ending its flight program with 199 missions, including 154 at mach 4 or greater, 109 at mach 5 or above, and 4 at greater than mach 6. NASA—usaf flight research continued with 13 flights of XB—70 supersonic aircraft, usaf’s C—5A, world’s largest military cargo aircraft, made its maiden flight and three of the aircraft completed 31 flights for 88-hr total flying time. Design of sst was reevaluated and program was delayed until new fixed-wing design was selected, with prototype construction expected to begin in 1969. nasa’s HL—10 lifting-body vehicle completed 12 successful glide flights and first powered flight.
dod space program included orbiting of 8 IDCSP comsats, 1 Lincoln Experimental Satellite, 5 Orbiting Vehicle research satellites, and 2 environmental research satellites; static test-firings of Titan III—M 1st stage; and near completion of mol launch complex at Vandenberg AFB.
In joint NASA—aec effort, propulsion technology highlights included power tests of Phoebus 2A nuclear reactor, first tests of cold-flow test engine in flight configuration in new test stand, and first test-firings of Pewee 1 fuel element test-bed reactor.
U.S.S.R. launched 74 payloads, including 64 Cosmos satellites, 1 Luna, 1 Proton, 3 Zond, and 2 Soyuz spacecraft, and 3 Molniya I comsats. Manned Soyuz III rendezvoused but did not dock with un-
manned Soyuz II launched one day earlier. Unmanned Zond V and VI completed circumlunar flights and were recovered. Zond IV circled moon and apparently crashlanded. U.S.S.R.’s Tu-144 delta-wing supersonic transport successfully made 38-min maiden flight. (Pres Rpt 68; NASA Release 68-219; B Sun, 1/18/69, 28; Shabad, NYT, 1/1/69, 1; upi, W Star, 1/1/69 A7)
•	Major administrative events affecting NASA and its role in space were
resignation of Administrator James E. Webb in October, after 7% yr as NASA’s head, and budget cuts necessitating program and personnel reductions.
Press marked Webb retirement with praise for many accomplishments of U.S. space program during his leadership. Webb, planning to devote time to interests in education and urban and foreign affairs, continued to serve as consultant to Acting Administrator Dr. Thomas 0. Paine.
NASA FY 1969 budget request of $4.37 billion, already smallest since 1963 and $700 million below FY 1968 request, was further trimmed by Congress because of urgent national needs in other areas, particularly Vietnam war and urban problems. Authorization of $4,013 billion was lowered to appropriation of $3,995 billion-—$375.12 million below original request. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968 again reduced NASA funds, as well as funds for dod and other agencies.
Dr. Paine in October announced NASA interim operating plan limited to $3.85 billion for FY 1969. Cutbacks included “sharply limited and deferred” Apollo Applications program, end to Saturn IB and V booster production, 50% cut in advanced mission studies, reduced lunar and planetary exploration program, one-year delay in NERVA development, slips in Biosatellite program, and reductions in astronomy, physics, and basic research. In November Dr. Paine said that below $4-billion level NASA could no longer “hold together our hard-won capabilities and utilize them effectively in critical programs; some of them would have to be dropped entirely.” (EH)
•	In its international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched
three satellites for European Space Research Organization:	In-
ternational Radiation Investigation Satellite Iris I (Esro II—B), Aurorae (Esro /) to study aurora borealis and related polar ionosphere phenomena, and Highly Eccentric Orbiting Satellite Heos A for interplanetary physics research. From eight nations, 35 investigators were selected to carry out experiments with first lunar surface material to be retrieved by NASA. Four nations contributed experiments flown on NASA spacecraft and 122 sounding rockets were launched in scientific programs with eight countries. Geodetic satellite observations were carried out with 34 countries; aeronautical research was conducted with 4 countries; and 52 countries had apt facilities to receive cloud cover pictures from U.S. satellites, (nasa Releases 68—219, 68—204; Pres Rpt 68)
