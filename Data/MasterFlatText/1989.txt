 A group of U.S. and Canadian astronomers announced that they had discovered evidence of vigorous activity in a whitedwarf star previously thought to be a stellar "corpse." This new and unexpected behavior may offer astronomers new insight into how stars are born, evolve, and ultimately die. The whitedwarf star, catalogued as 0950+139, lies at the center of the faint nebula called EGB6 and is located about 1500 light years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Leo. The findings were presented at the 173rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. (NASA Release 893, Jan 11/89)
 NASA issued a request for proposals to design and build a groundbased radar that would quantify and characterize debris orbiting between 180 to 360 miles above Earth. The radar would have the capability of detecting debris as small as 1 centimeter in diameter, contrasted with the 10centimeter capability of current radar systems. The data gathered by the orbital debris radar would be used in designing the permanently crewtended Space Station Freedom, which would be built to withstand as much orbital debris damage as possible.

 Astronomers from the University of California at Berkeley announced the possible discovery of a newborn pulsar at the heart of stellar debris from Supernova 1987a. A pulsar is an extremely dense sphere of neutrons less than a few miles in diameter but with a magnetic field trillions of times more powerful than the Earth's. The object at the heart of Supernova 1987a appeared to be spinning at a rate of 2,000 rotations per second. The observations were made by an international team of scientists working at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican observatory in Chile. The frequency of the light emitted by the object was found to vary in a regular pattern, suggesting that it was part of a binary system, with a smaller object rotating around a larger twin. The discovery was announced in a circular sent to members of the International Astronomical Union.

 Challenging earlier reports that a mysterious object at the heart of the remnants of Supernova 1987A is a rapidly spinning pulsar, scientists at Columbia University announced that the observed object was more likely to be a vibrating neutron star. The debate over the nature of the object began in February when astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley theorized0*that they were observing an extremely dense pulsar rotating at 2,000 rotations per second. The Berkeley announcement prompted astronomers at Columbia University to argue that the observed bursts of radiation were more likely to emanate from a less dense neutron star that is vibrating at the observed frequency. The Columbia astronomers argued that the vibration theory not only explained the recent observations but also was consistent with previous hypotheses on how neutron stars develop. (W Post, Mar
 In a severe setback for the Soviet Union's planetary exploration program, Soviet ground controllers lost stable radio contact with the untended Phobos 2 Mars probe, the Tass news agency reported. Phobos 2 stopped responding to ground control commands shortly after the craft was ordered to perform a delicate maneuver around the Mars moon Phobos. The maneuver was an initial step toward landing a probe on the Martian moon. During its transit toward Mars, Phobos 2 had experienced a failure of its main radio transmitter, forcing ground controllers to rely on a lowpower backup transmitter for all communications with the spacecraft. A companion spacecraft, Phobos 1, was also lost in September as a result of a ground control command error. The loss of communications with Phobos 2 was described by Western experts as having occurred at the "worst possible time" because few of the main mission objectives had yet been fulfilled.

 NASA scientists reported that a group of eight newly fertilized chicken embryos carried aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS28 had failed to hatch upon returning to Earth, raising questions about the viability of animal reproduction in zero gravity. A group of 16 eggs fertilized nine days before launch were all successfully hatched. Of a third group of eight eggs scheduled to hatch Saturday, only a few embryos remained viable. Discovery astronaut James Bagian speculated that the results may indicate that gravity plays a previously unknown critical role during the process of cell differentiation.

 After travelling 4.4 billion miles over twelve years, the Voyager 2 space probe completed its fourth and final planetary encounter by passing Neptune at a distance of 3,042 miles. During the Neptune encounter, Voyager 2 discovered six new moons of Neptune, a set of faint rings around the planet, auroral activity on Neptune and Triton, and a surprisingly dynamic atmosphere containing large storm systems. Additionally, Voyager 2 obtained closeup images of Neptune's two largest moons, Triton and Nereid. Voyager 2 and its sister spacecraft, Voyager 1, were launched in 1977 for planned encounters with Jupiter and Saturn. After its Saturn encounter, Voyager 1 was steered away from the plane of the solar system toward interstellar space, while the Voyager 2 mission was expanded to take advantage of a rare alignment of the large outer planets, which made possible a "grand tour" of the outer solar system. With its power supply and all major mechanical systems still operative, Voyager 2 encountered Uranus in 1986, discovering rings and several new moons around the planet. Advances in radio receiving technology allowed continued communication with Voyager 2 despite the spacecraft's extremely faint signal. At the conclusion of the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune, the craft would steer clear of the plane of the solar system and continue travelling into interstellar space. In anticipation of a possible retrieval of the craft by intelligent extraterrestrial beings, both Voyager spacecraft carried plaques bearing hieroglyphic messages that indicated their origins on Earth and contained images of a human male and female in a gesture of greeting. The spacecraft also carried a goldplated phonographic record of sounds from Earth, including greetings in all of the world's major languages and the sounds of several animal species.

Approximately five months before reaching Jupiter, Galileo would release a 34inch unpowered descent module that would enter the Jovian upper atmosphere and descend several hundred miles before being destroyed by extreme atmospheric pressure. The AtlantisGalileo mission had sparked protests and a law suit by antinuclear groups concerned over the danger of possible radioactive contamination from the probe's radioisotope thermal generators in the event of a catastrophic accident. In anticipation of possible efforts to disrupt the launch, NASA increased security measures at KSC. In addition to launching Galileo, the STS34 crew would conduct observations of the Earth's ozone layer and perform several onboard medical, biological, and materials processing experiments. The crew included Navy Captain Donald E. Williams (Commander), Navy Commander Michael J. McCulley (Pilot), and Mission Specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Changaz, and Ellen S. Baker. The mission ended successfully on October 23 with Atlantis landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

 Soviet and western planetary scientists announced results from the Phobos 2 mission to Mars and the moon Phobos. Despite the premature loss of spacecraft transmissions because of a computer error, scientists revealed that valuable data had been obtained from the twomonth period preceding the loss of communications. The new findings showed that Mars has no magnetic field of its own and that incoming solar particles impact directly with the planet's ionosphere. Researchers hypothesized that the direct interaction between the solar wind and Mars' upper atmosphere may have been responsible for the depletion of the planet's original atmosphere, as ionospheric particles were gradually electrified by the incoming solar particles. The observations suggested that Mars may have had an atmosphere comparable to Earth's during the first billion years after planet formation, and that conditions for the appearance of life may have prevailed during that time.

 Astronomers at the HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the discovery of the largest structure seen so far in the universe. The scientists claimed to have discovered a sheet of galaxies 500 million lightyears long, 200 million light years wide, and about 15 million light years thick, which they are calling the "Great Wall." The Great Wall, which is invisible to the naked eye, was estimated to be 200 million to 300 million lightyears away from Earth and was expected to reveal new insights on the distribution of matter in the universe.

 The Coloradobased Energetics Satellite Corporation announced that it had completed an agreement with the Soviet Union's civilian space agency, Glavkosmos, to launch two U.S.built commercial satellites on Soviet boosters. The contract provided for the launching of two geosynchronous satellites at a cost of $6.5 million each, with an option to add six more satellite launches in the future. The total potential value of the agreement was $54 million for the eightsatellite launch option. (W Post, Nov 16/89; NY Times, Nov 17/89)
 A NASA Delta launch vehicle was successfully launched on this date from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, carrying the $160 million Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite into a 570mile polar orbit. Three instruments aboard COBE would record the background radiation left over from the "Big Bang" in unprecedented detail, allowing refinement of theories on the formation of galaxies and galactic clusters in the early universe. The Delta was the last launch vehicle in NASA's inventory. Hereafter all future NASA untended launches would occur on commercial or military boosters.

 A team of astronomers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Princeton University announced the discovery of the oldest and most distant object yet observed in the universe. The object was reported to be a quasar at a distance of 10 to 15 billion lightyears from Earth, which may have formed when the universe was only about a billion years old. The discovery challenged conventional theories on the timetable for the formation of galaxies and galacticsized bodies in the early universe. Previous observations had placed the age of most quasars at about 3 billion years after the Big Bang. The new observations were expected to produce major revisions in theories of how matter coalesced during the early universe.

 The Solar Maximum (Solar Max) satellite tumbled out of orbit and reentered the Earth's atmosphere, spreading small amounts of debris over the Indian Ocean. The satellite had been launched in
 the Sun, the Earth's atmosphere, and deep space objects. In April 1984, Solar Max was retrieved by the Space Shuttle Challenger (Mission 41C) for inorbit repairs and redeployment. Solar Max's orbit had been deteriorating faster than expected over the past0*several months because of unusually high solar activity, which caused the Earth's atmosphere to expand and increase the amount of aerodynamic drag experienced by the satellite.

The discovery was expected to help determine the mass of the Milky Way and other similar galaxies. (NY Times, Dec 14/89; B Sun, Dec 14/89)
 Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology returned from a visit to the Soviet Union with photographs of a crewassisted lunar landing vehicle that was to be used to land Soviet cosmonauts on the Moon in 1968. The westerners were given the first concrete evidence of a Soviet lunar landing program when they were shown components of a lunar lander at the Moscow Aviation Institute and were allowed to take photographs. Soviet officials confirmed that a race to land astronauts on the Moon had indeed occurred during the 1960s but that the Soviets had0*fallen behind the United States as a result of several launch failures of their N1 rocket. At the time of the successful lunar mission of Apollo 11, the Soviet Union had denied having a crewtended lunar landing program.
