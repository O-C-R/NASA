Foreword
NASA’s twelfth annual chronology of events in astronautics and aeronautics reflects a U.S. space program redefined to be less costly and perhaps less spectacular in the 1970s than in the previous decade—yet this volume records a continued and indeed matured response to the challenges of space, both in scientific exploration and in practical uses.
The year 1972 closed with the triumphant end of the Apollo program. The mass of data from the manned explorations of the moon and data still being collected by instruments left on the moon’s surface combined with events on earth to intensify awareness of our planet, especially the fragility of its environment and the preciousness of its resources. In addition to bringing insights into how the earth evolved and into the history and nature of the moon, the flights—culminating in the new space records and investigations of Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 during 1972—let us see our planet “as it really is,” influencing long-range planning for future activities in space, as well as in many other areas of life. The assimilation and interpretation of lunar data will occupy many scientists around the world for at least a decade to come.
Several major events underscored the shift in emphasis from lunar exploration toward study of our planet. President Nixon announced that the United States would proceed to develop the reusable space shuttle, to reduce the cost and risk of using space. NASA selected a configuration with reusable boosters and orbiter and let the initial contracts to develop a practical and economical system for both manned and unmanned missions in the 1980s. Meanwhile, all Skylab components were delivered and flight crews were readying for the 1973 missions that would feature prolonged research in astronomy, earth resources, materials processing, and life processes, all under the weightless conditions of earth orbit.
A major step forward in space applications, turning space knowledge and technology into practical benefits, was the launch of Erts 1 to begin global observation of the earth’s resources and environmental factors. Data from Erts 1, from Skylab, and from remote-sensing aircraft were to be available to users worldwide. Weather and communications satellites—including Nimbus 5, Noaa 2, Anik 1 for Canada, and two Intelsats—were orbited to continue almost routine service to man from space. NASA’s technology utilization program expanded the nation’s technology base and attacked problems in health and medical care, air and water pollution, transportation, urban construction, and fire safety.
Although a stretched-out space program reduced plans for a future Grand Tour of all the outer planets to a focus on Jupiter and Saturn, and the nerva nuclear rocket program was reoriented toward a small, high-energy, nuclear propulsion system for planetary missions, 1972 produced significant firsts in space science. Pioneer 10 made the first probe of the Asteroid Belt and flew on toward its December 1973 rendezvous with Jupiter and eventual escape from the solar system. Pioneer 11 was to follow in 1973 for a meeting with Jupiter in 1974. Mariner 9, launched in 1971, completed its mission

FOREWORD
during 1972, photographically mapping the entire globe of Mars and sending back information that revised our understanding of that planet. We now know that Mars is geologically active; free-flowing water may have existed in its ancient past. Mariner 9 data laid the groundwork for 19751976 Viking missions to softland on Mars and search for evidence of life. Mariner 10, to be launched in late 1973, would make the first explorations of Mercury, flying by Venus on its way.
Oao 3 (Copernicus) opened new channels of information into the distant reaches of the universe. The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory made the first ultraviolet observations of Uranus, observed a supernova, and, at this writing, has returned compelling evidence of the existence of black holes in space. Explorer 47 and 48 joined satellites launched in previous years to extend our knowledge of physics and astronomy.
International cooperation took unprecedented steps in 1972. A U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement on cooperative use of outer space included plans for an Apollo-Soyuz docking mission in 1975; another provided for cooperation in science and technology. The European Space Research Organization worked on plans to develop a space laboratory to be flown on NASA’s shuttle. NASA launched four satellites for other nations and four cooperative spacecraft, and the President announced a U.S. policy of launch assistance to other countries and international organizations.
NASA’s major efforts in aeronautics were directed chiefly toward quieter engines; efficient, short-haul air transportation; and reduction of exhaust emissions. The supercritical wing was flight-tested on the Navy T-2C trainer and the Air Force TF-8A jet aircraft in joint advanced transport technology projects to permit savings in structural weight and increases in cruise speed without increasing power. In the NASA—usaf program to develop technology for landing manned space vehicles horizontally, the M2-F3 lifting body completed its 27th and final flight, having reached a speed of 1718 kilometers (1066 miles) per hour and a 21 800 meter (71 500 foot) altitude. The program was to continue in 1973 with flights of the X-24B in a new configuration.
Thus, designed for realistic progress at a constant budget level of $3.4 billion, NASA’s 1972 program in space and in the air was nonetheless marked by the excitement of new tasks, new achievements, and the continued increase in man’s knowledge in many fields.

Preface
Astronautics and Aeronautics for 1972, twelfth in this series of annual chronologies, gives a brief day-by-day account of key events of the year in space and in the air. It pinpoints dates, actors, new technology, decisions, programs, achievements, and early evaluations of results, with notations to sources. Some of the indirectly related technological and scientific events, some indications of the impact on society and national and international concerns, and a sampling of public and official reaction also are noted. Not intended to develop a full picture, the brief references, when used with the index and cross-references, can nevertheless outline the progress of a given subject during the year and point to origins in previous years.
Designed primarily for reference use within the Federal Government, the volume is also offered to the public. The principal sources are those immediately available in NASA, other Federal agencies, Congress, the professional societies, as well as the journals and the press, with verification from participants. Often details that could be lost with time can be captured and questions clarified while the participants are still at hand.
General editor of this volume was the Deputy Director of the NASA Historical Office, Frank W. Anderson, Jr., and the technical editor was Mrs. Carrie E. Karegeannes. The entire Historical Office participated in source selection, review, and publication. Archivist Lee D. Saegesser collected current documentation. The Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress, under an Exchange of Funds agreement, drafted monthly seements in comment edition form; which were circulated for corrections, additions, and use. At the end of the year, the entire manuscript was reworked to include comments received and additional information that was not available when the monthly segments were prepared. At the Library Mrs. Patricia D. Davis, Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith until October and Mrs. Nancy L. Brun from December, and Mrs. Shirley M. Singleton carried principal responsibility. Arthur G. Renstrom of the Library prepared the monthly indexes and Informatics tisco, Inc., prepared the detailed index for the annual volume. The index, indispensahle to the usefulness of a chronology, also serves as a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms.
Appendix A, “Satellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, 1972,” Appendix B, “Chronology of Major NASA launches, 1972,” and Appendix C, “Chronology of Manned Space Flight, 1972,” were prepared by Leonard C. Bruno of the Library of Congress. Appendix D, “Abbreviations of References,” was prepared by Mrs. Davis.
Without the assistance of many individuals throughout NASA and other Federal agencies, the content of this volume would be less reliable and complete. Comments, additions, and criticisms are always welcomed by the NASA Historical Office.

January 1972
January 1: Apollo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M. Worden participated in pregame pageant at 1972 Orange Bowl Classic football game in Miami. Pageant, “The First Decade,” was dedicated to U.S. space program. (NASA Activities, 2/15/72, 35) January 2:	Research in U.S. was shifting from pure to practical, Thomas
O’Toole wrote in Washington Post. “Changes that stress practicality have already been made to parts of U.S. science, but they’re scarcely detectable against the $16 billion the federal government spends every year to support U.S. science and technology. One of the few programs of any size begun by the Nixon administration is a $49 million project at the National Science Foundation code-named rann—for Research Applied to National Needs, rann supports a host of small programs aimed at improving things like subways, cancer treatment, earthquake forecasts and sewers.”
Changes within NASA required “little new money, but they serve to spotlight the emphasis the Nixon administration places on the practical goals of science. In the last six months NASA has taken on study projects from the Departments of Commerce, Interior, and Transportation— none of which involves space exploration. The space agency also has a contract from the National Science Foundation to investigate the use of solar cells (used on most unmanned spacecraft) to electrify homes and buildings. It has another contract from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to look into ways an apartment complex might recycle its sewage and water the way future astronauts will do inside their spacecraft.” (W Post, 1/3/72, Al)
January 3-7: NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971, and inserted in Mars orbit Nov. 13,1971) began systematic mapping of Mars. Full 360° of longitude for band of latitudes would be mapped every 20 days. Mapping had been delayed because major dust storm on planet had obscured visibility. By Jan. 7, after 55 days in Mars orbit, Mariner 9 had responded to 20 000 ground commands and had taken 3500 pictures. Dust was clearing and mission plan had been revised to meet mission objectives to greatest possible extent, (nasa proj off) January 3: National Science Teachers Assn, had received more than 15 000 applications for participation in NASA Skylab Student Project, NASA announced, nsta was managing project to stimulate interest in science and technology by promoting participation of U.S. students in grades
9-12 in experiments, demonstrations, or activities to be performed by astronauts during 1973 Skylab missions. NASA would select 25 proposals on basis of compatibility with Skylab requirements. Selectees and their teachers would attend Skylab Educational Conference and award presentation at Kennedy Space Center at Skylab launch time. NASA would build required hardware in consultation with students. Regional and national selectees would be announced in April, (nasa Release 72-1)

•	NASA announced issuance of requests for proposals (rfps) for six-month
studies to evaluate new propulsion systems for ensuring quiet and clean operation of short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft. Evaluation would include system noise and emission levels, thrust performance, size, and weight. Systems would be investigated for use with propulsive-lift concepts in which jet engines helped produce lift for takeoff and landing on short runways. Proposals were due Jan. 31. At least two companies would be selected. NASA planned to issue rfps for quiet, clean stol experimental engine in late 1972. (NASA Release 72-2)
•	Aerospace industry outlook for 1972 was described in Aviation Week &
Space Technology editorial: “Much of the political miasma and public criticism . . . appears to be dissipating. The cruel bite of unemployment . . . has made it politically less attractive to attack technology. The legislators who were glad to equate their anti-technology votes with a blast at skin cancer now find these votes equated with stimulating unemployment. The industry will continue to be under vigorous public and legislative scrutiny and deserves it. But it has shown the first signs of fighting back and beginning to state its own very valid case. Hopefully, this will continue during the election year in an effort to force politicians to assess technology more accurately in their appeals to the electorate.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 1/3/72, 7)
•	Science and Technology Div. of New York Public Library was closed
after failing to meet $86 000 budget deficit by $9000. Library officials had said previously they expected to raise required funds and reopen by mid-January. (Andelman, NYT, 1/1/72, 18; nypl pio)
•	In interview published in Time magazine President Nixon discussed
impact of his impending visit to People’s Republic of China: “. . . what really matters here is not the fact that the trip to China is announced” but results of trip. “Our people have become accustomed to the spectaculars. It is exciting. A trip to China is like going to the moon.” {Time, 1/3/72, 14—5)
January 4: Apollo 16 lunar module (lm) pilot Charles M. Duke, Jr., was admitted to Patrick Air Force Base Hospital for treatment of bacterial pneumonia. Duke’s illness was not expected to have serious impact on training preparations for Apollo 16 launch, scheduled for March 17. (msc Release 72-02)
•	Dr. Hannes O. Alfven, professor of applied physics at Univ. of California
at San Die"o and winner of 1970 Nobel Prize in physics, was named to receive U.S.S.R.’s 1971 Lomonsov Gold Medal for “outstanding achievements in plasma physics and astrophysics.” Award was highest granted by Soviet Academy of Sciences, (upi, LA Times, 1/5/72)
•	Completion by U.S.S.R. of world’s first fast-breeder nuclear reactor for
commercial purposes was announced by Izvestia. Reactor, at Shevchenko on Caspian Sea, would produce 250 000 kw of nuclear power to convert salt water from Caspian Sea into fresh water. (Shabad, NYT, 1/15/72, 11)
January 5: President Nixon announced decision U.S. should develop space shuttle system. In statement re'eased from San Clemente. Calif., following 45-min meeting with Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, President said: “I have decided today that the United States should proceed at once with the development of an entirely new type of space transportation

system designed to help transform the space frontier of the 1970’s into familiar territory, easily accessible for human endeavor in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
“This system will center on a space vehicle that can shuttle repeatedly from earth to orbit and hack. It will revolutionize transportation into near space, by routinizing it. It will take the astronomical costs out of astronautics. In short, it will go a long way toward delivering the rich benefits of practical space utilization and the valuable spinoffs from space efForts into the daily lives of Americans and all people.
“The new year 1972 is a year of conclusion for America’s current series of manned flights to the moon. Much is expected from the two remaining Apollo missions—in fact, their scientific results should exceed the return from all the earlier flights together. Urns they will place a fitting capstone on this vastly successful undertaking. But they also hring us to an important decision point—-a point of assessing what our space horizons are as Apollo ends, and of determining where we go from here.
“In the scientific arena, the past decade of experience has taught us that spacecraft are an irreplaceable tool for learning about our near earth space environment, the moon, and the planets, besides being an important aid to our studies of the sun and stars. In utilizing space to meet needs on earth, we have seen the tremendous potential of satellites for intercontinental communications and worldwide weather forecasting. We are gaining the capability to use satellites as tools in global monitoring and management of natural /resources, in agricultural

applications, and in pollution control. We can foresee their use in guiding airliners across the oceans and in bringing televised education to wide areas of the world.
“However, all these possibilities, and countless others with direct and dramatic bearing on human betterment, can never be more than fractionally realized so long as every single trip from earth to orbit remains a matter of special effort and staggering expense. This is why commitment to the space shuttle program is the right next step for America to take, in moving out from our present beachhead in the sky to achieve a real working presence in space—because the space shuttle will give us routine access to space by sharply reducing costs in dollars and preparation time.”
It was significant, President said, “that this major new national enterprise will engage the best efforts of thousands of highly skilled workers and hundreds of contractor firms over the next several years. The amazing ‘technology explosion’ that has swept this country in the years since we ventured into space should remind us that robust activity in the aerospace industry is healthy for every one—not just in jobs and income, but in the extension of our capabilities in every direction. The continued pre-eminence of America and American industry in the aerospace field will be an important part of the shuttle’s ‘payload.’ ”
Shuttle program would “give more people access to the liberating perspectives of space, even as it extends our ability to cope with physical challenges of earth and broadens our opportunities for international cooperation in low-cost, multi-purpose space missions.”
President quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes: “We must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor.” President concluded, “So with man’s epic voyage into space—a voyage the United States of America has led and still shall lead.” (PD, 1/10/72, 27-8; Transcript of Fletcher, Low press conference, 1/5/72)
• Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released statement from San Clemente, Calif., following President’s announcement of decision to proceed with development of space shuttle. Decision was consistent with NASA FY 1972 budget and was “a most historic step in the nation’s space program—it will change the nature of what man can do in space. By the end of this decade the nation will have the means of getting men and equipment to and from space routinely, on a moment’s notice if necessary, and at a small fraction of today’s cost. This will be done within the framework of a useful total space program of science, exploration, and applications at approximately the present overall level of the space budget.”
Dr. Fletcher described shuttle as “airplane-like orbiter, about the size of a DC—9 . . . capable of carrying into orbit and back again to earth useful payloads up to 15 feet [4.6 metersl in diameter by 60 feet [18 meters] long, and weighing up to 65,000 lbs [29 500 kg]. Fuel for the orb iter’s liquid-hydrogen liquid-oxygen engines will be carried in an external tank that will be jettisoned in orbit.” Orbiter would be launched by unmanned booster and would operate in space for one week, during which crew could launch, service, or recover unmanned spacecraft; would perform experiments; and, in future, would resupply and restaff space modules brought to space by shuttle.

He cited reasons “space shuttle is important and is the right step in manned space flight and the U.S. space program.” First, “the shuttle is the only meaningful new manned space program which can be accomplished on a modest budget. Second, the space shuttle is needed to make space operations less complex and less costly. Third, the space shuttle is needed to do useful things. Fourth, the shuttle will encourage greater international participation in space flight.”
Dr. Fletcher said NASA and contractors would focus until late February on technical areas, including comparisons of pressure-fed liquid- and solid-fuel rocket-motor options for shuttle’s booster stage, before NASA issued requests for proposals in the spring. “This summer we will place the space shuttle under contract and development work will start.”
At press conference in San Clemente following release of shuttle statements, Dr. Fletcher and Dr. Low discussed President’s decision. Dr. Fletcher said President was “particularly anxious that I stress the international aspects of this. This program will be open to all nations of the world, and it is his hope some day that foreign visitors from all over the world will be able to participate by moving to and from space in the space shuttle.”
NASA anticipated that “at its peak, the direct employment on the space shuttle will be of the order of 50,000 individuals. Of course, a great many of those will be employed in this area.”
Responding to question, Dr. Fletcher said decision on shuttle launch site, “which will be the same as the landing site,” depended on recommendation of launch site selection group. “It is not necessarily Cape Kennedy or any other site at this time.” (Text: Transcript)
•	Ames Research Center. Langlev Research Center, and Manned Spacecraft
Center had received over 250 proposals for using space-related technology to solve problems of air pollution, water pollution, solid waste management, and clinical medicine, NASA announced. Proposals were in response to reauest for ideas to demonstrate possible applications of NASA-developed technology to public problems. They would be reviewed by experts and one or more projects in each category might be selected for maximum $75 000 contract, (nasa Release 72-3)
•	Results of computer study made by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
for International Club of Rome, organization of distinguished world social scientists, were described in Washington Post. Study, made with dynamic worldwide model, traced effects of population, capital investment, geographical space, natural resources, food production, and pollution upon each other. Findings had shown “crisis level” 40 or 50 years away with few remaining options. Current age might be golden age, with higher life quality than in future. Next century might find four-sided dilemma—suppression of industry by shortage of natural resources, decline of population because of pollution, limits on population by food shortage, or population collapse from war, disease, and stresses of overcrowding. Birth control might be self-defeating by bringing improved food supply and living standards, causing resurgence of population growth; poor countries might have no “realistic hope” of reaching living standards of rich countries. Disparity between developed and underdeveloped nations might be equalized as much by decline in developed nations as by improvement in underdeveloped

January 6:	Apollo 16 command module (cm) pilot Thomas K. Mattingly
II described some of Apollo 16 experiments at Manned Spacecraft Center press conference, alfmed (Apollo light-flash moving-emulsion detector) experiment would test hypothesis that light flashes seen by astronauts on previous Apollo missions were “high energy particles, nuclei of heavy particles coming from the sun with a great deal of energy penetrating and causing some response ... in the eyeball by perhaps triggering one of the photocells in your eye. It may ... be hitting the . . . optic nerve, or it may be going into the head or some other location and creating a stimulus which appears to be a visual clue.”
meed (microbial ecological evaluation device), a package containing organisms, would be carried to determine effect of ultraviolet (uv) radiation, solar radiations, and zero g. MEED would be opened during extravehicular activity (eva) and exposed to sun; parts of experiment would be exposed to uv radiation and parts to different bands of solar spectrum. Organisms would be covered by superimposed filters; colony of one material could be exposed to different wavelengths by using different filters. Biostack, West German-made package of organisms in silicon biological material, would be carried to investigate effects of high-energy particles on the organisms.
Photographic tasks would include photography of solar corona and two new areas at galactic poles, Gegenschein experiment, and UV photography of earth. (Transcript)
•	NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe photographed area of Mars 800 km (500
mi) from south pole from 3335-km (2072-mi) altitude. Photos, released to press Jan. 11, showed pits and hollows—including two large closed basins 16 km (10 mi) wide—with more detail than seen before. According to Dr. Carl E. Sagan of Cornell Univ., spots occurred in sizes from more than 160 km (100 mi) to size of Yankee Stadium in New York. Many blotches seemed to be associated with craters, indicating that they might be wind shadows where hill or other feature had protected downwind area from dust deposition.

open debate” on space shuttle development issue, “leading to the rejection of this wasteful program.” It was “typical” that Nixon

Administration “can squander $6.5 billion to fly four people into orbit when it refuses to invest less than one-third that amount to provide desperately needed day care and development programs for millions of children.” Space shuttle was “many timbs worse than SST” in “magnitude of its cost, in the folly of its concept and in its damage to the country.” (Text)
•	President Nixon’s decision to support development of space shuttle was
expected to stir “some loud opposition in Congress,” New York Times said, “bht probably not enough to sidetrack initial funding. . . .” Opposition was expected “from those who question the President’s decision to hack an expensive new space effort at a time when so many down-to-earth social programs have to wait in line for a share of the Federal dollar.” NASA officials had expressed “confidence that they have sufficient Congressional support for an initial shuttle appropriation.” (Wilford, NYT, 1/6/72, 14)
•	Soviet Space Programs, 1966-70 (Senate Document 92-51) was released
by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. The 670-page report—prepared by Library of Congress under direction of Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.— noted that Soviet space program remained “a strong and growing enterprise” unhindered by budgetary strain and undimmed by deaths of three Soyuz cosmonauts in 1971. Current level of Soviet space activity exceeded that of U.S. at its peak in 1966, with perhaps 2% of Soviet gross national product devoted to space (U.S. spent about 1% of its gnp at peak). Although U.S. launch record had been declining steadily since 1966, Soviet launches had continued to climb, at least until 1970. Contrary to assertion that it was concentrating its efforts on unmanned program rather than manned program, U.S.S.R. apparently was still planning manned lunar landing and might spend $49 million on both advanced unmanned and manned lunar programs. U.S. would have committed $35 billion to total Apollo program when complete.
In unmanned research satellite program “the level of activity currently runs ahead of the corresponding level of work at NASA.” Compendium of every known Soviet launch that had achieved orbit showed that, along with scientific satellites, Cosmos program consisted of unmanned tests of spacecraft designed to carry cosmonauts, lunar and planetary probes that failed to leave earth orbit, unsuccessful Mars probes, and military research and development and observation satellites that accounted for 80% of Cosmos payloads. According to study, Cosmos series through April 1971 had included at least 16 tests of fractional orbital bombardment system (fobs) and 22 tests of experimental spacecraft designed to inspect and destroy other nations’ observation and navigation satellites.
Soviet achievements in near future were dependent on success or failure of G booster (in Saturn V class) or similar booster. Studies of moon with Luna series spacecraft would continue, perhaps with spacecraft launched by advanced booster carrying both rovers and sample returners. Planetary program would continue, probably with flyby mission to Jupiter and landing mission to Mars. Dr. Sheldon stressed that “the Soviet program is not a sham. It may be exploited for political purposes, but it is real and it is pursued in earnest.” (Text)

•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, issued statement
in Washington, D.C., on President Nixon’s Jan. 5 decision to proceed with development of space shuttle. Decision “initiates a program which holds great promise for scientific and technological advances in the interests of the nation and all mankind. We are also interested in its potential as a means for performing our military mission more efficiently and economically. The Air Force role in the program is to provide NASA data to help assure that the Shuttle will be of maximum utility to the dod and we are pleased that the proposed vehicle is configured to meet potential DOD needs. We will continue our close coordination with NASA as their development program proceeds.’-’ (Text)
•	Space shuttle concept endorsed by President Nixon made it “all but
certain” that Kennedy Space Center would be selected for shuttle’s launch site, New York Times said. Space experts seemed to feel that only by “converting the assembly buildings, launching pads and communications center” at ksc “would it be possible to develop a shuttle port for $300 million.” (NYT, 1/7/72, 7)
•	Newspaper editorials commented on decision to develop space shuttle.
Kansas City Star:	“The next great step in space for the United
States seems assured. President Nixon has pressed the go-ahead button and apparently it will be largely a matter of adequate funding by Congress. In view of the record of space accomplishments, there is not much doubt that the planned space shuttle program will be fruitful both from the standpoint of technological success and long-range scientific benefits.” (KC Star, 1/7/72)	"
St. Louis Globe-Democrat:	“There are so many potentialities for
the shuttle that it is bard to envision all of them. But there is no doubt that if it is completed space travel for the average citizen may become a distinct possibility in the 1980s.” (St Louis G-D, 1/7/72)

Christian Science Monitor said “space discovery versus human needs argument should not be seen as an either/or issue. This is so even leaving aside the jobs creation or economic return arguments.” Monitor believed that “a space shuttle program, because it is so practically linked to fulfilling man’s age-old vision of mastering the heavens, will unleash more constructive human energy than it will consume. And this excess will make meeting earthside demands the easier.” (CSM, 1/7/72)
Atlanta Journal Constitution:	“The program . . . has the almost
immediate benefit of employing some 50,000 highly trained aerospace workers who have faced a dismal job picture as the Apollo program has phased out. And, again, the proposal demonstrates that imagination and vision and a willingness to dare are still part of the American way of doing things.” (Atlanta JC, 1/7/72)
Milwaukee Journal:	“The shuttle offers the opportunity to make
space flight fairly routine, of taking large numbers of people and supplies in and out of space, of manning earth resource space stations continuously, of monitoring and repairing communications and resource satellites. It is a worthwhile program.” (MJ, 1/7/72)
Los Angeles Times said military aspect of space shuttle needed clarification. “Most taxpayers welcomed the decision to end the wasteful competition between NASA and the Air Force on the shuttle and orbiting space station.” NASA had not explained how shuttle’s civil and military functions would be kept separate. “No American wants the Soviet Union to tip the balance of power with its own space program. But it might help avert a new confrontation if the military applications were enumerated along with a statement of whether the American government thinks shuttles are bound by the international agreement barring nuclear weapons from outer space.” (LA Times, 1/7/72)
Seattle Times:	“The history of warfare shows that victory usually
goes to the one who occupies the high ground. Near-earth space is the ‘high ground’ of modern military planning. In approving a full go-ahead for . . . space shuttle program, President Nixon this week served notice that this nation intends to occupy the ‘high ground.’ ” (Seattle Times, 1/7/72)

U.S.S.R. openly acknowledged it. “Instead, both superpowers look down on the other from space, cameras rolling, and mobilize this new space tool for special missions in time of crisis... . Some . .. specialists think that since both superpowers depend heavily on their satellites for information, there is now a form of mutual deterrence in space which will keep one side from attacking the other’s satellites. However, there is widespread agreement that the United States has nothing to compare with the Soviets’ satellite inspection ability.” (W Post, 1/7/72, A16)

It has thus prevented the serious deficit in this country’s balance of trade from Becoming truly horrendous. But it holds no monopoly on aerospace technology. Unless it can maintain high productivity and competitive wage costs, foreign-made planes will become as common in our skies as foreign-made cars are on our highways.” (SF Exam, 1/7/72)
January 8:	Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) said in press release that
President Nixon’s decision to proceed with space shuttle development was “a great mistake, and an outrageous distortion of budgetary priorities” and “the last thing we need at this time.” It would keep NASA and aerospace industry occupied but “it will also insure a steady and very substantial drain on the federal budget. And it will insure that other needs will continue to go unmet.” (Text)
•	Newspapers continued editorial comment on decision to develop space
shuttle.
New York Times: “The space shuttle is far less expensive than the Apollo project, and, fortunately, is not being launched in the atmosphere of Cold War hysteria that attended the birth of the lunar landing effort. On the contrary, NASA has already stated publicly it would welcome cooperation on the space shuttle from other industrially developed nations, including the Soviet Union. The argument that the space shuttle is simply another SST boondoggle has little validity. The potential benefits are far greater, and the space shuttle presents none of the environmental problems that counted so heavily against the supersonic transport.” (NYT, 1/8/72, 28)
Detroit News: “It is good that the $24 billion outlay on the Apollo moon program is not to he wasted by the United States dropping out of the space program. Mission Impossible became mission accomplished because there was a national commitment to beat the Russians to the moon. The fact that the race has been won, however, should not blind Americans that it was only the first, tentative step in unlocking the mysteries of space. If we don’t press on, others will.” (D News, 1/8/72)

Mars 2 and Mars 3 probes. Spacecraft (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) had measured atmospheric humidity and surface temperature, photometered atmosphere and surface, and photographed surface. Temperature along route from 58° south latitude, 330° longitude to 30° north latitude, 190° longitude had been determined. Highest temperature—recorded near mid-day region—was 253 K (—20°C; —4°F). On night side of planet temperature dropped to 183 K (—90°C; —130°F).
Dust storm that had covered Mars since Mars 2 reached planet Nov. 27, 1971, was subsiding. “Photometric recordings obtained by means of the red filtre show dark areas corresponding to the Martian ‘seas’ that were previously absolutely undistinguishable. But the recordings made with the ultraviolet filter again showed bright clouds.” Onboard instruments to record emissions in three spectral bands containing lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and argon atoms showed that hydrogen emissions stretched to more than 3400-km (2100-mi) altitude and oxygen atoms concentrated near surface up to 600-800 km (370-500 mi). (Tass, fbis-Sov, 1/10/72, L3)
•	Space shuttle’s “subtle costs” were discussed in New York Times article
by John N. Wilford: “Because NASA must initiate shuttle development within its current $3.2-billion budget framework, other programs will presumably by sacrificed.” Possible “victim” was Grand Tour mission planned for late 1970s. “The choice is certain to be unpopular with much of the scientific community.” Scientists had criticized NASA’s emphasis on “big-money manned projects at the expense of the less expensive science-oriented unmanned missions.” Shuttle development also would “restrict the funds available for other scientific projects in NASA and elsewhere in Government.” (NYT, 1/9/72, 6)
•	New York News editorial commented on space shuttle decision: “We
would like to see the U.S. taking on, too, some of the more exciting space challenges that could be achieved with America’s present knowhow. But at least Mr. Nixon has furnished assurance that he will keep the U.S. in the space business. We can be thankful for that at a time when undeserved abuse is being heaped on the whole program by people who prefer to shut out the beckoning glitter of the stars so they can concentrate on the mud at their feet.” (NY News, 1/9/72)

Mrs. Harris had adopted as her philosophy phrase, “We are all fellow astronauts on Spaceship Earth.” She had said, “My position is to make sure the space program is for everybody. We have to get the alienated minorities into every NASA level, especially space exploration.” (Trescott, W Star, 1/9/72, Cl)
January 10:	European participation in space shuttle development was
discussed by NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers during press briefing at Manned Spacecraft Center. European space officials had released to European industry “fairly extensive study . . . leading to the definition of the tug that the Europeans might build for the shuttle to carry.” Tug was 3rd stage of shuttle transportation system. Myers said NASA had examined three possible areas for European participation: “One would he in elements, physical pieces of the shuttle that would be managed ... as the prime

contractor manages a subcontractor. We will expect the prime contractors to Work directly with the European industries in that case.” Europeans would supply money for parts developed by Europe. Second area Was tug. “If the tug were developed, we would expect it to be paid for by the Europeans.” Third area was sortie can, “experimentcarrying device to be carried in the payload compartment,” which would give them “an opportunity to enter into the use of the shuttle very extensively.” European space officials would meet with NASA within two months to respond on interest in participating.
Timetable called for selection of industrial contractors in summer 1972, with subsonic and suborbital test flights beginning in 1975, manned orbital tests in 1978, and first fully operational mission by 1980. Site evaluation board would make its next report to NASA within few weeks, and site for shuttle launch and recovery would be selected by spring. One site would be selected initially, with another or others selected later according to program needs. “We don’t see the shuttle as a highly limited operation. And, I think that eventually there will be more than one site.” Location depended on mission. “Today . . . there is a preponderance of due-east missions out of ksc [Kennedy Space Center!, and . . . different azimuths out of the West Coast. We can’t go due east out of the West Coast very well . . . because of the populated areas east . . . and we can’t get as efficient in polar orbits out of Kennedy ... so there is a tendency to ... go to the two coasts. Now whether that really ends up being that way in the shuttle system, we don’t know yet.” (Transcript)
•	Events leading to President Nixon’s endorsement of space shuttle develop-
ment were reported by Aviation Week & Space Technology: “The struggle between NASA and omb [Office of Management and Budget] officials reached the point of acrimony when the latter suggested design changes and demanded to know from NASA engineers the dollar savings that would result. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, finally appealed directly to the office of the President with a complaint that omb was attempting to design the U.S. space shuttle rather than merely budget it.” President Nixon had removed omb accountant from conference with NASA and demanded shuttle agreement. “The dispute culminated in Fletcher’s triumphal flight to San Clemente ... to join in the announcement that the space shuttle had been approved by the Administration.” (Av Wk, 1/10/72, 15)

•	Washington Daily News quoted Harvard Univ. nutritionist Dr. Jean
Mayer, Presidential Adviser on Nutrition, as saying some scientists had let their opposition to war, poverty, and pollution lead them into unscientific distortions and exaggerations. As result, laymen were confused about nuclear testing, defoliation, antiballistic missiles, supersonic transport, and extent of hunger and malnutrition in U.S. Dr. Mayer had said credibility of all scientists would be undermined as long as a few insisted on offering opinions “with little basis in fact.” (W News, 1/10/72, 16)

January 10—13:	Third Annual Lunar Science Conference held by NASA
and Lunar Science Institute at Manned Spacecraft Center was attended by more than 600 researchers from U.S. and 16 foreign countries. Foreign visitors included Soviet scientists Y. I. Belyayev, M. S. Chupakhin, and K. P. Florenskiy, who participated in conference, consulted with U.S. scientists, looked at lunar samples stored at msc, and helped select samples to return to their colleagues in U.S.S.R. NASA provided three grams (one tenth ounce) of lunar material collected on Apollo 14 mission as part of U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreements for exchange of samples. Samples included chip from widely studied crystalline rock, small piece of 9-kg (20-lb) boulder, and core samples soils, and polished thin sections.
Conference papers dealt with scientific results of Apollo lunar landing missions, analysis of Soviet Luna 16 samples, and results of study of lunar surface by U.S.S.R.’s Lunokhod 1. Apollo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M. Worden discussed their observations of lunar surface made from lunar orbit during July 26-Aug. 7, 1971, mission. Dr. N. C. Costes, Marshall Space Flight Center representative of Apollo Soil Mechanics Investigation Science Team, discussed mechanical properties of lunar soil.
Washington Post later compared conference with First Lunar Science Conference in 1970, when “there were few facts available and many theories.” At third conference, “situation seemed to have reversed.” Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said, “You’re not throwing facts out into a vacuum any more.”
Among facts stated at conference were: moon once had strong magnetic field, of which remnants remained to suggest moon once had metallic core up to 280 km (175 mi) thick; lunar crust was 65 km (40 mi) deep and layered; existence of extinct plutonium 244 in Apollo 14 samples indicated plutonium had been trapped when lunar crust solidified shortly after origin of solar system; and Copernicus

Crater had been gouged 850 to 950 million yrs ago, making process one of more recent major lunar events.
Dr. James R. Arnold of Univ. of California at San Diego reported that moon’s radioactive elements were concentrated in two broad plains, Ocean of Storms and Sea of Rains. “As we go away from this region ... we drop to quite low levels of radioactivity.” Scientists agreed that these radiation emissions should not prove hazardous to astronauts who might visit for short period.
Dr. Isidore Adler, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, reported that map of lunar surface chemistry produced from Apollo 15 x-ray data indicated highlands of moon contained more aluminum than did plains. Finding supported hypothesis that moon’s early crust was rich in feldspar.
Dr. Gary V. Latham of Columbia Univ., Apollo Program chief seismic investigator, debated presence of volcanoes on moon with Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold. Dr. Latham said that while main episode of lunar vulcanism seemed to have ceased 3 billion yrs ago, “it’s by no means certain that we do not have continuing vulcanism on a very minor scale on the moon.” Dr. Gold continued to support theory that moon was dead, rigid body with basins of compacted dust.
Dr. Leon T. Silver of California Institute of Technology proposed theory of “parentless lead” on moon to explain presence in some lunar locations of more lead than could have been produced by decay of radioactive uranium. In moon’s extreme vacuum it was possible for vaporized lead to travel great distances from its parent, uranium. Dr. Silver said other materials could be distributed over lunar surface in same way, all of which could confuse analysis of moon’s age.
Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory discussed tiny piece of green glass among Apollo 14 samples that scientists had nick-named “Genesis bean.” Bean and other glass fragments were almost identical chemically to rare meteorites, Howardites. Evidence suggested green glass had originated on moon and not from meteorite impacts on earth and thus might be some of earliest material of solar system.
Consensus of conference on bulk composition of moon was summarized by Dr. Gast: feldspar-rich highland material with anorthosite as one prevalant component, basalts (solidified lava, low in radioactive elements and relatively young) in plains and basins, and KREEP (highly radioactive material rich in potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus).
Conference closed with discussion of geologic setting of Apollo 16 Descartes landing site and plans for mission’s extravehicular activity. Soviet scientists returned to U.S.S.R.

“Man’s ability to perform capably in a prolonged state of weightlessness has yet to be proven and until it is the arguments for a large shuttle program must remain inconclusive. Beyond this, the recent agreements between this country and the Soviet Union to exchange biomedical and other space data and to work toward compatible docking systems would seem to make a full scale shuttle program a prime candidate for a co-operative enterprise.” (St Louis P-D, 1/11/72)

The sad truth is that the original shuttle couldn’t, either, once it became apparent that development costs would approximate $13 billion rather than the $5.2 billion estimated in 1969. As backers of the defunct supersonic transport finally had to admit, when you markedly alter the development cost of a flight system, you alter its economics also.” (C Sun-Times, 1/12/72)

But, as aerosol dust in air increased, albedo increased “very fast, compared to the opacity in the infrared; as the albedo increases, the solar radiation decreases, and the surface temperature goes down.” Temperature could decrease in next 30 yrs as much as about 3 K [5.4°F], Several climatologists had suggested that “3K decrease in global temperature is sufficient to trigger an Ice Age!” (Transcript)

•	Newspaper editorials commented on President Nixon’s decision to develop
space shuttle.
Washington Post said arguments for or against shuttle were not “error free” since “major ones rest on projections into the future which are exceedingly difficult to make and others rest on basically undemonstrable assumptions about the quest for knowledge. Part of the difficulty springs from the fact that no one can know what space-based research will discover. Is the key to the hydrogen atom and thus to unlimited energy out there . . .? Will the world some day need to import minerals from space to sustain life here? Will man have to be in space to accomplish things such as these or can machines do them all? Above all, where does this kind of program fit in a national budget that cannot provide for doing all the things at home that ought to be done?” Such questions would make debate over space shuttle “different in character and significance from last year’s debate over the sst.” Standards applied to “project which involves scientific research and

military considerations . . . must be somewhat different from those applied to a project, such as the sst, which involved only another way to move people from place to place.” (W Post, 1/14/72, A22)
Houston Post: “With the last Apollo moon flight scheduled later this year and the Skylab project to terminate in 1973, the shuttle holds the key to an on-going space program. Our failure to build it would indicate our lagging interest in space research to the possible detriment of future cooperation with the Russians in this field. It is true that we have important social priorities which need attention, but our space research posture in relation to the Soviet Union, whether competitive or cooperative, also carries a high priority.” (H Post, 1/14/72)

In Jan. 18 press briefing NASA Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews said pollution monitoring was natural activity for global surveillance capability because atmospheric pollution was potentially global problem. Not well understood were manner in which pollutants were dispersed throughout globe or manner in which earth corrected itself. “There’s a lot of work to be done in this area.”
In Jan. 21 briefing Dr. John M. DeNoyer, NASA Director of Earth Observations, said program was moving from exploratory to flight phase, from learning to applying techniques. Among applications was spring Arctic ice survey, in which some 80 scientists would be on ice measuring strain rates, meteorological conditions, and ice types, supported by Convair 990 aircraft from Ames Research Center. Also microwave techniques in remote sensing could identify ice-free lanes in Great Lakes region, making possible efficient shipping much earlier in spring than at present. Soo Canal into Lake Superior, which carried more tons of freight than any other canal in world, was now open only one half of year. Weather and cloud cover made aircraft surveillance inefficient; microwave techniques from satellite altitude was more practical in this instance. Another important program would be thermal mapping by remote sensing to permit better industrial planning from knowledge of how development would actually affect environment. Land-use planning also would be greatly aided by remote sensing data processed by computerized inventory system being developed at msc. (msc Release 72—11; MSC PAO; Transcript)

January 18-20
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
receipt of Jan. 14 letter from Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, announcing change in NASA office name from OABT to OAST.
On first day of hearings Dr. Fletcher testified on “steady increase” in NASA funding for aeronautics: Funding had grown from $42 million in FY 1966 to $110 million in FY 1972, “a doubling in terms of constant dollars. When you add the funding for salaries and other in-house costs related to supporting the aeronautics programs, the total . . . has grown from 1.6% of the total NASA budget in fiscal year 1966 to 7.1% in fiscal year 1972.” Number of NASA personnel members working in aeronautics research and technology had grown from 2600 in 1966 to 5300. Increase had occurred while NASA staff had been reduced from 34 000 to 27 500.
Dr. Fletcher said joint Dept, of Transportation and NASA Study on Civil Aviation Research and Development (card) had “forced the establishment of new and more effective coordination mechanisms between NASA and DOT.” Mechanisms were being used “to develop a formal card Policy Implementation Plan to specify clear goals, responsibilities, planned achievement milestones, and projected resource requirements for dot and NASA jointly.” card policy study had caused “better focus on the priority problem areas of aircraft noise . . . and terminal congestion” and directed more specific attention to role R&D might play in developing better total operating system for low-density aviation market so that civil aviation might be used more economically as tool for regional development. Focus did not compromise “ability to continue a comprehensive research and technology program in all the aeronautical disciplines to provide a technology base for the future.”
Deputy Director Clarence A. Syvertson of Ames Research Center outlined general recommendations of CARD study: scope of civil-aviation R&D programs should be expanded to emphasize nontechnological factors; economists and social scientists should be assigned to NASA and dot staffs, r&d staffs of Dept, of Defense, NASA, dot, and Civil Aeronautics Board should be interchanged to provide broad systems background for more effective Government action in civil aviation programs. cab should explore policy of allowing intermodal mergers of airlines for expanded use of air cargo to encourage innovative industry R&D in this area. Dept, of Commerce should refine and monitor measurable indicators of U.S. progress in civil aviation industry. National Aeronautics and Space Council should review and recommend national policies guiding civil aviation that embraced several agencies.
George W. Cherry, Deputy Administrator for Programs in oast, reported “considerable ongoing activity abroad in designing, building and selling new, small economical aircraft for the world’s low-density short-haul market. This raises the questions: Where will replacement aircraft come from? Can the U.S. industry compete with the foreign manufacturers to fill the market?” Answers required “fundamental policy decisions by the United States with regard to the desirability of providing continuing or expanded public-need air service, and also . . . to whether Government support can or should be given to the manufacturer.”
U.S. needed to know more about market and economics of operating in low-density area to write specifications for aircraft and operating system. “If industry designs fall short of meeting the economic specifi-
22

cations, there should be enough information available to determine if Government assistance . . . could result in the operator providing viable service. If subsidy is necessary, subsidizing the nonrecurring costs of manufacture, rather than the recurring costs of operation, might make good sense.”
NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology Roy P. Jackson described questol project plans for two quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (stol) transport research aircraft: “The experimental airplanes will function as a versatile facility for NASA flight research programs developed in cooperation with other Government agencies and interested industry groups, including the airlines. The information provided will reduce the technical risk associated with development, by industry, of both civil and military STOL transports” and “provide a comprehensive technical foundation on which Government regulatory agencies can establish realistic criteria for certification of commercial subsonic stol transport aircraft and for en route and terminal area operations.” (Transcript)
January 19:	NASA announced selection of flight crews for Skylab missions.
Prime crewmen for first, 28-day flight were Charles Conrad, Jr. (commander), Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin (science pilot), and Paul J. Weitz (pilot). Backup crewmen were Russel L. Schweickart, Dr. Story Mus-grave, and Bruce McCandless II.
Crewmen for second, 56-day mission were Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma. Third mission, for 56 days, would be flown by Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue. Backup crew for second and third missions was Vance D. Brand, Dr. William B. Lenoir, and Dr. Don L. Lind, (nasa Release 72-12)
• Skylab crew press conference, with prime and backup crewmen, was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr., said preparations were on schedule for April 1973 launch. Contractor checkouts and tests of hardware were expected to be completed for delivery to Kennedy Space Center in July. Skylab would carry some 20 000 pieces of stowage equipment on board to provide life support for nine men for 140 days. “So it all goes up at one time, and we’ve got a great deal of work to do, not only to learn how to operate this vehicle but also all the experiments in it. It became apparent that we could not be 100 percent cross-trained as we had been in Apollo, so we’ve . . . defined some areas for each guy to become expert in ... . That allowed us to balance out the training hours. Right now ... we have some 2000 training hours per man defined. We’ve been working on the basic training for the past year.” Training hardware would be available about February 1. Commander would have overall responsibility for mission and would be command and service module expert. Science pilot would be expert in all medical equipment and in Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) and its associated hardware. Pilot would be expert in Orbital Workshop systems and electrical systems. Remaining experiments would be divided among crewmembers according to availability and choice.
Astronaut Alan L. Bean said photographic data returned from Skylab would be “far superior” to previous data because actual film would be returned to earth. To return film, crews would conduct two extravehicular activities (eyas) on first mission, three on second, and two on third. “We’re going to be moving . . . 240 pounds [109 kg] worth of
23

film, in canisters, magazines, in and out of the cameras. We’ll have to remove the used exposed film and replace it with new film. It’s going to take about 3 hours.”
Experiments were described by Astronaut Gerald P. Carr. They included EREP earth resources experiment containing five sensors to calibrate earth’s atmosphere, corollary experiments submitted by high school students, engineering experiments to study effects of zero g on metal alloys and flammability of certain items, habitability experiments to study noise levels and atmospheric composition, and scientific experiments. Scientific experiments would include studies of effect of zero g on single human cells, studies of circadian rhythm of pocket mice and vinegar gnats, ultraviolet stellar astronomy and x-ray astronomy. Technological experiments would include crew vehicle disturbances, manual navigation sightings, and “a study of the little contamination cloud that we carry around with us . . . kind of like Pigpen in Peanuts.”
In response to question on illness during missions, Astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin said NASA would provide equipment and training on board to take care of most illnesses and injuries that could be handled in a doctor’s office. Science pilot would be able to provide emergency care for illnesses “up to and including quite severe. We have quite a package of drugs on board, administrable by all routes; we have tracheotomy equipment and equipment for maintaining an airway for stopping bleeding. We are attempting to develop in time for the flight intravenous fluids. We feel that, almost regardless of the severity of the injury, we will at least be able to stabilize the patient.” (Transcript)

January 20: President Nixon delivered State of the Union address before joint session of Congress and sent written message to Congress. He said in speech: “In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology is capable of achieving. Now the time has come to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of man.” He would propose new “Federal partnership” in technological research and development “with Federal incentives to increase private research, federally supported research on projects ... to improve our everyday lives.”
In written message President said dealings with U.S.S.R. had “ad-

vanced the prospects for limiting strategic armaments. We have moved toward greater cooperation in space research and toward improving our economic relationships.”
President said he would request Dept, of Defense budget increase “to preserve the sufficiency of our strategic nuclear deterrent, including an allocation of over $900 million to improve our sea-based deterrent force.” He had instructed dod “to develop a program to build additional missile launching submarines, carrying a new and far more effective missile.”
Space program had been reoriented to produce increased domestic benefits: “In recent years, America has focused a large share of the technological energy on projects for defense and for space. These projects have had great value. Defense technology has helped us preserve our freedom and protect the peace. Space technology has enabled us to share unparalleled adventures and to lift our sights beyond earth’s bounds. The daily life of the average man has also been improved by much of our defense and space research—for example, by work on radar, jet engines, nuclear reactors, communications and weather satellites, and computers. Defense and space projects have also enabled us to build and maintain our general technological capacity, which—as a result—can now be more readily applied to civilian purposes.
“America must continue with strong and sensible programs of research and development for defense and for space. I have felt for some time, however, that we should also be doing more to apply our scientific and technological genius directly to domestic opportunities. Toward this end, I have already increased our civilian research and development budget by more than 40 percent since 1969 and have directed the National Science Foundation to give more attention to this area ....
“I recently announced support for the development of a new earth orbital vehicle that promises to introduce a new era in space research.” Reusable space shuttle would lower cost and risk of space operations and open new opportunities in weather forecasting, communications, monitoring natural resources, and air traffic safety. “The space shuttle is a wise national investment.”
Proposals included increase of $700 million in civilian R&D, 15% increase over previous year. And technically oriented agencies like NASA and Atomic Energy Commission would work more closely with agencies with primary social mission like Dept, of Transportation. {PD, 1/24/72, 74-92)

Though such writers could skip over the many difficulties and high costs required by any genuine settlement attempt, there is now increasing evidence that the moon may not be quite so inhospitable as scientists once believed. The possibility that on this, too, the science fiction writers may have been prophets no longer seems as fantastic as it did before the first men walked on the moon.” (NYT, 1/21/72, 46)

January 22:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed NASA
plans for continuing fruitful space program in interview published by Christian Science Monitor: “For the next few years, we may have fewer of the more spectacular explorational missions .... We will focus more on . . . communications satellites, weather satellites, earth resources survey satellites.”
Next Applications Technology Satellite (ats) would demonstrate direct TV broadcasting in region of Rockies and Alaska, using large satellite with big antenna that could beam programs directly to augmented receivers in individual homes. Demonstration—-in cooperation with Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare—would work through educational network rather than directly to homes, however.
Comsats were “not quite so exciting an aspect of space technology” in U.S. but, “worldwide, there has been more interest in this than in almost any other aspect of our program.” Interest equaled that of ERT satellite. “Countries with vigorous mineral exploitation and agricultural development are interested in ERT satellites .... Countries with underdeveloped communications and education, such as India, are keenly interested in the broadcasting satellites.”
In weather satellite field, new sophisticated instruments “give hope that we can get a really world weather observing network going.” Infrared sensors, microwave sensors, and high-resolution optics that obtained temperature profiles throughout atmosphere by looking “through holes in cloud systems” should help “to get points all over the globe where we now get only pieces of the picture.”
NASA would try processing materials in zero g during Skylab program. “If it works with men doing it, there are cheaper ways we could do it without men. It may be one of those things that will be worth doing when we can get routine access to space with the shuttle.”
In response to question, Dr. Fletcher said second Skylab would be “a very good thing for the country. But I’m not sure the budget needed for both a Skylab and the shuttle would be salable. The shuttle is more important in the long run. Not to do more of the Skylab sort of thing will be bad for prestige. The Russians will be doing much more than we will. I’m sure there will be criticism from Congress and the public.” But with shuttle and current budget level, “we could do virtually all those things we have talked about doing in this century. We could go back to the moon and establish crude bases .... We could establish a permanent space station. We just might be able to send men to Mars and get them safely home.”
Apollo industrial base had already been destroyed, Dr. Fletcher said. “We could assemble a nucleus of people who know these things within NASA. But that’s about all.” As NASA turned toward space shuttle, “We hope and expect that many of the people who worked on Apollo will be in that program, so we won’t lose all the basic space flight know-how.” In international cooperation, France had asked to participate in Skylab mission and U.S.-U.S.S.R. meetings to establish compatible space docking system had progressed. “It looks as though we can do it technically. With existing hardware, we could do a docking in something like 1974 to 1975.”

Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.—updated Senate Document 92-51 released Jan. 6 and discussed future directions and significant aspects of space programs. Soviet planetary probes Mars 2 (launched May 19, 1971) and Mars 3 (launched May 28, 1971) were studying temperatures, density, and constituents of Martian ionosphere, atmosphere, and surface. Joint experiment with France on Mars 3 had been studying solar wind. With Soviet start in planetary exploration during 1971, U.S. should continue to feel competition in planetary program until NASA Viking landed on Mars in 1976. nasa future plans gave prominent priority to space shuttle. While Soviet plans for reusable space vehicle had not been divulged, “it is hard to imagine their attainment of announced goals . . . without use of a shuttle.” U.S.S.R. talked of putting up space station in five years. “It may be that the long awaited new large launch vehicle will find use in lifting major components for such a station. Using this vehicle, the U.S.S.R. could put up its equivalent of the U.S. Skylab any time from 1972 on.” U.S.S.R. had recorded “wide variety of commitments ... to conduct wide-ranging program” of solar system exploration and of earth applications. They had discussed possibility of Grand Tour flights and of manned planetary missions. In space cooperation, “although no firm commitment has been made and no real timetable set, the possibility has been opened that some of the surplus Saturn IB and Apollo hardware might be used to send an American crew to dock with a future Soviet space station. Then perhaps later if a remaining Saturn V is used to put up a Skylab 2 ... a Soviet Soyuz might send a crew to dock with it. More joint planning and more funds will be required to accomplish these suggestions.” (Text)

January 24: President Nixon in message transmitting FY 1973 budget to Congress said: “We have been reordering our research and development investments in defense and space. We have reassessed the space program and placed it on a firm future footing with increased attention to practical and economical applications of space and reductions in the cost of manned space flight.
“. . . we have strengthened our defense research and development capability to insure that the country will not face the possibility of technological surprise or lack of the deterrent power necessary to protect our national security.” Therefore budget authority requested for Dept, of Defense research, development, technology, and engineering (rdt&e) was at all-time high.
President proposed measures “to emphasize this Administration’s strong belief that science and technology can make significant contributions to the quality of American life and to economic growth”; to encourage private investment in R&D, including investment by small firms with innovative ideas; to use NASA and Atomic Energy Commission talents on clean, economical energy and safe, fast transportation— “this year we shall have the agency which sent men to the moon and back begin to assist the Department of Transportation in finding better ways to send people downtown and hack”—and to review economic policies which might restrict utilization and development of technical advances.
President also said human resources spending would be 45% of FY 1973 budget, while defense programs would total 32%. Outlays requested for major environmental programs in 1973 were $2.5 billion, “more than three times the 1969 level.” {PD, 1/31/72, 104-17)

•	NASA released briefing (held Jan. 22) on FY 1973 budget request in
which Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said budget would “enable the United States space program to move forward on all fronts, on a basis consistent with realistic budgetary constraints both now and in the future.” Budget “fully supports President Nixon’s decision to proceed with development of the space shuttle, . . . achieves this and other basic objectives in science, in applications, and in aeronautics within a fiscal ’73 budget approximately equal to that of last year,” and “provides programs to do the kind of work this agency should be doing.”
In past NASA had presented programs that required relatively modest outlays in first year and subsequent substantial increases. In FY 1973 budget, “We have a well-balanced program that can be supported at an essentially constant budget level over the next several years.”
“Most important aspects” of NASA’s FY 1973 program were: “The decision to proceed with the space shuttle; a strong effort in space science and applications; a major increase in aeronautics; a change of scope in the outer planet exploration program; and a reorientation of our nuclear rocket program.” Significant changes from FY 1972 plans were in Grand Tour and nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) programs. Grand Tour of outer planets would be replaced with less complex missions to Jupiter and perhaps Saturn. In place of nerva, NASA would concentrate on defining small, high-energy nuclear propulsion system for missions to explore planets.
During 1973 and beyond, “NASA will put even greater emphasis on turning the knowledge and technology acquired through space research to the immediate and lasting benefits of mankind. The recent establishment of the Office of Applications was an important step in that direction.
“In aeronautics we will increase our efforts by 50 percent this year, directed mainly at the pressing domestic needs for quiet engines and quiet short-haul air transportation systems.”
Dr. Fletcher said nasa FY 1973 budget “maintains our manned space flight capability, contributes to national security, increases the opportunity for acquiring new scientific knowledge, encourages international cooperation, addresses the problems of society and the environment, and helps to assure continued American leadership in aeronautics.”
Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, discussed space shuttle funding: “The shuttle, as we now visualize it”—if it had pressure-fed boosters and 4.6- by 18.3-m (15- by 60-ft), 30 000-kg (65 000-lb) capacity—“will cost $5.5 billion to develop. This includes two flight vehicles.” Funding would “spread over more than 6 years, but the bulk of the funding will be expended over a six-year time period. In addition . . . there will be an investment in facilities of about $300 million. And if more orbiters and boosters are needed for flight applications, these will cost $250 and $50 million apiece. Our current estimates for the cost per flight are $7.7 million. This is less than most of the launch vehicles we’re using today.” (Transcript)

Science and Astronautics Space Shuttle-—Skylab: Manned Space Flight in the 1970’s, status report prepared by Committee staff at request of Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Olin E. Teague, from information from NASA space flight Centers and key industrial contractors.
Conclusions on Skylab program were that program was within projected costs; bulk of equipment and systems were meeting design requirements in performance and reliability; and, despite some problems in procuring and integrating experiments, schedules were being met and no flight delays or significant cost increases were anticipated. Serious consideration was recommended for several options: possibility of flying backup Skylab B in 1974-1976 period; possible revisits to Skylab A after first three flights; and use of remaining Saturn IB launch vehicles in earth resources and applications flights after Skylab A program, during 1974-1978 period.
Conclusions on space shuttle program were: Sufficient technology existed to undertake development of fully reusable, low-operation-cost, earth-orbital shuttle. Number of design possibilities had been studied, covering range of development costs. Regardless of design chosen, as development costs were reduced, system recurring operating costs increased. In addition to reducing cost of near-space operations by order of magnitude, shuttle offered many opportunities for increased flexibility of earth resource surveys and management, space manufacturing, and short-term rapid-response laboratory facilities. And shuttle could also be used to improve national security position. (Text)

•	“Political advantages and votes” were in the 50 000 jobs of space shuttle
program, New York Times said, “and in the lift it would give to the nation’s ailing aerospace industry.” Shuttle jobs over next four fiscal years would offset expected losses in jobs that would occur as Apollo and Skylab programs ended. “Thus, if President Nixon’s plan is approved, private employment under Government space contracts will level out during this period at not much less than its present total of 111,000 jobs.” Administration’s proposed $5.5-billion shuttle investment was to be augmented by up to $2 billion before program became operational in later 1980s. “During that decade, $3-billion to $4-billion more will probably be spent on shuttle operations—one-third of them for military flights—if the current plan is followed.” Annual shuttle spending would double in FY 1973 to $200 million, triple in FY 1974 to $600 million, and reach $1 billion in FY 1975.

January 25—27: House Committee on Science and Astronautics held 13th meeting with Panel on Science and Technology, with theme of remote sensing of earth resources. Dr. James C.

This work will lead, in turn, to the development of models of the natural world.” Earth resources, meteorological, and environmental satellite data and data relay capabilities would force “quantum jumps necessary to create the kinds of interconnected models of natural and human action that will be essential in the not too distant future.” Ability to observe and measure phenomena affecting everyday life was “one of the most important products of our space program.”
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National Science Foundation Director, said in keynote address U.S. had necessary equipment and techniques for remote sensing. “The scientific potential in geology, oceanography, hydrology, and a host of other disciplines is well known. . . . What we don’t know very well is the impact of the application of remote sensing technology on society and its goals and values.”

Samples were mare basalts and breccias with variety of premare igneous rocks. “The bulk chemical compositions and textures of these rocks confirm the previous conclusions that the lunar maria consist of a series of extrusive volcanic rocks that are rich in iron and poor in sodium. The breccias contain abundant clasts of anorthositic fragments along with clasts of basaltic rocks much richer in plagioclase than the mare basalts. These two rock types also occur as common components in soil samples from this site.

•	LeRoy E. Day, NASA Space Shuttle Program Deputy Director, described
studies of shuttle’s effect on payload development costs during speech before American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics Rocky Mountain Section in Boulder, Colo.: “A number of . . . payloads have been flown and historical design and program cost data were available. We have determined by actual preliminary design, preparation of program plans, and detailed costing analyses, that these payloads could have been redesigned to fly on the shuttle with payload development cost savings ... of 50% of the historical baseline. The studies conclude that the cost of developing payloads (the major portion of space program costs) can be reduced primarily as a result of the shuttle’s ability to retrieve payloads for reuse, refurbishment and updating.”
Dichotomy of unmanned and manned space programs should not be perpetuated, Day said. U.S. needed to continue “vigorous and meaningful manned space program” that did not “obscure the automated satellite programs.” Shuttle was “the one mechanism that can effectively support both goals in an optimum way” within national space budget.

•	President Nixon’s “enthusiastic support” of space shuttle had “pumped
fresh breath of life” into NASA, “buoyed the spirits of a flagging aerospace industry and lost no friends in politically vital West Coast and southern states,” Robert Gillette said in Science article. Shuttle endorsed by President was “considerably less ambitious, and at least a billion dollars cheaper, than the shuttle NASA has fought for” but “in basic outline it remains unchanged. . . .” Shuttle “and its presidential stamp of approval stand as a tribute to NASA’s deft and persistent salesmanship, a talent marked by careful acquiescence to political and economic realities and by a willingness to bleed other programs, including Apollo, to keep the shuttle alive.”
While “some budget bureau officials are said to be unhappy with the magnitude, the design, and the pace of the shuttle project as it

now stands,” prospects for “scuttling the shuttle are slim.” Shuttle possessed few of sst’s intrinsic weaknesses. Central moral issue raised by the sst was “the propriety of government subsidy for an essentially commercial enterprise.” Shuttle “has no such commercial overtones, and, by any measure, it is a more truly national enterprise.”
Congressional attack on supersonic transport program, while largely based on project’s economics, had drawn strength from “vast and vocal public constituency aroused by alarms ... of environmental damage.” No such catalytic issue seemed likely to arise in shuttle debate. Gillette quoted unidentified Senate aide as saying, “Unless we can pull together the kind of public campaign that brought down the SST, the shuttle is going to get by this year without a thorough examination and without an adversary hearing in Congress.” (Science, 1/28/72, 392-6)

•	Creative science in U.S. was in transition state, Dr. William D. McElroy,
National Science Foundation Director, said in Science editorial. “And much of the feedback associated with this fermentation is focused on NSF, which in this country is often equated with creative science and scientists.” Historically, nsf had devoted large portion of its resources to “pursuit of disciplinary science—research and science education motivated solely by the intrinsic needs of a discipline or the creative needs of individual scientists. This kind of programming has been highly successful and must continue, for it is the bedrock of all scientific enterprise. However, there must also be a heightened awareness of the requirements placed on all science, and for this reason, a significant share of the total resources available to NSF in the future must be devoted to the social and technological needs of the nation. This, however, does not mean that the Foundation should be diverted from its earlier and historical purpose; in fact, this diversification should be construed as a means of strengthening that purpose.” (Science, 1/28/72, 361)

Worse, they would have us abandon our hard-won leadership in an area where United States ingenuity and creativity visibly overcame the lead of our principal world competitor and proved the American free enterprise system is still Number One when the chips are down.” (Text)

Orbital parameters: 244 011-km (151621.4-mi) apogee, 416-km (258.5-mi) perigee, and 90.2° inclination.
All vehicle systems monitored during launch functioned normally. Second burn of 2nd stage and ignition and burnout of 3rd stage occurred over Indian Ocean south of African continent. By Feb. 6 all flight experiments had been turned on and were working properly and all spacecraft systems were still functioning normally Feb. 23. On Feb. 18 NASA officially judged mission successful.
Primary NASA objective was to place spacecraft into orbit that would permit successful achievement of esro scientific objectives and provide tracking and telemetry support. Satellite—16-sided cylinder with 70% of its outer surface covered with solar cells—carried seven experiments to investigate strength and direction of magnetic fields, energy distribution of protons and electrons, and nature of solar winds; make very-low-frequency solar observations; and detect micrometeorites.
Heos 2 was second heos mission. Heos 1 had been launched Dec. 5, 1968, and was still in orbit. After orbital insertion, spacecraft was controlled from European Space Operations Center (esoc) and tracked by European Space Tracking Stations (estrack).

spacecraft for missions to outer planets had been made for NASA by panel chaired by Dr. Francis S. Johnson of Univ. of Texas at Dallas. Extensive study of outer solar system was “one of the major objectives of space science in this decade.” Panel recommended thermoelectric outer planets spacecraft (tops) be developed and used in Grand Tour missions of late 1970s; Pioneer-level program be maintained for exploration of Jupiter and Saturn and their satellites every two years; Pioneer-F and -G evaluate radiation environment of Jupiter and Pioneer-H be readied for Jupiter magnetosphere mission to further evaluate planet’s radiation if necessary; NASA ground-based research on planetary exploration be continued; even-segment Titan booster or its equivalent be developed for outer planet exploration; support be provided for scientific advisory committees, development of instrumentation, and studies of alternative mission strategies for Jupiter and Saturn exploration; and NASA development of methods of solar and nuclear electric propulsion be continued.
Report recommended programs for three funding levels: four tops Grand Tour missions in 1976-1980 period at $400-million annual budget level, compromise between Grand Tour missions and outer solar systems programs like modified Pioneer missions at $250-million-a-year level, and varied program of outer solar system exploration using modified Pioneer spacecraft at lowest funding level, approximately $400 million over one decade, (nas-nrc—nae News Rpt, 1/72, 8-9)
• Advanced technology aircraft to evolve from increased NASA, Dept, of Transportation, and Dept, of Defense use of research and experimental aircraft were described in Astronautics & Aeronautics by Langley Research Center Director Edgar M. Cortright. “nasa, in coordination with DOD and DOT, plans a program to design and manufacture two STOL transports. Although these aircraft probably will be smaller than anticipated production models, they will suit the needs of developing promising stol augmented-lift concepts, control systems, and crosswind landing gear. They will be able to operate within acceptable noise limits to and from stol strips about 2000 ft [610 m] long.”
Joint NASA-Army plan “should lead to advanced helicopter and tilt-rotor research vehicles. Although oriented primarily toward military applications, the research results will apply to commercial vtol transports.”
Advanced subsonic transports of the 1980s “will incorporate most of the applicable advanced technology . . . with significant gains in productivity. A longer range, higher capacity SST [supersonic transport] would fill a need on the transatlantic routes and the longer routes across the Pacific. And no forecaster can discount the possibility of a hypersonic transport (hst) for the 1990s.” (A&A, 1/72, 30-4)

•	Research scientists had been invited to submit proposals for Skylab
experiments studying use of weightlessness, NASA announced. Experiments would use weightlessness in space to develop improved techniques for preparing biological materials and for studying crystal growth, solidification, and other aspects of nonorganic substances. One invitation was for electrophoresis—motion of charged particles through fluid while under influence of electrical field. Use of technique on ground was hampered by effects of heat convection in fluid and sedimentation. Second invitation was for investigations of solidification effects, crystal growth, and other phenomena in weightless materials, using either small multipurpose electric furnace or system for levitating small samples of molten materials and closely observing them as they cooled and solidified. First experiments could be flown on Skylab missions beginning in 1973. (NASA Release 72-22)

February 2:	Mariner 9 news conference was held at NASA Hq. Spacecraft
(launched May 31, 1971) was in 81st day in Mars orbit, had accepted 25 000 commands, and had taken about 5000 pictures. Dr. Bradford Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said wind-transported dust that had obscured early Mariner 9 photography was more widespread and occurred more frequently than generally had been supposed; substantial quantities of surface dust were displaced each Martian year by local winds that varied with season and with specific areagraphie location; and large-scale atmospheric instabilities occurred, producing hemispheric and global dust storms which were seasonal but apparently did not occur every Martian year. Storm observed by Mariner 9 had begun in late September 1971, reached its peak in late October, and had cleared slowly until mid-December. Planet was quite clear in February.
Mariner .9 photos included pictures of huge volcano with base 500 km (300 mi) wide, Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey told press. “. . . as the storm cleared we were able to establish that the dark spots that we saw barely sticking up through at first” were “the very summit of Nix Olympica. This tall mountain with a complex crater at the top and the scalloped edges and the flat, or non-raised rims indicated to us that this was probably a multiple volcanic vent. As the storm continued clearing finally we could see all the way down to the great plains at the base of the mountain. Now this is a great volcanic pile .. . twice as big as the great volcanic pile that forms the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian pile is about 225 kilometers [140 miles] across and . . . about 9 kilometers [6 miles] high. It is the largest volcanic pile on the earth. It is something like 32,000 feet [9800 meters] from the floor of the Pacific to the top of the mountain.”

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
February 2
Photos also showed “spectacular channel” 100 km (60 mi) long with numerous side branching valleys that ended in featureless areas. Absence of vents at ends of valleys made gaseous eruption formation improbable and suggested channel might have been formed by water erosion. Highest amount of water vapor—one thousandth of that in earth’s atmosphere—above Mars’ south polar cap suggested that water vapor was being released from region as cap retreated. Absence of vapor over north polar cap indicated that water vapor there was condensed in carbon dioxide and was transported by storm or by general circulation from south polar cap to north polar cap. Vapor over south polar regions was slightly less than 20 precipitable micrometers.
Mariner 9 photos of Mars had provided data which conflicted with data from 1969 Mariner 7 Mars probe. From 1969 photos of heavily cratered planet experimenters had decided that Mars was “a dead planet, very primordial . . . the product of the accumulation of the cosmic debris that fell in to form the planet.” Mariner 9 photos showed “something very, very different indeed. ... we can see the great volcanic piles and because of the crispness of the edges and the lack of craters, we think these are geologically young . . . [and] we have a geochemically evolved planet.” Comparison of 1969 and 1971 photos showed that south polar cap regions completely covered by frost in 1969 were only partially covered in 1971. During period when photographed by Mariner 9 little separations had widened and solid carbon dioxide coverage had broken up until many dark spots showed through as the ice sublimated and revealed underlying dark rocks.
Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado reported that Mars atmosphere was primarily carbon dioxide but also contained atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen. “The atomic oxygen comes presumably from the photo-dissociation of carbon dioxide and the atomic hydrogen comes most probably from the photo-dissociation of water vapor.” Amount of atomic hydrogen varied very little with altitude. Atomic hydrogen extended some 20 000 km (12 000 mi) from planet like a “great big sphere of glowing hydrogen atoms with the spacecraft running around through it. Those hydrogen atoms are put there from photo-dissociating water vapor and because of the very low gravitational field of Mars, it is relatively easy for these atoms to escape. In fact, the picture that we have, is that water comes up out of the surface of Mars, goes into the lower atmosphere . . . [and] gets deposited in the polar caps; when the polar caps thaw, it is released into the atmosphere.” Atomic hydrogen was escaping into upper atmosphere at rate equal to 380 cu m (100 000 gallons) of water per day.

•	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented NASA’s FY 1973
authorization request before House Committee on Science and Astronautics as hearings opened. He emphasized importance of space program to U.S. national economy: “Scientific knowledge, scientific exploration, and the practical applications of aeronautics and space are enormously important in their own right. But perhaps most important of all is the need for the United States to have a continuously advancing technology. To meet the pressing social problems of our times requires above all a sound economy operating at a high level of employment to generate the tax revenues required at all levels of government. To maintain such an economy in a competitive world, we must increase our productivity year after year, decade after decade. The only way in the long term to keep increasing our productivity is through advancing our technology.
“I know of no other activity which has done and can do as much to keep the United States strong in advanced technology as NASA’s programs in space and aeronautics.” Economic necessity for advanced technology; “the direct practical benefits of space applications and improved aircraft, including their significance for national defense; and . . . the human and future practical values of increased understanding of the earth, sun, moon, planets, and universe—these are the basic reasons for maintaining a strong national program in space and aeronautics.”

Dr. Fletcher said that NASA’s FY 1973 program “moves forward in that it fully supports President Nixon’s decision to proceed with the development of the Space Shuttle, the keystone to the Nation’s future in space; it continues our major ongoing space programs; and it provides a 50 percent step-up in our work in aeronautics. It is realistic in that it supports these objectives within a fiscal year 1973 budget approximately equal to that of last year, and under a plan that does not commit the Nation to higher total NASA budget levels in future •• years.” (Transcript)

•	President Nixon, in message to Congress outlining 1972 environmental
program, said: “The time has come to increase the technological resources allocated to the challenges of meeting high-priority domestic needs.” Temptation “to cast technology in the role of ecological villain must be resisted—for to do so is to deprive ourselves of a vital tool available for enhancing environmental quality. . . . The difficulties which some applications of technology have engendered might indeed be rectified by turning our backs on the 20th century, but only at a price in privation which we do not want to pay and do not have to pay.” Technology “must be wisely applied so that it becomes environmentally self-corrective. This is the standard for which we must aim.”
President said he had requested in budget $23-million increase in research and development funds for reducing aircraft noise and additional $88 million for development of “broad spectrum of new technologies for producing clean energy.” These would include “new or increased efforts on fusion power, solar energy, magnetohydrodynamics, industrial gas from coal, dry cooling towers for power plant waste heat, large energy storage batteries and advanced underground electric transmission lines.” He also proposed establishment of $100-million Voluntary Fund for Environment by United Nations to which U.S. would contribute “fair share ... on a matching basis over the first 5 years” to improve global environment. “We are now growing accustomed to the view of our planet as seen from space—a blue and brown disk shrouded in white patches of clouds.

Group met in Neuilly, France, to identify potential areas for European participation in U.S. post-Apollo space program. In statement issued Feb. 11 Group said NASA, “noting President Nixon’s approval on Jan. 5, 1972, to proceed with development of the space shuttle,” had encouraged European participation in shuttle development. NASA expected that European participation would be “within the context of a broader program which included multilateral European responsibility for development of a major element such as reusable space tugs to provide access to geosynchronous and other orbits” beyond shuttle’s capability or “shuttle-borne orbital laboratories” for research by U.S. and European scientists. Group recommended calendar for actions to permit governmental decisions consistent with July 1 NASA commencement of shuttle development. (NASA Note to Editors, 2/11/72)
February 9: President Nixon sent United States Foreign Policy for the 1970’s: The Emerging Structure for Peace to Congress. Third annual report on U.S. foreign policy analyzed world situation. Of space, President said; “As our astronauts have seen, the unity of the Earth is experienced most vividly from outer space. And conversely, seen from our planet, space itself is a frontier to mankind as a whole, not merely to individual nations. Space is, therefore, an unparalleled field for cooperation among nations.
“As we move into the second decade of space exploration, the U.S. is committed to work with others in space for the benefit of all mankind. We are taking whatever steps can reasonably and properly be taken to work with other countries in the development of their space skills.
“Specifically, we have assured the European Space Conference that its member countries may obtain our assistance in launching satellites which are for peaceful purposes and which are consistent with international obligations embodied in such agreements as the Outer Space Treaty and the arrangements for the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (intelsat). We are prepared to consider such assistance to other interested countries. In addition, we are working closely with the Europeans on the concepts and design of a reusable space transportation system.
“Over the past year, NASA has agreed with the Soviet Academy of Sciences to significant cooperation in specific space tasks, and in the exchange of information and plans concerning our respective space programs. We have exchanged samples of lunar soil. We are examining together the means to enable Soviet manned spacecraft and our own to rendezvous and dock in space. Joint expert groups have been meeting

“In 1971, after years of negotiation in which the United States has played a leading role, the United Nations General Assembly approved an Outer .Space Liability Convention. . . .
“Last year also brought a new definitive charter for the operation of INTELSAT. . . .”
President said NASA-Soviet Academy of Sciences space cooperation had been among series of U.S.—Soviet agrements, “striking both in their diversity and in their promise of mutual advantage.”
But in “changed world” conditioning U.S. foreign policy, President noted “the end of an indisputable U.S. superiority in strategic strength,” and its replacement by a strategic balance in which the U.S. and Soviet nuclear forces were comparable. U.S.S.R. had continued to improve its capability in “virtually every category of strategic offensive and defensive weapons. . . . Soviet strategic forces, even at current levels, have the potential of threatening our land-based ICBMs if the Soviets choose to make certain qualitative improvements. They have the necessary technological base.” People’s Republic of China Was “continuing to, develop a strategic offensive capability. The possibility of accidental attacks remains.” President said it was wise for U.S. to begin Safeguard abm deployment, but “we may soon complete a salt agreement with the USSR which will limit abm deployment.”
President commended 1970 Hague and Montreal International Civil Aviation Organization conventions to deter aircraft hijacking and sabotage: “These two conventions will increase the likelihood that hijackers, saboteurs, and persons committing other attacks against civil aircraft will be punished. . . . Universal ratification would ensure that air pirates could find no place to hide.
“We intend to press for wide adherence to these agreements and for continued international cooperation, including exchanges of information on security measures. We will also continue to urge international agreement to suspend air service to countries which refuse to cooperate in the release of hijacked aircraft and in the punishment of hijackers.” (PD, 2/14/72, 235-411)

February 11:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, refuted econom-

In this way, they reach the totally false conclusion that the Shuttle program will cost $30 or $40 billion over the next two decades.
“Their figures are wrong, and their logic is wrong. It is against common sense to add the operational costs of the Shuttle to the development costs .... The cost of using the Shuttle to carry out a space mission should be added to the cost of the mission. Actually we will be saving money, not spending money, every time we use the Shuttle for a space mission.”
Shuttle development cost would be “about $6 billion to be spent over the next six or seven years” not $30 or $40 billion “as some Shuttle critics say.” (Text)

Dr. Naugle presented plan under study for “much more modest outer planets exploration program” instead of originally proposed two-mission, four-spacecraft Grand Tour of all outer planets, canceled because of budgetary restrictions. Jupiter exploration would continue. “We are studying a mission for the initial exploration of Saturn. We would take advantage of the rare alinement of the planets to launch two Mariner-class spacecraft in 1977 on a trajectory which would carry them first past Jupiter and on to Saturn to investigate that strange planet. ... At present, this program appears to be an excellent outer planets mission within the current constraints. However, we are studying other options with our science advisory groups to determine the set of outer planets missions which provide the most significant scientific information.” Viking project to softland spacecraft on Mars in 1976 remained “most significant element of the ongoing planetary exploration program.”
Mariner 9’s orbiting of Mars had been major highlight in 1971 planetary program. To date, “Mariner 9 . . . has been in orbit 96 days, is still healthy and operating nominally. ... it has transmitted back to Earth over 5700 pictures of Mars, a number of closeups of its two moons, and measurements of surface features and atmospheric properties by ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers.” NASA had mapped approximately 66% of Martian surface at resolution of 1 km (0.6 mi) or better.
“To date we have visited Venus and Mars, and will soon reach Jupiter and Mercury. Within the next year we shall have studied Mars in detail from orbit and within 5 years shall have begun an intensive automated exploration of its surface. By the end of the decade we expect to know whether life exists, has existed, or could exist on Mars.”

“Space” science, Dr. Naugle said, was no different from research man had been doing on earth . . . since he became man: “Man does love to wonder—to explore and understand his environment. The ability to wonder—the desire to extend one’s horizon—is a measure of the mental health and vigor of an individual or a society. The ability of a nation to educate its youth and provide them with the necessary tools to explore our environment, whether it be the innermost secrets of the nucleon or the outermost regions of the universe, is one measure of that Nation’s vigor and its capability to better understand, and in turn guide and control, its destiny.” (Transcript)

orbital science, Apollo 15 added as much new data as that gathered by the three previous missions combined.” Mission had marked first use of Lunar Rover and of orbital science experiments to collect lunar-wide information. “The scientific returns from lunar orbit and surface have significantly increased our accumulated knowledge of the moon and by extrapolation of the data from this vacuum-packed laboratory, knowledge of the solar system, including our earth.”
Upon completion of Apollo program with Apollo 17 in December, “we will have accumulated a vast treasure of lunar data. Many exciting scientific results have already been published; however, an adequate assessment of the total body of data will require scientific effort for years to come.
“As Apollo draws to a close, we are concentrating our activities in earth orbit—the primary field of manned space flight during this decade.” Skylab was “first step in this direction” and “one of the most significant benefit-oriented programs of the space age.” Skylab was four times larger than Soviet Salyut spacecraft and weighed 77 180 kg (170 000 lbs) with total 344 cu m (12 150 cu ft) pressurized volume. Skylab typified variety of activities that could be accomplished in space. “Several years ago we began to look at this total space arena in a different way. . . . While we were driving toward our goal of a manned lunar landing ... a distinction was made . . . between manned and unmanned flight programs.” Distinction “really does not exist” in nasa’s program for 1970s. “The transition is already underway in Skylab.”
Survey of total space activity had also led to shuttle concept. “We started with a fully reusable system . . . using winged flyback booster and orbiter stages with all fuel carried in internal tanks.” Studies confirmed feasibility. Estimated development costs were close to $10 billion, but cost per flight, at $4.1 million, “made it extremely attractive.” Problem was lack of funds. NASA “learned that there were cost advantages in using an expendable liquid hydrogen tank for the orbiter.” This became baseline with booster configuration unchanged except for modification. While process reduced development costs, expendability of tanks increased flight costs. NASA found “additional savings could be made if we placed both the hydrogen and the oxygen tanks outside the orbiter.” In efforts to economize on booster development, NASA first considered “flyback booster incorporating F—1 engines and phasing orbiter systems” and later “unmanned ballistic boosters.” Leading candidates were recoverable and reusable pressure-fed liquid-propellant booster and booster with solid-fueled rocket motors. Contractors were completing studies, and decision would be made shortly.
Mathematica report of study for NASA in May 1971 had shown shuttle with flyback manned booster was cost-effective when averaging 39 flights a year. Myers submitted new edition of report, incorporating refined data and changes in shuttle configuration, which showed shuttle cost effective with traffic as low as 30 flights per year.
“I believe that practically all of this country’s future earth-orbital space activities will use the Shuttle’s capability in exploiting the potential benefits of space and providing the taxpayer as large a return of his space investment as possible.” (Transcript)

•	Roy P. Jackson, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space
Technology, during hearings hy House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology on FY 1973 NASA authorization, testified that recently developed NASA technology could have increased supersonic transport’s investment return rate. Calculations had been made showing that “incorporation of now emerging technology for static stability augmentation and active flutter control could have allowed a weight savings, and thus a payload increase, of better than 16,000 pounds, or an additional return on investment of about 7.5
NASA research and technology in aerodynamics, configurations, materials, structures, propulsion, and avionics applicable to advanced long-haul transport aircraft design showed “real promise.” Application of automated active control concepts “could result in considerable weight savings by eliminating the need for inherent aerodynamic stability and thereby reducing the size of control surfaces. It could also result in reduced structural fatigue for longer life, lower structural loads for lighter structures, and ride quality control and active damping of aircraft flutter for a more comfortable ride.” (Transcript)

February 22:	Apollo 16 press conference was held at NASA Hq. Dr.
Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Manager, said Apollo 16 lunar landing site would consist of volcanic highland material. “The highlands which we are landing on . . . are composed of two types of units. One type is material formed early in lunar history and subsequently fragmented and redistributed by the numerous meteorite impacts which have scarred the lunar highlands. These units are predominantly ejecta deposits now. And on Apollo 15 with the genesis rock we hopefully have sampled some of these early deposits. The second major unit ... is materials which have modified these early deposits by flooding them or building up on top of them predominantly by volcanic processes. The primary objective of Apollo 16 is the exploration and sampling of this lighter type of highland terrain with hopefully a fragment or two of the old original stuff brought in by impact from . . . the old original crust which is probably still exposed down in the lower southern hemisphere.”
Dr. M. E. Langseth of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory explained changes in drill design, with joints to permit core samples to be brought out more readily.

• Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, appraised scientific contributions of Apollo program in testimony during House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight hearings on nasa FY 1973 authorization bill.
“. . . Apollo 11 crew crossed over four hundred thousand kilometers (250,000 miles) of space to touch another planetary body. Four teams of astronauts, from Apollos 11, 12, 14 and 15 . . . have now made the epic journey and walked the lunar surface. They have returned some 176 kg (388 lbs.) of lunar rocks and soils for analysis in earth-based laboratories and have established scientific stations on the moon that are continuously transmitting scientific and engineering data back to earth.” Apollo data, with information expected from continued sample analysis and lunar data analysis in the post-Apollo period, “surely will be of practical value to man, even helping him to cope with current environmental problems on earth.”
NASA sample analysis program had “required unprecedented advancement in instrumentation and techniques to perform multiple element and isotope analyses with extreme precision on minute amounts of sample.” Improved high-resolution instruments made “detailed investigations of surface features and internal structure of materials.”
Other related important breakthroughs had been computer hardware and software for processing and reducing large amounts of analytical data in a very short time. “These advances, in large part stimulated by NASA-funded meteorite studies, were absolutely essential, because of the scientifically unique, but limited, lunar materials. . . . these high precision research methods can now or will soon be routinely utilized in industrial processes and laboratories.” They could also “be immediately applied to a variety of environmental and biomedical problems by providing the capability to check and monitor levels of pollutants and toxic elements in our atmosphere, water, and foods.”
Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider outlined program’s progress: “During the coming fiscal year testing and checkout will be completed and operation of Skylab will have started. Within 2 years, the first Skylab . . . will have become part of history, having contributed new knowledge in many fields.”
Skylab offered “an earth observation capability never before available” to U.S. manned spacecraft. During eight-month mission, Skylab would fly over entire U.S. except Alaska, over much of Europe, all of Africa, Australia, China, and almost all of South America—covering 75% of earth’s surface and passing over each point every five days. By end of 1971, 288 investigations requiring Skylab data had been submitted, 249 U.S. and 39 foreign. Of these, 164 had been identified for further study. Skylab was “first manned space flight program designed specifically to carry activities and equipment explicitly aimed at improving man’s life on earth. It will contribute significantly to the increase of knowledge of pure science and is also an experimental space station; a forerunner of permanent space stations of the future.” Earth-oriented sensors would test technology for synoptic surveys of many environmental and ecological systems. Solar and astronomical

observations and other science experiments would expand knowledge of solar system, universe, and near-earth space. Biomedical experiments would inform how man’s well-being and ability to function were affected by living in space.
Harry H. Gorman, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management in Office of Manned Space Flight, testified on $305-million FY 1973 budget request for development, test, and mission operations in manned space flight research and development program: “This is the first year in which this activity is presented as a separate item. . . With near-completion of Apollo program, “we believe it iinportant to separately identify and control this basic capability which has been built up. . . . This work is essential to the support of the Nation’s space programs for the 1970’s and beyond.” Requested funding would provide for contractor support of in-house capabilities for Apollo and Skylab programs; for definition, design, development, and subsystem testing activities in shuttle program; and for pre-definition and definition of future programs, including High Energy Astronomy Observatory, Stratoscope 1 and 2, and Earth Observation Satellites.

February 22-24, 29: Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, continued testimony on FY 1973 authorization before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. He announced Feb. 24 NASA’s decision to substitute two flybys of Jupiter and Saturn for Grand Tour of all five outer planets.
New plan—necessitated by budgetary restrictions and congressional recommendation, and endorsed by National Academy of Sciences— National Research Council’s Space Science Board—would launch two spacecraft in 1977 on trajectory that would carry them by Jupiter and then Saturn during rare alignment of planets. Spacecraft for mission would be based on Mariners developed to explore inner planets Mars, Venus, and Mercury. They would have large antennas for longdistance communication, be powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators, carry more than 68 kg (153 lbs) of instrumentation including TV cameras, and be launched by Titan-Centaur-Burner III boosters and accelerated by Jupiter’s gravity and orbital velocity for flight to Saturn. Possible Saturn encounters included flying close to planet’s satellite Titan—larger than planet Mercury and only satellite known to have atmosphere. Spacecraft would encounter Jupiter in about IV2 yrs and Saturn about 3% yrs after launch. Mission plan flexibility would permit selection of different flyby trajectory at Saturn for second spacecraft based on data from first. Plan would maintain option to use Pioneer-class spacecraft for Jupiter and Saturn orbiters in late 1970s. Project responsibility had been assigned to Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
In other testimony, Dr. Naugle said NASA had developed heat sterilization techniques for Viking lander and new thermoradiation techniques expected to have future space and industrial applications. Program initiated measures to ensure that all planetary missions had “acceptably low probability of impacting or contaminating the target planets.” (Transcript; NASA Release 72-42)

February 23—24:	NASA officials continued testimony before House Com-
mittee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology during FY 1973 authorization hearings.
Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology Roy P. Jackson reported “excellent results” in first acoustic tests, completed in November 1971, of experimental quiet engine for conventional takeoff and landing (ctol) aircraft. “In an unsuppressed baseline configuration . . . the noise levels were the equivalent of at least 3 EPNdB [epndb, effective perceived noise in decibels] lower than the original targets. In a first cut simulation of an acoustically suppressed nacelle which was not an optimum design, the noise levels were from 7 to 9 EPNdB lower yet, with aerodynamic performance losses no greater than expected.” It appeared possible to design an advanced version of ctol engine “which will incorporate all the advances in technology and will have a more nearly optimum trade-off between noise reduction and installed weight penalty.”
In FY 1973, $2.5 million was requested for program to reduce noise of short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft to 95 epndb at 500 ft (150 m). Tests at Flight Research Center of quieted T-34 high-bypass-ratio engine operating with simulated wing-flap system would develop design data for both quiet, experimental stol (questol) aircraft program and quiet, clean, STOL experimental engine program.

budget request of $2.5 million, focused on lift fans with additional work on helicopter rotor noise. Acoustic and aerodynamic data would continue to be developed in tests at Langley, Ames, and Lewis Research Centers.
George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), described NASA role in Joint nasa, Federal Aviation Administration, and Dept, of Defense microwave landing system (mls) development plan to provide landing system for civil and military use to replace current very-high-frequency (vhf) landing system. NASA would provide personnel in faa mls Project Office, chairmanship of the mls Interagency Advisory Group, flight-test validation of the mls for stol operations, and extension of our work in FY 1973 to include ctol and vtol aircraft. “We are convinced the national microwave landing system program will make significant contributions toward noise abatement, airport congestion relief, and, especially, safety enhancement in the airport area.”
Gerald G. Kayten, Director of Transport Experimental Program Office in oast, said on Feb. 23 that NASA programs would “provide a foundation upon which industry can base the design and development of the new stol systems in the late 1970’s, and upon which the Government can establish criteria for certification and regulation of such systems.” Programs also would enable Government to make 1976 decision on vertical short takeoff and landing (v/stol) incorporation recommended in Dept, of Transportation Northeast Corridor Report. “NASA’s main focus is on propulsive-lift technology for effective and economical STOL capability, engine technology for development of quiet and clean STOL propulsion systems, and airborne STOL avionics and system technology.” Technology represented “totally new capability based on major advances in each of several technical disciplines.”
Albert J. Evans, Director of Military Aircraft Programs Office in oast, on Feb. 24 described support of military aircraft development programs. NASA had assigned research engineers to F-15 and B-l aircraft and Air Force prototype systems program offices. “This has put NASA ‘on the scene’ as technical problems become recognized and defined, and brings NASA’s technical capabilities ... to bear on the problems at an early date.” F—15 would make first flight early in FY 1973 “with about 12,000 nasa wind tunnel hours behind it, and much technical consultation by NASA staff members with the Air Force and the industry that is developing the F—15.” F—15 operational engine would be installed at Lewis Research Center to analyze air flow through engine components, combustion efficiency, and performance characteristics. nasa would analyze F-15 engine and airframe performance and flight-test aircraft at LeRC, where similar tests would be run on Air Force AX aircraft in cooperation with usaf. In B-l program, four frc engineers would be assigned to usaf Systems Program Office and contractor to assist in establishing flight-test requirements and instrumentation to verify analytical design techniques and ground-test data obtained at small scale in wind tunnels and information from simulator studies.

Bureau of Mines program would develop carbon monoxide detecting system, arc and U.S. Dept, of Agriculture would develop hydroponic system for spacecraft to accelerate plant growth under space flight conditions.
“The medical information needed to assure man’s safe journey into and return from space has led to the development of many items of information and equipment of great value to terrestrial medicine.” NASA life sciences program “exemplifies the success which can be achieved by combining the special talents of Government, industry, and university scientists.”
Dr. Berry also reported there had been “no findings in the manned space flights to date by the United States or U.S.S.R. that would preclude the commitment of man to longer duration missions. Therefore ... we feel confident in committing man to a 28-day mission.” Apollo 16 and 17 and Skylab experiments would study physiological response of body before commitment to 56-day Skylab mission.
Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Advanced Missions in omsf, testified on space shuttle orbital systems and advanced missions definition and planning: In areas of payloads, research and applications modules (ram), advanced missions, and advanced development, “principal effort is directed toward developing . . . understanding and planning the use of the shuttle.” In RAM program, “we will be continuing the study of concepts of a family of payload carrier modules suitable for transport in the Shuttle Orbiter cargo bay.” Modules would range from “austere shuttle ‘Sortie Can’ with relatively simple laboratory equipment . . . through more sophisticated, dedicated laboratory and observation facilities, including automated free-flyers serviced by the Shuttle.”
Sortie mission using orbiter as platform for short-duration experiments was among most promising shuttle operating modes. Mission would use advantages of shuttle in payload design, development, and operation, and, “for the first time, permit the investigator to accompany his experiment into space.” Sortie missions would be modeled after arc Airborne Research Program in which Convair 990 aircraft was used as airborne laboratory. “The goal in developing procedures for managing the Space Shuttle Sortie Missions will be to retain the relatively simple, flexible and highly responsive aspects of the ‘990’ program.” (Transcript)

•	Reporting on Jan. 10-13 Third Lunar Science Conference results, Science
said “far more comprehensive picture of the moon but far fewer claims to understand how the moon evolved were evident.” Conflict in geochemical evidence suggested “an initially cold moon in which partial melting of its outer layers took place and magnetic evidence that suggests an initially hot moon with a molten core during the early part of its history.” Other puzzles were indication that radioactive materials on moon’s surface were concentrated in one area and evidence of unexpectedly high heat flux from moon’s interior at Apollo 15 site. Seismic evidence that moon had layered crust 65 km (40 mi) thick had been unexpected. More details on lunar chronology had been determined, “such as the date of formation of the Imbrium basin about 4.0 billion years ago and of the Copernicus Crater only 900 million years ago.” It also appeared that, “because of the initially high rate of meteoroid impacts on the moon, very little if any of the original crustal rocks have survived.” Lunar-sample chemistry was “proving far from easy—the possibility that volatile elements have migrated on the lunar surface ... is complicating the analysis of trace constituents.” Despite complications, “scientific understanding of the moon is much further advanced than . . . even a year ago. The systematic coverage of the moon’s surface provided by the orbital experiments on Apollo 15, in combination with the lunar samples, laboratory work, and the experiments on the lunar surface have provided new data to replace what sometimes proved to be unfounded speculations.” (Hammond, Science, 2/25/72, 868-70)

engineers and scientists from Government, industry, and airlines. Meeting included interim report of NASA supercritical wing flight-test program and report on evolution of F-8 supercritical wing configuration. Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, head of 8-Foot Tunnels Branch at Langley Research Center and developer of supercritical wing concept, commented on correlation of wind-tunnel and flight-test results.
Flight tests of nasa supercritical wing on TF-8A aircraft had demonstrated that new airfoil shape increased flight efficiency at speeds near mach 1. Since its first flight March 9, 1971, TF-8A had carried supercritical wing on 27 flights and had reached mach 1.2 (1274 km per hr; 792 mph) and 15 500-km (51 000-ft) altitude, nasa test pilot Thomas C. McMurtry said flight-test program had indicated that piloting procedures and tasks at near-sonic cruise speeds should be as routine as present jet transport operations and that introduction of supercritical wing was not expected to cause any serious problems. Future plans for supercritical wing included addition of side fairings for increased area ruling, determination by simulation of effects of wing roughness from manufacturing imperfections, and development of plans for follow-on flight programs to further the readiness of new technology for industry applications, (frc Release 2—72; frc X—Press, 2/18/72, 2)

Data Acquisition, described telemetry on-line processing system (telops)—nasa’s planned “new approach to data processing”—in testimony during House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology hearings on NASA FY 1973 authorization, telops, planned to replace NASA data processing system that took “considerable number of weeks between the acquisition of data . . . and the actual delivery of that data to the experimenter,” would increase processing speed and efficiency so that “both the greater real-time requirements and the greater volume can be accommodated.” With telops “scientific and tracking data will be sent via the communications lines in near real-time where it will be prepared for entry into a large mass storage device” with “capacity of storing online all telemetry data acquired over a 6- to 12-month period. Existing computer would separate data and merge orbit and attitude. “The output product of this processing will be a combination of real-time

In April six more buoys would be installed on ice floes in Arctic Ocean north of Alaska to obtain basic weather information during summer. Data had never before been obtained because ice islands melted into brackish ponds and streams covered by fog and rain and were impossible to reach.
Monitoring platform in Ohio was transmitting water-quality data from Great Miami River near Cincinnati. IRLS platforms would also be attached to fixed stations in Lake Erie to monitor water oxygen content, electrical conductivity, alkaline and acid content, and temperatures and to test efficiency of collecting water data quickly and repetitively from many different areas simultaneously. Drifting platform in Lake Ontario would collect water data and information on currents. About 15 sensors on Mt.

Our laboratory and technical facilities will be dedicated to developing the technology for on-going programs and to payload planning.”
In FY 1973, manned space flight’s civil service strength at the three Centers would be 11 350, “a continuing reduction from previous years. This level is the minimum necessary for carrying out our responsibilities for Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle, while still providing support to new technology development and planning for future missions.” On top of planned reduction of 619 positions in FY 1972 budget, Centers were further cut by 636 positions under Federal employment control in FY 1972 and 1973, or 10% loss in those two years. Added reduction of 361 positions in FY 1972 and 275 more positions in FY 1973 would require further reduction-in-force procedures and continue to contribute to aging of overall personnel complement.
Of civil service total, 5% were in program planning and definition, 15% in program management, 30% in engineering and development, 5% in science and medicine, 20% conducting flight and launch operations, with rest in general management and administration. (Transcript)

• Adelbert 0. Tischler, Director of Shuttle Technologies Office in NASA Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), testified on progress of shuttle transportation system before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology during NASA FY 1973 authorization hearings: “Methods for rapidly assessing the aero-heating and flight handling characteristics of the shuttle are being developed. A base for applying new design methods and for use of new materials in the sensitive problem of structural mass has been laid. Thermal protection systems, some comprising materials which were virtually unknown at the start of the program, will be brought to . . . technological readiness. The questions of long-lived propulsive and power equipment, suitable for repeated re-use, will be answered.” Computerized index and search procedure for access to all published shuttle technology was nearing completion. “While technology issues remain, the continuing progress of the technology program conducted by . . . NASA centers and industrial contractors is building a technological base that is far deeper and stronger than that which has heretofore underlain new development programs. This base . . . will assure successful Shuttle development.”
David S. Gabriel, Manager of aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office, described NASA-funded electrophysics research program conducted by Ames, Langley, and Lewis Research Centers and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Program was concerned “with understanding and, ultimately, using electrons, nuclei, atoms and molecules. Such work is of central importance to future sciences, for example, to laser beam generation, transmission and conversion; superconductivity; or plasma power devices.” In FY 1972, research had been completed on continuous-flow plasma accelerator to simulate spacecraft reentry conditions accurately, new contributions to understanding plasma turbulence had been made, knowledge of uranium plasma properties had been improved, and carbon monoxide lasers had been demonstrated to be highly efficient. New superconductor made up of thin films of vanadium and silicon had been discovered. For FY 1973 $3.4 million had been requested for programs in plasma dynamics, lasers, superconductivity, and nuclear physics.
Roy P. Jackson, Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology, testified that “clearly the space shuttle orbiter, a rather sophisticated piece of machinery, is not only a launch vehicle and a spacecraft but also a high speed airplane, with all the attendant considerations of aircraft-type control and landing. It offers NASA an opportunity to apply aerodynamic, structural, and materials technology that has been developing over the past 10 or 15 years for high performance aircraft. Reciprocally the shuttle work offers much to benefit aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years.” NASA had also capitalized on early Air Force technology oriented toward manned high-speed flight in the atmosphere as well as reentry into the atmosphere, such as Dyna-Soar and X-15 projects.

several kilowatts of power. Current research is directed primarily toward two types of nuclear systems, isotope systems for low power levels of about 1 kilowatt, and the intermediate reactor power systems for levels in the range of several kilowatts up to 10-20 kilowatts.” Isotope systems were radioisotope thermoelectric generators (rtgs). Intermediate reactor power system consisted of zirconium hydride reactor to generate heat and thermoelectric power-conversion components to convert this heat into electricity. Program was directed toward reactor test in 1976-1977 period to demonstrate long-life capability. Stable performance had been achieved on thermoelectric converter test modules. Effort in FY 1973 would concentrate on verifying this performance. Conversion system would be developed for testing with the reactor to verify the integrated system performance. (Transcript)

of Pu-238 from SNAP-9 A, report on study of plutonium accidently injected into stratosphere when U.S. Navy Transit satellite failed to reach orbit after launch from Vandenberg afb April 21, 1964. Accident had caused threefold increase in global fallout of plutonium isotope over that usually injected into atmosphere by atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. SNAP-9A nuclear generator, designed to convert heat from Pu-238 into electrical energy, had burned up during reentry and had ablated into small particles at 46-km (28.6-mi) altitude. Concentrations of Pu-238 in stratosphere had been measured through end of 1970 and soil samples had been collected at more than 60 sites to estimate global distribution of fallout from the accident. Of the 17 kilo-curies of Pu-238 originally in the generator, 13.4 plus or minus 2.2 kilocuries had been deposited, with 3.1 plus or minus 0.8 in northern hemisphere and 10.3 plus or minus 2.1 in southern hemisphere. Although plutonium was one of most enduring and deadly radioactive poisons known, amounts inhaled when Pu-238 settled to earth were so small they were not considered hazardous. (Text)

Deputy Administrator, Dr. Fletcher said: “Our successes in space exploration have been outstanding .... However, in spite of the efforts of many and a number of significant accomplishments, our achievements in equal employment in NASA, here on earth, do not match what we have done beyond our planet.”
Dr. Fletcher said he would insist “that as fast as humanly possible, by transfer, training, promotion, and whatever other means are available, and appropriate, our offices move toward the goal of the balanced staffing that will achieve true equal employment opportunities.”
NASA was planning to get members of minority groups into space. Space shuttle would be important factor in accomplishing this goal. NASA also would consider establishing annual awards for outstanding performance in Office of Equal Opportunity and would insist that “spirit as well as the letter” of contractors’ equal employment obligations be fulfilled.

March 2—24: NASA’s Pioneer 10 (Pioneer-F) Jupiter probe was launched from Eastern Test Range at 8:49 pm est by three-stage Atlas-Centaur-TE-M-364--4 booster, used for first time. Spacecraft reached highest launch velocity ever attained, 51 500 km per hr (32 000 mph) relative to earth. Primary objective was to obtain precursory scientific information beyond Mars orbit with emphasis on investigation of interplanetary medium, asteroid belt, and Jupiter and its environment. Secondary objective was to advance technology for long flights to outer planets.
The 258-kg (569-lb), spin-stabilized spacecraft carried 11 scientific experiments to provide new knowledge about Jupiter, solar system, and Milky Way galaxy. It would return first closeup images of Jupiter and make first measurements of Jupiter’s twilight side, never seen from earth. Two additional experiments—celestial mechanics and S-band occultation—would use communication signal and earth-based equipment. Pioneer 10 would be first spacecraft to observe Asteroid Belt between orbits of Mars and Jupiter, first man-made object to escape solar system, first spacecraft to use orbital velocity and gravity of Jupiter for escape, and first NASA spacecraft powered entirely by nuclear energy— four radioisotope thermoelectric generators developed by Atomic Energy Commission. Pioneer 10 would make 20 kinds of measurements of Jupiter’s atmosphere, radiation belts, heat balance, magnetic field, moons, and other phenomena. It would also characterize solar atmosphere, interstellar gas, cosmic rays, asteroids, and meteoroids.
Spacecraft also carried pictorial plaque designed to show scientifically educated inhabitants of another star system—who might intercept it millions of years later—-the time spacecraft was launched, from where, and by whom. Plaque design was etched into gold-anodized aluminum plate 15 by 23 cm (6 by 9 in) and 1.27 mm (0.05 in) thick attached to spacecraft’s antenna support struts. Radiating lines on left of plaque represented positions of 14 pulsars, with mathematical binary code “1-” symbols representing pulsars’ frequencies relative to hydrogen atom, which was used as “universal clock.” Hydrogen atom was also used as “universal yardstick” for sizing human figures and outline of spacecraft on right of plaque. Man’s hand was raised in good-will gesture. Across bottom of plaque were planets ranging outward from sun, with spacecraft’s trajectory arching away from earth, passing Mars, and swinging past Jupiter.	-

March 2-24: nasa’s Pioneer 10 was launched with the highest velocity yet attained and began its journey toward the Asteroid Belt, the planet Jupiter, and eventual escape from the solar system. By March 24 all instruments had been turned on and were returning data. The probe carried a plaque to show any inhabitants of another star system*—who might intercept it millions of years in the future—where Pioneer 10 had been launched, when, and by what kind of beings. In the photo above, technicians adjusted the spacecraft at TRW, Redondo Beach, Calif., facilities.
Initial orientation of Pioneer 10 was achieved six hours after launch so that communications high-gain antenna was directed toward earth. By March 3, four scientific instruments—magnetometer, charged particles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid detector—had been turned on. First midcourse maneuver, March 7, increased velocity by 11 m per sec (45.9 fps), adjusted trajectory, and shortened flight time to Jupiter by nine hours. At 3:00 pm EST March 8, Pioneer 10 was 4 570 000 km (2 840 000 mi) from earth traveling at 32 800 km per hr (20 400 mph). Round-trip radio communication time was 31 sec.

Whether flight path behind Io had been achieved would not be known until spacecraft neared Jupiter. To go behind Io, spacecraft had to arrive within period of less then eight minutes. By March 24 remaining instruments—plasma analyzer, cosmic ray telescope, imaging photopolarimeter, infrared radiometer, and asteroid/meteoroid detector—had been turned on and all experiments were recording good data. Meteoroid detector had recorded 10 impacts, and asteroid/meteoroid telescope had seen one meteoroid. Spacecraft was expected to enter Asteroid Belt in early July and to reach Jupiter Dec. 3, 1973.
Pioneer 10 was first spacecraft to attempt Jupiter probe. Pioneer 5 was launched March 11, 1960, to study heliocentric space environment inward toward sun. Pioneer 6 (launched Dec. 16, 1965) and Pioneer 7 (launched Aug. 17, 1966) were studying heliocentric space environment. Pioneer 8 (launched Dec. 13, 1967) and Pioneer 9 (launched Nov. 8, 1968) were studying interplanetary phenomena. Last four were still operating satisfactorily.

March 2:	Isis 2 International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies (launched
by NASA March 31, 1971, in joint U.S. and Canadian program) was adjudged successful by NASA. Spacecraft had exceeded mission objectives. All 12 scientific instruments were operational and were still acquiring detailed information on latitudinal and diurnal variations of ionosphere. Spacecraft was obtaining radio-sounder and correlative direct measurements to allow continuation and extension of ionospheric studies during period of declining solar activity, and long lifetime was anticipated.
Isis 2 was fourth and final mission in U.S.-Canadian program to study ionosphere that began with launch of Alouette 1 Sept. 28, 1962. All four spacecraft were operational and were providing useful data. ISIS program had acquired wealth of knowledge on worldwide morphology of topside ionosphere, virtually unknown region before Alouette-isis program, and in discoveries in plasma physics and radio-wave propagation.

every decade throughout the rest of this century. “The busiest airports will have to handle twice to three times their present operations. Since most jetports are too noisy today, the capacity increase must be accomplished with an actual integrated decrease in noise. Steeper operational procedures, retrofitted engines, and quieter engines in new terminal-configured aircraft must all be considered as companions to dual runways, improved automation, and success in the Discrete Addressable Beacon and Microwave Landing Systems Programs.
“To design the next generation of civil aircraft as terminal-configured vehicles, the designer will need technology advancements that will permit steep and curved vertical profiles for noise abatement, curved ground tracks for noise abatement and airspace efficiency, and an ability to satisfy a specified time-of-arrival at the runway threshold to maximize runway capacity.” NASA had “a new start in FY ’73 to lead the way in technology, . . . the Terminal Configured Vehicles and Avionics Operating Experiments Program, for which funding of $4.2 million will be programmed.” (Text)
•	NASA applications program was reviewed by Associate Administrator for
Applications Charles W. Mathews in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications during FY 1973 NASA authorization hearings. Objectives of program were “to establish useful applications of space and space know-how through the development of user relationships, through the development of requisite technology, and through the conduct of appropriate ground, airborne and space flight investigations.”
Space was “a magnificent vantage point to survey the surface of the earth and to expedite and enhance the flow of information around the globe.” Core of program was new applications of earth observations and communications, but “other areas associated with the unique environment of space, particularly weightlessness, show promises which must be explored, developed and exploited.” Space manufacturing processes offered good example. “Space applications, however, should not be envisioned just as activities that lead to satellites or laboratories in space, for . . . applications relate to contributions to men and women who . . . reside right here on the ground. Know-how provided by experience with the development of space systems can be applied to . . . areas involving housing, transportation, health care and many others.” NASA participation in Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) would increase significantly in FY 1973 as transition occurred from planning to carrying out Tropical Experiment and Data Systems Test, both planned for CY 1974. Planning would be accelerated for Global Experiment during 1976-1977. garp was being conducted by World Meteorological Organization and International Council of Scientific Unions to increase understanding of circulation of atmosphere and provide mathematical and physical basis for long-range weather prediction, determination of feasibility of large-scale climatic modification, and assessment of consequences of man’s pollution of atmosphere.

William H. Woodward, Director of Space Propulsion and Power, cited importance of isotope power systems to NASA planetary program: “The ability of nuclear electric power systems to operate for long periods . . . without consideration to distance from the sun is the primary feature which makes nuclear systems mandatory for outer planet missions. This self-contained energy input characteristic also provides a relative insensitivity to the operating environments encountered and this capability may be important on many missions, e.g., lander missions on planetary surfaces or missions which encounter high natural radiation fields.” Power requirements of most missions could be satisfied with low-level isotope power systems using radioisotope thermoelectric generators (rtgs). “Currently, rtg’s are scheduled for flight on the Pioneer Jupiter Flyby and the Mars Viking Lander missions and in addition, are planned for use in future outer planet programs.”
Associate Administrator for oast Roy P. Jackson testified that solar energy could prove important energy resource. National Science Foundation’s rann (Research Applicable to National Needs) program had budgeted $4 million for solar energy investigations in FY 1973. Atomic Energy Commission, Dept, of Interior, and NASA were conducting inhouse studies. Solar Energy Subcommittee had been established by Federal Council on Science and Technology Committee on Energy Research and Development Goals to assess benefits to recommend r&d funds and programs. Subcommittee was first time solar energy had been considered at this level of national planning. NASA was evaluating concept for generating electric power from solar cells in space and transmitting power to earth via microwave beam, which would deliver more concentrated solar energy than naturally received on earth’s surface. Collecting in space also could be continuous, rather than having to stop at night or in cloudy weather.
Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management, described oast manpower problems and methods to alleviate them. Though oast manpower applied to aeronautics had increased 90% since 1966, manpower for all other efforts had decreased by 56%. Growth in aeronautics could not be provided continuously by transferring personnel from space projects. “In the short term we will continue to meet the increased need for aeronautics manpower by retraining and reassignment of personnel at the Research Centers. For the Ions: term we have initiated a program to encourage the training of students interested in aeronautical sciences. ... we are continuing the cooperative NASA/university graduate research and study program begun in FY 1971 where faculty and students are working with the Research Centers.”
R.	D. Ginter, Director of Technology Applications, testified on NASA and National Science Foundation cooperation in applications: nsf’s rann program contained “two broad areas of mutual interest: Advanced Technology Applications and Environmental Systems Resources. One of our senior people has been assigned to focus this effort, coordinate task selection, and provide program management. During the next year we intend to expand our problem definition activity and prepare specific proposals for NSF consideration.” (Transcript)

Academician M. D. Millionschikov said 1971 had been year of achievement in space. Creation of “the world’s first manned orbital scientific station, Salyut, was a major event. . . . Exploration of the moon and the planets with the help of automatic space vehicles has continued. Recently, a magnificent space experiment was completed—the Luna-20 automatic station’s delivery to earth of soil samples from the almost inaccessible' lunar mountain region. Two automatic ‘Mars’ stations were created. . . . Separating from the Mars-2 station, a capsule landed a pennant. . . and the Mars-3 descent vehicle made the first soft landing on the surface of Mars.

slash payload costs to $2000 per 0.5 kg (1 lb), “then 20 million pounds [9 million kg] in orbit represent a national investment of $40 billion.” Shuttle development cost of $5.5 billion plus deployment and operation of shuttle system would cost from $11 to $16 billion. NASA estimate of less than $100 for lifting 0.5 kg (1 lb) of payload from earth to orbit was “easily disputed.” Estimate of $11 billion for shuttle cost divided by 9 million kg amounted to $550 per 0.5 kg and not much less than the $700 per 0.5 kg that existing NASA launch vehicles had cost. Only “if orbital payloads can be reduced so they cost only several times more per pound than gold, is it meaningful to seek cheaper space transportation.

Apollo 16 astronauts would carry to moon a magnetic rock collected by previous Apollo landing to see if it changed when returned to moon. “We want to see if the magnetism that we have found in moon rocks was not somehow picked up on the voyage back to earth. The whole purpose of this exercise is to prove the existence of a magnetic field on the moon, which in effect proves that the moon was once hot like the earth. Most scientists believe there will be no change, that the magnetism was locked forever into these rocks when they solidified in the moon’s magnetic field.”
Astronauts would also set up magnetometer on moon and place a moon rock on head of instrument for instant reading of its magnetism. When rock was brought to earth, it would be read again for comparison with reading on moon. (O’Toole, W Post, 3/5/72, A3)

March 7:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, compared nasa FY
1973 budget program with FY 1972 plans in testimony before opening session of House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Department of Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans hearings on FY 1973 budget: “We have reconfigured our plans so that a substantially higher level of appropriations will not be required in future years to complete the programs in our FY 1973 budget” and to continue “useful and significant . . . new projects in space science, exploration, and practical applications, in advanced technology, and in aeronautics.” FY 1972 program would have required NASA appropriations in future years to approach $4 billion per year. Run-out costs to complete program as planned would have risen to $3.7 billion in FY 1973 and $3.95 billion in FY 1974. Revised program estimated run-out costs at $3.37 billion in FY 1974, $3.3 billion in FY 1975, $3.2 billion in FY 1976, and $3.1 billion in FY 1977. NASA could “by properly phasing-in the start of needed future new programs . . . hold NASA appropriations in future years to approximately the current total appropriations level in current dollars.”
Previous program would have committed U.S. to “higher NASA budget in future years, or to the waste from termination of programs in midstream,” but revised plan would “give the Nation a good, viable, and balanced program in aeronautics and space at a cost it can afford.” Dr. Fletcher believed “realistic long-term plan in which the Nation’s commitment is limited to budgets of approximately the current size is the proper posture for NASA from the standpoint of responsible management” and “should go far in alleviating the concerns that have been expressed that in embarking on the new space programs of the 1970’s we are committing the Nation to a program that it cannot afford.
“To achieve this posture, we have had to make some basic changes in our planning and accept yet another stretch-out of the period over which our continuing and long-term objectives in space exploration and space science will be achieved.” Principal change has been in space shuttle program. Shuttle now planned would cost $5.5 billion, about half what configuration envisaged year before would have cost. Second significant change was cutback in planned program for explora-

Third significant change was termination of nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program, now including in budget request $8.5 million for defining with Atomic Energy Commission smaller nuclear rocket engine and making trade-off studies of preferred propulsion system for missions to distant planets some time in 1980s.
Final major change was increased emphasis on aeronautics, in response to strong urgings of committees of Congress. (Transcript)
•	Tenth anniversary of Oso 1 Orbiting Solar Observatory, first U.S. satel-
lite devoted entirely to studying sun. Satellite had carried 13 experiments to collect data on solar radiation in ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray regions. After one year of operation it had provided more data on behavior and composition of sun than any single ground-based observatory and all previous rocket, balloon, and satellite flights combined and had measured 75 solar flares and subflares. Oso 1 had stopped operating Aug. 6, 1963, exceeding 6-mo design lifetime by almost 11 mos. (gsfc pao; A&A 1963)

•	NASA Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews
testified on earth resources program during FY 1973 authorization hearings before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications: Program was probably most significant present element of earth observations program, using advanced satellite and ground-based techniques. FY 1973 funding of $48.4 million would go for procurement (including spacecraft development) and flight operations, data-handling system development, and aircraft program already underway. Queried on pace of program, Mathews said NASA had “good basic program” that would merit expansion. Results from erts-a satellite—to be flown with high degree of participation by users from Government, industry, and universities— should show program merited extension and how it should be done. Mathews also cited need for regulation and control of information as it was gathered more nearly completely and accurately. Gathering information was “less of a problem and less of a challenge than the proper use of this information.” (Transcript)

•	Financial problems affecting development of new civil aircraft in U.S.
were described by William M. Magruder, adviser to President Nixon on technology, in speech before National Security Industrial Assn, in Washington, D.C.: “Nature of the development base applicability of military programs to civil transports has been altered drastically since the propeller transports and early jets. Those civil transports enjoyed literally ‘off-the-shelf’ engines, tires, brakes, instruments, hydraulic, electrical and air conditioning systems and nearly exact aerodynamics and controls. The cost of a civil transport development project under those conditions was about one time the manufacturers’ net worth, or about $300 million. During this period, it was not unusual for the military to be developing as many as one or two dozen related bombers and transports of equal size and technology. Today, a single civil air transport development program, such as the B-747, DC-10 or L-1011, will cost about five times the net worth of the manufacturers, or nearly $1.5 billion. At the same time, the Defense Department has only the C-5A, F—14, F-15 and B-1A in development, with little direct . . . fallout into the civil programs.

“Simultaneously with the skyrocketing of civil transport development costs, foreign nations have noticed that it takes a family of transports to dominate the marketplace. Where the U.S. offered twenty or thirty different models and captured 85% of the civil transport market, we now are isolated to the trijets and the B-747, while Europe offers Concordes, A-300 airbuses, Mercures for short range; VFW-614s and Falcon 20Ts for commuter traffic; and have started their stol projects for urban traffic. To do this, they have used multinational treasuries for subsidized financing.” (Text)

Pioneer 10 Jupiter probe March 2: “Like a note in a bottle cast on an outgoing tide, or a relic in a cornerstone, or a time capsule, this message to whom it may concern affirms mankind’s insistence on its precious and distinctive identity. It is behind the concept of pyramids, eternal vigil flames, and ancient cathedrals. More than an instinct to survive, it includes a demand that its existence be known and acknowledged.” Pioneer 10 launch “serves to transmit an ancient challenge: ‘Who’s there?’ Any authenticated reply would be the biggest news in quite a spell.” (W Star, 3/10/72)

•	Bridgeport (Conn.) Post commented on March 1 launch of Air Force
reconnaissance satellite. Satellite “is intended to monitor rocket tests of the Soviet Union and Communist China. And it is to remind us all not to get so carried away in the new approaches to the two Communist giants that we will let down our guard against them. . . . informed guesses are that the new spy satellite’s major job is to monitor submarine launching missiles. In its high position, the sensors would be able to observe one third of the globe. Another outpost would complete surveillance of the whole globe.” Despite President Nixon’s visit to China and prospective visit to Soviet Union “spy satellites are needed precautions.” (Bridgeport Post, 3/12/72, 23)
March 13: Two press briefings were held at nasa Hq., Apollo 16 Mission Director’s press briefing and press conference on medical aspects of Apollo 15 and 16.
In first, press was told hypergolic loading of propellants had begun and countdown demonstration test with fueled spacecraft would begin March 29. msc was continuing simulations, and prime recovery ship would leave San Diego March 23 and Pearl Harbor April 8 to take position. Launch preparations were proceeding on schedule toward liftoff at 12:45 pm est April 16.
Apollo Mission Director Chester M. Lee said one purpose of microbial ecology evaluation device (meed; experiment to carry fungi and bacteria) on Apollo 16 was to prepare for future Skylab missions. In Skylab “we are going to have some evas and some of these bacteria,
96

fungi, are on the suit before they go out. So the idea is to find out is there anything when we bring those suits back in and stow them for long periods of time like we are going to have on Skylab, do we have anything that we should be considering or concerned about as far as mutants and so forth.”
Lunar roving vehicle (lrv) Rover had been improved with new seatbelts that could be hung up out of way when not in use and with extra circuit breaker to permit deployment of TV after third extravehicular activity period, lrv would not cover as much distance on Apollo 16 as on Apollo 15. “We are planning 25.2 kilometers [15.7 miles] . . . because that gets us to our primary objectives,” not including 10% wander factor for missing craters. (Transcript)
In second briefing, Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life Sciences, explained medical problems and procedures on Apollo 15 and changes for Apollo 16. Major concerns on Apollo 15 were cardiac arrhythmia—irregular heart rhythm—and fluid-electrolyte imbalance, with severe loss of potassium. Cardiac arrhythmia occurred occasionally in normal persons and frequently in college students, apparently as a result of fatigue from all-night studying, adrenalin increase from apprehension about grades, drug effect from drinking coffee to stay awake, and heavy workload. Fatigue, adrenalin increase, drug effect, and heavy workload also acted on astronauts. Fluid-electrolyte imbalance was dependent upon intake in food and drink and output in breath, sweat, and body wastes. In space, balance was affected by weightlessness, acceleration, 100%-oxygen atmosphere, abnormal work-rest cycle, and sustained work loads. Countermeasures that could be taken were better control of intake, supplementing electrolytes with intravenous fluids, coordinating exercise, providing lower body negative pressure, and optimizing work-rest cycles.
Medical objectives for Apollo 16 were essentially same as for Apollo 15: to ensure crew safety medically, to improve probability of mission success by providing necessary medical information, and to detect and understand changes incident to space flight and learn more about effects of space flight on man. To improve medical wellbeing of Apollo 16 astronauts, 72-hr preflight controlled-diet period would determine amount of potassium needed by each crew member. Since potassium could not be preloaded, small amounts of extra potassium would be given in daily diet in flight to ensure adequacy. In addition to regular preflight cardiovascular examination, x-rays of astronauts’ hearts would be taken before and after mission to determine whether heart size decreased during flight. Skylab equipment would be used in flight for electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electro-oculogram. Other inflight medical changes were daily sample of improved electrocardiogram data, option to alter bioharness wearing schedule, expansion of crew status report, high-potassium diets with potassium-enriched beverages and snack supplements, measurement of food and fluid intake and urine and fecal output, return to earth of urine and fecal samples for analysis, and provision of anti-arrhythmic drugs lidocaine, procainamide, and atropine.
Dr. Berry also announced that Astronaut Donald K. Slayton, who had been removed from Aurora 7 mission (May 24, 1962) and NASA flight status 10 yrs ago because of possible heart malfunction, had been

March 14:	President Nixon transmitted to Congress Aeronautics and
Space Report of the President: 1971 Activities. In transmission message President said: “Aided by the improvements we have made in mobility, our explorers on the moon last summer produced new, exciting and useful evidence on the structure and origin of the moon. Several phenomena which they uncovered are now under study. Our unmanned nearby observation of Mars is similarly valuable and significant for the advancement of science. During 1971, we gave added emphasis to aeronautics activities which contribute substantially to improved travel conditions, safety and security, and we gained increasing recognition that space and aeronautical research serves in many ways to keep us in the forefront of man’s technological achievements. There can be little doubt that the investments we are now making in exploration of the unknown are but a prelude to the accomplishments of mankind in future generations.”
Report said U.S. was “proceeding into this decade with clearly defined goals and objectives for its civilian space program.” U.S. continued to invest “substantial resources” in space activities because of “national thrust to explore the unknown, the desire to acquire new knowledge, and the realization that space activity has practical and widely beneficial applications. Space is increasingly coming to be seen as an arena of human activity, rather than national activity, and therefore a particularly congenial focus for cooperative undertakings that bring the people of the world together.” {CR, 3/14/72, S3885; Text)
• Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and other officials testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1972 NASA authorization hearings. Dr. Fletcher said: “I regard the fiscal year 1973 budget . . . as marking the end of a difficult transition period for NASA. For the past 2 or 3 years, NASA, the executive branch, and the Congress have been grappling with questions on the course the Nation’s space program should take in the 1970’s and beyond. The main goals in science, exploration, and applications, and the advanced system and technology required to achieve these goals, have been identified . . . and generally approved .... But there has remained a basic uncertainty . . . the question of cost. Can the Nation afford the space program of the 1970’s? Will the approval of the Space Shuttle and the other programs . . . commit the Nation to a large increase in future spending levels?
“This year we can give clear answers to these questions. We can assure the committee, the Congress, and the public that the program
99
March 14
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
we are proposing does not commit the country to higher budget levels in future years, at least measured in current dollars .... The revised plan is, I believe, more realistic and will give the Nation a good, viable, and balanced program in aeronautics and space at a cost it can afford.”
Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, reported substantial progress in two basic cooperative activities with U.S.S.R.—joint work on compatible docking systems and exchanges in scientific areas, including lunar sample exchanges. In response to question, Dr. Low said he thought it likely U.S.S.R. would continue lunar program after U.S. completed Apollo program. “They may even try to land men on the moon in the latter part of this decade. That will be a catching-up process.”
To further question, Dr. Fletcher said that in late 1970s U.S.S.R. would be “doing things in the manned space program that are beyond what we would be able to do.” From end of Skylab in 1973 until 1978, “it is likely that they will be carrying on some important activity and we will have no opportunity to respond until 1978” [with space shuttle].

McCurdy, Associate Administrator for Organization and Management, submitted statement on NASA’s work force: “When several reductions are made serially, as they have been in NASA over the past several years, the effects compound, and the healing processes, such as the resumption of hiring of younger people, the filling of vacancies via merit promotion ... do not have an opportunity to function.” NASA was “feeling these disadvantageous effects severely.” Most worrying was “dwindling of the supply of new blood.” It was obvious “trend cannot continue without the health and vigor of the organization being undermined.” NASA needed “to embark upon a period of stability” in work force to “return to normal personnel development practices, heal the damage of the past several years, and be prepared to meet the challenges of the 70’s.” With the “prospect of a period of relative stability in the general level of spending” and “clearer view of the NASA forward mission,” such a policy was indicated.
Statement submitted by Daniel J. Harnett, Assistant Administrator for Industry Affairs and Technology Utilization, described NASA Regional Dissemination Centers’ assistance to users “ranging from small businesses to the largest companies in our Nation’s economy— across a broad spectrum of business sectors including manufacturing services, transportation and communications. The Centers also serve university faculty and students; varied national, state, and local organizations; and governmental entities at all levels.” NASA RDCs had served more than 2000 organizations in 1971, of which over 48% of industrial users were small businesses.
m/g Robert H. Curtin (usaf, Ret.), NASA Director of Facilities, submitted statement on facilities. In $77.3-million FY 1973 request for construction of facilities, $27.9 million was for modifications and additions to facilities for space shuttle, $11.2 million for facilities supporting scientific investigations in space, $12.9 million for facilities supporting aeronautical research and technology, and $25.3 million for smaller supporting activities and planning and design.

•	Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, Vice President and Group Executive of General
Electric Co. and former nasa Administrator, delivered 1972 Tizard Memorial Lecture at Westminster School in London. Discussing man’s future in space, Dr. Paine evaluated role of applications satellites: Their “great economic and social value” was apparent “although their full potential is not yet appreciated. Men on every continent regularly use these services today; shares can be bought in the enterprises that provide them. We must not, however, overlook the equal value of the new information about the earth’s origin, history, environment, and destiny that our more basic lunar and planetary scientific programs are providing. Already studies of radiative energy transport in the atmosphere of Mars have contributed to terrestrial meteorology; lunar geological surveys have provided new clues to the early formation and structure of earth. The line between science and application in this rapidly advancing area is continually shifting and new scientific understanding of such questions as the origin of the Ice Ages might be of incalculable human importance.” (Text)
•	NASA released findings of U.S. authorities who met at Langley Research
Center Aug. 16-20,1971, to discuss detection of air and water pollution by remote sensing, especially from aircraft or satellites. Group had reported that remote sensing produced essential information unobtainable by other means. Measurements could be obtained by aircraft, high-flying balloons, and satellites and from ground, to provide picture of global or regional pollution problems. Group had recommended that new techniques and instrumentation be used as fully as possible with special emphasis on remote sensing potential of space technology. (nasa Release 72—58)

•	Decision that space shuttle booster stage would be powered by recover-
able, reusable, solid-fueled rocket motors in parallel burn configuration, rather than by pressure-fed liquid-fueled rocket motor, was announced by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, to Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973 authorization hearings. Announcement was also released to press during morning and Dr. Fletcher held press conference in afternoon. Dr. Fletcher said both solid- and liquid-fueled boosters had been found technically feasible but “choice was made in favor of the solid parallel burn because of the lower development cost and the lower technical risks. Cost estimate for shuttle development was now $5.15 billion instead of earlier $5.5-billion estimate. Request for proposals would be issued about March 17. nasa expected to select shuttle launch and landing site shortly. At press conference he said: “I think we have made the right decision at the right time. And I think it is the right price.” Dr. Fletcher said it was likely NASA would want to launch and land at same coastal site and possibly from sites on both coasts. Inland sites were unlikely because of requirement for booster recoverability.
Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said at conference there would be eight-week response time to request for proposals to become prime contractor for shuttle development. NASA would evaluate proposals in another eight weeks and would be ready for choice of contractor in early July. Requirements had been developed jointly with Air Force and “we have a shuttle that meets the user’s requirements, both in NASA and in the Air Force.”
Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, estimated breakdown of 580 shuttle flights projected over 12-yr period for newsmen. Out of 100% of missions, 26% would be manned or man-tended, 74% unmanned. Of that 74%, 27% would be for applications (including NASA and other agencies or commercial applications), 25% for science, and 22% for Dept, of Defense missions.

Fletcher [see above]—moved to testimony on Apollo program, during Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearings on NASA FY 1973 authorization. In new Apollo 16 lunar surface experiments, far-ultraviolet camera/spectograph would photograph celestial objects or areas emitting or absorbing energy from atomic hydrogen. Data would provide information on “composition, density, distribution, and motion of interplanetary, interstellar, and intergalactic gas clouds which will . . . enhance our understanding of the structure and evolution of the galaxy.” Data, recorded on film and returned from lunar surface by astronauts, would be “first attempt to evaluate the Moon as a platform from which to make future celestial observations.” Second new experiment, cosmic ray detector, would acquire data on origin and source mechanism of high-velocity cosmic rays and solar particles beyond effects of earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field.

March 15—21:	NASA launched 29 sounding rockets from Wallops Station
in cooperative international program to test weather data systems for France, Japan, and U.S. Project was sponsored by United Nations World Meteorological Organization’s Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation. Objective was to compare data for better understanding of upper-air temperature and wind measurements and to encourage international cooperation in exchanging data obtained from meteorological rockets. Rockets—which carried radiosonde payloads ejected at apogee and descending on parachutes—included 12 U.S. Loki-Datasondes carrying NASA payloads, 10 Japanese MT-135s carrying Japan Meteorological Agency payloads, and 7 U.S. Super Areas rockets carrying French National Meteorological Agency payloads. Twenty-four flights were successful, three were failures, and two were partially successful. Second series of launches was planned for late 1973 with U.S., U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, Brazil, France, and India. (WS Release 72-3; WS pao)
March 16:	President Nixon praised ability of Americans to “harness the
discoveries of science in the service of man” in message to Congress on science and technology: “They have found a way of preventing polio, placed men on the moon, and sent television pictures across the oceans.” But, “when other countries are rapidly moving upward on the scientific and technological ladder, challenging us both in intellectual and in economic terms,” U.S. position in aircraft, steel, automobile, and shipbuilding industries “is not as strong as it once was. A better performance is essential to both the health of our domestic economy and our leadership position abroad.” U.S. should “combine the genius of invention with the skills of entrepreneurship, management, marketing and finance;” ensure favorable environment for technological innovation; realize “that mere development of a new idea does not necessarily mean that it can or should be put into immediate use;” encourage young people to become “dedicated scientists and engineers;” continue priority assigned to basic research and to “exploratory experiments which provide the new ideas on which our edifice of technological accomplishment rests;” and “appreciate that the progress we seek requires a new partnership in science and technology—one which brings together the Federal Government, private enterprise, State and local governments, and our universities and research centers in a coordinated, cooperative effort to serve the national interest.”
President had increased FY 1973 Dept, of Defense budget to “ensure our strategic deterrent capability, continue the modernization of our Armed Forces, and strengthen the overall technological base that underlies future military systems.”
To “apply our scientific resources in meeting civilian needs,” President had developed “overall strategic approach in the allocation of Federal scientific and technological resources.” He urged Congress to support new strategy that included reorientation of space program “to focus on domestic needs—such as communications, weather forecasting and natural resource exploration. One important way ... is by designing and developing a reusable space shuttle, a step which would
105
March 16
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
allow us to seize new opportunities in space with higher reliability at lower costs.”
President also advocated “providing new sources of energy without pollution;” developing “fast, safe, pollution-free transportation;” reducing losses from natural disasters; improving programs to curb drug abuse; increasing biomedical research; providing better health care; and drawing more directly on “capabilities of our high technology agencies”—NASA, Atomic Energy Commission, and National Bureau of Standards—in applying r&d to domestic problems.
To improve “climate for innovation” President had proposed National Science Foundation support of “assessments and studies focused ... on barriers to technological innovation and on the consequences of adopting alternative Federal policies which would reduce or eliminate these barriers.” Additionally he would “submit legislation to encourage the development of the small, high technology firms” and “provide additional means for the Small Business Investment Companies (sbics) to improve the availability of venture capital to such firms.”
Among “cooperative international efforts” in science and technology President cited exchange of lunar samples with U.S.S.R. and exploration of “prospects for closer cooperation in satellite meteorology, in remote sensing of the environment, and in space medicine. Beyond this, joint working groups have verified the technical feasibility of a docking mission between a salyut Station and an Apollo spacecraft.” {PD, 3/20/72, 581-90)
• NASA officials testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973 NASA authorization hearings.
Roy P. Jackson, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology, presented program request with increased emphasis on technology for “solving urgent domestic civil air transportation problems of noise and congestion,” continuing concern for “rapidly growing foreign competition” to U.S. leadership in world aircraft markets, greater attention to “countering the erosion of this Nation’s preeminence in military aeronautics,” phase-over in space shuttle technology from exploratory activities to development support, continuing focus on space technology for advanced earth-orbit systems and outer planet exploration, change in emphasis from development of large nuclear rocket to continuing the technology base for nuclear propulsion, with focus on small high-energy system. Budget also included continuing reduction of research staff and emphasis on upgrading existing facilities, with no new facilities requested.
In aeronautics, advanced system studies in FY 1971 and FY 1972 had examined application to new subsonic and sonic aircraft designs of projected advances in aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, controls, and avionics; identified technology advances offering greatest economic and competitive position benefits; and defined actions to “bring the advanced technologies to a state of readiness for industry utilization by the late 1970s.” Follow-on studies would be conducted in FY 1973 on “additional noise alleviation possibilities and on terminal compatibility.” Application of supercritical aerodynamics and configuration treatment, engine noise and emission suppression techniques, composite structures, and use of active control systems “were shown to result in a quieter, safer, more economical subsonic/sonic transport

March 16
having greater productivity than the current wide-body jet transports.” In FY 1973 “aerodynamics effort will concentrate on refinements of supercritical wing and related configuration treatment for transport concepts capable of increased flight efficiency.”
David S. Gabriel, Manager of aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office, testified on office’s on-going work after termination of nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program June 30, 1972: “To reach the outer planets in reasonably short trip times during the 1980’s requires more advanced propulsion systems than are currently available. Among the candidate propulsion systems for these missions is a small, approximately 15,000-pound-thrust [66 720-newton-thrust] nuclear rocket engine, more suited to these unmanned outer planet missions than the large NERVA engine. Other candidates include high-performance chemical rockets and solar-and-nuclear-electric propulsion.
“For the balance of this fiscal year and during the next, we will compare . . . candidate propulsion systems for a variety of future potential missions of the 1980’s and 1990’s including the outer planet exploration missions.” (Transcript)
• Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences, reviewed space science program before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973 authorization hearings: Major accomplishment in astronomy in 1971 had been mapping of universe at x-ray wavelengths with first x-ray astronomy satellite, Explorer 42 (Vhuru, launched Dec. 12, 1970). Two dozen scientific articles had been published on observations by satellite; 116 objects emitting x-rays had been studied and positions accurately determined. Analysis of rocket data on one object indicated diameter was less than 20 km (13 mi), yet it emitted much larger amount of x-radiation than did sun. “The discovery of such X-ray sources is of fundamental importance because matter in ordinary states . . . cannot account for such intense radiation.”
In 1971 NASA had launched eight missions in physics and astronomy program. Most important was Orbiting Solar Observatory Oso 7 (launched Sept. 29, 1971), “which carried into orbit a set of solar telescopes more powerful than any launched before. One instrument— a coronagraph—revealed visible evidence of three luminous jets of intensely hot solar plasma being hurled out into space at a speed of more than two million miles per hour [some 3 million km per hr]. These luminous jets were 20 times the size of the earth, and represented the energy of 100 million atomic bombs. A peak temperature of 30 million degrees must have been attained in this event. Again . . . matter must have been produced on a scale man cannot produce on earth.”
International cooperation continued major role in space science program; five of eight 1971 missions had had significant international participation.
During year experiments and prime contractor, TRW Inc., had been selected for “newest and most significant program in astronomy”—High Energy Astronomy Observatory, designed to “unlock some of the most profound and puzzling secrets of modern physics.” Pulsars and quasars had given evidence of new concept of energy generation that produced power at levels unexplainable by modern nuclear physics.

March 16,' 1962.
Cosmos satellites’ wide variety of functions were described in Trud by Soviet engineer T. Borisov.. Primary objectives of Cosmos program —which had included almost 500 spacecraft—were “profound and comprehensive scientific investigations of circumterrestrial space” and earth, improvement of space vehicles, and application of experiments “connected with the extensive use of space for national economic and cultural purposes. Very appreciable results have been achieved in . . . the historically short span of 10 years.” Cosmos satellites had studied circumterrestrial plasma and its interconnection with earth’s magnetic field, previously unknown dynamics of processes in upper atmosphere and space, and relationship between sun and earth. “Cosmos-261 and Cosmos-348 explored the plasma ocean. Cosmos-166, which spent a long time patrolling the sun, made a careful survey of the solar disc. Cosmos-92 and Cosmos-149 could be described as modern geophysical laboratories. The astronomers’ automatic laboratory Cosmos-215 had eight telescopes on board to observe hot stars in visible and ultraviolet rays. It also had an X-ray telescope and two photometers to record solar radiation dispersed by the earth’s upper atmosphere.”
Series had also contributed to “the further improvement of space technology” and led to creation of first orbital station. “It was only after testing all the complex mechanical, electrical, and radio engineering systems and installations, and after two Cosmos satellite automatic dockings that the way was opened to Soyuz . . . and Salyut. The Cosmos satellites have tested many systems, units and assemblies of lunar and interplanetary automatic apparatuses. . . . the thermo regulating system assemblies, the solar batteries, means of communication, and many scientific instruments for the Luna, Venera, Zond, and Mars apparatuses were created on the basis of or having regard to experience gained in the operation of similar installations in Cosmos satellites.” (fbis-Sov, 3/30/72, LI)

Contract had been awarded originally to General Electric Co. in 1970. Protest by Fairchild Hiller that its proposal was superior to GE’s had led to full-scale review of award by General Accounting Office. NASA had reawarded contract to Fairchild Hiller. Now, 18 mos after re-award, NASA had noted that cost of ats-f had increased from $50 million to $65 million “and is still climbing.” Satellite’s spring 1973 launch date was said to be slipping badly and NASA had moved new manager, John

•	New York Times science reporter John Nobel Wilford toured Zvezdny
Gorodok (Star City), near Moscow, as first Western correspondent to be invited to center of U.S.S.R. cosmonaut activities. Guide for visit arranged by Soviet Novosti News Agency was Soyuz Cosmonaut Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training. Shatalov said U.S.S.R.

did not announce space mission dates “because we don’t want to bind the people who are preparing the flight.” Cosmonaut flight training areas were closed to most visitors “because we just don’t want journalists to interfere with the working atmosphere of the cosmonauts.” Area contained medical center with centrifuge that cosmonauts called “Devil’s merry-go-round.”
From size and number of apartment buildings, Wilford estimated Star City population at 1500 to 2000, City was “smaller than Houston space center because it does not also serve as the mission control complex and apparently has no primary responsibility for the management of spacecraft design and development.” Like NASA Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Star City contained facilities for premission training of cosmonauts and postmission physical examinations and recreation. Like U.S. astronauts, Soviet cosmonauts were trained in aircraft “that make deep dives to simulate weightlessness.” Parachuting tested ability to handle high-stress situations. First simulator for Salyut orbiting laboratory was being installed in new building to be completed at year’s end. Wilford said that “this could mean that no major advance beyond the present version of Salyut should be expected until well after the simulator is ready.”
Of about 50 cosmonauts in Soviet space program, one third were civil engineers living in Moscow, Shatalov said; remainder were Soviet air force pilots who lived in Star City. No women were preparing for space missions but U.S.S.R. had “many women who specialize in meteorology and medicine, which are professions necessary on the orbital stations.”
From descriptions by Shatalov and Cosmonaut-engineer Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, Wilford had constructed outline of preparations for Soviet space mission: Cosmonauts were assigned to mission one year in advance of launch date by commission of medical and engineering experts and Shatalov. There were two backup crews. After learning spacecraft mechanics and electronics and practicing in spacecraft simulator at Star City, crew went to Baykonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan three weeks before launch. There they completed training in actual spacecraft, checked instruments, stocked food, adjusted couches, and recommended minor changes in housekeeping. “Unlike Cape Kennedy,” Baykonur had no simulators for last-minute practice. For two days before launch, “after the state commission approves the spaceship’s readiness,” crew relaxed. On launch morning cosmonauts were examined physically and biomedical sensors were attached to their bodies before they donned spacesuits. Traditionally, cosmonauts then gathered in quarters for few moments of silence broken by shouts of “off we go!” They signed their names on door before leaving for launch pad. Between missions, cosmonauts were expected to devote time each month to “social work”—visits to schools, collective farms, and factories.
Shatalov had suggested that new Soviet manned missions were possible within months and that U.S.S.R. was studying mission longevity in preparation for earth-orbiting laboratories. Of next Salyut mission, Shatalov said: “We are going to make it better .... We will prolong the visits of men, and the number of expeditions will grow. This is the difference now between our program and yours.” Yeliseyev had said his countrymen would “probably” be on the moon by 1975.

•	Soviet scientists V. Moroz and L. Ksanfomaliti described in Izvestia
findings on Mars atmosphere from Mars 2 and 3 spacecraft. Difference in contrast on two wavelengths between continents and seas during dust storm and change in contrast in same field had permitted evaluation of dust particle size and cloud thickness. Average radius of particles over Iapigya region Dec. 15, 1971, was estimated to be less than one micrometer and density of particles to be 100 million per sq cm (645 million per sq in). “If clouds of such density uniformly envelop the entire planet, its atmosphere must have contained several thousand million tons of dust.” Estimates suggested that particles have mostly silicate composition, “which agrees with the infra-red spectra obtained by Mariner 9. Particles of such a tiny size . . . fall very slowly—for about a month even in the absence of supporting vertical currents in the atmosphere. Hence the conclusion that no prolonged storm in the true sense of the word, i.e. constant winds in the period of investigation, occurred.” Unlike Venus, where cloud layer and atmosphere were more pervious and created “hothouse effect,” surface of Mars “gets cool rather than heated, giving rise to what may be described as an ‘anti-hothouse effect.’ When the storm ended, the temperature rose.” Water vapor content of atmosphere was low during and after the dust storm (Tass, fbis-Sov, 3/22/72, LI)

•	Charles W. Mathews, NASA Associate Administrator for Applications,
testified on future applications of NASA research in domestic communications before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during NASA FY 1973 authorization hearings: “Domestic communications systems . . . will make available many television-handwidth channels, for both public and commercial use, to all the population . . . including remote and sparsely populated regions. Several . . . channels could be available for educational and instructional use. There are likely to be universities of the air which will permit many students . . . to achieve college degrees while spending only a small . . . time in academic residence.” Improved systems would “permit an increase in the number of people who could receive actual pre-school training and training in early-childhood education and health-care practices.”
Health care could be improved and costs reduced through hroad public access to health-care services and information, while centralized health-record-keeping could aid hospital personnel, administrators, and private physicians. Two-way television teleconferences between health professionals could become possible. In law enforcement, “fingerprints and other criminal records and data could be almost instantaneously available anywhere in the country, and television conferencing could make possible the remote taking of testimony as well as remote identification procedures.” Postal service would improve “with the advent of electronic mail handling. Satellite links may be expected to carry a majority of the long distance letter mail, making inexpensive overnight delivery possible to all but the most remote locations. New satellite systems for aviation and maritime traffic management will reduce the accident rate and increase the efficiency of transoceanic and coastal transportation of goods and people.
NASA Deep Space Network support of Mariner 9 mission (launched May 30, 1970) was described by Gerald M. Truszynski, Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition: “From lift-off on May 30 to insertion into its egg-shaped orbit around Mars on November 13 and continuing during orbital operations around Mars, Mariner 9 has been monitored and controlled by the deep space network. The navigational accuracy required to insert Mariner 9 into Martian orbit was unprecedented in prior flights into deep space. The aiming point . . . after a flight of about 380 million kilometers (240 million miles) was an area only 160 kilometers (100 miles) square. This represents an aiming area some 100,000 times smaller than was attainable for the Mariner 2 flight to Venus in 1962. Since the network issued the commands for retroengine firing and Mariner 9 was injected into orbit... the spacecraft has been completing two orbits of Mars each earth day and recording some 30 television pictures of the Martian surface on each orbit. After each orbit, when the spacecraft can be ‘seen’ by the Goldstone 64-meter [70-yard] antenna, Mariner 9 transmits back the tape recorded pictures upon command from the network.” (Transcript)

NASA budget request of $163.4 million for aeronautical research and technology was increased $48.5 million to $211.9 million. In House report, Committee scored previous cut in funding for aeronautics and recommended increase to support 1971 Civil Aviation Research and Development (card) Policy Study of NASA and Dept, of Transportation by expediting solution of “major problems in aviation today: noise pollution and safety.” Bill allocated $41 million of the increase (for $50-million total) toward R&D to retrofit civil aviation fleet with noise reduction modifications and $7.5-million increase (for $24.7-million total) for aviation safety. Of safety funds, $3.8 million was for technology to modify civil aircraft to use Federal Aviation Administration’s new microwave landing system by 1978, $700 000 for turbulence research, and $3 million for research on aircraft collision avoidance.
Bill increased NASA budget request for technology utilization from $4 million to $5.5 million. Of increase, $1.2 million was to be spent in applying NASA technology to problems in urban structures, fire safety, transportation systems, and energy conversion and $300 000 for applications engineering products and patent licensing.
Committee deleted $4 million from $59.6-million NASA request for High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and restored $4 million deleted by Office of Management and Budget for Earth Observation Satellite (eos), follow-on development to Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts). Committee said it was expressing concern that NASA placed “higher priority upon certain expensive scientific projects . . . than it does upon space applications project which Congress considers most important.” Committee considered level of funding for space applications “inadequate” and urged “a substantial increase in the budget for fiscal year 1974.” (H Rpt 92-926; Com Off)
• Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering in Dept, of Defense, testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences on dod coordination with NASA on space shuttle development during hearings on NASA FY 1973 authorization: “I firmly believe that the U.S. must retain a strong national commitment to scientific and technological progress. The NASA space program is a vital element of this overall effort.”
In space area, DOD was “becoming increasingly dependent on space systems, particularly in . . . communications. Other agencies and the public are becoming increasingly dependent on the use of space for communications, weather forecasting, and natural resource exploration. The Department of Defense supports the NASA space shuttle as an important part of the President’s program, which will lead to a greater and more effective use of the space environment in the future.”
Dr. Foster discussed Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) for military needs not satisfied economically and reliably by more traditional communications systems. First dscs, currently operational, employed “simple, low-power satellites and ground terminals originally designed for experimental and test programs. To replace the existing satellites ... we are deploying new DSCS satellites that have roughly 10 times the communications capability. . . . We are also developing improved terminals which will supplement the existing dscs terminal complex.” (Transcript)

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said shuttle would “produce substantial flight economies, ease strictures on spacecraft design, lower manufacturing cost, remedy malfunctions in orbit, and afford a built-in versatility that will alter the nature of space planning and operations in major ways.” Editorial writer had described shuttle’s impact on space program as transition from dramatics of a countdown to an airport routine, Dr. Fletcher said. “The dramatics will be fondly remembered by many of us, but nostalgia will not obscure the hard

fact that the routine and economic access to space, of which the shuttle is the hinge pin, is the practical and commonsense means by which we shall reap the great harvest of benefits that space holds for mankind.”
Supplement interview quoted Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, as eagerly looking forward to shuttle flight. “By the time the first passenger shuttle flies I’ll be 68. I think flying into space in a shuttle will be just like being a passenger in an airliner, only smoother.” Dr. von Braun foresaw use of shuttle for travel to Mars “probably around 1990, or at least before the end of the 20th Century.” Flight probably would begin with Mars spacecraft being hauled, piece by piece, in space shuttle cargo bays, to be assembled in orbit. “I think the only way to fly to Mars is with nuclear power, and because we would never want to ignite a nuclear rock on earth, we’ll have to begin the journey from orbit.” Dr. von Braun saw shuttle preparing way for manned exploration by ferrying small, unmanned spacecraft into orbit and launching them toward Mars in late 1970s and 1980s.
Article by Rep. James W. Symington (D-Mo.), member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said shuttle offered opportunity “not only to the United States to advance its own aerospace science and technology, but also to countries which could not finance a complete shuttle system. The advantages will be mutual and conducive to needed international scientific cooperation.” Proper use of shuttle “can help us in our efforts toward the resources management necessary to make this planet fit to house future generations of man.”
James J. Harford, Executive Secretary of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said in article that guessing shuttle’s significance was “like trying to predict what the DC—3 would lead to in air transportation six years before its first flight. The space shuttle could be that powerful and more.” If shuttle performed the way NASA intended it to—“and NASA’s Apollo track record has to impress even the cynical”—shuttle would “help to create entire new industries and . . . hundreds of thousands of new jobs.” [W News, 3/28/72, 27, 29)

James A. Loudon to Jan. 16 letter in which former scientist-astronaut Dr. Brian T. O’Leary questioned compatibility of space shuttle with national goals. O’Leary letter had been “strange document from a man who wrote a whole book to complain that scientists don’t have access to space.” Shuttle’s most important aspect, “aside from its economy,” was its ability to carry passengers. “For the first time, scientists will be able to perform experiments in space without spending years in irrelevant pilot training first.” Shuttle’s effect would be “to make space very much more available, with results for a dozen different branches of science that are now incalculable.” (NYT, 3/28/72)	_

In statement following signing, Secretary of State William P. Rogers said convention had been formulated to compensate, fairly and promptly, if space object of one party caused injury or damage to citizen of another party. “I believe that the convention which we have signed today will accomplish that purpose. I concur in Admiral Alan Shepard’s statement in the U.N. General Assembly last year that it is a ‘sound treaty based on realistic perceptions of mutual interest and mutual benefit.’ Like its predecessor, this treaty is the result of intensive work in the United Nations Outer Space Committee and represents both a practical and an imaginative step in developing just international rules governing man’s activities in space. Many countries have had an active part in its formulation during years of intensive negotiations. The conclusion of the agreement has again demonstrated what noteworthy results a cooperative approach to international negotiations can achieve.” (Tass, fbis-Sov, 3/29/72, Al; Rogers Text)

•	Progress in NASA development of technology to alleviate aircraft noise
pollution and ensure quieter aircraft operation was described by Walter A. Pennino, Public Affairs Officer in Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), at NASA Hq. press briefing. Research had shown aircraft noise could be reduced if pilot flew aircraft “so that it climbs quickly” to be “as far from a ground observer as possible.” When wing flaps were retracted as aircraft accelerated, aircraft required “less thrust to climb. When a safe altitude is reached, the pilot can reduce the engine thrust from that required for takeoff to the lower thrust required for climb.” NASA and Federal Aviation Administration were encouraging airlines to adopt two-segment approach to reduce landing noise. Pilot would adjust controls to descent first at 6° glide slope. About one mile from the runway he would change path to slope. In final stages there would be no difference in the landing procedure. Aircraft would approach with engine power somewhat reduced and would be at higher altitude. Noise reduction would be three to five effective perceived noise in decibels (epndb) one nautical mile from the end of the runway and even greater reduction farther out from the runway. Ames and Langley Research Centers were studying requirements to make two-segment approach safe standard procedure. In Lewis Research Center Quiet Engine Program, experimental engines suitable for conventional takeoff and landing aircraft were being built. Test had shown reduction of noise by using quiet engine with and without acoustically treated nacelle. Goal chosen for short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft was 95 epndb at 152 m (500 ft). “We don’t have an engine that can do that job right now, but NASA is working on it.”
Follow-on programs for new family of aircraft were described by James 0. Kramer, Chief of Noise and Pollution Reduction Branch in oast Aeronautical Propulsion Div. “Preliminary design study contracts will be let in the next month or two to study a low-noise, low-pollution engine . . . suitable for stol. In addition, we havie been carrying on design study for an advanced technology transport . . . appropriate for the 1980-timeframe as a replacement for 707 or for the DC-8. We are . . . planning to initiate in FY 73 preliminary design studies of a Quiet Engine . . . appropriate for such an advanced technology airplane.” (Transcript)

Major structural features had been identified despite relatively low degree of ground resolution of image, which had been exposed at altitude of 1100 km (680 mi). Regional lines not yet recognized in surface mapping had been perceived. Synoptic view provided by image showed orthogonal fractures not heretofore apparent in regional maps of Alaska that might reflect “conjugate set of fractures within the crust which has exerted significant control over the geological history of the state.” Scientists had concluded increased resolution in other images from space platforms, like resolution of 60 to 200 m (200 to 650 ft) planned for Earth Resources

During March: nasa released Funds for Research, Development, R&D Plant and Scientific Technical Information, Fiscal Years 1971-1973: Annual Report to the National Science Foundation. Report, for inclusion in government-wide survey published by nsf for Congress, White House, Government agencies, and scientific community, showed distribution of nasa funds based on FY 1973 budget estimates. It reflected nasa’s total direct obligations incurred in FY 1971 and budget estimates for FY 1972 and FY 1973. In FY 1973 nasa would fund approximately 19% of Federal Government’s total research and development effort and provide 23% of funds for research, alone. When Dept, of Defense was excluded from computation, nasa was expected to conduct 36% of total civilian R&D effort. Total research in FY 1973 was expected to show 4% increase over FY 1971.
For first time since FY 1962 research would represent over 50% of nasa funding for Research and Development. Increase in research resulted in decreased funding for development, with impending completion of Apollo and Sky lab development; decrease was offset to a degree by funds applied to begin space shuttle development. Analysis of funding showed decline in engineering funds of about 7% of total, with increases in physical and life sciences. Reduction in engineering reflected anticipated completion of Apollo. High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) program effected increase in astronomy, and Viking program, increase in chemistry and biology. (Text)

Petrov said compatible docking system would allow “docking of spaceships of our countries with the humane aim of rendering help to crews of spaceships and space stations in distress. These systems would also allow joint experiments during the flights in space.” Petrov said negotiations had occurred in “atmosphere of mutual understanding and businesslike discussion” that “gives us the hope that all the difficulties connected with . . . such a sophisticated scientific and technological undertaking could be overcome.” (NYT, 4/2/72)

• Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, told press in Washington, D.C., he believed U.S. and U.S.S.R. would sign agreement during 1972 for joint mission in which Apollo spacecraft would dock with Soviet Salyut orbiting laboratory in 1975. At dinner party for seven newsmen Dr. Fletcher said: “We certainly don’t believe that the first mission of American and Soviet astronauts together will be the last.” Mission would “take a lot of planning and some hardware changes. ... I also think the crews will need time to train together for the first flight.” Crews would be bilingual and familiar with each other’s spacecraft. Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, John L. Swigert, Jr., and Donald K. Slayton were already studying Russian. First joint docking mission would cost U.S. as much as $300 million, most of it to keep manned flight facilities intact after conclusion of 1973 Skylab mission. Dr. Fletcher foresaw series of joint U.S. and U.S.S.R. missions, each longer and more ambitious. U.S.S.R. was emphasizing space station while U.S. emphasized shuttle. “I think it only logical that the two hook up together, especially since the shuttle will have rescue capability.” U.S.S.R. was expected to continue Lunokhod lunar rover and lunar sample return programs and “probably marry the two some time in the next two years. I also think they will attempt a manned lunar landing, but not until late in the ’70s, perhaps 1977.” (O’Toole, W Post, 4/6/72, A2)

Unknown factors included possible hazardous effects of prolonged weightlessness and of high-energy cosmic ray particles (high Zs) in deep space. Major recommendations were: research to determine course of physical deconditioning over two years of weightless and restricted activity; study of effects of radiation from high-Z particles; research program on effects of confinement to emphasize cognitive functioning; measurement and test of crew’s physiological, psychological, and performance status in flight; incorporation of life-support and safety requirements, including medical and dental facilities, into spacecraft engineering and emphasis on habitability of spacecraft; adoption of systems analysis approach to mission to provide common frame of reference for interdisciplinary planning and implementation; and priority study of crew composition and criteria.

The complete experimental engine will be operated in about 6 months. Results . . . indicate that we may expect to better the original noise abatement goals. Program results are given to industry on a continuing hasis. . . . We can expect some of our improvements to be adopted by industry in new engine designs before completion of our program.”
NASA—aec Spade Nuclear Systems Office Manager Milton Klein testified: “Reactor power sources will be required to provide power in amounts greater than a few kilowatts for many of the missions of the future. For unmanned military satellites, radiation hardening—mandatory for certain military missions—and low recurring costs for multiple missions are important advantages of small reactor systems. For unmanned NASA earth orbit missions, reactors become cost effective above a few kilowatts, a power range needed for such applications missions as communications satellites. In manned missions . . . overriding advantage of reactor systems is their ability to accommodate unforeseen large increases in power demand.” Advanced reactor systems were needed for electric propulsion systems capable of high energy missions to far planets.

These hearings represented one of the times . . . that Senator Anderson . . . and Admiral [Lewis L.] Strauss of the aec were in entire public agreement on a project. Senator Anderson was thinking of putting space under the Joint Committee and Admiral Strauss was interested in the space development program being under aec.

April 9:	Americans were wondering why U.S. spent “$40 billion” to land
on moon rather than on programs for social action, Jeffrey St. John commented in Los Angeles Times article. “The fact remains, however, that long before the landing of Apollo 11 public funds for social problems on earth had risen far beyond the annual space budgets. In 1972, the federal government has earmarked $100 billion for social action programs, as opposed to $3.2 billion for space. The ratio of expenditures for space and social action programs during the 15 years of the space effort has been roughly 11 to 1 in favor of social action.” Lunar landing had been “triumph of 400,000 scientists, engineers, and technologists and the sophisticated expertise of 20,000 private companies, large and small.” Apollo had been “clear-cut example of a successful government venture” but on earth Government had “made a mess of the social landscape.” Compounding irrationality was refusal of liberals to understand why “space program succeeded, largely as a private endeavor coordinated by government, and why social problems grow worse under government’s guidance.”
To accomplish lunar mission, space program participants had needed two crucial elements: “intellectual freedom” to analyze a problem correctly and “strict observance of natural laws.” In social problemsolving, intellectual freedom was abandoned for political expediency that played one pressure group against another and “there is a continual violation of certain immutable natural laws. Namely, the refusal of the social planners to believe the slums and poverty can be the products of an absence of individual initiative and enterprise.” (LA Times, 4/9/72)

Research and development expenditures were expected to reach $28.0 billion in 1972, up from $26.8 billion in 1971, increase of 4.3%; 1970 to 1971 increase had been 2.1%. r&d was expected to account for 2.5% of estimated 1972 U.S. gross national product (gnp), down from 2.6% in 1971. In 1964, r&d and gnp ratio reached 3.0%. Approximately 54% of national r&d effort was supported by Federal funds, primarily from Dept, of Defense and NASA. Industrial sector was second largest source. Companies were expected to provide two fifths of total U.S. r&d funds in 1972, up steadily from 31% in 1964.
Estimated 519 000 scientists and engineers in U.S.—more than one third—were employed in r&d during 1971, 5% fewer than in 1970. Nearly 70% of these professionals worked for industrial firms. Basic research expenditures for 1972 were projected at $4.1 billion, with applied research at $6.4 billion. In 1971, $4.0 billion and $6.1 billion had been spent on these activities. Universities and colleges were expected to perform more than 55% of national basic research effort during 1972, up slightly from 1971. (Text)

•	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed relevancy of space
program to communications field and scored antitechnologists as “misguided,” in speech before National Assn, of Broadcasters engineers’ luncheon in Chicago: “Our success in gathering information from space is forcing a revamping of surface communications as they relate to data transmission, and a substantial upgrading of the capacity of the system’s components. The echoes of our revolutions will be heard in many sectors. . . . They will be as beneficial as they will be far-reaching.”
Disputing anti-technologists, Dr. Fletcher said that “they argue that, if the space program is done away with, the problems that are rooted in technological advance will disappear as well . . . and . . . funds now allocated to space can be applied to poverty, aid to the inner city and to other national needs.” This was nonsense. “In so arguing, the base for planned error has been laid. A fundamentally irrational position has been taken. Critics of this stripe are unable or unwilling to recognize that technology is a tool—and nothing more.” As space program progressed, Dr. Fletcher said, “I am confident that ... we will be able to confront the anti-technologist with a sequence of results from our space work . . . that have a direct impact on the solving of some of the social problems that concern him—and the rest of us.
“While this erosion of the position of the anti-technologist is in process, it is important that we take every precaution that his campaign does not impede the formation of the wise policies of federal support.

Dr. Fletcher said that in halving cost of original plans main sacrifice was that “we are not reusing all the parts. We use this expendable gas tank to supply the orbiter. . . . That, however, had an enormous effect on the size. We were able to bring the size of the orbiter down so that we were able to use solid fuel rockets.” Dr. Low added, “We sacrificed nothing in terms of what kinds of satellites, what kinds of payloads we can put into orbit.” Estimates of larger costs by shuttle opponents had been derived by adding in cost of “all the satellites it will carry, the weather satellites, the communications satellites, and all of those things that would be carried anyway, whether there is a Shuttle or not,” Dr. Low said.

“And this could be likened to charging to the cost of a freight train the cost also of all of the freight that it is going to carry.”
In reply to question on cooperation with U.S.S.R., Dr. Low cited decision to build docking and rendezvous systems compatible between U.S. and U.S.S.R. manned spacecraft. Shuttle “will have a system on it so it can attach to another satellite and we will make that system so it is the same as the Russians will use on their satellites, so that if we need to rescue each other ... or if we want to conduct joint experiments in space, we can do that.”
Queried on comparison of U.S. and U.S.S.R. space programs, Dr. Fletcher said, “It is quite apparent that over the last 3 or 4 years, the Soviet space effort has grown in dollar volume and in number of launches per year, during the period that ours has declined. So that . . . they are spending quite a bit more in space than we are. It is estimated that perhaps 2 percent of their gross national product is spent for space, whereas a half of a percent of our GNP is spent on space. . . . Our number of launches per year has steadily declined from a peak of something [like] almost 80 in 1966, down to . . . the order of 30 or 35 in 1970 and 1971; whereas, the number of their launches has steadily climbed . . . and is now higher than even our peak. In 1971, they launched over 80 spacecraft, whereas our launches were down to less than half that.” (Transcript)
•	Physicist Dr. Ralph E. Lapp testified on space shuttle economics before
Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973 NASA authorization hearings. Following testimony by Dr. Oskar Morgen-stern, Chairman of Board of Mathematica, Inc., and Dr. Klaus P. Heiss of Mathematica, on corporation’s study of space shuttle economics [see Jan. 31], Dr. Lapp criticized calculations and said entire issue of launch vehicle choices for future should be restudied. He said shuttle payloads would average “10 times more expensive than their weight in solid gold.” Cost would be $5100 per 0,5 kg (1 lb) for launches 1979-1990. Cost projection prepared for NASA had indicated $7-billion saving for shuttle launches in program that would cost $42 billion using current methods, Dr. Lapp said. He added that no such $42-billion program had been authorized for the 1980s. U.S. taxpayers could save $19 billion by not building space shuttle and by using existing rockets for space program.

•	Selection of Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California as launch and landing sites for space shuttle was announced by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in Washington, D.C. ksc site would be used for research and development launches, to begin in 1978, and for all operational flights into easterly orbits. NASA would provide facilities for shuttle users at ksc by modification of existing facilities. Vandenberg afb site would be phased in toward end of decade for shuttle flights requiring high-inclination orbits. Dept, of Defense would provide basic shuttle facilities. NASA Site Review Board studies had shown Kennedy-Vandenberg combination had cost, operational, and safety advantages over all other U.S. sites. Cost of establishing facilities at ksc was estimated at $150 million; at Vandenberg, $500 million.
Decision to use KSC was “most gratifying to NASA’s launch organization” and ensured “continued utilization of this base and the supporting Eastern Test Range,” Dr. Kurt H. Debus, ksc Director, said in statement read at KSC press briefing following announcement of shuttle site selection.
Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, explained at ksc briefing why site construction at Vandenberg AFB would cost more than at ksc : “At Kennedv we can make full use of the Saturn V launch complex—Complex 39. The Shuttle will be brought back in there after flight, . . . refurbished there, . . . mated with its booster ... in the vab [Vehicle Assembly Building], taken on the trawler transporter to the existing launch pad and launched.” ksc modifications would be minor but at Vandenberg “launch facilities . . . are not yet as well
139

suited to the shuttle.” Larger modifications would be required, “and this is where the cost is.”
Selection between KSC and Vandenberg for a particular launch would depend on required launch azimuth, Dr. Low said. “If we launched something toward the east . . . then it makes sense to launch it from the east coast, whether it is for the Department of Defense or for NASA or for civilian users. When you launch into a polar orbit, or a high-inclination orbit, then it makes more sense to launch from the west coast so you don’t overfly land.”
In response to question, Dr. Low said NASA did not plan to mate Air Force-supplied booster with shuttle, “nasa will develop, or have developed under NASA contract by industry, the full shuttle including the orbiter, its large tanks, and the solid rocket motor.” NASA did have “clear understanding” with dod that it would use shuttle when it became available and if it met requirements.

nasa FY 1973 authorization bill heard testimony on space shuttle by Dr. Brian O’Brien, physicist and Chairman of nasa Space Program Advisory Council and of National Academy of Sciences’ Advisory Committee to Air Force Systems Command. Committee also heard shuttle testimony from Dr. Courtland D. Perkins, Chairman of Princeton Univ. of Dept, of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences and Chairman of nasa Space Systems Committee.
Dr. O’Brien said he believed shuttle would provide “space transportation system which can be available on short notice to meet unforeseen conditions which may result from world events, and . . . great flexibility in our space operations, whether civil or military.” It “should make possible a drastic reduction in cost of launches and in cost of payloads destined for earth orbit; while providing the opportunity for refurbishing or repairing satellites in orbit, or returning them to earth. In short, it should prove an invaluable tool in keeping us at the forefront in our operations in space.”
Dr. Perkins said nothing NASA could do “could have a more profound effect on the total space program in the years ahead.” Shuttle would provide launch capability for nearly all programs, manned and unmanned, permitting elimination of large stable of rocket boosters and large complex of launch sites. Program provided strong signal to young scientists and engineers that U.S. wasn’t “about to throw away our carefully developed competence in space” and it was one of only few new national programs continuing “growth and stretch” in high technology.

•	John N. Wilford contrasted U.S. and U.S.S.R. space programs in New
York Times article: “As American astronauts prepare for another Apollo voyage to the moon . . . their counterparts in the Soviet Union are training for long-duration flights in earth-orbiting laboratories, leaving their own lunar exploration to automatic probes. As the American Pioneer 10 heads for Jupiter, a Soviet spacecraft, Venus 8 is traveling toward a planned softlanding on Venus. As American engineers design a reusable shuttle for ferrying men and satellites into space, the Russians apparently are still trying to develop a giant rocket to give them lifting power as great or greater than the Saturn V. As

American launchings run about 30 a year and the space budget is under public attack, the Russians are launching nearly three times as many spacecraft and, if anything, are expanding their space program.” Contrasts had been highlighted in interviews with space officials during Wilford’s month-long visit to U.S.S.R. during March. According to Dr. Boris N. Petrov, director of Soviet Academy of Sciences Intercosmos Branch, “the priorities of the Soviet space program will remain the systematic research of near-earth space with the help of automatic stations, manned spaceships and orbital stations. For the moon and the nearest planets, the priority will continue to be research with the help of automated means.” (NYT, 4/14/72, 10)
•	Appointment of Dr. Noel W. Hinners as Deputy Director and Chief
Scientist, Apollo Lunar Exploration, in Office of Manned Space Flight was announced by Manned Spacecraft Center. Dr. Hinners had headed lunar exploration department of Bellcomm, Inc. (msc Release 72-82)
•	Use of energy in cosmic plasma to launch spacecraft inexpensively was
discussed in Science by Dr. Hannes 0. Alfven, Univ. of California at San Diego physicist. Energy for space propulsion was being used in “extremely inefficient” way because of low exhaust velocity of rocket gases. Total start weight of spacecraft “must be two or three orders of magnitude larger than the payload.” By plasma ejection, “one can easily reach exhaust velocities of several tens of kilometers per second” so that “the ejected mass may be of the same order of magnitude as the payload and the efficiency very high.” Energy for launch could be supplied from solar wind, tapping voltage of 1000 v if transfer resistance between ends of conductors and solar wind could be “made small.” Or energy could be supplied by transfer from ground through plasma channel in atmosphere. “When Apollo 12 was launched, there were low clouds but no thunderstorm. When the spacecraft had disappeared in the clouds, lightning was observed . . . where the spacecraft had last been seen. This effect was interpreted as due to the exhaust gases which facilitated a discharge of electrostatic charges in the clouds down to the ground. One cannot avoid thinking that it would be preferable to transfer power up to the spacecraft in this way.” If spacecraft at launch was “accelerated by two plasma guns at a large distance from each other, and electric arcs are produced between each . . . and the corresponding electrodes on the ground, it is possible that these arcs can be maintained during the launch through the atmosphere.” (Science, 4/14/72, 167-8)
•	Federal Aviation Administration announced publication of 1972 edition
of National Aviation System (NAS) Ten Year Plan and Policy Summary. Summary detailed FAa’s long-range program for development of balanced airport-airways system to meet projected demand for air transportation through 1982. Plan objectives included: completion of semiautomation of en route air-traffic control facilities; provision of basic automation equipment for radar-equipped terminal facilities and automatic metering and spacing of approaches in medium- and high-density terminal areas; increase in instrument-landing-system (ils)-equipped runways and installation of improved ILS at high-density airports; introduction of microwave ILS; investigation of use of satellite technology for air-traffic control communications, navigation, and surveillance and implementation of satellite communications in oceanic

April 15:	Apollo 16 preflight briefing was held at Kennedy Space Center.
Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager James A. McDivitt said Apollo 16 countdown was “probably the smoothest” to date. McDivitt announced that Apollo 16 would be last flight with which he would be associated: “I really don’t have any plans for the future because I’ve really been concentrating on Apollo 16, and while I made the decision that it would probably be a good time for me to leave the program, I have not had time to really sit down . . . [and] think through what my future would be.” Primary reason for leaving program after Apollo 16, rather than after Apollo 17, was so that if change meant move to new location McDivitt’s children could enter new schools at beginning of new school year. McDivitt was Air Force brigadier general and had been commander of Apollo 9 mission (March 3—13, 1969) and command pilot of Gemini 4 (June 3-7, 1965) during seven years as NASA astronaut.

• Washington Evening Star editorial commented on Apollo 16: While space program had been “worth the money,” it was “just a well that this is the next to last manned mission; the most promise henceforth will be in earth-orbital projects. The Soviets appear to be investing much more heavily in those than the United States.” (W Star, 4/15/72, A4)
April 15—16:	Wallops Station held open house as part of joint program of
Federal activities. Displays included moon rock and Apollo spacesuit. Television set was available for visitors to watch Apollo 16 launch on April 16. (Wallops Release 72-5)
April 16—27: NASA’s Apollo 16 (AS-511) carried three-man crew on fifth successful lunar landing mission. Lunar module (LM-11) Orion landed in moon’s Descartes region and two astronauts conducted experiments, rode lunar roving vehicle (lrv), and explored lunar surface. After 71 hrs 14 min on lunar surface Orion rejoined orbiting command and service module (CSM-113) Casper and astronauts transferred for safe return to earth with lunar samples.
April 16-18: Spacecraft—carrying Astronauts John W. Young (commander), Thomas K. Mattingly II (command module pilot), and Charles M. Duke, Jr. (lunar module pilot)—was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, on time at 12:54 pm est April 16 by Saturn V booster. Launch was watched by group of invited guests—including Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, King Hussein of Jordan, and President Jose Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica—and estimated half million other viewers near ksc and 38 million TV viewers.
Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with 175.9km (109.3-mi) apogee and 166.7-km (103.6-mi) perigee. Insertion into trajectory toward moon was achieved at 2:34 get in spite of minor anomalies—leak in instrument unit (iu) temperature control system’s gaseous nitrogen bottle pressure and malfunction of S—IVB auxiliary propulsion system (aps) helium regulators, which caused continuous

April 16-27: Apollo 16 carried a three-wan crew on the fifth successful mission to ^ explore the surface of the moon. The traverse routes planned for Astronauts John W. \ Young and Charles M, Duke, Jr., were outlined on photograph of the Descartes landing site obtained by Apollo 14, with geographical names to be used by the astronauts.
venting. CSM separation from Lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:05 GET and docking with LM was shown on color TV for 18 min.
First S-1VB APS burn was near nominal, but because of helium depletion and potential trajectory disturbances, second bum was not made and S-IVB lunar impact operations were terminated. Tracking of stage ended at 27:09 get when IU signal was lost. S-IVB impacted lunar surface at 75:08 get (4:02 pm EST April 19) at point estimated

to be 1.8° north latitude and 23.3° west longitude. Impact was detected by seismometers at Apollo 12, 14, and 15 sites.
Unexplained light-colored particles streaming from LM close-out panel during docking were reported by crew at 7:18 GET. Young and Duke entered lm, powered up, and found all systems normal. Grasslike particles, shown on cm TV, were later identified as shredded thermal paint, but degraded thermal protection was not expected to affect LM operations. First midcourse correction (MCC—1) was canceled because spacecraft trajectory was near nominal.
Electrophoresis demonstration began on schedule at 25:05 get and appeared to be successful, from crew’s description of reaction of charged particles in liquid. Ultraviolet (uv) photographs of earth from 107 300 km (66 700 mi) and 216 600 km (134 600 mi) were taken as planned. Duke reported “spectacular” view of half earth from 201 000-km (125 000-mi) altitude when he could see sun shining on only half of planet. During MCC-2, made at 30:39 get, services propulsion system (sps) tank pressure anomaly that had occurred earlier in mission was tracked and minor leak in transducer reference cavity was located. Procedures were sent to crew to account for transducer reading. Visual light flash experiment was started about two hours late, at 49:10 get, because of problem in aligning spacecraft. Duke counted 70 white, instantaneous light flashes that left no after-glow, uv photography of earth at 327 800 km (203 700 mi) was completed as planned.
Young and Duke entered lm at 53:50 get for two-hour checkout of LM systems. All system checks were nominal. Scientific instrument module (sim) door jettisoned at 69:59 get.
April 19-24: Apollo 16 entered lunar orbit with 314-km (195.9mi) apolune and 107.7-km (66.9-mi) perilune after lunar orbit insertion (loi) burn at 74:28 get (3:22 pm est April 19). Young, who had orbited moon in Apollo 10 (May 18-26, 1969), said moon was “just as fantastic as it ever was.” He described black mounds like volcanic craters with white central peaks and said central peak of Tsiol-kovsky Crater looked like “a white marshmallow in a sea of hot chocolate.” Astronauts also described whitish fracture patterns that looked like chalk scribbling and surface markings like chicken tracks. Mattinglv said Humboldt Crater had “every contrast in color on the moon.” Material overflowing from Descartes crater looked like cinder fields and submerged craters looked like coral atolls of South Pacific. Young and Duke reentered lm, powered up lm systems, and noted pressure rise in reaction control system (rcs) helium pressure regulator. About 25 kg (54 lbs) of fuel and oxidizer were transferred to lm aps tank in attempt to prevent rupture of burst disc, but disc ruptured at 95:03 get, decreasing helium source pressure.
csm—lm undocking and separation maneuver was conducted on schedule at 96:14 get. When Young and Duke came from behind moon in lm, Duke told Mission Control his helmet was full of orange juice. Duke’s microphone apparently had become entangled with tube through which he drank juice stored in his spacesuit. “Every time I turn my head I get orange juice. It’s delicious . . . hut it’s better in your mouth than floating around the cockpit. I’ve already had an orange shampoo.”

When Mattingly came from behind moon in csm he reported he had not conducted circularization burn because of malfunction in SPS yaw gimbal servo loop. While flight controllers evaluated problem, LM-powered descent-initiate maneuver was delayed, and LM and CSM maneuvered into station-keeping mode prepared to dock or continue landing procedures. Analysis of problem identified malfunction in secondary circuit that would not preclude lunar landing. Second separation maneuver by CSM with RCS burn was performed and LM began descent to moon on 16th revolution.
LM Orion touched down in moon’s Descartes region 230 m (755 ft) northwest of planned target point at 104:30 GET (9:23 pm EST April 20). “Wow, down. Old Orion is finally here, Houston. Fantastic,” Duke exclaimed. “All we’ve got to do is jump out the hatch and we’ve got plenty of rocks.” Duke and Young said site was rolling country surrounded by mountains and covered with big boulders. Sunlight was so bright it washed out moon’s colors and made lunar surface appear white. Since LM had stayed in lunar orbit six hours longer than planned it was powered down to conserve electrical power and first extravehicular activity (EVA-1) was rescheduled to follow sleep period.
EVA-1 began at 119:05 get (11:59 am est April 21). Young climbed down ladder and stepped onto lunar surface. “Okay, Cayley Plains,” he said, “Apollo 16 is gonna change your image.” Duke followed and astronauts began deploying experiments. Because of problems with LM antenna astronauts’ first steps on moon—for first time—were not beamed back to earth. Once Young and Duke set up portable antenna, TV signal and communication with ground controllers were received clearly on earth. TV pictures showed bleak, pale surface resembling Apollo 15 site, with flat-topped Smoky Mountain to north and Stone Mountain to south. Astronauts said site was rockier, more hilly, and more cratered than previous landing sites. Soil was firm, with rocks scattered over 30% of the surface and small craters covering 70%. During deployment of Apollo lunar surface experiments package (alsep) Young tripped over heat flow experiment (hfe) cable, pulling it from connector after Duke had drilled first bore hole. Mission Control later developed way to repair $1.2-million experiment, but procedure was not used because it would have been too complex and too time consuming and included some risk to other ALSEP components. U.S. flag and remaining ALSEP components were deployed successfully and functioned nominally.
Crew deployed lrv and found ampere readings for battery No. 2 off-scale low and rear steering inoperable. About 40 min later, after loading, all meters and rear steering operated properly and LRV performed nominally throughout remainder of EVA.
Young and Duke explored Flag, Spook, Plum, and Buster Craters and collected 20 kg (44 lbs) of samples, including number of white rocks. One crystalline rock coated with bluish glass appeared to have same texture as anorthosite “Genesis rock” collected on Apollo 15 mission; another was pure white. Some were flecked with green and black glass, some were black and gray, and one weighed about 6% kg (14 lbs). EVA-1 terminated at 126:16 get after 7 hrs 11 min 11 sec.
After resting inside LM and reviewing plans for second EVA, astronauts left LM at 142:51 get (11:33 am est April 22). They explored

April 16-27: Stars near the center of the Milky Way galaxy were photographed from the surface of the moon during Apollo 16. An ultraviolet, camera/spectrograph, designed and built by the Naval Research Laboratory, made photos in far ultraviolet light with hydrogen light filtered out, recording only the very hot, blue stars (streaked in the photo because of the moon’s rotation during the 30-minute exposure).
Survey Ridge and Stone Mountain and said ridge was pockmarked with small, subdued craters, most about one meter {three feet) wide and some containing smaller craters within main crater. Area around South Ray Crater was strewn with sharp boulders and resembled crater in Nevada where astronauts had trained. Young and Duke turned on lrv TV so viewers could watch them walking and collecting samples high up on slope of Stone Mountain. They reported seeing more of previously discovered white soil under gray surface layers and said soil was very loosely consolidated.
While ascending ridge and traversing very rocky terrain, LRV rear wheels failed to respond at full throttle, lrv continued to move, hut front wheels were digging in. Troubleshooting procedures identified mismatch of power mode switching. After change in switch configuration lrv worked properly. Astronauts took core samples and collected rocks that appeared to be volcanic, a greenish rock shaped like a snake’s head, and pure crystalline rocks. EVA was televised in color

with lrv camera and was extended 20 min. During crew’s return to LM, 5-cm (2-in) portion of Young’s portable life support system (plss) antenna broke off, causing 15- to 18-db drop in signal strength. EVA—2 ended at 150:14 get after 7 hrs 23 min 26 sec.
Third eva began 30 min early at 165:45 get (10:27 am est April
23)	to allow additional time near North Ray Crater and two other stations. Astronauts chipped off samples from enormous basalt rock the size of a house. All planned activities were accomplished, but astronauts had trouble configuring cosmic ray detector for stowage and return to earth, lrv covered 9% km (6 mi) and reached 17 km per hr (11 mph) going down 15° slope. TV coverage was excellent throughout eva. Total EVA-3 time was 5 hrs 40 min 14 sec—bringing total eva time to 20 hrs 14 min 54 sec and total distance traversed to 27.1 km (16.8 mi).
While LM was on moon, Mattingly, orbiting moon in Casper, completed lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous. He radioed information to geologists at Mission Control to help them plan EVA—3 exploration of Stone Mountain and determine best way to approach North Ray Crater. He located radioactive hot spot on eastern edge of Ocean of Storms south of Apollo 14 landing site and gamma spectrometer identified thorium, potassium, and uranium. Mattingly also discovered, on far side of moon, volcanic lava flows that resembled maria flows and spilled out over northeast rim of crater high in mountains near lunar equator. Two areas resembled volcanic flows around Flagstaff, Ariz., where crew had trained. Many large basins on moon’s far side appeared to be covered with same kind of material that covered area around Apollo 16 site.
Young and Duke depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment, repressurized lm, and lifted off lunar surface with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples at 175:44 get (8:26 pm est April 24). Liftoff was photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon and was seen by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked successfully and LM crew transferred samples, film, and equipment to CSM. For first time docking was not seen on TV, because LM steerable antenna was inoperable. LM jettison was delayed one day so that astronauts could rest. After LM jettison at 195:12 GET, LM lost altitude and began tumbling, apparently because circuit breaker in attitude-and-translation-controller assembly’s primary guidance and navigation system had accidentally been left open. LM ascent stage remained in lunar orbit and was expected to impact lunar surface in about one year. Boom that carried instrument to measure atmosphere of moon was jettisoned because it would not retract and might have broken off. Orbit-shaping maneuvers were canceled to avoid firing of SPS because of degraded backup SPS thrust vector control.
Scientific Subsatellite was launched at 196:14 get (4:56 est April
24)	into lunar orbit with 123.3-km (76.6-mi) apolune and 97.9-km (60.8-mi) perilune. Hexagonal, 40-kg (90-lb) satellite 77 cm long and 36 cm in diameter (30 x 14 in) carried three experiments. Subsatellite extended three 1%-m (5-ft) booms, two with magnetometer sensors to measure interplanetary and earth magnetic fields near moon and third for stabilization. Spacecraft also carried particle shadows and boundary layer experiment to collect data on plasmas and solar flares

and S-band transponder to detect variations in lunar gravity caused by mascons. Expected lifetime was 6 to 9 mos—shorter than 12 mos planned because shaping burn to optimize orbit had not been performed—but Subsatellite crashed into moon May 29.
Transearth injection maneuver at 200:33 get put CSM on trajectory for earth after 114 hrs 5 min (65 revolutions) in lunar orbit.
April 25-27:	Good-quality TV pictures of receding moon from
inside CM and of lunar surface from LRV on moon were transmitted between 227 and 229 get. At 243:35 get (3:43 pm est April 25) Mattingly left CSM for inflight EVA to retrieve panoramic and mapping camera film cassettes from SIM on SM. Mattingly made two trips, during which he observed condition of instruments, reported that insulation paint near rocket nozzle was blistered, and deployed and exposed microbial ecological evaluation device (meed) experiment for 10 min. He reentered CSM after 1 hr 24 min. Scheduled TV press conference began at 268:13 GET and ended at 268:31 GET. Astronauts briefly described moon’s far side, including crater Guyot, which seemed to be so full of material that it overflowed and spilled down side of the crater.
CM separated from SM at 290:08 GET, 15 min before entry interface at 121900-m (400 000-ft) altitude. Drogue and main parachutes deployed normally and CM splashed down and flipped upside-down in mid-Pacific about 5 km (3 mi) from recovery ship U.S.S. Ticonderoga at 2:44 pm EST April 27, after 11-day 2-hr (265-hr 51-min) mission.
After flipping spacecraft upright by inflating air bags, astronauts, wearing fresh flight suits, left CM and were carried by helicopter to biomed area on recovery ship for postflight examinations. After being declared in excellent condition, astronauts were flown on following day to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and to Ellington afb, Tex. Young had lost 3% kg (7% lbs); Mattingly, 3 kg (6V2 lbs); and Duke, 2% kg (5% lbs), but all were “euphoric, hungry and thirsty, and walking well.” CM was retrieved and placed in dolly on board recovery ship. Lunar samples, data, and equipment were flown to Ellington afb and cm was off-loaded at San Diego.
Mission achieved primary Apollo 16 objectives: to make selenologi-cal survey and sampling of materials in preselected area of Descartes region; emplace and activate surface experiments; evaluate capability of Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time, increased EVA operations, and surface mobility; and conduct inflight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance were near nominal except for lack of rate feedback in thrust vector control and yaw oscillations that delayed lunar landing, caused revision of lunar surface activities, and necessitated end of mission one day earlier than planned. All anomalies were quickly analyzed and resolved or compensated for by workaround procedures developed to permit mission to continue. Flight crew performance was excellent. Minor errors made by crew were attributed to fatigue and did not preclude mission success. Mission was officially judged a success.
Accomplishments included largest payload (34 518 kg; 76100 lbs) placed in lunar orbit, first cosmic ray detector deployed on lunar surface, first use of far-UV camera on lunar surface, longest lunar

surface stay time (71 hrs 14 min), longest lunar surface EVA (20 hrs 15 min), and largest amount of lunar samples brought to earth (96.6 kg; 213 lbs). In addition, astronauts returned 3793.5 m (12 446 ft) of exposed film used on lunar surface and in lunar orbit.
Apollo 16 was 13th Apollo mission to date, 10th manned Apollo mission, and 5th successful manned lunar landing mission. Apollo 15 had been conducted July 26-Aug. 7, 1971. Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight. Manned Spacecraft Center was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, Marshall Space Flight Center for Saturn V launch vehicle, and Kennedy Space Center for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under overall direction of Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa proj off; NASA Release 72-64K; NYT, 4/16-30/72; W Post, 4/16-28/72; W Star, 4/16-28/72; B Sun, 4/18/72, Al; AP, New Haven Register, 4/21/72)
April 16:	Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko—first Soviet dignitary to
accept invitation to watch Apollo launch—described his reaction to launch to press at Kennedy Space Center. “It was beautiful, it was poetry. It was a great impression.” Yevtushenko said he had been even more impressed on his midnight visit to the floodlit launch pad with astronaut David R. Scott, “It’s really a beautiful show, this white tender body of a rocket, supported by the clumsy but sometimes tender hands of the red gantry tower. I absolutely had the feeling of one big brother embracing his sister before a long way, a long road. It was wonderful. Silence, not people. No press. Nothing. The sky, the ground, the rocket. It was so beautiful.” (Witkin, NYT, 4/17/72, 24)
•	Astronaut John W. Young had not had “command pilot syndrome”—
fastest peak heart rate of crew at launching—when Apollo 16 was launched, Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life Sciences, said in interview. “The commander has the greatest responsibility and . . . usually has the fastest rate.” During Apollo 16 launch lunar module pilot Charles M. Duke, Jr., had fastest peak rate, 130 beats per min. Command module pilot Thomas K. Mattingly II registered 115 heats per min, and Young—who was making fourth space flight and second trip to moon—registered 108 beats per min. Record had been set by Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr., whose rate had reached 166 beats per min just before launch of Gemini 11 Sept. 12, 1966. (Altman, NYT, 4/17/72, 24)
•	Tass announced Apollo 16 launch 22 min after U.S. news agencies re-

•	Jan. 25 fuel leak in Apollo 16 spacecraft had added extra $200 000 to
cost of mission, Washington Post reported. Most of money went to pay overtime to technicians who had worked two weekends bringing vehicle with csm/lm from launch pad to Vehicle Assembly Building (vab), where command module had been partly disassembled, and returning spacecraft to pad after repair work on launch vehicle and command module had been completed.

flight scheduled to carry them to Cape Kennedy because only 10 had accepted, Washington Post reported. (W Post, 4/16/72)
• U.S. was “running out of blank spaces on the map” and needed last
frontier of space “to keep the human spirit up,” Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, said in interview published by National Enquirer. “Huge tasks” set for computer industry by Apollo program had boosted that industry from $1-billion-per-year earnings in 1969 to $8 billion in 1972. “The aerospace industry itself is a $27 billion business. These and associated industries which the space program stimulates . . . produce the base for the taxes to support all programs. Let the tax base erode and you will very soon see that we won’t be able to afford the social programs.” (Adler, National Enquirer, 4/16/72)
•	New York Times editorial commented on space cooperation: “These
past few years astronomy has probably advanced further than in any previous century since the invention of the telescope. Fantastic progress has been made through American and Soviet exploration of the moon, Mars and Venus.” Need was “to build on this new base of knowledge with a program of further manned and unmanned space exploration conducted under a system of international cooperation which combines the resources, manpower and knowledge of many nations. No generation has ever faced a nobler challenge than space now poses before all humanity.” (NYT, 4/16/72, 5:12)
April 17: Newspaper editorials commented on Apollo 16 mission as astronauts headed toward moon from April 16 launch.
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin: “The Apollo missions are still high adventure. And if the firing sequence is now familiar, there was still suspense yesterday as the huge Saturn V rocket engines lifted another brave crew of American astronauts .... But as the thunder faded away . . . there was the same old question every recent space probe has inspired: What is to be the future of U.S. space research when the Apollo missions are completed?” (P Bull, 4/17/72)
New York Times: “The Apollo effort began in 1961 in an aura of cold war Soviet-American rivalry. But yesterday the Moscow television news gave the Apollo 16 launch equal time with events in Vietnam. Soviet-American space cooperation—perhaps a prelude to truly international team-work—could help greatly in easing world tensions. It would be an unexpected but welcome by-product of the Apollo program.” (NYT, 4/17/72, 33)
•	St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial commented on Soviet announcement of
plans for Soviet-American space mission: “If successful, the way would be opened for further joint exploratory missions, and for emergency rescues. Hopefully, the experiment would provide a stimulus for further combining . . . space efforts. This would provide a valuable interchange of scientific data and a saving in money. The goal should be co-operation in spacefaring by all the nations of the earth.” (St Louis P-D, 4/17/72)

Grumman would require at least $2.2 million more per aircraft to compensate for expected losses, plus additional amount to provide profit. Navy was seeking $734 million in FY 1973 for 48 F-14s at current unit cost of $16.8 million. Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, Chief of Naval Operations, testified April 19 that Government should “stick to the contract.” F-14 was “real winner, one the country really needs,1’ but aircraft could be produced profitably under current contract terms.

April 18:	Science briefing on magnetic enigmas of moon was held at
Manned Spacecraft Center. Finding that rock samples of different kinds collected at all four Apollo landing sites were imprinted with magnetic field from 3 billion to 4 billion yrs ago was reported by Dr. David W. Strangway, Chief of msc Geophysics Div. Laboratory tests had shown 400 to 500 gammas of local magnetic field would have been needed to leave magnetism observed in lunar rocks—% o t0 Vioo as strong as magnetism on earth’s surface. Earth’s magnetism was believed to be caused by earth’s rapid spin and molten core but moon spun only once a month and had been assumed to be solid throughout. Analysis had determined that lunar rocks cooled from molten state between 3.6 billion and 4 billion yrs ago and it was “almost certain” that rocks had acquired their magnetism at that time.
Dr. Paul J. Coleman of Univ. of California at Los Angeles reported that findings obtained with Subsatellite launched from Apollo 15 Aug. 4, 1971, had shown marked variations in lunar magnetism on moon’s far side, with sharp, even peak near crater Van de Graaf close to center of moon’s far side.
Dr. Palmer Dyal, Ames Research Center physicist, said Apollo 16 efforts to find explanation for observed lunar magnetism would include survey of Palmetto Crater north of landing site to assess possibility that impacts of large meteorites could leave residue of local magnetism. Equipment included magnetometers left on moon by previous missions and lunar subsatellite to be ejected from Apollo 16 command module. (Transcript)

And there appears to be no quarrel from the viewing public.” What company, Image Transforms, Inc., had been doing to signals from Apollo 16 was being kept confidential—even from NASA—to protect seven existing and two pending patents. Signals were sent from Apollo 16 to Houston and were immediately sent to Image Transform’s North Hollywood, Calif., plant and back before being displayed on NASA screens and being sent to networks. Extra delay was only one fifth second. NASA had arranged image processing so geologists could give astronauts better input on which rocks to collect on moon.

President then issued statement from Key Biscayne, Fla.: “The journey of Apollo 16 has ended, but the contributions of this mission to scientific progress have only begun. Rarely if ever has so much new information been made available to science in such a brief period. As the work of evaluation and analysis goes forward, the impact of Apollo 16 will be felt for many years to come.
“On behalf of all Americans, I am pleased to welcome Astronauts Young, Duke, and Mattingly back to earth and to salute them for a job well done. Their skill, their courage, and their enthusiasm have written another proud chapter in the stirring story of mankind’s struggle to unlock the mysteries of the unknown.” White House press officer later said President had asked possibility of promoting Capt.

Manned Spacecraft Center briefing Apollo 16 astronauts had returned from mission in excellent condition. “They could walk well. And there wasn’t any obvious effect ... on the ability to stand up well without having blood pressure drop. And . . . there was no motion sickness” even though astronauts had spent about 30 min in spacecraft in fairly rough sea after splashdown. All three astronauts had minor irritation around sensor attachments on the skin. All three had normal white blood cell counts rather than increased counts usually seen on previous missions. Their response to postflight tests showed they were in “better shape” than Apollo 15 crew had been. Cardiac silhouette size appeared to have decreased; only astronaut to have cardiac ar-rythmic contractions was Charles M. Duke, Jr., who had three. Data on potassium levels was not yet available. Astronauts would be on rigid diet and undergo extensive tests for three days so doctors could compare postflight medical measurements with those taken during three-day preflight controlled diet period.

•	U.S. press commented on safe April 27 return of Apollo 16 astronauts.
New York Times: Mission had “reminded us once again that man’s study of the moon is but in its infancy, and that the great bulk of the moon’s territory is still completely unexplored.” Yet, “only one more manned lunar mission is now scheduled.” As Apollo program ended, “its enormous successes underline the opportunities on the moon and compel all men to lift their eyes to the heavens if they would understand whence and how our species, our world and our solar system came into being.” (NYT, 4/28/72)
Atlanta Journal Constitution: “These three strong young men are heros in the truest sense of the term. They have pitted their courage, their physical strength and their minds against a multiplicity of awesome forces which singularly or collectively could totally obliterate them. And they did it for the noblest of reasons—the pursuit of knowledge. If mankind has any claim to greatness, surely it is men like this that give it credence.” Editorial also approved space funding: “It is appropriate to note, just when the next-to-last planned Apollo spacecraft is safely home from the moon, that a few days ago the U.S. House voted approval of a $3,4 billion space agency budget bill. Part of the money will go for the development of a space shuttle, the next logical step in the great adventure of exploring space. The technological advances that are part of the space program have already proven themselves of value here on earth. It’s likely that this kind of extra technical dividend will continue to lead to break-through areas not even related to space.” (Atlanta JC, 4/28/72)
San Francisco Examiner:	. . Apollo 16 may well turn out to be
the most rewarding of all our moon expeditions. All Americans can take pride in a feat so remarkably compounded of scientific precision and human courage.” (SF Exam, 4/28/72)

•	Washington Post editorial commented on Apollo 16:	. . what has
struck us about the moon flights is that so little has gone wrong and how much of what has gone wrong has been correctable. It is a sad commentary about the quality of life on earth when it takes days to fix a television set or a refrigerator while it takes only hours to analyze and overcome an electronic flaw in a craft that is circling the moon.” (W Post, 4/29/72, A18)
April 30:	Apollo 16 discoveries were described in New York Times
article. Mission had been “longest, most ambitious and, in many respects, most productive” in Apollo series. Discoveries included fact that Descartes region of lunar highlands contained almost no specimens of unaltered volcanic rock despite region’s age, “older than the seas and the more prominent craters.” Region had been found to contain breccia rock that had been “fragmented, jumbled, and cemented together again.” High magnetism observed at sites visited by Apollo 16 astronauts might provide clue to moon’s early history, since analysis of lava rocks on earth had indicated earth’s magnetic field flipped over at intervals of thousands or millions of years, with shift requiring centuries. Reverse polarity discovered in rocks near Apollo 16 landing site might mean moon had done magnetic flip at some time in its early history. Among experiments whose outcome was still uncertain was attempt to photograph and analyze ultraviolet light from hydrogen clouds thought by some scientists to exist and to be “missing mass” that would explain gravity assumed to be keeping clusters of galaxies from flying apart.

During April: Soviet Space Program, 1971 was released by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences as supplement to Senate Document 92-51 [see Jan. 6 and 22], Report—prepared by Library of Congress under direction of Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.—said 1971 had been peak year in Soviet space activity, with 83 successful launches against 31 for U.S. Soviet successes had included “remarkable performance of the roving lunar vehicle, Lunokhod 1, the versatile manned space station Salyut in which a manned world duration record was set, the arrival in Mars orbit of two very heavy payloads, Mars 2 and 3, and the placing in lunar orbit of the heavy automated laboratory Luna 19.” On negative side had been inability to develop large G booster, death of Soyuz cosmonauts, crash of Luna 18 on moon, failure of first Mars probe, and failure of Mars 2 and 3 landers to carry out planned experiments. U.S.S.R. in 1971 had flown manned-precursor spacecraft “with greater maneuverability than' the present ones, quite possibly testing the advanced propulsion needed for manned lunar flight.” Soviet spokesmen had reiterated commitment to manned space stations, applications satellites, and unmanned planetary exploration throughout solar system. Manned lunar and planetary flights “continued to get mention as a later goal.” U.S.S.R. was expected to launch another Salyut to be visited by Soyuz 12 and 13 for long stay. Thus far U.S.S.R. had given space program “continued verbal support” and had demonstrated “commitment of hardware which has been rising for the 15 years flights have been undertaken.” (Committee Print)

•	Relation of U.S. space program to national interest was discussed in
Foreign Affairs article by Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator: “To some, space is, or should be, pure science; to others, it is prestige and the American image; to still others, space means national security.” Some space program students had said “its impact will be felt in other respects than the costaccounting of economic productivity versus technological investment. There has been much discussion of the influence of space exploration on the mind and spirit of man, as an extension of the revolution in thought that was initiated by Copernicus and continued by Newton and Darwin. A study of the history and pre-history of man suggests that the human drive is expressed through just such tentative movements out of the world of tried experience into a new world of untested promise.
“Sputnik and the moon landing signaled the opening of a new frontier across which man can now travel into the endless reaches of outer space. The new frontier of space will not be closed quickly, for astronomical knowledge shows that billions of stars, some undoubtedly accompanied by earthlike planets, surround us in the galaxy. Space exploration has brought home to more people than ever before the reality of this vast complex of stars and planets. ‘Out there’ is really there, a place that one can get to. Never again can we make the mistake of identifying our speck of planetary matter as the universe.” (Foreign Affairs, 4/72, 532-44)
•	British press correspondent Arthur Smith presented British view of U.S.
and U.S.S.R. space programs since Apollo 11 (July 16-24, 1969) in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: “Two major events in space marked 1971—both of them signs that America’s formidable lead in space exploration is being whittled away by the incredibly dynamic program” of U.S.S.R.: launch of Soyuz 11, which put U.S.S.R. ahead of U.S. in total launches for first time since 1958, and U.S.S.R.’s landing of Mars 3 capsule on Mars—“relatively unproductive from the scientific point of view,” but impressive. “These two events demonstrate that the Soviet space program is now making great strides after many years of relatively minor achievement in both manned and unmanned exploration and application. The characteristic pattern was a Soviet achievement announced to a surprised world, followed some months later by a more sophisticated and more useful U.S. version of the same mission, yielding far more scientific data, but little prestige.”
U.S.S.R. program was characterized by excessive secrecy because, according to Soviet officials, rockets used in space program were similar to those used in military program. Smith said genuine reason for secrecy “is the desire to guard against a failure in the full blaze of world publicity.” U.S.S.R. “guards against ever having to admit failure by announcing launches only post facto. If there is a launch pad failure there is no announcement at all. If orbit is reached by the spacecraft, but it does not function as planned, no mention is made of this in the curt bulletin.” If lunar or planetary probe failed to enter planned trajectory, mission objective “is not mentioned, and

the spacecraft is merely allocated a number in the catch-all Cosmos series. ... It is impossible to be absolutely certain how many of these escape stage failures there have been, but there may have been as many as 10 or 15 aimed at Venus and Mars alone.”
Soviet program had “little ... of the technical virtuosity of the American approach,” but had more impetus and would “obviously continue on a growing scale. Apart from the progress in individual projects, the ever increasing number of Soviet launches demonstrates that the Russian equivalent of NASA is financially more secure. And the speed with which the Soviet space establishment can respond to a failure is also a pointer to the massive scale of the back-up precautions which are taken.” Soviet program, by its nature, was ensured greater financial security. “By their very success in being able to reach an unparalleled level of technology in their spacecraft, the American engineers have been working against their own best interests.” {Bull Atom Sci, 4/72, 18-24)

May 2:	Apollo 16 rock and photography briefing was held at Manned
' Spacecraft Center. Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said first few weeks of preliminary examination of Apollo 16 samples would be occupied with opening bags and weighing, dusting, photographing, and examining rocks. Catalog, including photos, of all samples should be completed by end of May. Rocks examined to date appeared to be breccias. One rock—collected during third extravehicular activity and described on moon by Astronaut Charles M. Duke, Jr., as “an honest to goodness igneous rock”—was different in texture and appearance from other typical breccias, but had not yet been precisely classified. “Zap pits” on the surface indicated rock had been lying on one side. It was flattish with very fine, silverish crystals in finer grain matrix with no vesicules. Dr. Gast said rock could be rapidly crystallized igneous rock, very-high-grade metamorphic rock, or metamorphic rock that had been at temperatures of 1000°C (1300 K) long enough to be completely recrystallized.
Dr. William R. Muehlberger of Univ. of Texas and U.S. Geological Survey expressed surprise at “the tremendous number of clasts [rock fragments]” within rocks. Clasts represented “crustal material hauled in from somewhere and that’s a tremendous plus beyond what we had originally conceived of as getting. ... So whether it’s volcanic in origin and therefore . . . this is crust from straight under somewhere or whether it’s impact origin and therefore crustal material thrown in from some distance doesn’t matter.” By selecting Descartes as landing site, NASA*had obtained extra sampling, “maybe even a better sampling,” than in other highlands missions. “And we may even have sampled another quadrant of the Moon that we wouldn’t have gotten in any other way. ... we may have a good deal more than the 15 percent or so of the highlands represented in these rocks and we may

•	NASA Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews
briefed House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications on Applications Technology Satellites F and G and Synchronous Meteorological Satellite. Projects had been reported to be experiencing technical and cost problems. NASA review had found in ATS project “considerable progress has been made in . . . completion of . . . thermal structural model. Other elements, such as the integrated communications transponder, were not keeping pace . . . significant imbalance had developed in the total project. It has been necessary then to reschedule and reestablish the proper phasing between project elements.” Manpower and expenditure rates had been reduced, management changes had been made, and reporting arrangements had been strengthened. Reduced project content would provide for protoflight ATS-F and required integration and testing.
“These actions are expected to be completed this summer. Our appraisal ... is that the ATS—f launch will occur in the early spring of 1974 with ATS—G to follow in a year to eighteen months.” Costs were expected to remain within FY 1973 estimate of $180 million to $215 million exclusive of $48.4-million vehicle costs.
Review of SMS had confirmed need for correction in funding and scheduling because of introduction of advanced design features not adequately assessed in program definition. “Primary emphasis is now being placed on completing engineering model verification tests during . . . this year to insure an orderly initiation of the production phase in early FY 1973.” NASA had established and was monitoring milestone schedules, had strengthened contractor’s project management organization—including change in project manager and transfer of key NASA personnel to organization—and had improved flow of information between NASA and contractor to improve project visibility. Parts procurement was proceeding satisfactorily after “special remedial attention.” SMS development schedule would be 33 mos, placing launch of SMS—A in early fall of 1973. Second spacecraft, sms-b, was scheduled to be launched five months later. SMS—B total runout cost was estimated at maximum $50 million exclusive of $8.4-million vehicle cost, reflecting FY 1973 reprogramming requirement of $4.5 million. “I believe that this project is now proceeding on a sound basis and will prove to be a very significant addition to NOAA’s [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s] weather satellite system.” (Testimony)

They had successfully grown microorganisms in Antarctic soil samples, but no form survived when kept in pond water. “In this environment,” Dr. Cameron said, “the capacity of life to adapt and survive is pushed to its limit and beyond. The concentration of living things around water sources in the dry valleys and their thinning out and final disappearance on the cold, dry slopes may provide the model for the distribution of life we may . . . someday find on Mars.” (nasa Release 72-90)

May 3:	Apollo 16 Astronauts John W. Young, Thomas K. Mattingly II,
and Charles M. Duke, Jr., held press conference at Manned Spacecraft Center and showed films and still photos taken during April 16-27 mission. Crew’s physical condition was already back to normal. Mattingly’s exercise-response tests had been normal one day after landing, and Young’s and Duke’s had been normal two days after landing. Tests to determine potassium levels were still under way.
Young said engine problem that had delayed lunar landing six hours had made Apollo 16 “a cliff-hanger of a mission from where we were sitting in the cockpit; but the ground came through . . . with a couple of clutch hits and put us right back in the ball game. I know there was a lot of work being done on the ground and, speaking for the flight crew, we certainly appreciate it.” Young also praised lunar roving vehicle which carried him and Duke over lunar surface. “The suspension system on the Rover is absolutely remarkable. We never had the feeling of spinning out or anything, but sometimes we went in some deep holes and sometimes the vehicle bounced up in the air and came down on a rock . . . [but] it didn’t seem to affect the performance of the machine.”
Duke said lunar surface was so clear that “features look almost like you’re right next door to them,” like a clear day in western U.S. desert. “Some mountains you think are right next to you and [they] end up 20 miles [32 km] away. You have the same feeling on the lunar surface. Looking out the window from the lunar module . . . South Ray Crater . . . looks like it’s just right next to you, but it was 6 kilometers [3% miles] away.” (Transcript)

May 8:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed space pros-
pects in interview published in U.S. News & World Report: Chances of joint U.S. and U.S.S.R. mission were “quite good.” It hadn’t been decided “exactly how it would work, but there might be two or three astronauts and the same number of cosmonauts.” U.S.S.R. probably would be “very active” in manned space flight until U.S. space shuttle was flying in 1978. “So it may appear that we have lost our leadership during that period.” U.S.S.R. would “try to be first in something— probably with manned and unmanned missions” during 1974 to 1978. “If and when they land men on the moon—even if they land on the same side . . . where we landed—that would attract a lot of public attention. ... If they were to land on the far side of the moon, that would be even more spectacular.” It would also be spectacular, Dr. Fletcher said, if U.S.S.R. announced it was “putting up a space station as the first step in a program to get to Mars.”
Gap in U.S. space program had been caused by “series of things” including cancellation of two Apollos. “We probably should have worked it so that the shuttle would be operating earlier, but we spent a lot of time studying the shuttle—and that was good. . . .” Only possible fill-in was to “fly more Apollo components, and we are looking at that possibility. We have leftover Saturn rockets and leftover com-mand-and-service modules, and we’re looking to see if they can be used between 1974 and 1978.” It would take another Sputnik to accelerate U.S. space program to peak force, “but I don’t see that it’s necessary. ... I honestly think that we could do a reasonably good job on the budget that we’ve programmed for the ’70s. I think the main problem with the five-year gap is going to be loss of national prestige during the period.” Space program critics and decreasing space budget “may have a negative impact on people wanting to stay with the space program.” If there were no gap-filling missions, “we may have to phase part of the astronaut group into some other kinds of work while we wait for the shuttle.” When shuttle was operational it would “enable us to make space flight a routine event. Maybe we’ll have an every Monday-morning flight out to space. This will change the nature of what we do in space completely. When we can get into

It will also be a decade in which we will consciously seek to avoid the large funding peaks that characterized the Apollo era.” Number of achievements possible within limited budgeting would be limited. “In the science arena, and in particular in the exploration of the solar system, this will mean some effort on extending our exploration of earth-like planets. And that will be about it, unless some circumstances again change our emphasis on space science.” In 1980s NASA would “be getting to those very special, very important missions to the smaller bodies of the solar system . . . which will give us probably our best look at the very earliest days of the solar system. Then, in addition, we should during the 1970s look to the best husbanding and application of our space sciences resources to see if we can’t get in

•	Dr. Aleksander P. Vinogradov, Vice President of Soviet Academy of
Sciences, presented report on Luna 20 samples to Academy. He had earlier, on May 4, published data on soil sample in Pravda. Luna 20 had landed near moon’s Apollonius Crater in mountainous area between Sea of Crises and Sea of Fertility and returned to earth with lunar samples. Luna 20 soil was light grey, porous consertal (of texture in which irregular crystals interlocked) material containing fewer glassy, fused particles than Luna 16 samples from Sea of Fertility. Average particle size was 70-80 millimicrometers with largest particle in excess of one millimeter. Albedo value was higher than for samples returned by Luna 16, Apollo 11, or Apollo 12.
Basic mass of particles were anorthositic rock containing large amount of feldspar, metallic iron, and olivine. “The lunar samples’ surprise proved to be the presence of pulverized metallic iron, which . . . does not oxidize, as distinct from terrestrial iron. This discovery may be of great practical significance. We have shown experimentally that under certain conditions it is possible to obtain such iron in the laboratory from basalts. If we succeeded in developing cheap technology for the industrial production of inoxidizable iron, this would give technology a magnificient construction material.” Understanding nature of formation of anorthosites would be of even greater significance. “Perhaps it will even elucidate the most ancient history of our planet. A popular hypothesis once existed among geologists that the earth’s crust originally consisted of anorthosite rocks. Now it has unexpectedly received strong ‘corroboration’ from the moon.
“After study of the lunar rock the nocturnal luminary appears before us as a ‘twofaced Janus.’ On the moon’s visible side vast territories are occupied by basaltic seas, while the entire far side is practically a solid continent, apparently formed from anorthositic rocks. Such a sharp difference is one of the moon’s most exciting secrets.” (Izvestiya, fbis-Sov, 5/17/72, LI; Sov Rpt, 5/19/72, 1)

May 14:	Physicist Dr. Ralph E. Lapp said in Washington Post article
that NASA followed “cart-before-the-horse” or “rocket-before-payload policy” in figuring shuttle costs. Question to be debated was not shuttle transportation “but the basic purpose and worth of payloads.” NASA was “sorely perplexed as a federal agency whose basic mission was accomplished when men landed on the moon.” Skylab mission in 1973, “when a temporary, makeshift station is placed in orbit,” would end NASA manned space flight “unless the shuttle project goes ahead. In a sense, it’s a shuttle to nowhere unless a permanent space station is also approved. This project, last costed at $10 billion, was once the basic rationale of the shuttle, but its price tag scared off congressmen. Now NASA downplays the space station, but the Jan. 31, 1972, Mathe-matica study includes 62 shuttle trips to space stations in one scenario.” (W Post, 5/14/72, B3)

May 16:	Press briefing on Apollo 16 preliminary science results was
held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Dr. David W. Strangway, Chief of msc Geophysics Branch, said magnetic sample returned to moon on Apollo 16 “did pick up fairly strong component of soft magnetization as the result of exposure to the spacecraft systems. On return to the earth, however, we were able to clean that out and to recover the original hard component of magnetization which is what ... we were hoping to do.” Experiment had worked out “quite successfully and suggests that the soft components that we’re seeing in the rocks is indeed of spacecraft origin and is not an artifact of some kind that came from the lunar surface. ... if it did come from the lunar surface we’ve contaminated it so much that we can’t sort it out afterwards. But the hard component then, we believe, is real and it came back through the whole journey and ... is essentially unchanged and unmodified.”
Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said qualitative conclusion from chemical analysis of few samples examined to date was “that the soil is certainly quite homogeneous from point to point.” Homogeneity suggested that rock at Cayley Plains might not be different from rock in Descartes and that neither formation might have been formed from volcanic lava. Samples had very high concentrations of aluminum and calcium—26%% aluminum oxide and 15% calcium—“very different from what we see everywhere on the surface of the earth.”
X-rays of core tubes showed dispersion throughout soil of metal particles—probably metallic iron—up to 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter. Tentative conclusion was “that metallic iron, both in the soil and the rocks, is very much more abundant at this site than it’s been at any other site on the moon and this may be a qualitative characteristic of the Apollo 16 site and perhaps a qualitative characteristic of the highlands is that rocks there contain bits of metallic iron. It is tempting to speculate that this has something to do with the high magnetic field at this region.” Although scientists couldn’t tell just from looking at rocks whether any were volcanic, “the opinion is

Flight tests in 1971 with modified American Airlines Boeing 720 aircraft from Stockton (Calif.) Metropolitan Airport in clear weather had shown “cockpit modifications made procedure of reducing ground noise by effecting steeper approaches in terminal area safe, repeatable, and reasonable under clear-weather conditions.”
Carl C. Ciepluch, Deputy Manager of LeRC Quiet Engine Project Office, discussed first tests, in May, of experimental engine A with acoustic nacelle and 97 900-newton (22 000-lb) thrust. LeRC had tested engine A at takeoff and landing speeds when noise was most noticeable. Tests had shown that if four such engines were installed on DC-8 or Boeing 707 aircraft takeoff noise would be 90 effective perceived noise in decibels (epndb) instead of 116 on takeoff and 118 on approach with current DC-8 and Boeing 707 engines. Although not suitable for wide-bodied jets, quiet engine and nacelle was 8 to 13 epndb quieter than engine used on Boeing 747s and DC-1 Os. Testing of engine with nacelles would continue through fall to measure more precisely effectiveness of noise suppression techniques and measure engine’s internal noise sources other than the fan. Late in year, engine would be tested in a new altitude chamber at Lewis. Second quiet engine was undergoing aerodynamic tests by manufacturer General Electric Co. at Peebles, Ohio, before being delivered to LeRC at end of year for acoustic tests, nasa would use evaluation of both engines in designing quiet experimental engine Mark II for “optimum trade-off period noise reduction and installed weight penalty for aircraft application.”
Newell D. Sanders, Chief of LeRC v/stol and Noise Div., chaired conference and discussed noise levels, methods for noise reduction, and quiet engine principles. (LeRC Release 72-29; Text; Lewis News,

May 21: Proposal for domestic communications satellite system was reviewed by John J. .O’Connor in New York Times. Federal Communications Commission was considering several possible structures for system: completely open entry for applicants, with restrictions limited to antitrust considerations; approval of one applicant or consortium of applicants, subject to restrictions; or plan between these two. Spokesman for one independent group, Network Project, had testified in May congressional hearings protesting that ownership and management by private industry would make granting access for either educational institution or individual “the prerogative of a specialized interest which has historically subordinated public service to private gain.” Network Project viewed “public access to, and control of, satellite facilities as a fundamental right,” particularly since “American people have already invested more than $20-billion in the space program through their taxes.” Question should be opened to debate, including public.

And why?” Satellite research “dominated by the Defense Department” had “involved lasers, computers, sensors and a wide variety of surveillance technology. Cameras on helicopters have already been used to record unaware citizens. Will these techniques become a standard element in a domestic satellite system? And, if so, will the public have

•	Ames Research Center scientist Dr. Robert T. Jones was testing theory
that antisymmetrical wing pivoting on center point might convert aircraft to supersonic transport without high fuel consumption and noise of conventional sst, NASA announced. Aircraft would have conventional straight wing at right angles to fuselage during takeoff on medium-length runways and would require about one fourth the takeoff energy needed by comparable delta-wing jet transports with similar payloads. As aircraft reached speed and altitude where swept wings were efficient, entire wing would rotate about 45° so that wing on one side would point in direction of flight and wing on other side would trail. Studies had indicated that cruising in this configuration at supersonic speeds to mach 1.2 would not produce sonic boom and could be accomplished with fuel economy similar to that of current jet aircraft at subsonic speeds. Conceptual aircraft could cruise up to mach 1.5 over ocean where sonic effects were not detrimental, arc

•	nasa announced start of development of space experiment to test equiva-
lence principle of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Principle asserted that pull of gravity and oppositely directed mechanical acceleration could not be distinguished in small region of space. Thus, when two identical clocks were in areas with different gravitational pull, clock rates would appear to be different, although rates themselves would not change. Gravitational Redshift Space Probe Equipment would be launched from Wallops Station on Scout-D rocket in late
1974.	“Gravitational redshift” was term for decrease or shift toward red spectrum as a light wave escaped from strong gravitational field of sun or other massive body toward weaker gravitational field.
Clock in experiment would follow 3%-hr elliptical flight trajectory over Atlantic and would always be in weaker gravitational field than identical clock at Bermuda ground station. Frequency of clock in probe, as observed by telemetry, should appear greater than frequency of clock on ground and rate should appear to increase as strength of gravitational field decreased up to 18 000-km (11000-mi) altitude and decrease as it returned to stronger field at lower altitudes. Difference between experimental and ground-based clock rates would be compared with shifts predicted by Einstein’s theory.

“Article 6. This Agreement shall enter into force upon signature and shall remain in force for five years. It may be modified or extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.”
Plans for joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission were outlined in Fact Sheet issued by White House Press Secretary in Moscow: “Under today’s agreement both sides commit to the development of a complete project schedule, and to meeting that schedule. Arrangements will be made for the necessary contact and understanding between specialists. . . . Training exercises will be conducted in [each] country for the other country’s flight crew and ground operations personnel.” Working groups would meet in July to plan engineering aspects of mission. Persons directly participating in flight operations of test mission would be included in working groups two years before mission. During mission each country’s control center would be expected to control its own craft, but on decisions affecting joint elements of program—including countdown coordination—consultations would occur with other country. “There will be preplanned contingency courses of action. Television down-link will be transmitted to the other country’s control center, and voice communications between vehicle and ground will be available to the other country’s control center on a pre-planned basis.” Flight crews would be trained in other country’s language at least well enough to understand it and act in response during normal and contingency courses of action. Apollo command and service module (csm) and Saturn IB booster would be used. Additional cost of mission to U.S. would be about $250 million. Project Directors would be Glynn S. Lunney, Assistant to Apollo Program Manager for Operations, Experiments, and Government Furnished Equipment at Manned Spacecraft Center, and Soviet Academician K. D. Bushuyev. (Texts)
• Signing of space cooperation agreement in Moscow was announced by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew at Washington, D.C., press briefing attended by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator; Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Presidential Science Adviser; Glynn S. Lunney, Assistant to Apollo Program Manager for Operations, Experiments, and Government Furnished Equipment at Manned Spacecraft Center; and Apollo 9 Astronaut James A. McDivitt, Special Assistant for Organizational Affairs to msc Director. Dr. Fletcher said: “We . . . are very pleased that the President has been able to meet with the officials of the Soviet Union and to provide what we think is by far the most meaningful cooperation in space achieved ever by these two nations.”
Dr. Fletcher described rendezvous and docking of Apollo space craft and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft as “perhaps the most dramatic” commitment under cooperation agreement. Spacecraft were at present incompatible “because they have different atmospheres. Theirs is a
197
May 24
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
normal atmosphere, ours is a low pressure oxygen . . . atmosphere and there are certain communications and electronics incompatibilities.” Spacecraft would be made compatible by docking module, new device constructed by NASA to link spacecraft. Apollo spacecraft would be launched on Saturn IB rocket. “Then we will make a maneuver at 100 miles [160 kilometers] or so altitude, ... go in and pick out the docking adaptor from the Saturn and then continue on in orbit. Meanwhile the Soviets will launch their Soyuz . . . [and] rendezvous or at least move their altitude to something like 150 miles [240 kilometers]. We won’t be at the same altitude, but hopefully we will be far enough north so too much maneuvering will not be required.” Rendezvous would be performed primarily with U.S.-developed guidance and instrumentation. Then spacecraft would dock with “new kind of . . . mechanism we call androgynous, because it doesn’t consist of a prop and a drogue. ... It is an inverse docking mechanism sp they can dock with us or we can dock with them either way.” System “will apply not only to this . . . mission, but all succeeding spacecraft ... so that we do have the capability, over a long period, of rendezvousing and docking with each other’s spacecraft.”
Dr. Fletcher said original plan to attempt rendezvous and docking with Soviet Salyut space station had been canceled when U.S.S.R. “found that was a very complicated mission because it involved not just two launches, their Soyuz and our apollo, but a third of their Salyut.” Universal docking system using docking adaptor between Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft had been selected because “there has been concern for many years that we did not have a rescue capability ... in space [so] that we each would have the option of rescuing the other. Future spacecraft beyond 1975, which is the planned date for this mission, will all have the capability.”
Total cost of project was estimated at $250 million. Fringe benefits from U.S.-U.S.S.R. joint program were: “It does have the impact of requiring 4,400 people to be employed . . . primarily from the aerospace industry, partly to prepare the command service model and the Saturn IB launch device, hut also to construct the new docking adaptor,” and “it will keep the APOLLO team together . . . through 1975 in preparation for the first launch of the shuttle ... in 1978.” NASA was optimistic that cooperative space effort “may lead to greatly increased cooperation on still other programs.” Joint mission would be “most visible” U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative effort in history, “since it will involve cosmonauts and astronauts working together on a very complex mission in space while the whole world is watching, presumably on television via satellite relay.” (Transcript)
• Second press briefing on U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation agreement was held at NASA Hq., following White House briefing. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said: “This is not the culmination but a very major milestone in the long period of negotiations with the Soviet Union on space cooperation. And in my judgment this is at least one of the most important missions that NASA has and that is to promote international cooperation.” Mission was, as well, “an important part of the new program of NASA for the 70’s.” Rendezvous and docking mission could be accomplished in context of constant NASA budget. “This constant budget . . . and the programs . . . now

•	Agreement on Cooperation in the Fields of Science and Technology was
signed in Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers and U.S.S.R. State Committee for Science and Technology Chairman Vladimir A. Kirillin. Main objective was to “provide broad opportunities for both Parties to combine the efforts of their scientists and specialists in working on major problems, whose solution will promote the progress of science and technology for the benefit of both countries and of mankind.” Cooperation might include exchange of scientists and specialists; exchange of scientific and technical information; joint development and implementation of programs and projects in basic and applied sciences; joint research, development, and testing, and exchange of research results and experience between scientific research institutions and organizations; organization of joint courses, conferences, and symposia; and help in establishing contacts and arrangements between U.S. firms and Soviet enterprises. Agreement would establish U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation to meet at least annually, in Washington and Moscow alternately.
Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Presidential Science Adviser, said at Washington, D.C., press conference following Moscow signing that Agreement would “enable Soviet and American specialists to solve some major common problems.” Cooperation would produce “more vigorous activities here ... on research, management and systems science, wide use of natural resources, weather modification, superconductivity, high energy physics and basic science.” U.S. and U.S.S.R. had already derived major benefits from cooperation in fusion technology and “in the magneto hydrodynamic area, the breeder reactor area and in the solar energy area, we are doing things . . . that are of interest to the Soviet Union.” (PD, 6/5/72, 921-2; Transcript)

Born in the mad competition for status characteristic of the cold war, manned and unmanned space research has taught both sides how puny are man’s resources in facing the mystery and challenge of the universe. As that lesson has sunk in, both sides have come to understand the advantages of cooperation as against useless and wasteful rivalry.” (NYT, 5/25/72, 42)
St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “Cooperation in solving medical and environmental problems and the exchange of personnel and information in space research should stand as predecessors for other joint efforts at solving problems faced by both nations. And it should go without saying that the more both countries pursue common objectives together, the more they ought to trust each other and the less likely they should be to resort to rash belligerency.” {St Louis P—D, 5/25/72)
May 26: U.S.-U.S.S.R. Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems and Interim Agreement With Respect to the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms were signed in Moscow by President Nixon and Communist Party Leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, abm treaty—-requiring Senate ratification—limited each country to two ABM deployment areas with radius of 150 km (93 mi) each and with no more than 100 ABMs in each. One area would be centered on national capital and one would protect field of intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms). Each country was permitted six modern abm radar

complexes within capital area. Interim agreement froze production of icbms for five years or until full treaty was negotiated, if earlier. Possession of icbms was limited to those already deployed or under construction—1054 for U.S. and 1618 for U.S.S.R. Agreement also froze construction of submarine-launched ballistic missiles for nuclear submarines beyond those already begun. New construction of icbms, submarine missiles, or modern ballistic missile submarines would require dismantling equal number of older ones.
Agreements left both nations with near-parity in nuclear weapon strength. U.S. would lead in strategic bombers with 460, with 140 for U.S.S.R.; both countries would have 2500 delivery vehicles; and Soviet megatonnage would be triple that of U.S. but U.S. would have some advantage in warheads. Each country would use “national technical means of verification,” rather than on-site means, to monitor compliance with treaty terms. Baltimore Sun said later that means intended were “obviously spy satellites that use photographic and other means to check on developments in each country.”
Statement released by White House Press Secretary in Moscow following signing of agreements said President Nixon was “deeply gratified that now, for first time since the advent of nuclear weapons a generation ago, the two most powerful nations . . . have taken the lead in a direction away from wasteful, dangerous, and self-perpetuating competition in armaments and toward a mutual restraint on weapons systems.” President intended “to press ahead ... in building on that foundation laid down by this initial salt [Strategic Arms Limitation Talks] accord, and to seek both further progress in the limitation of offensive weapons, and more comprehensive agreements across the whole range of issues confronting our two countries.” {PD, 6/5/72, 925-37; Kumpa, B Sun, 5/27/72, Al)
• NASA anounced retirement of Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, effective July 1 when he would become Corporate Vice President for Engineering and Development at Fairchild Industries. Dr. von Braun had joined NASA in 1960 when Army Ballistic Missile Agency development team which he headed was transferred to NASA and formed nucleus of Marshall Space Flight Center.
Born in Germany, Dr. von Braun became director of German army portion of Peenemuende Rocket Center. Near end of World War II he led group of scientists to West, surrendering to allies. In 1945 he went to U.S. under contract to U.S. Army to direct high-altitude firings of V—2 long-range ballistic missile at White Sands Missile Range. As Director of Development Operations Div. of abma, Dr. von Braun led development of Pershing Army missile and Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile, whose nosecone reentry test vehicle Jupiter-C was used to launch first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1 (Jan. 31, 1958). Dr. von Braun was msfc Director from July 1960 to February 1970, when he assumed his current position. He had received numerous awards and honors, including Dept, of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award, Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy, British Interplanetary Society Gold Medal, Herman Oberth Award, NASA Medal for Outstanding Leadership, Galabert International Astronautical Prize, NASA Distinguished Service Medal, American Society of Mechanical

Dr. von Braun said he would leave NASA “with a deep feeling of gratitude for the wonderful and unique opportunities the agency has given me during the last 12 years . . . [and] with the knowledge that NASA has enough well thought out plans to keep it moving ahead for many years to come.”
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said Dr. von Braun’s retirement was “a source of regret to all of us. ... For more than a quarter of a century, he has served the United States as a leader in space rocket development. His efforts first put the United States in space” with Explorer 1 and as director of msfc “he directed the development of the world’s most powerful rocket, the Saturn V. All of us at NASA will miss the daily stimulation of his presence, but we are confident that we will continue to have the benefit of his inspiration and counsel in the continuing exploration and use of space.” (nasa Release 72—113; NASA biographical data)

•	Newspapers commented on U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation agreement.
Wall Street Journal: “Whereas past space efforts have been an extension and symbol of Soviet-American competition, the proposed new effort will attempt to extend and symbolize cooperation.” Question was “whether this change is contrived and doomed to fail as an expression of national needs and attitudes or whether it signifies the dawning of a new era in the progress of man. A case may be made either way. . . .” {WSJ, 5/26/72)
Christian Science Monitor saw agreement as “commitment to peace, to friendly relations in the years ahead on the part of the world’s two superpowers.” Agreement meant extension of Apollo program to bridge gap between last Skylab mission in 1973 and 1978 space shuttle flights. “It will mean an estimated 4,400 more jobs in the aerospace industry. It will mean that Soviet space crews will come to the United States for training and vice versa. And once the rendezvous is made televiewers in both countries will be able to watch their astronauts moving from one spacecraft to another and conducting joint scientific experiments.” (CSM, 5/25/72)
Miami Herald: “Both sides may learn a bit from each other .... What most people will learn is likely to be more meaningful because emotions are the mainspring of human attitudes and actions. National prestige has been a foremost consideration in space for more than 15 years. Preparation for the joint flight promises to remold the effort into a symbol of international cooperation.” (M Her, 5/26/72)

Washington Post: “The promise is that this first docking and the steps that lead to it may be the key to a new coordinated joint effort to explore and exploit those parts of the universe within man’s reach.” If mission was successful, “it ought to be possible for [U.S. and U.S.S.R.] to cooperate on most other aspects of space operations. The benefits to each country from such an arrangement would be great. By curtailing both competition and duplication in space activities, scientists on both sides would be able to do in good time the things that ought to be done without straining the financial resources of their governments nearly as much in the process.” (W Post, 5/26/72) May 27:	Donald K. Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at
Manned Spacecraft Center, said in telephone interview with New York Times that NASA astronaut corps would be cut because it had “three times as many people as are needed.” If all astronauts had stayed in program, many “would just be on dead-end streets. There have been retirements right along, and there will be further reductions. . . . It’s just a fact of life that we have only one Apollo, three Skylab and one ‘ren-dock’ flights ahead of us, and our manpower is over our known requirements by a factor of three.”
Of 27 astronauts who had flown on Apollo missions, 12 had already left flying status. As many as 10 astronauts reportedly already had been asked to find other employment as soon as possible, Washington Post said astronaut corps had confirmed. Two had recently resigned— Edgar A. Mitchell and James B. Irwin—and many more of the 43 astronauts remaining were planning resignations. Philip K. Chapman would join staff of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anthony W. England would join Science and Applications Directorate at msc. Donald L. Holmquest and John S. Bull, both on temporary leave to universities for past year, were also expected to resign. According to one unidentified astronaut, “Slayton really feels that he doesn’t need any more than 15 men” for shuttle and joint Soviet missions. In 1967 and 1968, astronaut total had reached peak of 63 men. (Lyons, NYT, 5/28/72, 1; O’Toole, W Post, 5/28/72, A14)
• Dr. Wernher von Braun’s resignation from NASA May 26 was “reminder of how many others who forged the American space effort in the last 15 years have left the scene,” New York Times commented. Mercury Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., was “Ohio businessman with political ambitions”; Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman was Eastern Airlines Vice President; Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong was Univ. of Cincinnatti professor; former NASA Administrator James E. Webb, “who built the Apollo team,” was lawyer-consultant in Washington,
D.C.; Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, “administrator in charge at the time of the moon landing,” was General Electric Co. Vice President. Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, “who gathered the manned space flight team while Dr. von Braun was building the rockets,” had “recently stepped down as director of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.” Others of “space’s first generation have scattered to industry or are close to retirement.” Of original 118 German-born engineers who came to U.S. with Dr. von Braun, only 35 remained at Marshall Space Flight Center. Dr. Eberhard F. M. Rees, “another of the Peenemuende V-2 rocket Germans,” was msfc director. Six of original team—including Dr. Kurt H. Debus, director of Kennedy Space Center—were still

•	Press commented on U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation agreement.
U.S. would “be doing virtually all of the cooperating” in joint space mission called for under new U.S.-U.S.S.R. space agreement, William Hines said in Washington Sunday Star. “While negotiations were underway ... it was assumed that the 1975 joint manned space flight envisioned . . . would be a 50-50 proposition. The Americans would build the hardware . . . and the Russians would provide a small space station in which experiments could be carried out.” Instead, U.S.S.R. had “pulled back their item—the Salyut station— and changed the nature of the mission.” This had relieved U.S.S.R. of considerable expense and “left Uncle Sam holding a $250 million bag, this sum being the estimated cost of the hardware our side will have to build anyway.” (W Star, 5/28/72, A6)
St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “An agreement between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. . . . ought to be just the first step toward full international co-operation in space. Countries which lack space programs of their own should be encouraged to participate in space ventures as limited partners.” Other countries had scientific expertise to contribute. “Beyond this they ought to receive the full benefits of whatever information

•	Achievements of U.S.-U.S.S.R. summit meetings in Moscow to date were
summarized in New York Times article by Max Frankel. U.S. and Soviet officials had “duly signed the agreements that had been specially packaged for the occasion. Some, on cooperative ventures in health research, environmental control, scientific cooperation and a link-up of astronauts in space, had been merely rewritten or upgraded from earlier agreements, to add to the cumulative sense of achievement. One of the accords, to avoid naval harassment and incidents at sea, had been negotiated under the deadline of the summit.” Another, on trade, had become “too complicated to resolve” and was “earmarked for energetic followup this summer.” Agreement to limit construction of defensive and offensive nuclear weapons “was finally finished in a whirlwind round of all-night sessions.” Main premises behind summit meeting were “that the two superpowers are now truly strategic equals, that they both have enough invulnerable weapons to deter nuclear attack, that they need to stop adding more weapons before they can reduce the number of weapons, that they both can use the money they might eventually have for better purposes, that they must avert even indirect conflicts that might draw them into war, and that they must collaborate more broadly in other fields to avoid the intrusions of inevitable conflicts of interest and conflicts among smaller nations.” (NYT, 5/28/72, 4:1)

May 29: President Nixon and Secretary General Leonid I. Brezhnev of Soviet Communist Party’s Central Committee signed “Basic Principles of Relations” outlining agreements made between U.S. and U.S.S.R. during May 22-29 summit meetings in Moscow. They then released joint communique at conclusion of President’s visit to U.S.S.R. Communique described agreements on cooperation in science and technology and space: “It was recognized that the cooperation now underway in areas such as atomic energy research, space research, health and other fields benefits both nations and has contributed positively to their over-all relations. It was agreed that increased scientific and technical cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and shared effort for common goals is in the interest of both nations and would contribute to a further improvement in their bilateral relations.” In peaceful exploration of space, “both Sides emphasized the importance of further bilateral cooperation.... In order to increase the safety of mam’s flights into outer space and the future prospects of joint scientific experiments, the two Sides agreed to make suitable arrangements to permit the docking of American and Soviet spacecraft and stations. The first joint docking experiment of the two countries’ piloted spacecraft, with visits by astronauts and cosmonauts to each other’s spacecraft is contemplated for 1975.” NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences would plan and

Commenting on agreements signed with U.S.S.R. during May 22-29 Moscow summit meetings, he said: “Recognizing that the quest for useful knowledge transcends differences between ideologies and social systems, we have agreed to expand United States-Soviet cooperation in many areas of science and technology.
“We have joined in plans for an exciting new adventure ... in the cooperative exploration of space, which will begin—subject to Congressional approval of funding—with a joint orbital mission of an Apollo vehicle and a Soviet spacecraft in 1975.” President asked for “fullest scrutiny” of antiballistic missile treaty signed May 26, “because we can undertake agreements as important as these only on a basis of full partnership between the executive and legislative branches of our Government.” {PD, 6/5/72, 975-81)
• Astronomy Survey Committee of National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council issued Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1970’s, Vol. 1. Committee assessed state of astronomy and astrophysics and recommended priorities for Federal funding in 10-yr, $1.2-billion program to study “entirely new class of objects . . . undreamed of ten years ago.” New technologies applied during decade had revealed new types of worlds. Previously well organized universe had “exploded into a bewildering universe” of objects with “exotic new names and marvelous new natures.” Opening of radio sky had suggested presence of undiscovered physical laws and requirements for new observations and explanations.
Committee defined four programs of highest priority: (1) very large radio array to attain resolution equivalent to that of single radiotelescope 42 km (26 mi) in diameter, plus increased support of smaller radio programs at universities or research laboratories; (2) optical program to increase efficiency of existing telescopes with electronic auxiliaries, while creating new large telescopes to research limits of known universe; (3) increased support and development of infrared astronomy, including construction of large, ground-based infrared telescope, high-altitude balloon surveys, and design studies for very large atmospheric telescope; and (4) program for x-ray and gamma ray astronomy from High Energy Astronomy Observatories (heaos) supported by ground-based optical and infrared telescopes.
Committee recommended for secondary priority: construction of very large millimeter-wavelength antenna to identify and study complex molecules and to study quasars in their most explosive stages; doubling of support for astrophysical observations from aircraft, balloons, and rockets, at wavelengths from far infrared to gamma rays; continuation of Orbiting Solar Observatories through oso-L, —M, and -N, with updating of ground-based solar facilities; increased

•	Lunar Samples Analysis Planning Team, using information imparted
at Third Lunar Science Conference [see Jan. 10-13], reported in Science on advances made and problems still outstanding in lunar science. Most important gain had been that “we now know there is a lunar crust.” Primal igneous activity in outer layers of moon had generated feldspathic crust 40 km (25 mi) thick. Apollo 15 core samples had shown that material at all levels had resided within few centimeters (one inch or so) of lunar surface at some time, but gradient in some cosmic ray product allowed tentative conclusion that soil in lower half of core had been stratified for 0.5 hillion yrs. Apollo 15 mission and Third Lunar Science Conference had answered many fundamental questions, but each answer raised new questions. “What are the nature and chronology of rock types in the lunar highlands? Answers to date have been indirect or broadbrush. The most interesting epoch of lunar history, the first half-billion years, is recorded in highland rocks if it is preserved anywhere. Why is the occurrence of lunar norite or kreep so sharply restricted to the northwest quadrant of the moon’s nearside? Is an exceptionally mighty impact . . . required to raise noritic rock to the surface? This would be inconsistent with the supposedly shallow depth of origin of the Fra Mauro Formation cratering debris.”

If the nature of compositional heterogeneities in the moon at the time of its accretion can be inferred correctly from chemical and petrologic studies . . . this information will go far toward answering the question.” Goal of understanding moon would be furthered by international cooperation.

He had been asked at bis first NASA Hq. press conference if he “did not feel like the captain of the ill-fated ship Titanic.” Ten “good reasons” why reporters no longer asked that question were: (1) NASA had defined space program for 1970s that was “as challenging, as exciting, and as rewarding as our space achievements of the last decade, but less costly.” (2) New program had been approved by President and Congress “with a strong bi-partisan majority.” (3) Program could be carried out over next six or eight years at present $3.4-billion NASA budget level “which calls for steady space progress at a cost the country can afford.” (4) Balanced program meant increased capability for “useful work in all the major areas of space activity.” (5) “We have chosen the re-usable Space Shuttle as our major investment in new space technology . . . and . . . have succeeded in redesigning the Shuttle to cut estimated development costs in half without significant losses in performance.” (6) “We have settled the argument over whether to stress manned or unmanned space missions in the Seventies. The shuttle will be used for both.” (7) Space shuttle in military service “will make an important contribution to our national security.” (8) Program was “relevant to the needs of modern America.” Information culled from Earth Resources Technology Satellites would “help protect the environment of spaceship Earth.” (9) Space shuttle program to develop future uses of space provided “necessary base for increased international cooperation,” adding significance to U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation agreement.

Nor is there any prospect of such world government in time to act.” Day approached “when technical accomplishment makes it not only possible to export mass quantities of men and women in fleets of immense spacecraft but also to seed the distant planets and still more distant stars so that they become habitable for human beings.” This was “logical, ultimate goal of all ecological crises. Within sensible limitations of cleanliness, the aim must be not to reduce by Gandhian means of zero growth but to produce—to mass produce—new Noah’s arks and thrust them into the infinity of the universe.” (NYT, 6/11/72, 4:15)
June 12:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, spoke on coopera-

Small business may be the key element which preserves American free enterprise.” NASA’s “broad and vigorous” R&D effort generated “literally hundreds of new processes, new products and new materials.” Transfer of technology to areas unrelated to space meant “profits for private enterprise, jobs for labor, and benefits for the consumer.” Transfers benefited small entrepreneur because “he is flexible—and can take advantage of the financing specifically made available for this kind of enterprise.” NASA maintained contract category especially for small business—contracts between $2500 and $500 000 for construction work. “In 1971, this resulted in 73% of NASA’s expenditures for construction.” (Text)

June 13-14: Intelsat-IV F-5 comsat was launched by NASA for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (intelsat). Satellite, launched from Eastern Test Range at 5:39 pm edt by Atlas-Centaur booster, entered elliptical transfer orbit. Primary NASA objective was to place satellite into transfer orbit accurate enough for spacecraft onboard propulsion systems to place it in planned synchronous orbit. ComSatCorp objectives were to fire apogee motor, position satellite in its planned geostationary orbit, and operate and manage communications system for INTELSAT.
Apogee-kick motor was fired at 9:00 pm edt June 14 and Intelsat-IV F—5 entered circular orbit with 36 824.2-km (22 882.1-mi) altitude at 124° east longitude. It would drift westward 4.4° per day to reach station at 61.4° east longitude over Indian Ocean by end of July. Satellite’s first major transmission would be coverage of Olympic Games in Munich in August.
Intelsat-IV F-5 was fourth comsat in Intelsat IV series. Satellite was 238 cm (93.7 in) in diameter and 528 cm (208 in) high and weighed 1387 kg (3058 lbs) at launch. It had 12 transponders, providing 12 TV channels and 3000-9000 telephone circuits, and was capable of multiple-access and simultaneous transmissions. Expected lifetime was seven years. Intelsat-IV F-4 had been launched Jan. 22 and was operating satisfactorily over Pacific, (nasa proj off; NASA Release 72-119)

June 14: Press conference on scientific results of NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971) was held at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Robert H. Steinbacher, project scientist, said Mars “used to he likened to earth in science fiction, and was compared to the moon after the first pictures from Mariner 4 in 1965. Now we are seeing that Mars has a character all its own. It is not earth-like or moon-like, it is Mars-like.”
Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey said Mars could be divided into four major geological provinces: Nix Olympica-Tharis volcanic province with volcanoes up to 8 km (5 mi) high and 500 km (300 mi) in diameter; Ophir-Eos equatorial plateau region with faults and rifts 5 km (3 mi) deep; cratered and smooth terrains with large circular basins like lunar impact basins; and south polar cratered terrain covered with glacial sediment layers up to 100 m (330 ft) thick. Convincing evidence that water had played active role in evolution of Mars was shown in Mariner 9 photos of deep, winding channels that might have once been beds of fast-flowing streams. Masursky suggested two explanations for apparent heavy rains and floods on Mars in past: volcanic heat might have melted water ice

stored below surface as permafrost or increased dosages of sunlight on polar caps every 50 000 yrs, because of axis wobbling, might have melted polar caps completely.
Dr. Geoffrey A. Biggs of Jpl described north polar hood of variable clouds that appeared to have general west-to-east flow pattern, with some systems resembling small cyclones. Photos also showed “white cloud phenomenon”—brilliant white spots, believed to be water ice clouds, associated with volcanoes. “The clouds appear mostly in the afternoon, when warmer air is moving up the slopes and cooling as it goes.” Pictures of north polar area showed wavelike clouds “formed by a simple, harmonic movement of air, of winds up to 115 miles per hour [185 kilometers per hour] . . . very much like the cold fronts shown in earth atmosphere pictures.” (Summary statement and abstracts; Wilford, NYT, 6/15/72, 1; Swaim, Pasadena Star-News, 6/15/72)

It was 256 800 000 km (1.7 astronomical units) from sun, moving through region of space never before traversed by man-made object. All science instruments had been turned on and checked out and all other instruments were operating satisfactorily. Meteoroid detector had recorded 42 hits to date. When Pioneer 10 entered asteroid belt between July 15 and 26, frequency of meteoroid encounters was expected to increase.

From these, 300 were being selected; 50 investigations would be carried out in 35 other countries—about one third of the countries represented at United Nations Stockholm conference [see June 5-16]. Investigations reflected “an understanding of real needs and are aimed at meeting these needs.” (Text)

“In the last few years experimenters have artificially modified the space environment. We can now produce artificial aurorae. We can change the population of the Van Allen radiation belt. We can artificially modify the ionosphere from the ground and our other ideas about artificial experiments for the future stretch as far as trying to copy the sweeping action being carried on naturally by Jupiter’s moons.” Other possible man-made changes in near-earth space environment included releasing beam of energetic particles from satellite to produce electromagnetic waves in space, injecting thermal plasma at high altitudes to change radiation population in space, and transmitting electromagnetic waves from earth to disturb particles trapped in Van Allen belt. Experiments would provide data on natural processes that caused geomagnetic storms on earth, permit improved predictions of radar clutter and quality of polar radio communications in future naturally occurring storms, permit modification or attenuation of naturally occurring storms, and enable scientists to make near-earth space environment safe for prolonged manned space flight and study.

June 15:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, and Apollo 16
Astronauts Charles M. Duke, Jr., John W. Young, and Thomas K. Mattingly II met with President Nixon at White House to discuss April 16-27 Apollo 16 mission and joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission scheduled for 1975.
Following discussion Dr. Fletcher and astronauts held press conference. Dr. Fletcher said President was “very pleased” with progress made toward joint mission. “The President particularly wanted to emphasize that . . . this is only the beginning of what he conceives as a long association with the Soviet Union in many other areas of space cooperation. ... we are busy working on other kinds of things that we can do together . . . perhaps through the turn of the century, doing things together for economic reasons and because he feels strongly that the international aspect of this is important in improving relationships. If we can do this together, we can do other things together.” President also emphasized worldwide space cooperation.
As areas for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in future, Dr. Fletcher thought “the ones we can be sure of” were “the cooperative program on Mars [and] a new cooperative program on Venus, where we explore the upper atmosphere and the entire atmosphere and they explore the surface. We are going to be doing that together.” (Other nasa officials explained later these would be coordinated efforts rather than joint missions.)
July meeting of principals at Manned Spacecraft Center would “iron out the management” of joint docking mission. Astronaut Young said that “real problem” was communication; “once we solve that problem we can prove that we can work together in a lot of other areas besides.” Dr. Fletcher said plans for joint astronaut and cosmonaut training had not been concluded, “but it is going to be absolutely essential that the cosmonauts come over here and train on our equipment and vice versa. That much has been agreed to.” Training program probably would start “within about a year.” Dr. Fletcher summed up progress made on joint mission since May 24 signing of cooperation agreement: “We have set up the agenda for the meeting which will primarily involve the management aspects. ... We also have, at

home, worked out some of the details of the specifications . . . and now are waiting approval.” Perhaps most “spectacular” progress had been “great enthusiasm from Congress for the mission, particularly when we told them this was not going to cost any more money.” (Transcript; WSJ, 6/16/72)	.
•	Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified before House
Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space on U.S.—U.S.S.R. agreement on cooperation in space [May 24]. He described events that led to agreement on joint rendezvous and docking mission: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, then nasa Administrator, had suggested to Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov during April 1970 meeting in New York “possibility of cooperation in the area of astronaut safety, including compatible docking fixtures for space stations and shuttles.” National Academy of Sciences President, Dr. Philip Handler, had conveyed NASA’s interest to Soviet Academy President Mstislav V. Keldysh. “In July, Dr. Paine suggested directly to President Keldysh that this possibility be considered.” Dr. Low said if docking mission was successful, “both countries will have increased their chances of rescuing astronauts in distress without commensurate increase in the costs of a standby rescue capability. It is here that the joint test mission is particularly important. It will give us the opportunity to identify and resolve under the best possible conditions the problems we can expect to flow from differences in language, equipment, and operational procedures.” Joint working groups were making significant progress. Space meteorology group was organizing experiments to advance temperature sounding from satellites and microwave measurement of precipitation zones, ice conditions, and sea surface roughness and temperature. Another joint working group had provided for coordination of meridional sounding rocket networks in Eastern and Western Hemispheres and had begun to exchange operational and scientific meteorological data. Working group on natural environment was defining coordinated experiments in remote sensing of the environment related to vegetation, geology, and the oceans. Oceanographic effort would continue satellite and ship measurements over same ocean area. In group on scientific investigation of near-earth space, moon, and planets, “experts from both sides have been working on a common system of lunar coordinates and a program for compiling a complete map of the moon on the scale of 1:5,000,000.” Group on space biology and medicine was “considering certain common standards and procedures to increase the comparability of information.”
If U.S. and U.S.S.R. could work together to achieve “intimate and complex common goal” like joint space mission, “we will have built mutual confidence and trust. The symbol of US and Soviet spacemen meeting in orbit before the eyes of the entire world cannot help but ameliorate attitudes, viewpoints and expectations throughout the world.” (Transcript)

congressional briefing at White House he said: “Our present strategic military situation is sound. Much of the criticism has focused on the imbalance in number of missiles.” To assess overall balance “it is necessary to consider those forces not in the agreement; our bomber force which is substantially larger and more effective than the Soviet bomber force, and our forward base system.” U.S. had “major advantage in nuclear weapons technology and in warhead accuracy.” With its multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), U.S. had two-to-one lead in warheads. Lead would be maintained during agreement period, “even if the Soviets develop and deploy MIRV’s of their own.” U.S.S.R. had more missile launchers than U.S., “but when other relevant systems such as bombers are counted there are roughly the same number of launchers on each side. We have a big advantage on warheads. The Soviets have an advantage on megatonnage.” What was disadvantageous to U.S. was “trend of new weapons deployment” by U.S.S.R. and “projected imbalance 5 years hence hased on that trend.” Relevant question was “what the freeze prevents; where would we be by 1977 without a freeze?” Considering current Soviet momentum in intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, “ceiling set in the Interim Agreement can only be interpreted as a sound arrangement that makes a major contribution to our national security.” (Text)

•	Wall Street Journal article criticized “strange aspects to NASA’s push
for the shuttle.” Economic estimates of cost were “troublesome.” Some critics had charged that development costs might be “two to four times the $6 billion estimate of NASA. And the operating cost may not be as cheap as NASA says.” “Strangest” aspect of NASA argument was “agency’s almost total silence on the one space project for which the shuttle makes real sense—the permanent orbiting space station.” It had been assumed space station would be “keystone of any long-range space effort involving men” from beginning of space program. Project had been “shoved aside” in favor of manned lunar landing but “the moment that race was won . . . NASA pulled the space station plans back out.” It was easier to sell public $6-billion research and development program for “useful” space shuttle than $40-billion program for space station. But NASA’s “selling spiel” was “somewhat misleading.” Once $6-billion development program was finished shuttle would go into routine operation. “Plans call for 30 to 40 flights a year for 10 years. At $10.5 million a flight this comes to $30 billion to $40 billion— about the same in time and money as proposed for the space station.” Paper later acknowledged its arithmetical miscalculation and corrected total to “$3 billion to $4 billion,” but said corrected figure also was “misleading.” NASA estimate had projected $35 billion for shuttle program through 1990, including $12 billion for shuttle and $23 billion for payloads.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
Failure showed “differing methods of Kennedy the idealist and Nixon the pragmatist.” President Nixon had “smoothed the way” with seven meetings between U.S. and Soviet engineers, beginning with April 24, 1970, meeting between then NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, and Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov. President Kennedy’s attitude toward space program had been “ambivalent” until Sept. 20, 1963, when he proposed “joint expedition to the moon” in speech before United Nations. Proposal had come as surprise and had “staggered” anti-Soviet space supporters in Congress, who proceeded to pare NASA budget. House had voted 125 to 110 against using NASA funds for joint lunar landing with Communist country. Kennedy had “forgotten that politics is the art of the possible, forgotten that a leader should never surprise his own close support,” Sherrod said. “In the sunnier climate of 1972, Richard Nixon duly observed the axiom and the rule.” (NYT, 6/17/72)
June 18: There was “general satisfaction” among ordinary Russians with “the improved atmosphere fostered by President Nixon’s visit to Moscow” in May, New York Times reported. Since visit, Soviet press had hailed arms-limitation agreements as triumphs for Soviet foreign policy.

Ending of Moscow summit talks (May 22-26) just as United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (June 5-16) opened was “coincidental,” Stanley Karnow commented in Houston Chronicle article. “But historians may one day regard the timing of the two meetings as symptomatic of a significant change that is now taking place in the world.” Moscow summit “essentially spelled the end of an era in which the powers viewed military rivalries as the main threat to their security.” Stockholm conference “appears to mark the start of an era in which nations will view ecological disequilibrium as an increasingly dire menace to their security.” (H Chron, 6/18/72)
• U.S. Postal Service officials had been “somewhat upset” by reports that Apollo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M.

Sieger, German stamp dealer, had sold 100 Apollo 15 covers at 4850 German marks each for total $150 350 at official exchange rate. Under NASA regulations, astronauts had been permitted to carry on mission small mementos of flight for friends and relatives but not for sale. Official “moon mail” covers were distributed to purchasers by U.S. Postal Service. Specially struck medals had been carried on several Apollo missions and later sold to public through Government channels.

June 20:	NASA held press conference on erts-A Earth Resources Tech-
nology Satellite (to be launched July 23) at Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Arch B. Park, Chief of NASA Earth Resources Survey Program, described experiments that “typify ... a direct relationship between the results of the experiment and the interest ... of the general public.” Most important experiments were in land use and understanding geology, soils, vegetation, and engineering aspects of man’s mass works. Second was environmental awareness, including experiments in biological control of pests, water quality, mine safety, forest conservation, and resources management.
Primary objective of erts was described by project manager Wilfred E. Scull as “the acquisition of multi-spectral images” over U.S. and rest of world and use of data for various disciplines. Spacecraft, scheduled for launch July 21, would weigh 939 kg (2070 lbs) and would be launched into sun-synchronous, circular earth orbit at 920km (570-mi) altitude, repeating coverage under same conditions of illumination over entire globe every 18 days. Onboard equipment included three return-beam-vidicon (rbv) cameras that would take pictures every 25 sec, multispectral scanner subsystem (mss) that would continually scan ground directly beneath satellite, and two wideband video tape recorders (wbvtr) to record and store images for later playback. Data-collection system consisted of remote platforms for measuring soil, water, and air quality and other environmental data and transmitting data to erts as it passed overhead. Data would be telemetered to three main stations (Fairbanks, Alaska; Goldstone, Calif.; and Greenbelt, Md.) and processed at gsfc. All images received by NASA would be sent to Dept, of Agriculture, Dept, of Interior, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Transcript)

June 22:	Press conference on preliminary results of Apollo 16 experi-
ments was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Dr. Fairouk El-Baz of photo-geology team described metric camera photo of old, three-ring basin about 960 km (600 mi) in diameter on far side of moon. Eastern part of ring coincided with “what the Soviets had called some 10 years ago right after the Luna 3 photographs . . . the Soviet Mountains.” NASA had concluded from Lunar Orbiter and Apollo 8 photos that formation was not mountains but “the coincidence of very bright rays from two relatively young craters,” and U.S.S.R. had conceded to elimination of Soviet Mountains from lunar dictionary. Apollo 16 photos showed, however, that “what we have here is really the Soviet Mountains rediscovered, so to speak, that is part of a middle ring of a very old basin.” Dr. EI-Baz said that, pending approval of International Astronomical Union, large basin would be named Arabia in honor of Arab contributions to astronomy, eastern range of middle ring of basin would be called Soviet Mountains, and long western range of middle ring discovered by Apollo 16 would be called American Mountains.
Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic experiment, said May 13 meteorite impact on moon “may well turn out to be the most important single seismic event the Apollo Network will record in its life unless the good fairy sends us another fragment of rock. It provided very important confirmation of the structure that we have proposed based on the S-IVB impact.” Seismometers had also recorded other meteorite impacts and dozens of moonquakes. “We’ve been able to establish at least the presence of 20 different moonquake source locations. They . . . have the familiar pattern which can be correlated with lunar tides and hence are triggered by lunar tides.” Most puzzling question was what energy source within moon caused moonquakes. “We don’t have the answer to that. We do have the puzzling fact that the two source zones we’ve located are nearly 900 kilometers [560 miles] deep . . . the depth at which our very tentative evidence places a reflector. . . . there seems something special about that depth. All of the Moon above that depth within our network area, at least, must be . . . solid. Very high frequency seismic waves can propagate through it. Such high frequencies are eliminated from terrestrial earthquake signals by a partially molten low velocity zone.” If part of moon were molten, “it’s either in very, very small isolated pockets or at greater depth than 1000 kilometers [620 miles].”

Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said about 90% of Apollo 16 lunar samples consisted of aluminum-and calcium-rich material. “The aluminum and calcium concentration . . . approach the composition of pure plagioclase ... a name component of . . . anorthosite. They are very typical of what one finds in the highlands anywhere on the moon where we have any chemical data. Now, the negative side of that conclusion is that these rocks are not as had been thought prior to the mission, a kind of volcanic rock that is rich in silica ... a viscous volcanic rock. It’s quite definite that the so-called Cayley formation ... is not a volcanic formation and I think we can generalize with some confidence that... it probably is not a volcanic formation in the other places on the moon where it has been identified or mapped in, either. There are a few rocks . . . which are distinctly different” from the rest in lower aluminum concentration, 15 to 18 percent, and higher magnesium-iron concentration with composition that could be that of volcanic rocks. They were also high in potassium and phosphorus. From Apollo data scientists had identified four major types of rocks: grey breccias that contained black and white clasts (rock fragments); black feldspar rock that appeared under microscope to be igneous because it was tough and dense; very white cataclasites of crushed plagioclase-rich material; and crystalline rocks. One rock in Apollo 16 samples, “rusty rock,” was covered by red, rust-like coating. Identification of rust, so far, was only visual; x-ray and mineralogical tests had not yet been made. “It may turn out to be ... a more exotic type of iron compound than simple rust. It’s quite definite that this ... is something that’s rusting; it’s something that took place on the Moon . . . not ... in the spacecraft on the way back or from handling the rock. The coatings are dispersed through the inside of the rock and too thick and too diverse to have been formed in the spacecraft.” (Transcript)

•	Was it “reasonable to expect that Europe’s disorganized space effort
can make a positive contribution to a major American manned space programme?” English aerospace expert Kenneth W. Gatland asked in New Scientist article. Poor showing of European Launcher Development Organization (eldo) to date had “done nothing to inspire confidence” since its 1962 inception. Despite 11 firings with last 4 intended to achieve orbit, “we have yet to see an eldo satellite circling the Earth.” In same period U.S. had “developed Apollo and landed 10 men on the Moon!”
European specialists had been working with U.S. aerospace companies on shuttle components and it would be possible, “depending on the financial arrangements,” for Europe to build complete unit like sortie can or space tug. “Whatever Europe produced, in effect, would be supplied free of cost to NASA. Actually, there should be a bonus as labour costs here are about half those in America, which would . . . offset the extra costs involved in collaboration.” In return “Europe would gain access to the fully operational system, opening the way for our satellites to be launched cheaply and allowing European scientists and engineers to conduct their own experiments in space.” Money might better be spent by Europeans on commercial satellites but “we might then have to pay whatever price is demanded for launching and become dependent on America for all advanced commercial services in space.” Biggest problem was “to assess precisely what importance space will have in the last quarter of the 20th Century. We need— and have never had—an in-depth assessment of the scientific and commercial potential.” Possibly post-Apollo period held “beginnings of a new growth industry which . . . will rival commercial air transport. If so, America’s offer to internationalise her manned space programme provides an excellent opportunity to get in on the ground floor.” (New Scientist, 6/22/72)

•	Air Force and Dept, of Defense viewed space not as a mission but “as
a place that offers more effective ways of accomplishing certain defense missions,” Grant L. Hansen, Assistant Secretary of Defense for r&d, said in published interview. There was no “space program in the sense of nasa” within dod. During first phase of space exploration and use for national defense, Air Force has been assigned role as DOD’s executive agency for military space efforts, from operation of Joint dod and Atomic Energy Commission Vela space surveillance system to launches of payloads for other military services. New instructions from Dr. John S. Foster, dod Director of Defense Research and Engineering, in 1971 had encouraged all military services to “look for ways of using space systems to perform their jobs better and cheaper.” Air Force would continue launches but “will no longer operate space systems of other services, nor will there be the requirement to develop their systems for them. The cooperation among the services on space matters is excellent, and, I believe, this change, which recognizes that space as a military medium has reached maturity, benefits everybody.” (AF Mag, 6/72, 35-40)
•	National Science Foundation released Federal Funds for Research, De-
velopment, and Other Scientific Activities, Fiscal Years 1970, 1971, 1972 (nsf 71-35). Federal obligations for research and development (r&d) in 1970 totaled $15.3 billion excluding plant; slight rise to $15.4 billion was expected for 1971. Figure was decrease of 5% in constant dollars. Basic research obligations were expected to rise from $2.1 billion in 1970 to $2.2 billion for 1971 and $2.4 billion for 1972. Federal support for basic research declined in 1970 but was expected to reach new record highs for 1971 and 1972. Bulk of Federal basic research, 81%, was funded by NASA; Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare; National Science Foundation; Atomic Energy Commission; and Dept, of Defense. NASA had led in basic research support since 1961, with 29% of total in 1971.
Applied research obligations totaled $3.5 billion in 1970 and were expected to rise to $3.8 billion for 1971, increase of 8%. Total was expected to reach $4.2 billion in 1972—all-time high in current dollars. dod, hew, and NASA continued to dominate Federal applied research effort and would account for 78% in 1971. Obligations for development totaled $9.7 billion in 1970 and would decline 3%, to $9.4 billion, in 1971. In 1972, Federal development total was scheduled to rise to $10.0 billion, or 1966 level, dod, nasa, and AEC were most prominent in Federal development effort in 1960-1972, accounting for 92% in 1971. dod funded 63%; nasa share had declined since 1965 to expected 19% for 1971.
Although total Federal R&D obligations were expected to increase 9% from 1970 to 1972, nasa and aec decrease continued. NASA estimate for 1972, however, was smallest reduction since downward trend began in 1967. Report noted increases in key programs—Skylab, space shuttle, Viking Mars explorations, and unmanned missions to outer planets—had almost offset decreases in Apollo program. (Text)

July 1:	Proposal to produce rare bloodclot-dissolving enzyme urokinase
aboard Apollo spacecraft during 1975 joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission would be made to NASA by university-industry scientific team, Washington Post reported. Scientists from Abbott Laboratories, General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., and Univ. of California at Los Angeles had suggested use of device developed by UCLA biophysicist Alexander Kolin that separated the one kidney cell out of every 19 that made urokinase. Device had been used successfully on earth, but team believed urokinase-producing cells could be isolated more effectively in space, where gravity did not hinder separation. Cells would be separated aboard spacecraft, ampuled, frozen, and brought back to earth, where enzyme would be produced by pharmaceutical plant. If successful, method could reduce high cost of urokinase to $50 per dose. National Heart and Lung Institute had treated 236 victims of pulmonary embolism with enzyme at more than $1000 per patient.

•	Press conference on overall aspects of May 24 U.S.-U.S.S.R. space
cooperation agreement was held at Manned Spacecraft Center during meetings of NASA and Soviet working groups [see July 6-18]. Participants included Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator; Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of Soviet Intercosmos Council; Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., msc Director; and Arnold W. Frutkin, NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs.
Dr. Low said “great deal” had been accomplished in all areas covered by cooperation agreement. Working groups were meeting almost constantly. Nations had exchanged lunar samples from all flights through Apollo 15 and Luna 20 and were about to exchange samples on Apollo 16. Area of greatest interest was rendezvous and docking mission scheduled for 1975. Talks on joint mission were “going extremely well.”
Petrov said Soviet people had been informed of plans for joint space flight “at the same time as the American people”—when technical discussions were in progress. “Our press, just as your press, carried information on the discussions.” Asked if foreign press would be permitted to witness launch of Soviet Soyuz during joint mission, Petrov said both Apollo spacecraft and Soyuz launch would be conducted “under the same conditions as all previous launches.” Question on control of mission was deferred to conference on joint rendezvous and docking mission scheduled for July 17, but Dr. Low said “general principle” would be that, “while the Soviet cosmonauts are visiting in our Apollo command module, we will be in command; when we’re visiting in their Soyuz, they will be in command of that ship . . . and we will be under their command.” Petrov said he hoped, and was certain, “that this first test flight will not be the last one” and that theic ,,rould be possibility of space rescue flights if needed, “regardless of what country’s spacecraft are involved.” If test flight was successful, Dr. Low said, “our plans are to equip the Space Shuttle with this kind of a docking system. We don’t think that we will need a follow-on test but instead we will be flying operationally with compatible systems beyond that point.”
Asked to comment on Soviet Venus probe Venus 8, launched March 27, Petrov said spacecraft should reach planet at month’s end. “That
257

vehicle will release another one which should come down onto the surface of Venus.” Soviet scientists had done everything possible to guarantee mission’s success, “but what is not excluded is the possibility of a landing in such a position ... or place where transmission of information will not last for very long.” Probe was expected to provide data to increase understanding of planet’s surface and structure, “which is not only a question of increasing our knowledge but which can . . . clarify the origins and structure of . . . Earth.” Data already transmitted for Venus 8 had been “so new and so unexpected and so interesting.” (Transcript)

July 17: Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp) press conference was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Participants were Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., msc Director; Glynn S. Lunney, astp Director for U.S.; Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of Intercosmos Council of Soviet Academy of Sciences; and Konstantin D. Bushuyev, astp Director for U.S.S.R. Lunney said that during series of meetings that had begun July 6, U.S. and U.S.S.R. had discussed and agreed on “the technical content of three very important project level documents”: project technical proposal that described mission and hardware elements, organizational plan that described how countries would work together in controlling project before and during flight, and schedule of activities. Officials had also concluded “technically detailed documents describing the agreements that we’ve reached on various systems,” such as docking aids, docking targets, control systems, and docking mechanism. Further technical discussions would be held in U.S.S.R. in fall.
Preliminary plans called for launch of Apollo spacecraft carrying three astronauts 7% hrs after launch of Soyuz with two cosmonauts. Second Soyuz would be ready as backup if Apollo could not be launched during one of three launch opportunities. On Apollo’s 14th revolution spacecraft would rendezvous and dock, using U.S.-built docking mechanism on Apollo. After docking, two astronauts would pass through airlock into Soyuz and spend several hours with cosmonauts before returning to Apollo for night. Next day one astronaut and one cosmonaut would exchange places for whole day. After returning to own spacecraft, crews would undock vehicles and complete separate missions. Apollo would probably remain in orbit nine more days and Soyuz about one more day. Docking would be televised.
Bushuyev praised “friendly atmosphere” and “wonderful conditions” of meetings and said friendliness was “the greatest achievement and the most important assurance for the success in our future work. The difficult tasks that we are called upon to solve . . . would be impossible unless these conditions existed. We are on the first stage of a very

•	Discovery by instruments aboard Uhuru (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy
Satellite launched Dec. 12, 1970) of regular pulse rhythm in x-ray pulsar was reported by Washington Post. Pulsar discovered in constellation Hercules by Uhuru in November 1971 pulsed for 9 days; then stopped pulsing for 27 days, in repeated pattern. Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Frank D. Drake had said discovery was “every bit as bewildering” as discovery of pulsar itself. “There is no known reason why a star should disappear and then reappear at such regular and predictable times.” Possibilities advanced by astronomers included one that pulsar was orbiting another pulsar whose radio waves were unobservable by Uhuru and that second pulsar overwhelmed first for 27 out of 36 days. Second possibility was that Hercules pulsar was outermost of two stars circling third star in egg-shaped orbits and that eccentric orbits and eclipsing behavior of second orbiting star kept Hercules pulsar hidden from earth three fourths of time. Third and most likely possibility was that pulsar wobbled off orbiting path around its fellow star so that it cast beam into space, away from earth, for 27 out of 36 days.

•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed future
air superiority aircraft in speech before Aero Club of Washington in Washington, D.C. Air Force had not developed new fighter aircraft that could maintain air superiority in battle area in 20 yrs, while U.S.S.R. had developed “whole family of sophisticated fighters.” F—15 program should give U.S. “what we need for the air superiority mission.” For allies, U.S. had developed F-5E international fighter, “a simple design that cost about half that of our present long-range, multipurpose aircraft.” It would “play a particularly vital role in improving the self-defense capabilities of our Asian allies. ... In modernizing our forces, we have learned an important lesson in the last few years. You cannot build an aircraft with every possible new technological device and expect to buy enough of them to get the job done. . . . The unit cost of high performance aircraft has increased tenfold every 18 years.” Avionics was factor in driving up cost of new aircraft systems. F-111D included Mark II avionics system costing over $4 million. To lower unit cost of systems, Air Force was tailoring new aircraft for “somewhat narrower purposes.” Through specialization “we hope to obtain aircraft that can both survive and perform more effectively in their individual mission and ... we will be able to afford many more of these aircraft than we could obtain in the case of one super-capable, multipurpose plane.” (Text)

July 23-25: Erts 1 (erts-a) Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched by NASA from Western Test Range at 11:06 am pdt by 2-stage Thor-Delta booster with nine strap-on rockets. Satellite entered circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 906.9-km (563.6-mi) apogee, 899.7-km (559-mi) perigee, 103.2-min period, and 99,1° inclination. Primary objective was to acquire for three months synoptic, multispectral repetitive images from which useful data would be obtained for investigations in agriculture and forestry resources, mineral and land resources, land use, water resources, marine resources, mapping and charting, and environment. As secondary objectives Erts 1 would acquire complete, largely cloud-free coverage of U.S. with multispectral scanner (mss) or return-beam-vidicon camera (rbvc) system, or both; acquire coverage over majoT earth land masses with mss or RBVC; and demonstrate relay of data from remote ground-based platforms.
The 941-kg (2075-lb), butterfly-shaped satellite carried RBV camera system, MSS subsystem, data-collection system (dcs), and two wideband video tape recorders (wbvtr). Launch was first step in merging space and remote sensing technology to manage earth resources more efficiently. Satellite would be able to cover earth with 500 pictures— 1000 times fewer than 500 000 needed to cover earth from high-altitude aircraft. Each picture would cover 34 000 sq km (13 000

sq mi). Satellite would view 185-km (115-mi) strip of earth with global coverage every 18 days, crossing equator daily at about 9:30 am local time.
Solar array lock-on to sun and three-axis stabilization were achieved as planned. By July 25 instruments had been turned on and were operating satisfactorily. Initial imagery from RBVC system and MSS was excellent and showed detail.
Data were being transmitted to stations at Fairbanks, Alaska; Goldstone, Calif.; and Greenbelt, Md.; and would be sent to data-processing facility at Goddard Space Flight Center. Ground station at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, constructed and operated by Canadian government, would also receive data. Data would be distributed in form of high-quality film images or digitized data on computer-readable magnetic tape.
Unlike previous unmanned programs where principal investigators had own instrumentation on board spacecraft and were responsible for own data analysis, all Erts 1 investigators had access to all data from onboard instruments. The 300 investigators from 43 states, District of Columbia, 31 foreign countries, and two international organizations would be assisted by 25 specialists assigned by NASA to analyze results. To carry out research required to evaluate satellite techniques, NASA was working with user agencies—including Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Corps of Engineers—and state and local organizations.

Reusable solid-propellant booster rockets and orbiter high-pressure, liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen main engines would boost orbiter into space and booster rockets would detach at 40-km (25-mi) altitude and splash down in ocean for recovery and reuse. Orbiter, under own power, would continue into low earth orbit. Shuttle would be able to place satellites in orbit, return satellites from orbit, permit in-orbit repair and servicing of satellites, deliver propulsive stages and satellites to low earth orbit, and make short-duration science and applications missions with self-contained experiments in low earth orbit. Shuttle development schedule called for horizontal test flights beginning in 1976 and manned orbital test flights beginning in 1978, with complete system operational by 1980. Employment generated by orbiter development and shuttle integration was expected to reach 15 000 by 1975-1976 and then would gradually decrease, (nasa Release 72-153)-

NASA had presented pre- and postflight medical requirements and flight crew health stabilization program for Apollo 16 (launched April 16), mission’s preliminary physiological results, and glossary of space medicine for mutual understanding of technical and scientific exchanges. U.S.S.R. had detailed medical findings from June 6-30, 1971, Soyuz 11—Salyut 1 mission, in which three cosmonauts died; pre- and postflight clinical-physiological examination procedures for cosmonauts; and theoretical aspects of predicting physiological responses of crew during flight. Soyuz-Salyut data had indicated no deterioration of crew’s physiological status or performance efficiency before accident. Inflight data were similar to data from previous Soyuz missions and to Apollo data and were consistent with findings by both countries that general adaptive process occurred during weightlessness. U.S.S.R. had confirmed cosmonauts’ deaths were due to hypoxia and gaseous embolism (dysbarism), caused by rapid decompression of landing capsule some half hour before return to earth. Review and evaluation of 24-day Soviet mission had indicated no need to modify medical aspects of Skylab plans.
Joint Working Group had agreed to develop common medical examination procedures to compare U.S. and Soviet pre- and postflight data on crew body functions and increase information on physiological responses to space flight.

August 5: Pravda published interview with unidentified designer of U.S.S.R.’s Venus 8 Venus probe (launched March 27). “The vehicle was designed for prolonged work on the planet’s surface. Everything is aimed at delaying the apparatus’ ‘thermal death.’ New devices and additional scientific instruments were fitted to the descent apparatus. Therefore, the task was to reduce some of the weight and lighten the apparatus chiefly at the expense of the body. A new system for releasing the cover from the parachute section and an improved parachute system are used on the . . . descent apparatus. The parachutes were tested on a special stand . . . like a wind tunnel with a gas current heated to 500 degrees [centigrade; 773 kelvins] being blown through it. Carbon dioxide—the chief component of the Venusian atmosphere— was passed through the tube. With the help of sensors and a movie camera the testers thus had the opportunity of observing the behavior of the parachute system under near natural conditions.” Spherical capsule had been repeatedly tested in high-pressure chamber that simulated physical conditions of Venus landing.

his firm was unsuccessful largely because its shuttle design was more “conservative” than that of NR. Gavin said NASA officials had considered “mission suitability” and not management problems as weakness in Grumman bid. Grumman design had more complex swing arms to hold shuttle stationary before launch and lacked “background with large cryogenic tanking” used in shuttle’s fuel supply. Grumman design had also been more expensive than NR version. Spokesmen for other losers, Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., declined to comment after debriefings.

August 8:	Skylab medical experiments altitude test (smeat) crew press
conference was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Astronauts Robert L. Crippen, Dr. William E. Thornton, and Karol J. Bobko answered press questions from inside chamber they had entered July 26. Chamber had atmosphere of 70% oxygen and 30% nitrogen and pressure of 34 500 newtons per sq m (5 psi). Astronauts said they missed wives, families, and variety of outside life most. They had not experienced any stress from close confinement and had no trouble sleeping, but had recommended minor changes in food, waste collection system, and some medical equipment.
Dr. Thornton said he was surprised at crew’s physiological condition: “There has been literally no change worth mentioning during this period, either physiological or psychological.” One ot two items “might have even shown a little improvement. There was a sniffle or two when we came in, and this atmosphere seems to have . . . cleared it up.”
Dr. Thornton said $3-million cost of test was justified and was “a very, very small part of what could be considered insurance and success of the Skylab program.” Money being spent on Skylab medical research could build a number of medical institutions with “a great

•	National Academy of Sciences released findings of two-year study of
science and its relation to society, made by Physics Survey Committee chaired by Yale Univ. physicist Dr. David A. Bromley. Report, tentatively titled “Physics in Perspective,” was in press at release time. It rated 69 program areas in physics in order of priority and emphasized cost to U.S. science and society and to physics if programs were not adopted. Most “striking” aspect of survey had been “renewed discovery of the over-all power and vitality of U.S. physics,” but “this strength is in danger.” Committee found danger most immediate and obvious in subfields like elementary particle and nuclear physics where major facilities approved in mid-1960s were just becoming operational. Report named 15 programs that had growth potentials warranting high priority for incremental support: macroscopic quantum phenomena including superfluidity and superconductivity, quantum optics, scattering in solids and liquids, heavy-ion interactions, higher-energy nuclear physics, national accelerator laboratory, Stanford linear accelerator, controlled fusion, turbulence, nonlinear optics, lasers and masers, atomic and molecular beams, biophysical acoustics, very large radio array, and x-ray and gamma ray astronomy.
Committee concurred with recommendation of Astronomy Survey Committee [see June 1] that High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) should be prominent in national effort in astrophysics and astronomy. “Because of the opaqueness of the earth’s atmosphere to both X and gamma radiation, these windows on the universe have only recently been opened through rocket and satellite astronomy. Any reasonable extrapolation from the preliminary soundings that have been possible so far suggests a larger return in fundamental insight into the structure and history of the universe. In the total national physics program, the estimated cost of this facility—$400 million . . . is extremely high. To be considered in proper perspective it must be viewed in the context of the total expenditures of the U.S. space program. In anticipated scientific return—both short- and long-range—

August 13-28: Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technology Satellite (mts) was launched by NASA from Wallops Station by four-stage Scout booster at 11:10 am edt. Spacecraft and booster, which included new Algol III 1st stage, weighed 21 650 kg (23.9 tons)—heaviest vehicle ever launched from Wallops. Orbital parameters: 814.5-km (506.1-mi) apogee, 495.8-km (308.1-mi) perigee, 98-min period, and 37.7° inclination.
Primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of bumper-protected multisheet spacecraft structure for protection against meteoroid penetration in first inflight test. Data would be compared with data from single-sheet structures launched previously. Secondary objectives were to obtain data on meteoroid impact velocity and measure impact flux of small mass meteoroids.
Satellite had been designed, fabricated, and tested by Langley Research Center. It carried three experiments: bumper penetration experiment with 12 panels, each 48 cm wide and 3 m long (19 in x 10Y2 ft), containing 8 pressurized cells; impact flux experiment containing 65 thin-film capacitance penetration sensors arranged in groups of 3 and 5 on various parts of spacecraft; and meteoroid-velocity experiment consisting of 2 plates of sensors and timer to measure time meteoroid traveled distance between plates.
By Aug. 22 spacecraft experiments and telemetry systems were operating and good data were being obtained, but half of panels in bumper experiment apparently had not deployed. Spacecraft was spinning at 3 rpm as planned, but because of panel deployment anomaly and resulting spin axis 90° to that planned, spacecraft battery temperature had risen from 299 K (79°F) past 308 K (95°F) design temperature to 337 K (147°F) Aug. 22. Battery was still providing voltage and all experiments were functioning satisfactorily. During spacecraft’s second pass Aug. 22, telemeter A, powered by battery, came on as commanded but telemeter B, backup system operated by solar-cell power, went off unexpectedly. Officials decided to discontinue interrogation of telemeter A so that data from telemeter B would not be jeopardized. As a result, no data were being received from secondary experiments and no housekeeping data were received. About 2000 impacts by submicrometer particles had been detected during telemeter A operation, providing sufficient data for impact experiment. No data had been obtained from meteoroid-velocity experiment. By Aug. 28, 3 of 48 pressurized detector cells successfully deployed had been punctured and primary experiment was continuing to provide good data, (nasa proj off)

August 16-17: Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, spoke on NASA’s attack on costs during symposium “Cost—A Principal System Design Parameter” in Washington, D.C. Symposium was sponsored by National Security Industrial Assn, and Armed Forces Management Assn, nasa was facing major cost problems. If nasa did not “do something about the high cost of doing business in space, and do it soon, our nation’s space program is in deep trouble. We are on the verge of exciting new discoveries in space science, but we cannot follow through as rapidly as we should because we can’t afford it. We see before us many important space applications, but we cannot move out as rapidly as we should because we can’t afford it. Most important of all, we may lose our hard-won worldwide leadership in space, if we don’t find a way to do more for our money!” NASA could do little about budgetary restraints, “but there is a great deal we can do about costs. Doing something about the high cost of doing business in space is today’s biggest challenge.”
In past, NASA had been forced to develop expensive equipment for one-time use. “Today we have 52 operating civilian spacecraft. By the end of next year we will launch 35 more, for a total of 87” representing “43 different spacecraft types—on the average each spacecraft [type] is flown only twice!” But payloads had become more complex, while launch costs decreased. “We are no longer as limited in weight and volume as we were ten years ago; with the shuttle, weight and volume constraints will be non-existent for many missions. This means that we should now optimize our payloads for low cost and high reliability, and not for minimum weight and maximum performance. ... I am convinced that if we do this, we can drastically reduce the cost of doing business in space. And this ... is as great a technological challenge as everything else that we have done in space.” (Text)

During August: House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space published U.S.—U.S.S.R. Cooperative Agreements. Report of June hearings to explore scope of scientific and technical agreements signed during May 22-30 summit meeting in Moscow included texts of agreements and comments of experts. Dr. Philip Handler, National Academy of Sciences President, had said of space cooperation agreement: “The symbolism of the proposed link-up in space may prove to be the most significant aspect of the venture.” Agreement was “symbolic of a mutual awareness that the planet earth is a small and fragile spaceship, that all men are its fellow passengers, and that the fate of the people of all nations is essentially a common fate.” Subcommittee had concluded: “While a gradual amelioration of fundamental political conflicts and disagreements is the most that can be reasonably hoped for, the genuine cooperative spirit that has made these agreements possible opens the door to more effective communication and deeper understanding between the world’s two predominant powers that could have the most profound effect on the future of mankind.” (Committee Print)

Pioneer 7 after one month of radio silence. Spacecraft was on far side of sun, more than 312 million km (194 million mi) away—so far away that round trip time for radio communication to spacecraft and back to earth was 35 min at speed of light. Controllers had reacquired Pioneer 7 “in the blind” without knowing spacecraft’s exact position or radio receiver’s exact frequency and had set long-distance record for finding and reviving spacecraft that had turned itself off. Scientists had theorized that at Pioneer 7’s farthest distance from sun electrical power from spacecraft’s solar cells had fallen below level required to operate spacecraft and scientific instruments. By leaving instruments off temporarily and thus reducing power requirements, tum-on of radio transmitter had been possible. (NASA Special Release)

September 9:	Tass reported results of Venus 8 probe that had landed
capsule on Venus July 22 after four-month flight. Wind had moved descending capsule horizontally in same direction as planet’s rotation on its axis. Wind speed had declined from 48 m (160 ft) per sec at 45-km (28-mi) altitude to 2 m (6 ft) per sec at 11 km (7 mi). Key question during landing was whether sunlight reached Venusian surface or was absorbed completely by atmosphere and clouds. Preliminary data on changes in illumination at different altitudes showed that Venusian atmosphere considerably weakened sunlight but some sunlight did reach surface. Atmosphere consisted of 97% carbon dioxide, less than 2% nitrogen, and less than 0.1% oxygen and contained
0.01-0.1% ammonia at altitudes between 33 and 46 km (20 and 30 mi). Surface in landing area resembled earth granite rock in radioactive composition with 4.0% potassium, 0.0002% uranium, and 0.00065% thorium. (fbis-Sov, 9/13/72, L7)

September 11:	NASA released prints from infrared photos of New York
area taken by Erts 1 (launched July 23). Black-and-white photo of New York City taken from 915-km (569-mi) altitude covering area 185 km (115 mi) square was covered by clouds, but was valuable as a general test of Erts 1 instrumentation. Images of infrared radiation from which prints had been made clearly showed distribution of vegetation in New Jersey.
Dr. Paul D. Lowman of Goddard Space Flight Center said in interview that pictures of other areas had been of higher quality. “Our first discovery from erts is that all our maps, topographic as well as geologic, are out of date.” In California’s Monterey Bay area, scientists had discovered “a whole series of unsuspected faults” in earth’s crust. While major earthquake faults ran northwest and southeast, newly discovered faults ran at right angles to mountains, northeast and southeast. About 15 faults, each extending about 16 km (10 mi), had been discovered in Monterey region and about 12 faults had been discovered near Lake Tahoe, Calif. Satellite picture of Dallas-Fort Worth area showed many new roads, reservoirs, suburbs, and airports that were not on area’s most recent map, made three years before.

But it becomes a piddling figure . . . when compared Avith massive governmental outlays for farm price-supports and other questionable multibillion-dollar expenditures. And even in endorsing this minimal space effort, Senator McGovern stresses the negative aspect of not wanting to see additional thousands of aerospace employees thrown out of work, rather than emphasizing the positive contributions of space to the expansion of man’s scientific knowledge, to the strengthening of the technological know-how of American industry, and to the enhancement of the nation’s image throughout the world.” (Huntsville Times, 9/11/72)

September 11—13:	American Society of Mechanical Engineers held annual
Aerospace Div. Conference at Anaheim, Calif. Application of aerospace technology to societal problems and future of space exploration were discussed by officials of NASA; National Science Foundation; Depts. of Commerce, Transportation, and Interior; state and local governments; industry; and education. Aviation’s role in earth resources surveys was described in paper by Deputy Director Clarence A. Syvertson and Airborne Science Office Chief Donald R. Mulholland of Ames Research Center: “At the present time, 275 companies are engaged in aerial surveys, but less than 50 of these are equipped for nonphotographic remote sensing. New sensor technology growing from and stimulated by the space program has made it possible to obtain vastly improved data.” Federal Aviation Administration data showed that in 1971 “some 230 aircraft were used for aerial surveys and another 31 for patrolling.” ARC used general-aviation, high-altitude research, and four-engine jet transportation craft. Remote sensing

It is self-evident that this work needs to be continued with respect to other planets . . . and that it can be done by international cooperation.” (NYT, 9/13/72, 42)
September 13—15:	First national conference on remotely manned systems
was held at- Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Stanley Deutsch of NASA Office of Life Sciences said in keynote address that usefulness of remotely controlled machines was “virtually limitless” both in space and on earth. “Using a remote system to scout Mars in advance of manned missions will enhance the safety of the man when we do send him to Mars.” Remotely controlled systems also could be used in future to rescue and return an incapacitated astronaut and provide a method for capturing unstable satellites. Remotely controlled systems technology developed for space was also being applied to nonspace applications such as Navy undersea manipulators, Air Force and Army remotely piloted aircraft, handling material in radiation laboratories, industrial safety, mining, medicine and hospitals, police work, and fire fighting.
Dr. Ewald Heer of Jpl’s Advanced Technical Studies Div. said “intelligence” of automated systems would have to be increased greatly to ensure success of future earth orbital and planetary satellites. “Remotely manned systems are man-machine system® that augment and extend man’s sensory, manipulative and intellectual capabilities to remote places. However while machines may have superior strength and endurance and resistance to hostile environments, they still depend on human intelligence for decision-making in the performance of complicated tasks. Advanced engineering automation is essential in space station and shuttle operations and scientific data gathering must be microminiaturized for sustained interplanetary operations of two or more years.” (jpl Releases 625, 626; Swain, Pasadena Star-News, 9/14/72)

•	Findings to date of investigations into Apollo 15 commercialism were
released by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and by NASA. Senate Committee reported on Aug. 3 closed hearing that received testimony from NASA management and Apollo 15 astronauts on commercialization of postal covers and replicas of “Fallen Astronaut” sculpture that was carried to moon during mission. Hearing had revealed “no basic new facts” on incidents, nasa had disciplined astronauts for carrying unauthorized covers. There was “no indication at this time that the Apollo 15 crew either profited or intended to profit from” sales of sculpture. Sale of sculpture by artist Paul Van Hoeydonck “appears to be a direct contradiction of the intent of the Apollo 15 astronauts.” Committee said Dept, of Justice had requested copy of hearing transcript and was reviewing situation for possible violation of Federal statutes.
Committee said its continuing investigation had determined, after Aug. 3 hearing, “that several astronauts had accepted payment for autographing blocks of stamps. NASA was “continuing its investigation of this latest incident and is determining what management actions it will take as a result.” Committee expressed concern “with the adequacy of NASA management procedures which would permit such incidents to occur or create an atmosphere or an environment which might encourage misconduct.” It also was concerned with “awareness of responsible management personnel as to their responsibilities for the recognition of and need for initiation of timely and appropriate action on sensitive events coming to their attention.”
Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, released report on Apollo 15 commercialism and disciplinary actions taken by NASA. Investigations and reviews had revealed weaknesses in NASA’s administrative procedures, management communication channels, and internal operating relationships. Actions were under way to remedy weaknesses, including revision of policy and procedures on articles to be

All personal items would be approved by NASA Administrator. Items that could be commercially exploited by recipients were prohibited. List of items would be publicized no later than 30 days after flight’s completion. Future missions would carry official flight kit containing items appropriate for official presentation by Government. Items would be approved by Administrator and announced before launch. Commercialism of flight kit was prohibited.
NASA pao stated in response to inquiries about sale of autographs by astronauts, “nasa has determined . . . autographs were signed by the astronauts on their own time while not on duty, that no misuse of Government property or personnel was involved, but that a procedural infraction did occur in that no NASA management advice was sought prior to these actions.” NASA employees had been “personally admonished . . . for this infraction of NASA procedures” and facts had been reported to Dept, of Justice.

•	Library of Congress Congressional Research Service published Cape
Kennedy or Cape Canaveral? A Brief History, a Background, and an Analysis of S.J. Res. 193. Report on Senate bill to return to Cape Kennedy, original name of Cape Canaveral, concluded that “relevant issues of fact are not in question in this legislative decision.” Historical significance of Cape Canaveral was “genuine” and majority of Cape residents and Florida State Legislature favored return to old name. “Nor is the procedural legitimacy of the permanent change of name to ‘Cape Kennedy’ seriously questioned. The nature of the official act is generally accepted as a national gesture of tribute and respect to a martyred President. Evidence from historical precedent is scant; geographic names have often been applied and altered to honor persons, and these have subsequently been changed for a variety of reasons.” Question was “whether sufficient cause exists ... to reverse the act of November 27, 1963, changing the name of Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy.” (Text)

and development effort to level “at least equal to that of the Soviet Union.”
Convention adopted 1972-1973 Statement of Policy Sept. 19. Statement said new environment created by Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (salt) “places a high premium on added protection for our current strategic bomber force, on improved ballistic missile technology as an antidote to numerical inferiority, on more accurate and consistent surveillance capabilities, and on more secure and dependable communications.” Nothing in salt agreements impeded size and momentum of U.S.S.R.’s research and development effort. Soviet effort “for the past several years has surpassed that of the United States by a wide margin. Tlje possibility of technological surprise has not diminished under salt, unless the United States undertakes and maintains a military research and development program that is comprehensive, consistent, and competitive.” If U.S. emphasized efforts on qualitative force improvement, enhanced forces survivability, and improved conventional weapon delivery, “risks involved in the SALT agreements can likely be kept within tolerable limits.”
AFA awards presented during convention included Theodore von Karman Award to l/c Donald G.

Air Force System Command’s Newsreview traced historical highlights of its bases and organizations. Arnold Engineering Development Center (aedc) near Tullahoma, Tenn., had been established in 1953 at recommendation of aeronautical scientist Dr. Theodore von Karman. Center currently consisted of 40 test units that provided “simulated flight-test capability ranging in speed to more than 20 times the speed of sound and to altitudes around 1,000 miles [1600 kilometers].” Center’s replacement value was $840 million. Patrick Air Force Base, Fla,, had grown with space program. Launch of V—2 from Eastern Test Range at Patrick in 1950 “was the first step to the moon. That goal, now accomplished five times, leaves the future of space exploration on the threshold of a dream.”
Future of the Air Force was discussed by Gen. John D. Ryan (usaf) in Armed Forces Journal issue dedicated to Air Force Silver Anniversary. “It would be very easy ... to take off on rhetorical flights of overcoming the unlimited challenges of aerospace. The challenges do exist; and they could conceivably mean that the future of the Air Force will include the use of remotely piloted vehicles, hypersonic aircraft, and the laser. But if these, and anything else man can envision and produce, do exist in the future, they will only be the means for Air Force people to do their basic job of providing this country with the aerospace power required for defense and security. As in the past 25 years, success in the future depends heavily on the dedication and quality of Air Force people.” (Airman, 9/72, 25; AFSC Newsreview, 9/72, 6, 9; AFJ, 9/72; Dept of AF, A Chronology of American Air Space Events, 1/3/61)

Some U.S. officials believed U.S.S.R. was establishing precedent for using Cuba as base from which to launch and recover reconnaissance satellites. In first reported incident two naval reconnaissance versions of Tu-95 Bear turboprop aircraft made 12-hr flight from Cuba up route 80 km (50 mi) off U.S. coast to point north of Norfolk, Va. Flights had been detected by radar on U.S.S. Forrestal and had been monitored by F-4 and A-7 aircraft.

lessness on physiological systems. There were indications that some zero-g effects were self-limiting. Collection of good inflight data for longer periods, coupled with ground-based experiments, was vital in planning for longer duration space flight. Vestibular problems had not been great enough for U.S. crews to require preadaptation program. “Such a program must, however, be considered as the number of potential crewmen is increased, particularly as scientists with no test pilot experience are added to crews. However, I do not at the present time see any physiological requirement for the addition of artificial gravity for long duration space flight.”

September 28: Claims that Government, news media, and public had pessimistic view of space program’s future were refuted by Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, in speech before National Space Club in Washington, D.C. With decision to build space shuttle, President Nixon had “committed his administration and the Nation to a continuing viable space program” that “meets the needs of the United States’ future.” President had taken another “great initiative in space” in signing U.S.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation agreement. Senate had supported space shuttle by vote of 61 to 21. “And for the first time in NASA’s history, the Congress appropriated every last penny that we asked for.” Editorial comment in U.S. had run 9 to 1 in favor of shuttle, 18 to 1 in support of Apollo 16, and “we have yet to encounter serious editorial criticism of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.” While some segments of public were apathetic to space program, less than one percent of the 2200 letters NASA received from public daily was against space program. Most NASA mail was “in outright support of what we are doing” or sought additional information about space. One reason for pessimism “syndrome,” Dr. Low said, was that “so many people in Washington . . . tend to equate ‘program’ with ‘budget,’ or . . . ‘accomplishment’ with ‘dollars available.’ ” Space program challenges existed, “and whether or not we can meet them is relatively independent of whether NASA’s budget is $3.4 billion, or $3.6 billion.” But it “does depend strongly on the results we continue to achieve; ... on our ability to create and innovate, on our skill and our dedication.” (Text)

At dedication he said ceremony marked final step in nasa-sponsored program to build space-oriented research facilities at U.S. universities under Sustaining University Program started in 1960s. Univ. of Kansas Center was 37th and last facility to be completed. Dr. Fletcher said program had accomplished its mission “extremely well. These splendid facilities give our Nation the means of performing research that would be virtually impossible without them.” Program’s projects had been “invaluable in the successful accomplishment of many of our greatest achievements in space.” NASA had found in universities “a concentrated source of one of the irreplaceable ingredients of advanced research programs—highly trained intellects. And now that they can work in facilities to match, we are expecting even more productive results.”
Dr. Fletcher discussed universities’ role in NASA activities in luncheon speech: “We work with large and small universities in aeronautics and space programs supporting projects . . . relevant to NASA’s mission and . . . compatible with university interests and capabilities. We encourage the use of NASA laboratory facilities and the exchange of information between university faculty and nasa scientists.” More than 900 university experimenters had used space data, more than 300 investigators from 42 universities had analyzed lunar samples, 25 universities had conceived Apollo mission experiments, and 2500

Review. Government and industry had spent more than $100 million on high-pressure-engine technology since 1961. Air Force XLR-129 engine program had provided strong technical base for space shuttle engine. Shuttle’s orbiter stage would use advanced-concept staged combustion engine “very similar to that of a turbojet equipped with an afterburner; . . . there are two different stages of combustion.” While first turbojet combustion occurred in main chamber, shuttle engine’s first burning occurred in gas generator or preburner. Preferred engine concept for future spacecraft would be “single engine that could operate as a rocket, a ramjet, a scramjet, and a turbofan.” At liftoff, rocket would be firing and “turbofan might also be operating to supply additional air to improve the performance of the rocket. After the vehicle is moving at a greater speed, the ramjet would start operating, and the turbofan would be removed from the airstream. The pure rocket would continue to operate briefly to aid the ramjet. As the vehicle reaches the outer fringes of the atmosphere, the inlets would be closed, and the pure rocket would be used alone for reaching, maneuvering in, and leaving orbit. To return to base after re-entry into the atmosphere, the ramjet and/or the turbofan might be used separately or they might be used like an afterburning turbofan.” To improve spacecraft performance further, “we would like to get away from having to carry an oxidizer for the rocket portion of the flight.”

Future space engines would “mate the tremendous energy available from nuclear explosions with the ability of a rocket to operate at high thrust levels.” Performance of nuclear rocket “more than makes up for its being heavier than a normal rocket.” Nuclear rocket’s specific impulse was about twice that of “even the best chemical rocket.” Nuclear stage also would be useful for seeding space with unmanned applications satellites. (Holder, Siuru, Air IJniv Rev, 9/72)
• Europe’s dilemma over altered conditions for participation in post-Apollo space program was described by Kenneth W. Gatland in Spaceflight. Europe had been invited to develop research and applications module (ram) for space shuttle, rather than space tug as originally discussed. Elimination from Europe of any shuttle propulsion technology had “left little room for manoeuvre.” Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm would be “denied the opportunity to contribute their Attitude Control Propulsion System (acps) engine” which “is considered to be fully competitive with U.S. equivalents” because NASA had rejected acps as “too advanced and too complex” a European contribution. Space tug— with attributes of both launch vehicle and spacecraft—would have pushed propulsion technique “well beyond what is currently envisaged in Europe.” Tug covered “very extensive range of the basic techniques of interest to the Europeans and might engender solutions to the most classic problems.” Tug’s “far-reaching integration with the shuttle and with the payload during operations would have afforded Europe effective participation in most American missions, i.e., the majority of space activities in the 1980s.” (SF, 9/72, 322-3)

October 1: Joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. space mission scheduled for 1975 would include 48-hr linkup of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft and crew exchange, Soviet Cosmonaut Vladimir A. Shatalov said in report released by Tass. Coyuz spacecraft, manned by two cosmonauts, would be launched first. “In seven and a half hours, Apollo spaceship manned by three astronauts will be launched from Cape Kennedy. In 24 hours, Apollo will approach the Soyuz ship and link up will be made. The system that will be formed will be operated as a single spacecraft. Within two days, spacemen will move from one ship to another, scientific and technical experiments will be made and there will be television transmissions to the earth. At the end of the third day, the spaceships will be undocked and will soon land on their respective territories.” Shatalov said he hoped manned Mars mission before end of 20th century would be international flight—“Possibly it will be the Soviet-American flight.” (fbis-Sov, 10/2/72, L2)

•	Significance of nasa and Soviet Academy of Sciences joint Apollo-Soyuz
test project (astp) was discussed by Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, in letter to nasa staff. Eyes of world would be on nasa and Soviet manned space flight teams as never before. There “must be a near certainty that the mission will be successful, or it should not be attempted.” Not just nasa reputation but “future of manned space flight and international cooperation in space will be significantly influenced by the success or failure.” Mission also was “important first step to facilitate rescue missions in space and to enable manned spacecraft from two or more countries to participate in future cooperative activities. And because several years of friendly cooperation are required just to plan and fly this one test mission, it takes on an added symbolic significance and gives us the feeling that even now, long before the flight, we may be making a contribution to the cause of peace and better understanding between our two countries.” Decision to cooperate in project was “optimistic vote of confidence in the future of manned space flight by the two leading powers.” But project had practical limits. Neither side would transfer its technology as such. “So neither side has to give away anything, but each has much to gain.” Biggest concession to be made by each country was “recognition that close and visible cooperation between the two countries on an important aspect of manned space flight has become desirable.” (NASA Activities, 10/15/72, 200-2)

•	NASA released official summary of reasons for selection of North American
Rockwell Corp. for $2.6-billion prime contract to build space shuttle. Summary said NR had been chosen over competitors—Grumman Aerospace Corp.; Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Inc., Space Systems Div.; and McDonnell Douglas Corp.—because “North American Rockwell attained the highest score from a mission suitability standpoint* because its cost proposal was lowest and credible, and because its approaches to program performance gave high confidence to us, to the [Source Evaluation] Board, and to the Manned Space Flight center directors, that it will indeed produce the Shuttle at the lowest cost.” Summary—signed Sept. 18 by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator—said NR’s “greatest advantages” within mission suitability area were in management, with efficient control of program and best overall top project management team. NR design provided lightest dry weight. NR’s “good understanding of all electrical power subsystems reflected the very thorough studies . . . made following the Apollo 13 accident.” Analysis of maintainability was excellent. Further, NR management techniques “should provide earlier identification of cost problems” and planned constrained buildup of resources in beginning of program lent confidence in ability to control costs.
Grumman Corp. had been “very close behind” but its plan to build up its work force to early manpower peak had been seen by NASA as threat of “premature commitment of resources during the course of the program.” Grumman’s greatest strength had been in its technical design; McDonnell Douglas design had strong features but some technical drawbacks; and Lockheed’s proposal had lacked “consistent technical depth.” NASA had originally made summary available only to General Accounting Office and to competing bidders because of potential embarrassment to losers. Agency had later released summary, Wall Street Journal said, “to demonstrate that politics didn’t play any role in the decision and that the most painstaking selection procedures in the agency’s history were observed.” (Text; WSJ, 10/5/72, 12)

October 9—15:	International Astronautical Federation held 23rd Congress
in Vienna. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, Director, of National Science Foundation, stressed Congress theme “Space for World Development” in opening address: “This is the year of ever-increasing cooperative interests in space ventures, including the joint, manned space effort by the Soviet Union and the United States. Thanks to the genius of our early pioneers, . . . results of an era of experimentation now show us clearly the promise which the orderly and determined use of space and space vehicles has to offer.” (Text; Congress Release, 10/9/72)
Soviet attendance at Congress was limited to 21 including Cosmonauts Anatoly V. Filipchenko and Valery N. Kubasov. More than half of scheduled Soviet participants failed to arrive or to send papers. Proxy readings of Soviet papers that were included eliminated most opportunities for clarification and discussion by panelists. Lack of Soviet participation had been attributed by Western scientists to U.S.S.R.’s downgrading of iaf in wake of increased space cooperation with U.S. and France and to Soviet budgetary hold-down. (Av Wk, 10/16/72, 16)
Dr. George E. Mueller, President of System Development Corp. and former NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said in interview following opening session that it would be technically feasible to put crews of mixed nationalities on Mars within 20 to 30 yrs. “Even the money is there. It’s getting it allocated for the project that’s difficult.” He envisioned crew of 12 or more in giant spacecraft possibly powered by nuclear energy taking 12 to 18 mos to reach Mars. Special shuttle would be needed to carry supplies. “Such an

Dr. James H. Bredt of Advanced Missions Program Office in NASA Office of Manned Space Flight described new space processing experiments for Skylab missions in 1973. Experiments would broaden scope of experiments to correspond to program’s increased area of interest, to gain experience with new techniques in order to develop advanced equipment for future missions, and to enable materials scientists and engineers to demonstrate value of space laboratories for applied materials research. Apparatus and experimental samples would be delivered to Kennedy Space Center for installation in spacecraft during first week of December. Experiments were to be performed by third and final Skylab crew in November and December 1973. Analysis of samples would begin immediately after their return to earth, and principal investigators probably would present preliminary reports of results at 25th iaf Congress. (Text)
Frank J. Malina, Chairman of International Academy of Astronautics’ Manned Research on Celestial Bodies (marecebo) Committee, told 5th Lunar International Laboratory Symposium Oct. 10 that 1964 estimate of 1975-1985 decade for initiation of permanent lunar laboratory might have been “too optimistic.” Men and machines had provided “great deal of hard working knowledge on the Moon and on men working there,” but people and governments needed to be convinced that necessary funding should be provided.

Manned Spacecraft Center Skylab Program Manager Kenneth S. Kleinknecht discussed mission’s rescue capability during 5th International Space Rescue Symposium. Special kit to be installed in Skylab command and service module (csm) would permit CSM to rendezvous and dock with orbital workshop, using two-man crew. CSM then would be able to accept three stranded astronauts from workshop, undock, and reorbit with five persons on board. Rescue could be effected 48 days after alarm early in mission and as quickly as 10 days late in mission. Reason for variation in time required was that 22 days were needed to refurbish launch umbilical tower after previous launch. (Text)
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp)—joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission scheduled for 1975—was discussed at Oct. 10 press conference. Participants were Cosmonauts Filipchenko and Kubasov; Soviet academician Dr. Leonid I. Sedov; Dr. Wernher von Braun, Corporate Vice President for Engineering and Development with Fairchild Industries and former NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning; and Dr. Krafft A. Ehricke, North American Rockwell Corp. scientist. Dr. von Braun said transition from lower pressured Apollo spacecraft to higher pressured Soyuz would be easy for astronauts, while Soviet cosmonauts would have to spend about two hours in airlock to adjust to Apollo system. Dr. Sedov said U.S.S.R. had not accepted invitation from U.S. for joint mission when first proposed because of sensitive political situation. With successful Moscow summit meetings in May, situation had become “favorable.” (iaf Release, 10/10/72)

Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said European Launcher Development Organization (eldo) studies of space tug had been discontinued but NASA studies were continuing. “Our present belief is that the required technical advances combined with the budgetary demands that the space shuttle will make . . . will make it impossible to develop within this decade the ‘full capability’ that we feel will eventually be necessary.” NASA was investigating alternate approaches “to providing a Space Shuttle third stage which will give us a reduced but acceptable capability for the delivery of payloads during the early years of shuttle operation.” Alternatives being considered were: to modify existing stage for use as expendable third stage; to make major modifications to existing cryogenic- or storable-propellant stage to enable it to carry payload to geosynchronous orbit and return to shuttle orbit for reuse; or to build new vehicle with less capability than needed, as part of evolutionary program leading to vehicle with required capability. Studies of first alternative were under way; contracted studies within next year were expected to examine latter two alternatives. (Text)

tunities. Atmospheric pressures of cabins would be adjusted while spacecraft were docked, to avoid necessity of prebreathing pure oxygen before transfer of crewmen from Soyuz to Apollo cabins. Soyuz pressure would be lowered from its normal 101 kilonewtons per sq m to 69 (from 14.7 psi to 10); Apollo pressure would remain at 35 kilonewtons per sq m (5 psi).
First joint crew training session was scheduled for summer of 1973, with cosmonauts visiting U.S. for several weeks. Astronauts would train equal time in U.S.S.R. in fall of 1973. Soviet two-fifths scale model of docking mechanism would be tested with U.S. model during Moscow meeting in December 1972. Further consideration of extravehicular crew transfer would be deleted; if any emergency prevented return of crewmen to their own ships, they would land in spacecraft they were visiting. Sufficient propellant would be budgeted for Apollo spacecraft to allow it to maintain attitude control while docked.
Exchange of working groups would be more frequent, with meetings at msc in November, in Moscow in December, and at msc in March 1973.
U.S. delegation included representatives of prime contractor North American Rockwell Corp. and three of five working groups established in July 6-18 meetings at msc to define mission elements.

October 17: Ariel 4, cooperative United Kingdom and U.S. satellite (launched by NASA Dec. 11, 1971), was adjudged successful. During more than 10 mos in orbit, spacecraft had operated satisfactorily except for tape recorder failures and minor experiment problems. Primary mission objective—to investigate interaction of electromagnetic waves, plasmas, and energetic particles in upper ionosphere— had been achieved.
High-frequency noise experiment had shown several apparently distinct kinds of radio noise, which were under study. Extremely-low-and very-low-frequency experiment and impulse experiment showed elf noise spectrum depended on latitude and therefore on shape of magnetosphere. Univ. of Iowa charged-particle detector was observing auroral charged particles, large field-aligned currents over auroral zone, and higher-energy protons of ring current. Observations, when combined with those from other satellites, were expected to delineate dissipation mechanism for ring current responsible for magnetic storms.

October 23: Chemical & Engineering News published views and plans of presidential candidates for science and technology beyond general pledges in Democratic and Republican Party platforms. Same set of questions had been submitted to campaign organizations of Sen. George S. McGovern (D-S.D.) and of President Nixon. President Nixon said he would continue general pattern of previous years on Federal research and development funding; its division among defense, space, and civilian sectors; its possible link to gross national product (gnp) ; and appropriate balance for basic research, applied research,
358

and development. Pattern would include increasingly effective program in civilian sector R&D, “prudent space program, and a sufficient defense R&D budget.” Administration believed r&d funding should be based on opportunities for effective programs and necessity for creating new opportunities through fundamental studies and that R&D resources, excepting basic research, should be allocated to areas that provided “greatest opportunity for leverage or that satisfy an immediate future need.”
Sen. McGovern recommended increased Federal R&D funding. Principal problem was “government spending that has masqueraded as R&D, yet has little technical content. For example, when an Apollo is launched ... all of the kerosene and liquid oxygen that it uses comes out of the federal R&D budget. Only a very small percentage of the federal R&D budget actually represents laboratory investigations, instrument design, feasibility studies, and other technical efforts that involve scientists and engineers.” Sen. McGovern would emphasize civilian sector R&D and strong military R&D program as “good investment for long-term national security. My space program would emphasize unmanned planetary exploration and scientific satellites and also earth resource and communications satellites.” Nixon Administration would continue to maintain “strong and up-to-date defense force” and to capitalize upon past space investments. Both candidates recommended increased priority on developments of new energy sources.
Nixon Administration was opposed to S. 32, reconversion bill introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to amend National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to establish framework of national science policy. Bill would focus policy and U.S. scientific talent and resources on Nation’s priority problems. Administration believed segment of S. 32 that would establish independent agency within nsf was “particularly unwise” because it would “divorce the R&D from the departments of Government responsible for using its results” and “would divert attention from the primary mission of nsf—to support fundamental and basic research.” Sen. McGovern would continue to support S. 32. “In its original form, before compromise to get Republican support, it would have provided $1.2 billion for a new NASA-type Civil Science Systems Administration that would fund genuine r&d across a broad range of civilian technology needs.”
Administration did not believe in Cabinet-level science department or “supra” agency, nor that “existing science apparatus is totally adequate. As with all human and governmental institutions, it too should be dynamic and subject to change as conditions and events dictate.” Sen. McGovern felt “more centralized federal science management and funding apparatus might be useful, but the key need is not to change the institutions but rather to give them more power in the Federal Government.” He favored establishment of Office of Technology Assessment [see October 13] which would “assess each new technical program with an eye toward cost efficiency and effectiveness, and domestic betterment.” Asked if federally owned laboratories should be expanded to deal with problems of health and environment, Nixon Administration pointed out that NASA Centers were “closely involved with the R&D components of other federal agencies in an effort to solve pressing national problems.” Sen. McGovern believed Federal

October 23-27:	Conference on high-energy astrophysics was held at Cal
Tech by division of American Astronomical Society. Dr. Kenneth I. Kellerman of National Radio Astronomy Observatory said most baffling phenomenon observed by radiotelescopes was speed at which objects seemed to be moving. If measurements taken in past two years were accepted at face value, objects associated with quasars were speeding away from each other faster than speed of light. Such speed had been considered impossible. Cal Tech astronomer Dr. W. L. W. Sargent said strange blue objects sighted in sky by Hale Observatory astronomers might be newly formed galaxies “about 100 million years old, and they seem to be made up of very young stars.” Discovery indicated that galaxies might still be forming. Dr. Herbert Gursky of American Science and Engineering, Inc., said astronomers using Uhuru (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy Satellite launched by NASA Dec. 12, 1970) had spotted several x-ray objects that could not be detected by wavelengths other than x-ray. Impact of x-ray astronomy might be that “this new wavelength range may show some different aspects of stars and galaxies.” Through x-ray astronomy scientists “hope to . . . learn something about these objects that radio and optical observations can’t tell us.”
Evidence of black hole—star whose gravity field was so strong that light could not escape from it—in constellation Cygnus was reported by Dr. Kip Thorne of Cal Tech, Dr. J. P. Ostriker of Princeton Univ., and Dr. Riccardo Giacconi of American Science and Engineering. Evidence had come from photos taken at Hale Observatory that showed bright blue line near source Cygnus X-l and from data gathered by XJhuru (see also Sept. 2). Scientists thought line in photos might be result of superhot gas being drawn from neighboring star in black hole. If finding was accurate, Cygnus X—1 would be first black hole discovered. Existence of black holes had been predicted by Einstein as part of his theory of relativity.

Congressman H. Allen Smith (D-Calif.) [see Oct. 3 and Oct. 21]. News had come as surprise to officials, who had refused to comment. JPL engineer Charles D. Hepburn had said that several engineers deplored renaming of facility for political office holder when there were many great local scientists who had contributed to space program. Hepburn had said it was “insult to technology .... Our work has to do with the physical universe, not with the meanderings of a political career.” (LA Times, 10/26/72; Pasadena Star-News, 10/27/72) October 27: U.S.S.R. launched Meteor 13 weather satellite from Plesetsk to obtain “meteorological information needed for the operative weather forecast service.” Orbital parameters: 891-km (553.6-mi) apogee, 866-km (538.1-mi) perigee, 102.5-min period, and 81.2° inclination.

• Lunar science press conference at Manned Spacecraft Center discussed Apollo 16 data and portent for Apollo 17 mission, scheduled for launch Dec. 6. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of State Univ. of New York at Stony Brook reported that analysis of pea-size Apollo 16 rock fragments had shown them ranging in age from 3.98 billion to 4.25 billion yrs. Rocks had crystallized some 300 million yrs after moon’s formation. It was possible that Apollo 17 site would yield “very young rocks . . . , young volcanics. So one may be able to extend the mare type ages . . . and see just how long it took the surface of the moon ... to crystallize before it was a rather hard crust . . . with very little, if any, igneous activity.”
Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg of Cal Tech reported Apollo 16 rock No. 65015 seemed to have undergone two distinct melting steps. Bulk of this “two-history rock” had 'crystallized 3.93 billion yrs ago but had retained some crystals that had been formed between 4.40 and 4.48 billion yrs ago. First crystallization probably had been associated with great heat during moon’s formation but scientists had no clue to cause of second melting period and subsequent recrystallization. Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said “fundamental conclusion” was evolving from new understanding of moon gained “largely out of the Apollo program.” Scientists “have to now look at each individual planet and somehow or another infer its chemical composition.” They were beginning to see chemically heterogeneous solar system.
Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, Apollo 17 lunar module pilot, described Apollo 17 landing site in moon’s Taurus-Littrow area on rim of Serenitatis Basin: “It’s in that general geographic ring that resembles the Apennine front near where Apollo 15 landed. It has, however, some very distinctive characteristics .... There is no clear evidence that we are close to mare. The nearest obvious mare surface is several hundred kilometers [100 km equals 62 mi] to the . . . northwest—in the Mare Serenitatis. We are landing on a plain that seems to overlie a slightly elevated flat surface that predates the mare. And it seems when you look at all of the basins on the moon, that that surface, a correlative surface in other basins, is somehow related to the formation of the basin. There are comparable plains around all of the big circular basins, and there is a flat floor that predates the mare that is cut by graben faulting .... Also in the site we have the . . . north and

south massifs. These are large aggregates of peaks and mountains that . . . are part of the range structure of the Orientale basin.”
Dark cover over valley floor and portions of highlands was younger than mare and was as little as 0.5 m (1.6 ft) thick. Radar data had shown cover was “finely fragmented mantle material” that was “ubiquitous in all of the low areas and locally is covering portions of the highlands.” Dr. Schmitt said mantle, although of not as high a priority as the crustal examination in the south massif, had “potential of giving us our most fundamental evidence for studying this evolutionary model.” Potential was high that “dark mantle material has sampled some significant portion of the crust. At least it has sampled its source area, and that source area is very probably deep within the moon.” Dr. Schmitt told press that to be able to say that man was “on the verge, if not already there, of understanding the evolution of another planet is something that is really unprecedented in the history of man. And I think that’s the thing that’s the news of Apollo. That is what we have done.” (Transcript)
•	Mariner 9 mission ended as attitude-control gas supply was depleted and
engineering telemetry signal ceased during 698th Martian orbit of spacecraft launched May 30, 1971. Mariner 9 had reached Mars Nov. 13, 1971, and was 383 675 000 km (238 416 000 mi) from earth when engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent 45 960th, and last, command—to turn off radio transmitter. Spacecraft was expected to remain in Mars orbit some 50 yrs.
During 349 days (more than one half Martian year) of orbital activity, Mariner 9 had maintained instrumented surveillance of Mars and made first closeup photos of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. Major findings had included: geologically active planet with volcanic mountains and calderas larger than any on earth, equatorial crevasses more than 3000 km (2000 mi) long and three to four times deeper than Grand Canyon, indications that free-flowing water might have existed in Mars’ geologic history, evolution of monumental dust storms that raged to altitudes of 50 to 60 km (31 to 37 mi) above Mars surface, and realization that dust storms and cloudiness accounted for much of variability of Mars’ appearance over years.
Mariner 9 was first man-made object to orbit another planet. Mariner project, managed for NASA’s Office of Space Science by jpl, had been planned as two-spacecraft mission to Mars but Mariner 8, launched May 8, 1971, failed to enter orbit when Centaur stage of Atlas-Centaur booster malfunctioned after normal countdown and liftoff from Eastern Test Range. Spacecraft had reentered earth’s atmosphere. Plans had been revised and Mariner 9 had been launched successfully to conduct missions of both Mariners. Data from Mariner 9 experiments would provide groundwork for 1975 Viking lander mission to search for evidence of life on Mars, (jpl Release 634; A&A 1971)

•	Overview of Apollo 17 mission, scheduled for Dec. 6 launch, was given
by Mission Director Chester M. Lee at nasa Jdq. press briefing. Mission experiments would include lunar surface gravimeter to detect possible lunar surface deformation from pull of earth and sun and to confirm existence of gravity waves; lunar ejecta and meteorite experiment to determine mass, velocity, and frequency of meteorite impacts on moon and nature of their ejecta; lunar seismic profiling experiment to acquire data on lunar near-surface structure and layering; lunar atmospheric composition experiment (masspec) ; experiment to measure solar flares; and lunar traverse gravimeter with receiver carried on lunar roving vehicle Rover to survey anomalies of gravity at all science stops.
Among major new experiments on Apollo 17 mission would be surface electrical properties experiment to determine lunar surface layering and measure electrical properties of material; lunar neutron probe to measure capture rate of low-energy cosmic ray secondary neutrons and neutron energy spectrum as function of depth; and medical experiment biocore to be carried in command module (cm), biocore would carry six pocket mice in environmentally controlled situation. On return to earth, mice would be returned to principal investigators for examination for effects of high-Z particles. New experiments to be carried in scientific instrument module (sim) bay were far-ultraviolet spectrometer to determine composition density of lunar atmosphere; infrared scan radiometer to obtain data to correlate and confirm earth-produced thermal maps; and lunar sounder module to probe lunar near subsurface to depths of 1 to 1.05 km (0.6 to 1 mi).
First Apollo 17 launch window would open at 9:53 pm est Dec. 6 and close at 1:31 am est Dec. 7. Alternate launch windows would occur in January and February. To reach moon at optimum sun angle, Apollo 17 would be launched at night; entry into trajectory toward moon would be made over Atlantic rather than over Pacific as on previous Apollo missions. “This means the TLI [translunar insertion] will occur about 45 minutes later than ... in the past.” Countdown preparations were proceeding normally.

•	Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, described functions of
Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched July 23) in speech before First International Conference on Computer Satellites in Agriculture at Ohio State Univ. Satellite “now circles the earth 14 times a day in near-polar orbit. Each pass covers a region 185 km (115 miles) wide. After 18 days, the satellite returns to the same position. The erts Multispectral Scanner scans the earth in four wavelength bands.” Green band enhanced features within water, since they were transparent in band. Red band showed contrast between vegetation and man-made structures and was good for land use mapping. Infrared band was invisible to human eye but “vegetation strongly reflects this energy, and thus appears bright on film. Water absorbs it, and appears dark. This band is often used to identify plants or crops, since the brightness of the image depends greatly on the type of vegetation. It is also used to determine the health of plants, because healthy crops will appear to be much brighter than those which are diseased.” Data to date had shown earth resources satellites like Erts 1 would be able to take large-scale inventories of crop type and crop health, erts data “lend themselves to rapid automated area calculation procedures for all kinds of agricultural production parameters.” (Text)

•	Results of U.S.S.R. research of Mars as released by Soviet press were
summarized by Interavia. Initial analysis of data collected by Mars 2 and 3 (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) spacecraft during interplanetary flight had indicated large variations in composition of interplanetary plasma ions at 20 million km (12.5 million mi) from earth. Data had also revealed new information on distribution of solar plasma around solar system and its relationship with interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic fields. No magnetic field had been detected near Mars, indicating possible lack of liquid core.
Orbits of spacecraft had been selected to cover areas of Martian surface difficult to investigate from earth-central latitudes of southern hemisphere to 65° south, equatorial zone, and northern hemisphere to 29° north. During Martian orbit infrared radiometer data had shown certain areas of surface to be definitely warmer than immediate surroundings, indicating possible volcanic activity.
Mars 2 and 3 had found steam content in Martian atmosphere to be 2000 times less than that existing in terrestrial atmosphere. At times precipitated water could be 50 micrometers; at others, less than 10. Since photos taken by NASA’s Mariner 9 revealed impressive valleys which could have been formed by erosion, Soviet scientists had theorized that higher temperatures and pressures, sufficient to produce water in liquid form, existed on Mars in previous era. Very sharp differences in planet’s brightness, never before observed from earth, were observed by visible range photometer. Data were collected from measurement of radio-wave reflection.
After landing, scientific results from Mars 2 and 3 had been meager. Mars 2 had hardlanded a capsule on Mars Nov. 27, 1971. Photos and measurements by Mars 3 (which softlanded a capsule Dec. 2, 1971) had indicated a dust cloud 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) thick covering landing area, leading to speculation that either dust storms had raged over area and caused capsule to land incorrectly or capsule had sunk into dust layer.
Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov had said U.S.S.R. planned to use 1973 launch windows if program of Martian exploration continued as planned. (Interavia, 10/72, 1139—41; gsfc SSR, 1/31/73)

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had asked Panel to review paper by Univ. of California at Berkeley physicist Dr. Harold S. Johnston [see Aug. 1] and to consider research to resolve uncertainties that existed in Dr. Johnston’s hypothesis that nitrogen oxides from exhausts of supersonic transport aircraft could have destructive effects on ozone concentration. Uncertainties existed because dynamic processes might distort chemical equilibrium model based on static atmosphere, rates of some reactions in scheme of chemical kinetics might not be known, and estimations of SST engine exhaust products seemed uncertain to order of magnitude, at least. Panel had concluded: “There appears to be general agreement that Harold Johnston’s conclusions . . . are credible, but with the reservations cited.” Possibility of serious effects on the normal ozone could not be dismissed. “To the extent that existing information permits, Johnston has done a very careful and detailed analysis.” It was evident “that we suffer from serious ignorance of many fundamental aspects of the chemistry and dynamics of the stratosphere when we attempt to make quantitative assessments of the pollution consequences of high-altitude aircraft operations.” (nas—nrc-nae News Rpt, 10/72, 2)

•	Doomed civilization theory was disputed by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA
Administrator, in speech at Carnegie Institute Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. Speech was part of Man and Idea Series sponsored by museum’s Women’s Committee. “I think these views overlook the very center of civilization—man himself, his intellect and his capacity to learn and act, and thereby retain in some great measure control over his own destiny.” Goal of space program was to “place the tools of planetary management into the hands of man.” Rather than barrier or constraint, space had become to man “a natural extension of his sphere of activity. I do not see this as ephemeral or temporary; I believe that, both physically and intellectually, our operating environment has been permanently expanded. This is a real contribution to the human spirit.” Human spirit was difficult to define; “it is measured by attitudes and aspirations and mature expectations. Our space experience, in the fourteen years past, has given us all a different—and better—view of the future. In a very real sense, the future is already here; we must learn to recognize it and live in it responsibly.” (Text)

NASA Administrator, in letter to staff. NASA had received “great vote of confidence from the President, the Congress, and the country” in assignment to develop space shuttle. Assignment had been “most appropriate” in year when Apollo program would be concluded and was “a new challenge . . . worthy of the one we are about to complete.” Year 1972 had also been one of “great decision” because in NASA FY 1973 budget “we have also won approval for the concept of a well-rounded space program, with funding for significant progress in all major fields of space activity during this decade. We will stress practical benefits from spacecraft in Earth orbit in this decade and the next. But we will also build greatly improved spacecraft to study the universe from Earth orbit and to explore throughout the solar system.” NASA might be “moving faster with a bigger budget, but I don’t see how we could be doing a better job.” (NASA Activities, 11/15/72, 224)

Olympics slopes, another near slopes of three smaller volcanoes north of canyons along Martian equator, fourth on desert plain, and fifth in region of flattened craters at edge of highland terrain. Observations from Mariner 9 (launched May 30, 1971) had shown sites were low, relatively warm regions, possibly moist, where life form was most likely to be discovered. Prime objective of Viking missions was to determine if Mars harbored life or potential for life. In choosing sites, project scientists had eliminated nearly one third of Mars because of high elevations. In mountainous regions, Viking parachutes would not have sufficient atmosphere to brake spacecraft descent. Scientists also had rejected areas where surface appeared too soft for spacecraft landing, too hard for retrieval of soil samples, or so steep that spacecraft might tip over on landing.

November 9—15: Canadian Domestic Communications Satellite (Tele-sat-A)—named Anik 1, Eskimo for brother—was launched successfully at 8:14 pm est by NASA from Eastern Test Range on three-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. Anik 1 was placed in highly elliptical transfer orbit with apogee of 36 470 km (22 661.4 mi); perigee, 188.9 km (117.4 mi); inclination, 26.9°. After checkout and reorientation of spacecraft, apogee kick motor on board Anik 1 was fired at 3:55 pm est Nov. 13, bringing spacecraft into near synchronous circular orbit with 36 508-km (22 658-mi) apogee, 35 822-km (22 258.8-mi) perigee, 1455-min period, and 0.4° inclination and drifting to final operating position in synchronous equatorial orbit off west coast of South America.
Under contract between NASA and Telesat Canada, NASA mission objective was to place Anik 1 in orbit of sufficient accuracy to allow onboard propulsion systems to place spacecraft in stationary synchronous orbit while retaining sufficient station-keeping propulsion to meet mission lifetime requirements. Objectivie was met; mission was adjudged successful Nov. 15.
Launch was first on Thor-Delta “straight eight” launch vehicle, so called because diameter was eight feet for all three stages including fairing. Previous Thor-Deltas had been tapered at joint of first and second stage. New design allowed Delta to launch new generation of larger volume spacecraft. Flight was also first with nine solid-fuel thrust-augmentation rockets from Cape Kennedy. Third stage was TE-364-4 solid-fueled motor.
Anik 1—first of two—was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. under contract with Telesat and designed to provide transmission of TV, voice, and data throughout Canada for seven years. It would provide 10 color TV channels or up to 9600 telephone circuits. System could distribute analog or digital signals with overall performance comparable to that of terrestrial methods. Spacecraft, 1.8 m in diameter and 3.4 m high (6 by 11 ft), weighed 540 kg (1200 lhs) at launch and 270 kg (600 lhs) in orbit.

Emphasis was on argument by Dr. Harold S. Johnston of Univ. of California at Berkeley and Dr. Paul J. Crutzen of Univ. of Stockholm that nitrogen oxides from supersonic transport exhaust could seriously deplete stratosphere ozone that absorbed much of harmful ultraviolet rays. Some scientists and engineers attending conference had agreed with theory but many had said it was essential to prove theory wrong. Dr. Harold F. Blum of State Univ. of New York at Albany had said that if additional UV got through stratosphere increase in skin cancer would occur, but he could not estimate amount of increase. Dr. Alan J. Grobecker, sst assessment program manager, said if chain reaction in which nitrogen oxides continuously removed ozone according to Johnston-Crutzen theory was very slow effect might escape notice. sst program studies would include use of high-flying U-2 and Concorde supersonic transport aircraft to make stratospheric observations and quick-freeze samples of air in stratosphere for laboratory analysis.

November 16-27: Explorer 48 (sas-b) Small Astronomy Satellite, second in series of three, was successfully launched for NASA by Italian crew at 1:14 am local time (5:14 pm Nov. 15 est) from San Marco Facility off coast of Kenya. Four-stage solid-propellant Scout launch vehicle boosted 186-kg (410-lb) payload into circular orbit with 632.5-km (393-mi) apogee, 443.7-km (275.7-mi) perigee, 95.4-min period, and 1.9° inclination. Launch was 26th consecutive successful Scout launch, record for NASA vehicle.
Primary objective of Explorer 48 was to measure spatial and energy distribution of primary galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation— within sas program to make investigations of celestial sphere from above earth’s atmosphere and search for sources inside and outside our galaxy, radiating in x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet, infrared, and other regions of electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma ray telescope was first satellite version of evolution of digitized spark-chamber telescopes that had begun with balloon-borne instruments. Advanced detector could establish gamma ray event and reject events that simpler instruments might identify erroneously. It could study gamma rays exceeding 20 mev in energy, in region of electromagnetic spectrum able to penetrate galactic and extragalactic matter.
On Nov. 19 half of experiment’s high-voltage supplies were turned on and experiment was pointed toward earth. Real-time data acquisition indicated proper functioning of experiment, with detection of earth albedo gamma rays. Remaining high-voltage power was turned on Nov. 27. Experiment and spacecraft control section were functioning normally.
Spacecraft was cylinder 59 cm in diameter and 51 cm high (23-in dia by 20). When deployed, four solar paddles—27 cm wide and 135 cm long (10.5 by 53 in)—provided raw power. Unique was separate development of spacecraft control section and experiment package, which had permitted flexible concurrent development of experiments and minimized costs by fabrication of standardized control section.
NASA provided booster and satellite; Italian team was responsible for cost-reimbursable launch preparation.

November 18:	NASA and Boston Univ. Dept, of Astronomy sponsored
symposium “Life Beyond Earth and the Human Mind” at Boston Univ. Panel Chairman Richard Berendzen, Boston Univ. astronomer, had said symposium was being held because recent findings in astronomy, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics had indicated high probability of existence of extraterrestrial life. Many scientists believed that “within the next few decades some form of communication will be achieved with intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.” Panelists were anthropologist Dr. Ashley Montagu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Dr. Philip Morrison, Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Carl E. Sagan, Dean Krister Stendahl of Harvard Divinity School, and Dr. George Wald of Harvard Univ., winner of 1967 Nobel Prize for medicine and researcher in biochemical evolution.
Dr. Sagan said human technology had reached stage where man could detect another civilization as advanced as his. “Most optimistic estimate of civilizations in our galaxy is one million, which means one per many hundred thousand stars.” Searching stars one by one could take hundreds of years. Dr. Montagu said that “some other forms of

life are probably more intelligent than we, which can explain why they haven’t contacted us.” Dean Stendahl said discovery of life elsewhere would teach mem that God’s domain is larger and would give man better idea of his place in it. Contacting other beings might help man to stop viewing God in his own image. Dr. Wald said he was convinced that life existed elsewhere in galaxy but he doubted man would ever contact it. Dr. Morrison predicted man would receive and verify message from another civilization. Message would be technical, scientifically coded communication received over many months or years.

November 24:	Twenty-fifth anniversary of first launch of Aerobee sound-
ing rocket on Nov. 24, 1947, from White Sands Missile Range. Launch had been unsuccessful; rocket carrying Johns Hopkins Univ. payload had veered off course and had been destroyed. But since then arrowshaped Aerobee had been busiest booster in U.S. space program, with launch rate of almost one per week and few failures out of 900 launches to date. Aerobees carrying scientific payloads to altitudes as high as 480 km (300 mi) had been launched by NASA, Air Force, Navy, and Federal scientific groups. Launches were mainly from NASA’s Wallops Station, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Churchill Range in Manitoba, Canada.
Aerobee—most widely used rocket in astronomy—had carried delicate instruments through blanket of air and dirt surrounding earth to area of greater visibility. Instruments launched June 13, 1969, by NASA on Aerobee 150 from Natal, Brazil, had detected x-ray star only 16 km (10 mi) wide that weighed as much as sun. Scientists at Univ. of California who conducted experiment had said stellar object might be first direct evidence of neutron star and first time size of x-ray source from deep space could be determined.
Other scientific payloads aboard Aerobees had measured Crab Nebula, collected micrometeoroids, taken temperatures aloft, and recorded air densities. In 1952 Air Force Aerobee carried two monkeys and two mice in biomedical experiments.
Rocket originally weighed 700 kg (1600 lbs), was 5.8 m (19 ft) long, and carried payloads under 45 kg (100 lbs). Over years Aerobee had grown to be 15 m (50 ft) long, powered by four clustered, liquid-fuel engines and solid-fuel booster. Largest Aerobee could blast 400-kg (900-lb) payload to altitude of 200 km (125 mi). (Lyons, NYT, 11/26/72, 39; A&A 1915-1950)
• Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Manned Spacecraft Center Director and former msc Director of Flight Operations, reviewed Apollo program in Associated Press interview published in Baltimore Sun. Apollo 8 (launched Dec. 21, 1968) had been program’s pivotal mission. “It proved so many things that had a bearing on the progress of the program—things that it might have disproved. The navigation to and from the moon, the ability of the spacecraft systems to perform, the ability of man to survive the deep space environment, all hinged on the Apollo 8 mission.” Mission also had changed competitive position of U.S. and U.S.S.R. in space. “I really believed the Russians planned to fly a cir-cumlunar mission, sending a manned spacecraft looping around and returning it without orbiting the moon. That way they could say they sent the first man to the vicinity of the moon. And when we . . . decided to fly Apollo 8 as a moon-orbit mission, there was nothing left for them to do.” There was no major technological field that “hasn’t been materially changed or had some reflection of not only Apollo but of the whole space program.” Space technology had been important to maintenance of U.S. position as leading nation in world. Five manned lunar landing flights had produced greater scientific return than envisioned. “We have done just about all we should have done with the Apollo program in terms of lunar exploration. This is a good time to stop, evaluate what we have and use our resources to do other things in the space program.” (B Sun, 11/24/72, A10)

•	Washington Post published first of series of articles on U.S. energy crisis.
Population had doubled in 50 yrs, while energy use had almost quadrupled. Per capita electricity consumption had doubled five times— twice in last 15 yrs. Nationwide environmental movement had halted Government’s Plowshare program to release trapped oil and gas by nuclear explosions, delayed Alaska pipeline, and forced near-moratorium on dam building. Ecologists had “forced power companies to abandon scenic river and lake sites in 10 states and have caused more than 20 delays in the construction of nuclear power plants.” Disagreement was “rampant” over changes wrought by environmental movement. But ecologists had caused no shortage of energy in U.S. thus far. Many energy experts believed technology would “bail us out by letting us tap new, clean fuels and by cleaning up existing fuels.” Mitre Corp. had recently completed exhaustive energy study.

Its ultimate impact will be to expand space activity while at the same time reducing the high costs of the space effort.” Shuttle combined in one transport “capability to launch or carry out unmanned or manned missions repeatedly and routinely. It will be the first true ‘aerospace’ vehicle in that it can fly and maneuver in both space and the atmosphere.” Shuttle would contribute more than any previous rocket vehicle to NASA’s progress in advancing technologies and capabilities for space flight and exploration, space science and study of aerospace phenomena, and expanded use of space and space technology for human benefit. “To achieve the smoothest, most economical progress and benefits at lowest cost to the taxpayers, all three objectives should go forward in fairly close concert, not piecemeal or with fluctuating budgetary peaks and valleys.” (Am Sci, 11-12/1972, 730-8)

•	First results of new radar astronomy technique for accurately measuring
lunar topography from earth were described in Science by Haystack Observatory astronomer Stanley H. Zisk. Earlier techniques had measured radar backscattering properties by analyzing lunar echo simultaneously in both time and delay Doppler frequency. New technique extended earlier technique to three-dimensional measurement using radio-interferometer receiver for lunar echo signals. Technique had been used to measure lunar area that included craters Ptolemaeus,

Other features coinciding with local gravitational anomalies could be correlated with flow events. Science cover photo of lunar topography showed floor of crater Ptolemaeus to be higher than large mare to its left. Lunar elevations were indicated by lighter shades of gray on black-to-white /photo.

•	Major advance in research to control nuclear fusion for commercial
/ energy was announced by Atomic Energy Commission. Experiments
using adiabatic toroidal compressor (atc) at aec’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory had achieved, for first time, plasma density in range in which tokamak fusion reactor was expected to operate and had demonstrated new technique for heating tokamak plasma to thermonuclear temperatures. ATC was device for containing and heating plasma fuel to temperatures that would melt any other container. It was improved version of Soviet-developed tokamak containing and heating device that had been hailed internationally as promising approach to production of fusion power. Soviet results from T-3 tokamak experiment, published in 1969, had been confirmed by Princeton tokamak experiments in 1970. Dr. James R. Schlesinger, AEC Chairman, had said new ATC results “further brighten the prospect of realizing commercial fusion power in a tokamak confinement system.” But aec had “many years of hard work ahead” to develop concept into “practical power system.” (aec Release P-404; aec pio)

•	New York Times said it had asked more than 20 scientists and scholars
with no part in space program to assess probable place of space exploration in “broad sweep of history and in the evolution of man and man’s perception of himself and his universe.” British historian Arnold J. Toynbee and American anthropologist Dr. Margaret Mead had seen space experience as “turning point in human history.” Univ. of Michigan biophysicist Dr. John R. Platt had said that “the great picture of earth taken from the moon is one of the most powerful images in the minds of men today and may be worth the cost of the whole Apollo project.” He saw photo as “a great landmark in exploration—to get away from the earth to see it whole.” Soviet poet Robert Rozhdestvensky had said: “Man has become . . . more perceptive to what worries other people. He has no possibility of hiding away . . . of escaping reality and shutting himself up in the narrow world of his own.” French anthropologist Dr. Claude Levi-Strauss had said: “I never look at TV except when there’s a moon shot, and then I am glued to my set.” Dr. Garrett Hardin, ecologist of Univ. of California at Santa Barbara, had said it was time to pull back from further manned space exploration for several centuries. Space program “can only be called ‘spiritual’ in both the good and bad senses.” Technological spinoffs of space program “could surely have been achieved with an expenditure of much less.”
Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin, Director of Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of History and Technology, had said greatest thing about space exploration was “that we don’t know what its payoff will be. This symbolizes the American civilization. The people who settled America had no idea what the payoff would be. They settled it before they explored it.” Nobel Prize winning biologist Dr. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi had said Apollo flights demanded that word “impossible”

Weinberg, said successes in space and nuclear energy had given people “the feeling that essentially any technological problem can be solved. This has created within the technological community and within the public at large a kind of technological euphoria.” (Wilford, NYT, 12/3/72, 1)
•	Apollo program accomplishments were praised by Dr. Wernher von
Braun, Vice President for Engineering and Development with Fairchild Industries, Inc., and former NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, in New York Times article: “Two developments stand out in my view: (1) The remarkable advance in sophistication of flight techniques and capabilities of the crews, and (2) . . . the eye opening increase in both the extent and results of the scientific activities of manned lunar exploration.” After completion of Apollo 17 mission would come realization “that we have only begun the exploration of the moon. As the analysis of Apollo lunar data and specimens proceeds, it will dawn on us what an enormous treasure trove awaits mankind just offshore from our planet. It will also occur to the scientific community that a base on the moon is just as important as a base in the Antarctic.” (NYT, 12/3/72, 68)
•	Astronauts’ image was discussed in New York Times Magazine article.
Of 73 pilots and scientists selected for astronauts corps only 39 remained active, and corps faced future cuts. Three astronauts had died in Jan. 27, 1967, Apollo spacecraft fire; five others in aircraft and auto accidents. Of 25 who had left corps, “many have followed the conventional paths of glory into business and Government.” But “in the behavior of others there is more than a touch of the eccentric, and a large dose of trouble, almost a mythological element: the wandering hero back among his tribe, after stealing the sacred fire and grappling with terrifying demons, condemned to ask tough questions.” World might regard some astronauts as “Byrds and Lindberghs of our time.” As space program emphasis shifted, “they may be an endangered species. For the hotshot pilot seems destined to he replaced in the space stations of the near-future with scientists given training of shorter duration for their flight duties.” Astronauts had been “wandering heroes who tried to unite us with their vision of earth as a small ball floating in an oceanic universe, with all men as passengers. But they weren’t really poets, and they flew at a time of bitter earthly quarrels, with many resentful of the price tag on their odyssey.” Like most heroes, “they were magnified versions of all of us, men of great daring and courage whose competitiveness was no doubt fierce, whose outlook was often corporate and even corny, whose ingenuousness was at times profound. But their image as a comforting symbol to Middle America did them an injustice.” (Muson, NYT Magazine, 12/3/72, 37, 142)

exploration, “not because of the hostility of the lunar surface or of interplanetary space, but because of indifference back at home.” U.S. had “vindicated her technological honor following the deep felt humiliation of being beaten into space by the Russians: the payoff in terms of international prestige has not come up to expectations; the hope that space had vast military potential has proved an illusion.” (Silcocjc, London Sunday Times, 12/3/72, 33)
•	Newspaper editorials commented on U.S. space program.
Baltimore Sun on post-Apollo space program: “While it is tempting to contemplate what improvements could be financed here on earth from the billions being spent in space, it is well to bear several factors in mind. One is the decline in space spending from a $5.25 billion peak in 1965 to the present plateau of $3.35 billion a year. Another is the Nixon administration’s decision to proceed cautiously on the rush-rush manned Mars expedition advocated by Vice President Agriew three years ago. Still another is the American-Soviet agreement on a rendezvous-and-docking mission for mid-1975, a concept once relegated to political science fiction. Finally, there is the very real prospect that experiments and programs conducted from space shuttles will be of use in improving the environment on earth. More accurate weather forecasting, air pollution studies, better communications—these are some of the more obvious opportunities. These trends surely justify reasonable financial support to continue a desired momentum in space technology.” (B Sun, 12/3/72)
New York News on last Apollo mission: “The Apollo program is being phased out before its time, a victim of what we consider false economy, and the horizon is barren of any prospect for manned exploration beyond the boundaries of Earth orbit. Even unmanned probes will be few and far between as things look now.” (NY News, 12/3/72)	_ #
Chicago Tribune on future space program: Cost of Skylab, Viking, and space shuttle programs would £e far less than amount put into space since 1958. “The national priorities have been reordered and, we believe, properly so.

was adjudged success. Objectives of extended mission of Mariner 9 (launched by NASA May 30, 1971, and inserted in Mars orbit No. 13, 1971) had been to map 70% of planet with 1-km (0.6-mi) visual resolution and to study dynamic characteristics of Mars at reduced data-acquisition rate. During extended mission Mariner 9 had mapped 100% of planet and had observed large areas with infrared and ultraviolet instruments. S-band occultations and celestial mechanics measurements had proved Mars to be geologically and meteorologically active. (nasa proj off)
•	Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, described major alterations
in “nature of the space effort” to be expected with 1978 introduction of space shuttle, in signed New York Times article. National space program had “turned an important corner in 1972—a year that, in a very real sense, was a year of decision” in choosing to proceed with shuttle. U.S. had “turned from a period of space exploration to a period of space exploitation for practical purposes.”
By 1978 it would be “realistic to consider a variety of missions either not practicable at present cost levels or that were beyond the state of the art as it was in the pre-shuttle era.” Missions would include advanced, space-based communications systems that, when used for education, would “have the potential for eliminating illiteracy from the face of the earth.” Shuttle-launched advanced-version Nimbus satellites, combined with weather-modeling ground computers, would permit experiments in weather modification to dampen violent storms. Earth resources program data would provide precise picture of crop and timber conditions and extent of attacks by disease, drought, and fire. By 1980s, pilot space manufacturing operations might be in progress. “Super pure vaccine could thus be produced. Perfectly homogeneous alloys, fiber composites and perfectly round ball bearings are other possibilities.” During 1980s, “program of planetary exploration should record the completion of a close look at all the planets in our solar system as well as a detailed study of Mars, Jupiter and Venus. Large orbiting telescopes will be aimed at the outer reaches of the universe, examining such phenomena as quasars and pulsars.” (NYT, 12/4/72, 50)
•	Term “post-Apollo” had “outlived its usefulness,” Dr. James C. Fletcher,
nasa Administrator, said in message to staff. “When plans for this decade were still uncertain it made sense to refer to them as post-Apollo plans. But today we are advanced with new programs which stand on their own merits.” Skylab, space shuttle, Viking, High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao), and Pioneer and Mariner missions to planets drew heavily on technology of 1960s, “but they take this technology giant steps into the future.” Dr. Fletcher suggested names for future years: 1973 would be “Year of Skylab” and of Pioneer 10, 1975 would be year of Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, in 1976 Viking would land on Mars, and in 1978 first space shuttle orbital flight was scheduled. “Each of these events will make a memorable page in the story of human progress. Each of them will contribute importantly to mankind’s knowledge of our planetary environment.” (NASA Activities, 12/15/72, 244-5)

Some consider the moon landings the most brilliant scientific achievement in history; others still look at the whole venture as a waste of resources needed for urgent requirements here on earth. Yet one fact about the venture is beyond dispute: in the years 1969-72 men landed on another celestial body for the first time and showed they could live and work in the bizarre and literally inhuman conditions on that foreign planet. Long after most other developments of the twentieth century are forgotten, future generations will recall this as the century in which men broke the bonds of terrestrial gravity and began their cosmic destiny.” (NYT, 12/6/72, 42)

December 7—19: Apollo 17 (AS—512), sixth and last successful NASA manned lunar landing mission, carried three-man crew—including first scientist-astronaut in space—to moon’s Taurus-Littrow region after first nighttime launch. Lunar module Challenger (LM-12) landed on moon Dec. 11 and two astronauts deployed experiments, rode lunar roving vehicle (lrv), and explored lunar surface during 75-hr stay. Challenger rejoined orbiting command and service module America (CSM-114) in lunar orbit Dec. 14 for safe return to earth with record 115 kg (250 lbs) of lunar samples Dec. 19.
December 7—10: Launch from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by Saturn V launch vehicle was delayed 2 hrs 40 min. Automatic cutoff at T minus 30 sec in countdown required recycle and hold at T minus 22 min; additional hold was called at T minus 8 min. Holds were caused when terminal countdown sequencer failed to command pressurization of S-IVB liquid-oxygen tank. Tank was pressurized manually, but failure to arm tank’s pressurized interlock prevented continuation of launch events until interlock was bypassed by jumper. Workaround was first thoroughly analyzed at Marshall Space Flight Center. Investigation later indicated cause of failure was defective diode on printed circuit card in sequencer.
Spacecraft—carrying Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan (commander), Ronald E. Evans (command module pilot), and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt (lunar module pilot and geologist)—was launched at 12:33 am EST Dec. 7, with illumination from S-IC 1st stage creating brilliance of morning sun. Liftoff, witnessed by crowd estimated at 500 000 and by nationwide and foreign TV viewers, was visible to naked eye as far as South Carolina to north and Cuba to south.
Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with 170-km (105.6-mi) apogee and 168-km (104.4-mi) perigee.

Latch 10 was locked by pushing on handle; latches 7 and 9 were locked and manually fired to lock handles. Following hatch replacement, csm/lm combination was ejected from S-IVB stage at 4:45 get. S-IVB lunar impact maneuver targeted stage to strike moon’s surface Dec. 10.
Midcourse correction (MCC-1) was not necessary because of nominal trajectory. MCC—2 maneuver was performed on time at 35:30 get, changing velocity 3 m per sec (9.9 fps). Cernan and Schmitt entered LM at 40:10 get and discovered docking latch 4 improperly latched. Evans moved latch handle 30°^t5°, disengaging hook from docking ring. Mission Control and flight crew decided to wait until second LM entering at 59:59 get for further action on latch. Remainder of LM housekeeping was nominal and LM was closed out at 42:11 GET.
Heat flow and convection demonstrations were conducted as planned; results were satisfactory. MCC-3 and -4 were not required because of near-nominal trajectory. LM housekeeping was resumed at 59:59 get and completed at 62:16 get with all systems nominal. Evans, following ground instructions, stroked docking latch 4 handle and succeeded in cocking latch. Latch was left in cocked position for csm-lm rendezvous.

Planned trajectory was modified continually because of late liftoff; coast toward moon was accelerated to ensure arrival of spacecraft at lunar orbit insertion (loi) at scheduled GMT time. GET clock was updated 2 hrs 40 min at 65:00 get to place all events on original flight plan schedule. Crew began one-hour visual-light-flash phenomenon observation at 68:19 GET and reported seeing bright to dull light flashes. Cernan reported continuing gas pains during private consultation via separate radio link with Dr. W. Royee Hawkins, Manned Spacecraft Center Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations. He was told to continue taking antigas pills and to alter diet. Crew jettisoned scientific instrument module (sim) door at 84:12 GET and said SIM bay looked good.
December 10-16: Apollo 17 entered lunar orbit with 315-km (195.7-mi) apolune and 97-km (60.3-mi) perilune after 398-sec loi burn at 88:54 GET (2:47 pm EST Dec. 10). Cernan announced: “America has arrived on station for the challenge ahead.”
S-IVB 3rd stage impacted on lunar surface at 89:39 GET (3:32 pm EST Dec. 10) at 4° 12' south latitude and 12° 18' west longitude. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 seismometers.
Evans described crew’s excitement at reaching vicinity of moon: “We’re breathing so hard, the windows are fogging up.” Schmitt interrupted running commentary on lunar topography with shout: “Hey I just saw a flash on the lunar surface!” When assured by Mission Control that impact of possible small meteor would have been masked

on seismometers by S-IVB 3rd-stage impact, Schmitt groaned: “Just my luck.” Cernan—who had orbited moon during May 18-26, 1969, Apollo 10 mission—described sight as “still just as impressive.”
Descent orbit insertion (DOI-1) was performed at 90:31 get. CSM and LM undocked and separated on schedule at 107:48 get. Circularization maneuver placed csm in orbit with 129-km (80.2-mi) apolune and 100-km (62.1-mi) perilune.
DOI-2, at 109:50 get, inserted lm into orbit with 111-km (69.0-mi) apolune and 11-km (6.8-mi) perilune. Powered descent was initiated and Challenger touched down on Taurus-Littrow site at 113:02 get (2:55 pm est Dec. 11).
Cernan descended lm ladder four hours later, at 117:02 get, and said: “As I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, I’d like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible.” Schmitt, first geologist to walk on moon, followed and asked, “Hey, who’s been tracking up my lunar surface?” Cernan said surrounding hills looked like “wrinkled skin of an old, old, 100-year-old man.”
Astronauts deployed lunar roving vehicle. Cernan made short test drive and said, “Hallelujah, Houston! Challenger’s baby is on the roll.”
As Cernan and Schmitt set up TV equipment, Cernan called to Schmitt: “Hey, Jack, just stop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to look up over the South Massif and look at the Earth.” Schmitt replied: “What? The Earth? You seen one earth, you’ve seen them all.” Cernan unfurled U.S. flag on lunar surface while Schmitt took his picture. Cernan said, “It’s got to be one of the most proud moments of my life.” Flag had “flown in the mocr [Mission Operations Control Room] since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the country, the United States and mankind, something different than it was.”
While preparing to traverse to Apollo lunar surface experiment package site, Cernan inadvertently knocked extension off of lrv right rear fender and repairs were made with tape. Astronauts crossed to alsep site, where they deployed alsep. Color TV camera beamed live telecast to earth.
LRV fender again fell off during traverse to Steno Crater, lunar station 1A. Crew deployed surface electrical properties experiment and explosive packages during 7-hr 12-min lunar surface exploration. First eva ended at 124:13 get.
Second eva began 1 hr 20 min late, at 140:35 get (6:28 pm est Dec. 12). Cernan and Schmitt, on instructions from Mission Control, improvised replacement for lost lrv fender extension. Four chronopaque maps were taped together and held in place by two portable utility lamp clamps. “Call me the little old fender maker,” Cernan said.
Cernan and Schmitt visited lunar stations 2, 2A, 3, 4, and 5. They deployed explosive packages, obtained photos, and collected and documented soil samples. At station 4, Shorty Crater, Schmitt shouted: “There is orange soil! It’s all over! Orange!” Cernan confirmed finding: “Jack that is really orange. It’s been oxidized.” Schmitt dug trench and extracted sample which he described to Mission Control: “An essential portion of the zone . . . actually has a crimson hue, or

And outside of that, it’s gray.” Scientists on ground immediately speculated that soil might have originated from volcanism on moon as recently as 100 million yrs earlier. If so, it would contradict “dead moon” theory that moon had always been cold and inert. Dr. Robin P. Brett, head of MSC Geochemistry Branch, told press, “What we have been witnessing may be one of the most significant finds of Apollo geology.”
Schmitt revisited ALSEP site to verify that lunar surface gravimeter had been leveled properly. EVA-2 ended at 148:35 get (2:05 am EST Dec. 13), after 7 hrs 37 min. Total distance covered during second eva was 19 km (12 mi).
Third eva began 50 min late at 163:35 GET (5:26 pm est Dec. 13). Cosmic ray detector was retrieved before start of traverse to prevent exposure to low-energy solar protons from small solar flare. Cernan and Schmitt took black and white and color photos and collected 66 kg (145.9 lbs) of samples. Samples included blue-gray breccias, finegrained vesicular basalts, crushed anorthositic rocks, and soils. EVA-3

ended at 170:48 get {0:41 am est Dec. 14), after 7 hrs 16 min. During EVA—3 Evans, orbiting in CSM 113 km (70 mi) above lunar surface, identified series of volcanic domes in Aitken Grater, on moon’s far side.
Before entering Challenger for last time, Cernan and Schmitt stepped before TV cameras. Cernan said: “To commemorate not just Apollo ITs visit to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world, we’d like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our spacecraft.” He read inscription: “Here man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind.” Dr, James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, congratulated astronauts from Mission Control at msc and conveyed Godspeed message from President Nixon. As astronauts boarded LM, Cernan said: “I believe history will record that America’s challenge of today has forged man’s destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. God speed the crew of Apollo 17T
Total time for three EVAs was 22 hrs 5 min 4 sec, during which Cernan and Schmitt traveled 35 km (22 mi) in LRV, collected 115 kg (250 lbs) of samples, and took 2120 photos. Good-quality TV transmission was received throughout evas.

cameras in CSM provided excellent picture in Mission Control as lm approached. Cernan in lm said, “Good to see you .... It’s been a good trip.” Evans replied, “Good to have you all back up here.” Observing that “America and Challenger are . . . good tight Navy formation,” Cernan told Evans, “Command module looks as good as the day they put it on the pad.” Evans answered, “And, you know, so does Challenger.”
CSM and lm docked in lunar orbit at 190:17 get and Cernan and Schmitt transferred to csm with samples and equipment, lm ascent stage was jettisoned as planned. Impact of stage on lunar surface at 195:57 get was recorded by four Apollo 17 geophones and Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 alseps. Explosive packages were detonated and events were picked up by lunar seismic profiling geophones. Flash and dust from EP 7 explosion were seen on TV.
Insertion into trajectory for earth began at 236:42 get, after csm’s 147 hrs 48 min in lunar orbit.
December 17-19:	Spacecraft left moon’s sphere of influence at

Evans left CSM at 257:34 get (3:27 pm est Dec. 17) for 1-hr 7-min inflight eva to retrieve lunar sounder film and panoramic and mapping camera cassettes in three trips to sim bay. TV pictures relayed to Mission Control showed him cavorting in weightlessness in stiff white pressure suit and attached to 7.6-m (25-ft) line. Following space walk, astronauts settled down for final two days of mission.

Recovery helicopter dropped swimmers, who installed flotation collar and attached life raft. Astronauts were transported to recovery ship for postflight examination. They would be flown to Houston via Samoa the following day. CSM was retrieved by recovery ship for transport to San Diego, Calif.
Apollo 17 achieved primary objectives—to make selenological survey and sampling of materials and surface features in preselected area of Taurus-Littrow region, emplace and activate surface experiments, and conduct inflight experiments and photography. Launch vehicle and spacecraft system performances were near nominal throughout mission. Only minor discrepancies occurred, with no effect on safety or mission objectives. Flight crew performance was good. Mission was judged officially to be “a great success.”
Accomplishments included sixth manned lunar landing and return, first geologist-astronaut on lunar surface, longest lunar surface stay time (74 hrs 59 min 38 sec), longest single lunar surface eva (7 hrs 37 min 22 sec), longest total lunar surface EVA time (22 hrs 5 min 4 sec), longest total lunar distance traversed with LRV (35 km; 22 mi), longest Apollo mission (12 days 13 hrs 51 min), most samples returned (115 kg; 250 lb), and longest time in lunar orbit (147 hrs 48 min).

New York Times: “It is still a breathtaking concept, though five teams of astronauts have successfully accomplished similar feats since Apollo 11 made its historic breakthrough in July 1969. The nearcatastrophe which forced abortion of the Apollo 13 mission provides a useful reminder of the dangers involved despite all the exquisitely painstaking care taken before blast-off.” Astronauts had “special qualities which set them apart. Some day . . . taking a rocket to the moon will be as common as taking a plane to London is today. But the Apollo pioneers who have blazed the way had to have a special degree of competence and courage to embark on this extraordinary journey.” {NYT, 12/7/72)

reflectivities of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites J II and J III was reported in Science by astronomers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and State Univ. of New York at Stony Brook. Measurements had been made by rapid-scanning Fourier spectrometer on 150-cm (60-in) McMath solar telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Percentage of frost-covered surface area had been determined at 50% to 100% for J II, 20% to 65% for J III, and possibly 5% to 25% for J IV. Leading side of J III had 20% more frost cover than trailing side, which explained visible geometric albedo differences between the two sides. Reflectivity of material underlying frost on J II, J III, and J IV resembled that of silicates. Surface of J I might be covered by frost particles much smaller than those of J II and J III.

But the question of its rightful place in the scheme of things always hung over it.” While “a cynic would conclude that the American people had turned from social problems,” realist “might conclude that what we were hearing in the late 1960s were the first real rumblings against large federal programs. The space program, meanwhile, had gained its momentum while this disillusionment was setting in. We got to the moon, it seemed, almost without anyone knowing it. The program had the velocity—and there was no turning back.” (W Post, 12/8/72, A26)

December 10: Nimbus 5 (Nimbus-E) meteorological satellite was successfully launched by NASA from Western Test Range at 11:56 pm EST by two-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster. Satellite entered near polar orbit with 1101.3-km (684.3-mi) apogee, 1089.5-km (677.0-mi) perigee, 107.2-min period, and 99.95° inclination. Solar array lock-on and three-axis stabilization were achieved as planned. Activation was proceeding.
Nimbus 5 carried new and improved instruments to extend observation into cloudy areas and higher altitudes, making first vertical temperature and water vapor measurements through clouds of earth’s atmosphere.
Assigned primary objectives were to improve and extend capability for vertical sounding of temperature and moisture in atmosphere with particular regard to altitude coverage and cloud interference, providing nearly total global coverage for first time, and to demonstrate improved

thermal mapping for 10 wks. As secondary objectives spacecraft would determine feasibility of using passive microwave remote sensing techniques to obtain earth observational data and would demonstrate capabilities of improved selective chopper radiometer (scr), provided by United Kingdom, to obtain atmospheric soundings.
Butterfly-shaped 769-kg (1695-lb) satellite carried six meteorological and earth resources experiments: scr; infrared temperature profile radiometer (itpr) ; Nimbus E microwave spectrometer (nems) ; electrically scanning microwave radiometer (esmr) ; surface-compositionmapping radiometer (scmr) ; and temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (thir).
Nimbus 5 was sixth of seven spacecraft designed to provide atmospheric data for improved weather forecasting. With added sophistication program had grown to include wide range of earth sciences. Sensors aboard Nimbus 5 would map Gulf Stream off east coast of U.S. and Humboldt Current off west coast of South America. By knowing locations of streams, shipping interests could make substantial saving. Nimbus 5 would also provide information about El Nino— change in Humboldt Current. El Nino had been causing great economic damage by warming coastal waters, killing nutrients and fish.
Nimbus 2 (launched May 15, 1966, with design life of 6 mos) had returned data for 32 mos, for detailed study of effect of water, carbon dioxide, and ozone on earth’s heat balance. Vertical temperature measurements of Nimbus 3 (launched April 14, 1969) had been termed by meteorologists as one of most significant events in meteorological history, providing worldwide atmospheric information.

The spearhead technology spawned ... is not just confined to aerospace but has spilled over into other broader areas such as medicine, communications and education.” (2) “Creation of a cooperative blend of engineering and scientific effort that appears to have begun bridging a divisive gulf and providing a pattern for more fruitful future work.” Apollo 17 “with its first scientist-astronaut crewmember, foreshadows the increasing opportunity for scientists to work in space as Skylab and the space shuttle provide sufficient capacity for non-flightcrew specialists.” (3) “Creation of a management capacity in both government and industry for marshaling vast resources to focus on a specific goal to achieve results within a limited time. Hopefully, these techniques can be applied to other complex problems facing modern society.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 12/11/72, 7)

The dreams that draw humanity forward seem always to be redeemed if we believe in them strongly enough, and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood mystified by the stars; today we reach out to them. We do this not only because it is man’s destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the impossible, and to do the impossible, but also because in space, as on earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement and the enlargement of human existence.
“This may be the last time this century that men will walk on the moon. But space exploration will continue, the benefits of space exploration will continue, the search for knowledge through the exploration of space will continue, and there will be new dreams to pursue based on what we have learned.

December 16:	Apollo 17 surface science press briefing was held at
Manned Spacecraft Center as astronauts headed toward home from moon. Stanford Univ. seismologist Dr. Robert L. Kovach described results to date from lunar seismic profiling experiment. Experiment had recorded impact of lunar module (lm) on lunar surface 9 km (5.6 mi) southwest of landing site “right on target where we wanted it.” Kinetic energy at impact was comparable to “1 ton of tnt going off.” Signal was “very clearly recorded on the geophone array and we’ve acquired an extremely important data point; . . . we’re effectively getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers [1.9 to 2.5 miles] in the Moon. And ... we should get some very important information about the underlying highland type materials.” Data point was “in critical distance range to answer one of the mysteries . . . of the shallow Lunar interior. We’ve been very much concerned about the enormous change in physical properties by terrestrial standards, . . . velocity changes by enormous percentage over a very small pressure range.” Data point should provide “answers as to just how these properties are changing.” First two explosive charges deployed had not shown significant differences in subsurface of Apollo 17 landing site and those of Apollo 15 and 16 but Apollo 17 site appeared to be “underlined by definitely more competent materials and they quite probably could be volcanic flows.”
Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic experiment, said Apollo 17 data, when compared with previous data, suggested possibility of new interpretation of lunar structure. “We do find evidence for lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably.” Velocity of seismic waves in crustal material and velocity of material underlying crust might also have to be lowered. “We’re not dealing with pure anorthosite anymore. We’re dealing perhaps with gabbros . . . and so we have ... to review all of the data and to reconsider our interpretations some, not just the seismologist, but the geochemist and geologist, as well.”

Dr. Marcus E. Langseth of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, principal investigator for heat flow experiment, said Apollo 17 experiment had “more than doubled” lunar heat flow data to date. “We’ve got a very successful emplacement in the operation of our instrument. It has been perfect.” Lunar surface temperature recorded Dec. 14 had been about 360 K (189°F). At about 15 cm (6 in), it had dropped to 280 K (45°F). At about 65 cm (26 in) temperature dropped to 254 K (—2°F). “Below that depth, the temperature begins to increase again. It’s about 257 degrees [3°F] at the bottom of the probes.” Data indicated that heat flow at Apollo 17 site would resemble that observed at 15 cm (6 in). If so, it would “give support to the kind of growing model of a warmer interior to the Moon” and “would require that there be a total gradient abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Moon as compared to Earth. So, there would be implication here for fundamental difference in composition, between the Moon and the Earth.” Dr. Langseth also reported data from traverse gravimeter experiment had supported thesis that “high gravity anomalies associated with the mare basin—the so called mascons”—probably had been created by slab of basalt or lavas which had flooded into previously excavated basins.
Dr. William R. Muehlberger of Univ. of Texas, principal lunar geology investigator, said Apollo 17 had provided “most exciting few days of my scientific career. This mission is truly the fitting climax to the whole Apollo program. The landing site held great promise that we were going to get a good chance to unravel much of the earlier lunar history as well as the sample and study of what appeared to be very young vulcanism .... And I think this promise was fulfilled.” Orange materials at Shorty Crater had been “a spectacular plus.” Scientists hoped “returned material will tell us that that was young vulcanism in volcanic alteration of Shorty Crater. There’s still a possibility it could be an impact crater, however.” Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., discussed Dr. Latham’s suggestion that lunar crust might be thinner than originally expected: “I will certainly defend the proposition that the crust is made of a very aluminum plagioclase-rich rocks, . . . anorthosite gabbro or gabbroic anorthosite, . . . far from a basalt. I think that the chemistry of the surface rocks, . . . and the returned rocks bear this out and if the crust is thin, it reduces the likelihood that it is any different composition than what we see at the surface.” (Transcript)

Still operative on moon were five nuclear-powered scientific stations costing $25 million each and three laser reflectors costing total $2 million. (Kotulak, C Trib News Service, C Trib, 12/16/72) December 17: Apollo 17 orbital science briefing was held at Manned Spacecraft Center while astronauts continued flight homeward from moon. Data from laser altimeter and S-band gravity experiments were described by Dr. Wilbur R. Wollenhaupt, Chief of msc Experiments Support Section and S-band transponder coinvestigator. Profiles of near-side lunar basins appeared to be flat and depressed with surrounding terrain. Far side appeared mountainous. Copernicus Crater was deficiency region; Sinus Aestuum, Mare Serenitatis, and Mare Crisium were high regions; and Littrow landing site was low.
Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey, member of Apollo Orbital Science Photographic Team, said panoramic camera aboard Apollo 17 had “acted better than on the two previous flights [Apollo 15 and 16], and we essentially accomplished the tasks assigned to it.” During Apollo 17 mission “we saw the successful rectification of the 15 and 16 panoramic photographs, and they looked very good indeed. So, hopefully, we will have the rectification of 17 done shortly and put out a series of photomosaics, putting the high-resolution panoramic frames together into what we think will be the best series of maps that we have developed for the Moon.” Correlation of photography with gravity tracking and laser altimetry had produced “a great deal of data” to confirm earlier interpretations from Apollo 15 that lunar front side was low and that “largest area of mare material on the front side is an ocean basin floor, . . . not a result of the impact as the large gravity anomalies indicate in the impact basin.”
Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Walter E. Brown reported lunar sounder experiment had “behaved about as we expected except that there were a couple of surprises.” Experimenters had expected that “over the Mare, the smooth areas, . . . we’d have a reasonably smooth, well-behaved echo, and over the mountainous area it might bounce around a little bit.” Sounder data had shown “it was fairly smooth over the mountains and it bounced around over the Mare.” Until mission film was returned, “we won’t know . . . just exactly what is going on, but it’s . . . extremely interesting.”
Dr. Frank J. Low of Univ. of Arizona and Rice Univ. said scanning radiometer experiment performance “was essentially perfect.” It produced coverage of about one third of the surface area of the moon and made some 100 million independent temperature measurements. With “beautiful Atlas of thermal measurements generated by this magnificent flight,” scientists had “foundation of a new technique for exploration of planetary surfaces without atmospheres.”
Johns Hopkins Univ. scientist William E. Fastie said far-ultraviolet spectrometer had “performed perfectly . . . and all of the observations that were intended were accomplished.” Experiment had detected neither major nor minor constituents of atmosphere. “And, pending further analysis, we have . . . identified only one trace constituent of the lunar atmosphere. The immediate conclusion ... is, that the Moon is not outgassing, because the only other possible gases that could be in the lunar atmosphere are neon and argon, and neither of them are the primordial atmosphere of the Moon.”

They went there consciously as representatives of all mankind, not as imperialists seeking to bring the moon under the Stars and Stripes. What they learned has been made available to all peoples and all nations without any request for a quid pro quo. In the atmosphere created by Project Apollo—with its constant reminder that what united men is stronger than what divides them—it was easier to reduce cold war tensions, to end the original space race, and to begin genuine international collaboration in cosmic exploration. Project Apollo has helped consecrate the moon and space to the cause of peace and cooperation among all men. This has been a glorious adventure in whose successful outcome the people of America and of the world can properly take pride.” (NYT, 12/17/72)

•	President Nixon issued statement on U.S. space program following splash-
down of Apollo 17 command module: “The safe return of the command module America marks the end of one of the most significant chapters in the history of human endeavor. In October 1958, this Nation set about sending men into a hostile, unknown environment. We had little idea what lay before us, but there was new knowledge to be gained and there was a heritage of meeting historical challenge— the challenge of greatness—to be sustained. Project Mercury, begun in 1958, taught us that man could survive and work in space. In 1961, President Kennedy voiced the determination of the United States to place a mem on the moon. We gained the understanding and the technology to embark on this great mission through Project Gemini and we accomplished it with the Apollo lunar exploration series. In 1969, for the first time, men from the planet Earth set foot on the moon.
“Since the beginning of Apollo, nine manned flights have been made to the moon. Three circled that nearest neighbor in the universe, six landed and explored its surface. We have barely begun to evaluate the vast treasure store of extraterrestrial data and material from these voyages, but we have already learned much and we know that we are probing our very origins. We are taking another long step in man’s ancient search for his own beginnings, pressing beyond knowl-

edge of the means of human existence to find, perhaps, the meaning of human existence.
“Nor is this great work ending with the return of Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans from the moon today. Rather it has barely begun. As Sir Isaac Newton attributed his accomplishments to the fact that he stood ‘upon the shoulders of Giants,’ so Newton himself is one of the giants upon whose shoulders we now stand as we reach for the stars. The great mathematician once wrote: ‘I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.’ I believe we have finally moved into the great ocean and we are trying now to understand what surrounds us.
“The making of space history will continue, and this Nation means to play a major role in its making. Next spring, the Sky lab will be put into orbit. It will be aimed not at advancing exploration of deep space, but at gaining in space new knowledge for the improvement of life here on earth. It will help develop new methods of learning about the earth’s environment and the earth’s resources, and new methods of evaluating programs aimed at preserving and enhancing the resources of all the world. It will seek new knowledge about our own star, the sun, and about its tremendous influence on our environment. Scientists aboard the Skylab will perform medical experiments aimed at a better knowledge of man’s own physiology. Also, they will perform experiments aimed at developing new industrial processes utilizing the unique capabilities found in space. Skylab will be our first manned space station. It will be in use for the better part of a year, permitting the economy of extended usage, and laying the groundwork for further space stations.
“Economy in space will be further served by the Space Shuttle .... It will enable us to ferry space research hardware into orbit without requiring the full expenditure of a launch vehicle as is necessary today. It will permit us to place that hardware in space accurately, and to serve or retrieve it when necessary instead of simply writing it off in the event it malfunctions or fails. In addition, the Shuttle will provide such routine access to space that for the first time personnel other than trained astronauts will be able to participate and contribute in space as will nations once excluded for economic reasons.
“The near future will see joint space efforts by this Nation and the Soviet Union in an affirmation of our common belief that the hopes and the needs that unite our people and all people are of greater consequence than the differences in philosophy that divide us.
“Finally, we will continue to draw knowledge from the universe through the use of unmanned satellites and probes.
“We cannot help but pause today and remember and pay homage to those many men and women—including those who made the ultimate sacrifice—whose hopes, whose energies, skill, and courage enabled the first man to reach the moon and who now have seen with us perhaps the last men in this century leave the moon. But the more we look back the more we are reminded that our thrust has been forward and

that our place is among the heavens where our dreams precede us, and where, in time, we shall surely follow.
“Though our ancestors would have called the deeds of Apollo miraculous, we do not see our age as an age of miracles. Rather, we deal in facts, we deal in scientific realities, we deal in industrial capacity, and technological expertise, and in the belief that men can do whatever they turn their hands to. For all this, however, can we look at the record of 24 men sent to circle the moon or to stand upon it, and 24 men returned to earth alive and well, and not see God’s hand in it?
“Perhaps, in spite of ourselves, we do still live in an Age of Miracles. So if there is self-congratulation, let it be tempered with awe, and our pride with prayer, and as we enter this special time of spiritual significance, let us reserve a moment to wonder at what human beings have done in space and to be grateful.” {PD, 12/25/72, 1788-9)

Less than four years ago men had never been even in the vicinity of the moon. Now about two dozen men have orbited the satellite, and a dozen have walked and ridden on its surface. Hundreds of pounds of lunar rock and soil are now ... on earth, available for study, while instruments planted on the moon give daily reports of lunar conditions, and will do so for years. The moon is now a distant but accessible outpost of earth, better known now than the North Pole was before Admiral [Robert E.] Peary discovered it in 1909. Project Apollo may be ended, but man’s interest in the moon is still very much alive.” (NYT, 12/20/72, 42)

“But within that overall engineering program, we knew we would be exploring, we knew we would open up new vistas and for that reason we developed the experiments to be taken along on later flights.” There had been “only one reason for flying Apollo after the first landing and that was to gather information for science, to continue the exploration of the Moon.” Underlying drive of Apollo “—to reach into space, to seize these new challenges, to learn more about the moon and also about earth, to explore for new opportunities for man to use in his future development—is not well understood by the public.”

six moons, had minimum temperature of 205 K (—90°F), same as atmosphere in which life originated on earth 2 billion yrs ago, was discussed by Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Carl E. Sagan in interview published by Washington Post. Discovery had been made by Cornell Univ. and Univ. of Minnesota astronomers using infrared measurements. Titan was about 1.5 billion km (900 million mi) from sun and received only one percent of sunlight that earth received. “We have to ask ourselves what kind of a planet would make this atmosphere so far from sun. The only answer we have been able to come up with is something identical to our primeval earth. Possible life form on Titan would not be earthlike, “but it would be earth chauvinism to think that no form of life whatever could survive so far off in the solar system.” Dr. Sagan believed Titan was made up of chemical ice, except for small molten core of radioactive rock. Core melted ice far below surface, forcing volcanic ice to surface, where it burst into brilliant red on contact with sun’s ultraviolet light. “We see Titan as a red disc through the telescopes, which is exactly what we get in the laboratory when we react methane, hydrogen, water ice, and ammonia with ultraviolet rays.” (O’Toole, W Post, 12/24/72, Al)

Summary
During 1972: U.S. orbited 39 spacecraft in 30 launches—including Apollo 16’s 4 payloads and Apollo 17’s 3. U.S.S.R. orbited 89 payloads in 74 launches. Italy launched one satellite for NASA on NASA booster. And Japan launched one spacecraft on its own booster. U.S. total included 16 payloads orbited by Dept, of Defense in 13 launches and 23 by NASA in 17 straight flawless launches—NASA’s first perfect annual launch record.
nasa’s Apollo program came to successful conclusion with Apollo 17, most productive of all NASA lunar landing missions and most scientifically rewarding. Apollo 17, sixth successful manned landing mission, set records for longest manned lunar landing flight (301 hrs 51 min), largest lunar sample return (115 kg; 250 lbs), longest total extravehicular activity time (22 hrs 5 min), and longest time in lunar orbit (147 hrs 48 min). Earlier in year Apollo 16 also produced valuable data from surface and lunar orbit investigations.
Unmanned NASA program was highlighted by Pioneer 10, first spacecraft to fly beyond Mars orbit, first to penetrate Asteroid Belt, first intended to look at Jupiter close up, and first destined to escape solar system. At year’s end Pioneer 10 had passed safely through three fourths of Asteroid Belt. Mariner 9, launched in 1971, had circled Mars 698 times, photographing Martian moons and completely mapping planet’s surface before Oct. 27, 1972, shutdown. Findings revised previous concepts of Mars, showing planet to be geologically active, with volcanic mountains higher than any mountain on earth, with a crevasse three to four times deeper than Grand Canyon, and with indications that free-flowing water might once have existed on Mars. Erts 1, first Earth Resources Technology Satellite, laid groundwork for glohal inventory of earth’s resources and environment. Copernicus (Oao 3) Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, with largest telescope placed in space, set new standards of pointing accuracy and opened new channels of information on far reaches of universe. Nimbus 5 meteorological satellite demonstrated new techniques for daytime and nighttime temperature readings through clouds at all levels in atmosphere.
Other unmanned missions included Explorer 47 (imp) to study earth-sun interactions from orbit halfway to moon, Explorer 48 (sas; launched for NASA by Italy) to survey gamma ray sources, Noaa 2 weather satellite for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Triad 01—IX Transit satellite for Navy. Two dozen spacecraft orbited in earlier years continued to return data on solar system and universe beyond.
All components of Skylab manned orhital research satellite were assembled at Kennedy Space Center for 1973 launch. Three flight crews and two backup crews began training. Final space shuttle design was selected and prime contract for shuttle orhiter development was awarded, as well as main engine contract. Contractors had progressed

well into system definition, design, and early development. Kennedy Space Center and Vandenberg Air Force Base were selected as shuttle launch and landing sites.
M2-F3 lifting body completed 27th and last scheduled flight in joint NASA and Air Force program begun July 12, 1966. During 14 lifting-body flights in 1972, maximum speed of 1718 km per hr (1066 mph) and maximum altitude of 21 800 m (17 500 ft) were attained.
In aeronautics, Flight Research Center celebrated 25th anniversary of its creation in 1947 as Muroc Flight Test Unit of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical wing was flown in configuration planned for future flights. Digital fly-by-wire computerized control system was demonstrated in series of flights from frc. System, for potential use in space shuttle, enhanced aircraft handling and reduced pilot workload. NASA awarded contract to refine design of quiet, jet, propulsive-lift, experimental aircraft QUESTOL in major effort to develop technology for short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft to relieve airport congestion. Progress was made in quiet jet engine, techniques to reduce aircraft emissions, composite materials, avionics, aerodynamics including supercritical and antisymmetrical wings, general-aviation safety, supersonic and hypersonic research, and research in basic materials and structures.
In sounding rocket program, more than 80 successful flights were made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations; to make astronomical observations in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions of electromagnetic spectrum; for special projects; and for support. NASA flew 61 balloon flights in its program to study near-earth phenomena, including balloon that lifted 545 kg (1200 lbs) of scientific equipment to 45 000-m (148 000-ft) altitude.
U.S.S.R. launches decreased from record 83 in 1971 to 74. The 89 payloads included 72 Cosmos satellites, 3 Intercosmos, 1 Luna, 3 Meteor, 2 Prognoz, 3 Molniya I, 3 Molniya II, 1 Venus, and secondary payload Sret 1 (launched for France).
Japan launched Denpa Radio Explorer Satellite. (NASA Releases 73—48 and unnumbered of 12/27/72; NASA Lifting Body Off; gsfc Sounding Rocket Br.; gsfc SSR, 11/31/72; 12/31/72; A&A 1972; Myers testimony, 2/27/73)
• President Nixon’s January decision to proceed with development of reusable space shuttle keyed transition in U.S. space program from space exploration to space exploitation for practical and immediate benefits to mankind. While budget restrictions and national emphasis of technology applications to improve conditions on earth brought early end to Apollo program, U.S.-U.S.S.R. space agreement opened new era of international space cooperation. Agreement inspired intensive planning for 1975 joint rendezvous and docking mission of Soviet Salyut and U.S. Apollo spacecraft in orbit.
Apollo program—major drive of U.S. space program since 1961, triumphantly concluded in 1972—had begun to give clear picture of moon, how it had evolved and its relationship to sun and earth, and would contribute to understanding of how earth had evolved. Apollo program had also given man new awareness of earth and had given Americans self-confidence in ability to achieve gigantic goal.

During 1972: Conclusion of the Apollo program was commemorated by Scott Long’s cartoon, published in the Minneapolis Tribune Dec, 6, The maimed lunar explorations had given man a new awareness of the earth and the need to preserve it, as well as a wealth of information on the moon and possible origins of the earth and solar system.
New space program for 1970s was designed to be funded at constant budget level over several years—yet to maintain space flight capability, contribute to national security, increase opportunities for new scientific knowledge, encourage international cooperation, address problems of

society and environment, and continue U.S. leadership in aeronautics. Reusable shuttle was expected to give “routine access to space” by cutting complexity and cost of launches and multiplying uses of satellites. It could be used for both manned and unmanned missions and, in military use, could serve national security.
Revision of NASA FY 1972 program to phase in new programs while holding expenditures to $3.4-billion budget level required basic changes in planning. Further stretch-out of period over which NASA long-term objectives in space and science could be achieved was necessary. Shuttle configuration costs were pared to about half of original cost estimate; plans for Grand Tour missions to explore all five outer planets in late 1970s were cut back to focus on Jupiter and Saturn with less expensive spacecraft; and NASA and Atomic Energy Commission’s nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program was terminated. Emphasis on aeronautics was increased at urging of congressional committees, but $44.9 million of $50.5-million NASA FY 1973 appropriation for aircraft noise suppression program, engine retrofit studies, and quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) aircraft program was impounded by Office of Management and Budget. Tight NASA funding and end of Apollo program brought reductions in personnel, especially at manned space-flight Centers. NASA total in-house personnel decreased by 1181 from Dec. 31, 1971, to 27 801 persons Dec. 31, 1972, with further cuts scheduled for 1973. Marshall Space Flight Center employment was reduced by 258, to 5501 persons; Manned Space Center 159, to 3882; and Kennedy Space Center 123, to 2518.
Employment in aerospace industry throughout the Nation also declined slightly, from 924 000 workers at end of 1971 to 917 000 at end of 1972, despite infusion of space shuttle program. Aerospace industry remained largest manufacturing employer, however, and industry sales increased for first time since 1968.
To emphasize transition from Apollo to Skylab and shuttle activities, NASA established new Mission and Payload Integration Office within Office of Manned Space Flight. Space Station Task Force became Sortie Lab Task Force. Apollo Program Office became Apollo/ASTP Office to prepare for 1975 U.S.—Soviet mission. Office of Advanced Research and Technology (oart) was renamed Office of Aeronautical and Space Technology (oast) to emphasize increasing NASA aeronautical activity. Office of Applications had been separated from Office of Space Science at end of 1971 to increase emphasis on use of space technology for benefits on earth. Charles W. Mathews, Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight since 1968, headed new Office of Applications.
Dr. Wernher von Braun retired as NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning to become Corporate Vice President for Engineering and Development at Fairchild Industries, Inc., after more than quarter of century as leader of space rocket development in the U.S. His NASA career had begun in 1960 when his Army Ballistic Missile Agency team—which had launched first U.S. satellite, Explorer I in 1958—was transferred to form nucleus of Marshall Space Flight Center. Dr. von Braun had served as MSFC Director from 1960 to 1970, where

Saturn V launch vehicle for Apollo moon missions was his major engineering achievement.
In technology utilization, NASA continued to distribute information about aerospace technology to private and public sectors of national economy at ever-increasing rate. NASA-developed technology was being used in medicine, nondestructive testing, and engineering design. NASTRAN computer program to analyze structures under stress was used by more than 70 industrial firms, universities, laboratories, and government agencies to solve structural engineering problems.
Technology and interpretive systems developed by NASA in cooperation with other agencies prepared way for worldwide environmental pollution and monitoring network.
NASA FY 1973 appropriation of $3,408 billion was equivalent to budget request and $110 million above FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion. Increase reflected funds for design and development of space shuttle. (A&A 1972; Fletcher testimony, 2/28/73; aia Aerospace, 3/73; NASA Pocket Statistics, 3/72, 1/73)
• In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched European Space Research Organization’s Heos 2 to study interplanetary space and magnetosphere, Esro 4 to investigate solar ionosphere, and TD—1A astronomical observatory satellite, that carried seven experiments from six European universities and research organizations. NASA also launched Anik 1 (Telesat A) domestic communications satellite for Telesat Canada, Aeros scientific satellite in joint U.S.-West German project, and Oscar 6 (developed by U.S., German, and Australian radio amateurs) for Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.—in addition to two International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium comsats. Italian crew trained by NASA launched NASA’s Explorer 48 Small Scientific Satellite from Italian platform off coast of Kenya.
May 24 agreement signed in Moscow by President Nixon and Soviet Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin on cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space included Apollo Soyuz Test Project in which Apollo spacecraft would rendezvous and dock with Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in earth orbit. Mission was scheduled for July 1975 and meetings in U.S. and U.S.S.R. advanced project to point of testing models of spacecraft finking device. U.S. and U.S.S.R. exchanged data from 1971 Mariner 9 and Mars 2 and 3 probes of planet Mars.
After series of meetings in U.S. and abroad, esro decided to develop sortie laboratory to fly with NASA’s space shuttle in 1980s.
President Nixon announced new policy making U.S. launch assistance available to interested countries and international organizations for satellites intended for peaceful purposes.
Third Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute in January was attended by more than 600 researchers from U.S. and 17 foreign countries. Participating Soviet scientists consulted with U.S. scientists, examined lunar samples, and helped select Apollo 14 samples to return to U.S.S.R. as part of U.S.-U.S.S.R. exchange agreement. Apollo 15 lunar soil samples were exchanged for soil samples collected by U.S.S.R.’s Luna 20. Apollo 16 materials were distributed to scientists in 15 foreign countries, and Apollo 17 samples also would be distributed to other nations for analysis and display.

•	Aerospace industry sales increased for first time since 1968. Sales for
1972 were $23.5 billion, up 5.9% over 1971. Commercial aerospace sales increased 11.6%, to reach estimated $4.8 billion. Increase reflected increase in deliveries of helicopters and general-aviation aircraft. Major aerospace sales included $13.8 billion to Dept, of Defense, up from $12.6 billion to DOD in 1971; missile sales to DOD at $5.2 billion, up from $4.7 billion; and military aircraft sales at $8.1 hillion, up from $7.4 billion.
Space sales continued to decline in 1972, to $3.0 billion from $3.2 billion in 1971. Utility and executive aircraft sales increased from $321 million in 1971 to $500 million—up 55.8%. Units delivered increased 23.2%. Civilian helicopter sales increased from $69 million in 1971 to $95 million in 1972, gain of 37.7%
Aerospace exports declined for first time since 1964—from $4.2 billion in 1971 to $3.9 billion, 6.6% decrease. Major reason for decline was drop in military aerospace exports—down 23.8% from $1.1 billion in 1971 to $854 million in 1972. Aerospace imports in 1972 were valued at $500 million, increase of 34.0% from $373 million in 1971. Aerospace industry profits were expected to increase from 1.8% in 1971 to 2.2%.

•	At least 1944 persons died in civilian aircraft accidents involving air-
craft weighing more than 5700 kg (12 500 lbs). World accident rate in terms of facilities per 100 000 flight-hours was 0.126, up from 0.094 in 1971 and highest rate since 1969’s 0.134. Number of actual deaths in U.S. airline accidents dropped from 203 in 1971 to 190 in 1972.
(Interavia, 3/73, 201)
•	NASA published Physics of the Space Environment (NASA SP-305).
Series of lectures, presented originally in colloquia at Univ. of Alabama 1970-1971, had been sponsored by Marshall Space Flight Center’s Aero-Astrodynamics Laboratory. Major topics covered were dynamics and transient state of upper atmosphere, chemical composition of upper atmosphere, and solar flare forecasting. Flare forecasting “fiasco” was described by Frederick W. Ward, Jr., Air Force Cambridge Laboratories physicist: Forecasters dreamed of discovering cause, energy source, and antecedent conditions for solar flares. “This ‘tunnel vision’ has had a profound and deleterious effect on the state-of-the-art. It has diverted attention from many promising approaches and relegated them to limbo. More importantly, it has actually inhibited the scientific search for the underlying physical mechanisms.” Examples of neglected aspects ranged from observing techniques and equipment to availability and accuracy of archived data. Inspection of available data “leads to an obvious conclusion: there are at least two suns up there.” (Text)
•	Federal Aviation Administration completed installation of automated
flight-data processing system in all 20 of its contiguous air route traffic control centers, rendered 34 automated radar terminal systems (arts hi) operational, and installed 53 instrument landing systems, (dot Release 99-S-72)
•	U.S. helicopter manufacturers exported record total of 259 rotary-wing
aircraft valued at $73 673 000. Shipment was 17% increase in dollar value and 6% increase over the 244 helicopters valued at $62 853 000 shipped in 1971. (aiaa Release 72-2)
•	Kennedy Space Center minority and female employees increased steadily.
During first 18 mos of ksc Equal Employment Opportunity—from April 1971 through September 1972—contractor employees increased by 249, to 11 382. Female employment increased by 128 persons, to 1240, an 11.5% increase. Minority personnel members increased from 609 to 847, 39.1%. During third quarter 1972, ksc contract personnel increased by 162 and minority employees increased by 70 to peak 7.44% of ksc contractor work force. Minority population in Brevard County, based on 1970 census, was 9.4%. (ksc Release 348-72)
•	Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum completed first
year under new Director, former astronaut Michael Collins. Major emphasis was on preparation for new museum to be opened in U.S. Bicentennial year, 1976. Domed planetarium chamber 9 m (30 ft) high was being constructed as laboratory for experimentation and design of programs and equipment for Spacearium in new museum. Museum library was being reorganized to standards of other Smithsonian Institution libraries.
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sao) progress and plans were being assessed against standards recommended by Astronomy

• Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne had record 608 000 visitors— increase of about one third over 1971. Museum was considered most active museum in Switzerland and Europe’s most popular transport museum. Planetarium rated second to New York’s American Museum-Hayden Planetarium in number of annual visitors. Swiss Transport Museum’s Air and Space Wing was dedicated July 1. Dedication ceremonies were attended by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator; Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A Armstrong; and Mercury Astronaut John H. Glenn. During year, James E. Webb, former NASA Administrator, officially presented model of Goddard Space Flight Center’s computer facility to Museum. (Dir Swiss Trans Museum letter to nasa Hist Off, 2/19/72; A&A 1972)

Appendix A
SATELLITES, SPACE PROBES, AND MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS
A CHRONICLE FOR 1972
The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress. Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite Situation Report compiled by the Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center; and public information releases of the Department of Defense, NASA, noaa, and other agencies, as well as those of the Communications Satellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, translations from the Tass News Agency, statements in the Soviet press, and international news services reports. Data on satellites of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, governmental announcements, and international news services reports.
This tabulation lists payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as probes, ascended to at least the 6500-kilometer (4000-mile) altitude that traditionally has distinguished probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or (c) conveyed one or more human beings into space, whether orbit was attained or not. Furthermore, only flights that have succeeded—or at least can be shown by tracking data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe or manned flight—are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. An asterisk by the date marks dates that are one day earlier in this tabulation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean Time. A double asterisk by the date marks dates of Soviet launches which are a day later in this compilation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean Time.
World space activity decreased for the first time in three years. There was a decrease in the total successful launches—106 against 120 in 1971, the lowest since 1964—and a sharp drop in total payloads orbited—126 against 151 in 1971. The difference between launches and payloads is of course accounted for by the multiple-payload launches (dod, the principal user of this system in the past, made 3 multiple launches in 1972, orbiting 6 payloads; NASA made only 1 multiple launch, with 2 payloads; the U.S.S.R. made 3 multiple launches, orbiting 18 payloads).
Of the 1972 world total, the United States launched 30 boosters carrying 35 payloads (counting the Apollo 16 and 17 payloads as 1 for each mission). In 1971 29 U.S. boosters launched 47 payloads. Although the U.S. 1972 launch total increased by 1, its payload total was the lowest since 1961. Of these 1972 totals, dod was responsible for 13 launches and 16
457
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972
payloads. Of NASA’s 17 launches, 8 were non-NASA missions—Intelsat-IV F—4 and Intelsat-IV F—5 for ComSatCorp, Heos 2, TD—1A, and Esro 4 for ESRO, Anik 1 for Canada, Aeros for West Germany, and Triad 01—IX for the U.S. Navy. The Soviet Union once again more than doubled United States space totals, launching 89 payloads with 74 launches. It had launched 97 payloads with a record 83 launches in 1971.
The year was very successful for both manned and unmanned activity. The U.S. completed its Apollo program of manned lunar exploration with two immensely successful flights. Apollo 16 explored the moon’s Descartes region and returned with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples. Apollo 17, the sixth and last manned lunar landing, was the most productive and most scientifically rewarding. Among its many records, this longest of manned lunar landing flights spent the longest time in lunar orbit, conducted the longest total eva on the moon, and returned with the largest sample of lunar material (115 kg; 250 lbs). Pioneer 10, launched early in the year, successfully streaked through the Asteroid Belt toward its December 1973 Jupiter flyby objective and would eventually become the first spacecraft to escape the solar system. NASA also launched Erts 1, the first of a series of experimental satellites to monitor the earth’s resources and environment; Oao 3, the largest telescope ever placed in space; Nimbus 5, a more sophisticated experimental meteorological satellite; and Anik 1 for Canada, which became the world’s first operational domestic communications satellite system.
The Soviet Union scored a major interplanetary success with the soft-landing on Venus of a capsule from Venus 8, which conducted the first soil analysis of another planet. Luna 20 continued a series of unmanned Soviet lunar accomplishments with its successful lunar landing and retrieval of lunar soil. The U.S.S.R., in a typically active year, also orbited six communications satellites, including an improved second-generation series, and three Meteor weather satellites.
Also during 1972, Japan launched its fourth satellite, the second one to carry scientific instruments. Italy launched the U.S.-built Explorer 48 on a NASA vehicle from its launch facility off the coast of Kenya. And the Soviet Union launched a French-built scientific satellite, Sret 1, as a secondary payload. It was the first of three planned launches in a cooperative French-Soviet program.
As we have cautioned in previous years, the “Remarks” column of these appendixes is never complete, because of the inescapable lag behind each flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.

Appendix B
CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1972
This chronology of major NASA launches in 1972 is intended to provide an accurate and ready historical reference, compiling and verifying information previously scattered in several sources. It includes launches of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA or under “NASA direction” (e.g., in 1972 NASA provided vehicles and launch facilities and launched the Communications Satellite Corporation’s two Intelsat IV satellites and the European Space Research Organization’s Heos 2, TD—1A, and Esro 4, as well as Anik 1 for Canada, Aeros for West Germany, Triad 01—IX for the U.S. Navy, and Noaa 2 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; also, under a NASA and University of Rome agreement, an Italian team launched a NASA satellite, Explorer 48, from Italy’s San Marco platform off the coast of Kenya, on nasa’s Scout booster). During 1972, NASA achieved its first perfect annual record, experiencing no launch or mission failures.
An attempt has been made to classify performance of both the launch vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle performance and mission results—successful (S), partially successful (P), and unsuccessful (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been added for payloads when vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary; many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact that a great deal is learned from missions that may have been classified as unsuccessful.
Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Open sources were used, verified when in doubt with the project offices in NASA Headquarters and with NASA Centers. For further information on each item, see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as referenced in the index. The information was compiled in May 1973 by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress.

Appendix C
CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1972
This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights during 1972 and—taken with Appendix C to the 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971 volumes of this publication—provides a summary record of manned exploration of the space environment through 1972. The information was complied by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress.
Compared with 1971, 1972 saw a halving of manned space flight, mainly attributable to U.S.S.R. inactivity. While two U.S. Apollo and two U.S.S.R. Soyuz flights placed a total of 12 men in space during 1971, 1972 saw two Apollo flights and no Soyuz mission, for a total of 6 men in space.
Apollo 16, launched in April, continued to improve and to extend U.S. manned lunar capability by spending more than 20 hours exploring the moon’s surface and returning with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples. The Apollo program was brought to a highly successful conclusion with the near-perfect December flight of Apollo 17. Breaking nearly all previous manned lunar exploration records, the Apollo 17 mission was the longest and most productive. The two-man crew spent some 22 hours exploring the moon’s surface and returned with 115 kg (250 lbs) of lunar material. With this sixth and last manned lunar landing, 12 men had walked on the moon and spent nearly 12% days on its surface. They had returned a total of about 380 kg (841 lbs) of lunar rocks and soil to earth for future study.
The Soviet Union made no manned flight attempts during 1972, apparently still recovering from the tragic June 1971 flight of Soyuz 11 that resulted in the death of its three-man crew.
By the end of 1972, the United States had conducted a total of 27 manned space flights—2 suborbital, 16 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and 6 lunar landings—with a total of 34 different crewmen. Of the 34 American astronauts, 9 had participated in two flights each, 5 had flown three times, and 2 had flown four times. The Soviet Union had made 18 manned flights, all in earth orbit, with 25 cosmonauts. Three had participated in two flights each and two had flown three times. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft hours in flight had reached 3526 hours 27 minutes for the United States and remained at 2097 hours 16 minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumulative total man-hours in space were 9499 hours 30 minutes for the United States and remained 4403 hours 12 minutes for the U.S.S.R.
Data on U.S. flights are the latest available to date within NASA, although minor details are subject to modification as data are refined.
