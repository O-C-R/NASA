The United States and Russia began taking practical steps toward merging their manned space programs.  NASA expected to begin shuttle flights to the Mir Space Station as a step in a joint venture to build a space station. The agreement called for seven flights through 1997 in which U. S. space shuttles would dock with Mir and allow the exchange of crews. One shuttle mission in 1995 would supply solar arrays that would combine U.S. advanced photovoltaic technology with Russia's expertise in space structures and mechanisms in order to boost Mir's electrical output by six kilowatts.

Scientists at the University of Chicago advanced a new theory explaining the "mass extinctions" of living species that have occurred on Earth, the most famous being that of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.  They theorized that supernovas burned off the Earth's ozone layer and caused the sun's rays to flood the surface with deadly radiation.  The theory borrows from work done on the effect of ozone depletion in Antarctica.  Scientists estimate that five mass extinctions have occurred on Earth, one every 120 million years.

NASA selected the IBM Thinkpad 755C as the Space Shuttle's new standard portable computer. It will supplement the Shuttle's computing capability and manage in-orbit activities.  Sixty computers were purchased at $400,000. Pending completion on testing, they will be used on all Shuttle missions starting with Mission 63 next March. (AvWk, Jan 3/95)
NASA reported that three years of data collection from its Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) confirmed that Clorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause ozone loss.  The satellite detected CFCs and hydrogen fluoride, a product of the chemical breakdown of CFCs, in the stratosphere. (AvWk, Jan 2/95; The Grand Rapids Press, Jan 2/95)A General Accounting Office report called NASA's plans to expand and fund the scientific research needed to support a manned space facility unrealistic.

An air-safety computer system developed by NASA at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1985 had yet to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The Takeoff Performance Monitor was designed to help pilots handle takeoff mishaps more quickly and safely, but airlines, manufacturers, and Federal Aviation Administration officials said the cost and liability burdens outweighed the benefits. Troublesome takeoffs occur less than 1 percent of the time but account for 10 percent of all serious airplane accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. (CSM, Jan 6/95)

NASA scientists expressed concern about space trash from spent satellites and burned out rocket boosters that pose a hazard to functioning satellites and space shuttles. Instead of attempting to collect such debris, NASA has been concentrating on preventing its further buildup by programming satellites and boosters to spiral into the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly. In the future, however, NASA may take a closer look at the possibility of retrieving space debris. At that point, the research of Kumar Ramohalli, formerly of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was attempting to develop a debris retrieving satellite, should be useful. (CSM, Jan 9/95)
Two new images taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope provided details of the results of two violent cosmic events.  One image shows a single star, actually a planetary nebula in the constellation Draco, which blew off its outer shell 1,000 years ago and is in the last stages of its life. The other shows the result of a rare and spectacular head-on collision between two galaxies located 500 million light-years away in Sculptor. (NASA Release N95-1; B Sun, Jan 12/95)

A team of national geologists working with NASA scientists dropped a 700-pound weight on a jumbled mound of rock in Canyonlands National Park in Utah in an attempt to determine whether Upheaval Dome is a badly eroded salt dome or the remnants of a 5-mile-diameter meteorite impact crater. Earlier studies of shattered rocks and quartz crystals had already convinced many researchers that an asteroid or comet fragment slammed into southeast Utah sometime between five and 100 million years ago. Impact craters such as Upheaval dome are common in the solar system, so the geologists were attempting to learn how such craters form. (Salt Lake City Tribune, Jan 10/95)
Supercomputers helped scientists from the University of Arizona and the Los Alamos National Laboratory to understand the hidden mechanism by which massive stars explode. Computer simulations show that stellar explosions (supernovas) erupt unevenly from the collapsed stellar core. The trigger appears to be the energy of neutrinos, particles that have near zero mass and zero electrical charge. (W Post, Jan 10/95, LA Times, Jan 10/95)
A senior scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, Kenneth M. Towe, refuted a recent satellite-based NASA claim that the presence of hydrogen fluoride in the atmosphere confirms that ozone depletion is largely caused by clorofluorocarbons. Towe pointed out that, contrary to NASA's contention, hydrogen fluoride does have a natural source--it is emitted by volcanoes--and it plays a large role in the destruction of ozone in the lower stratosphere. Towe's position received corroboration from another authority, Michael S. Coffman, president of Environmental Perspectives, Inc., in Bangor, Maine.

Astronomers detected a gigantic mass, equivalent to 40 million Suns, in a distant galaxy that they believe to be a black hole. The discovery, announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, was made by a team of American and Japanese scientists using a computer-linked system of 10 radio telescope dishes stretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii known as the Very Long Baseline Array. Since black holes, by definition, emit no visible light or other radiation, astronomers infer their presence by their strong gravitational pull on surrounding stars.  The discovery was made by observing the rotation of a disk of gas and dust surrounding a galactic nucleus.

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope to study quasars began to reassess their theories after studying a series of quasars during the past few months. The astronomers expected the quasars, thought to be super-massive "black holes," to be surrounded by galaxies that "feed" the quasar. Instead, none of the first eight quasars they studied was surrounded by a galaxy, raising questions about of how black holes form and sustain themselves. "I really don't understand this," said project astronomer John Bahcall in a report to the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona. (LA Times, Jan 13/95; W Post, Jan 13/95)
Atmospheric scientists presented some 40 papers or abstracts at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Tucson, Arizona, on the topic of newly-discovered discharges of lightning in Earth's upper atmosphere. The upper-atmospheric lightning materializes above thunderheads and shoots upward, not downward, in bolts and flickers that soar as high as 60 miles above the surface of the Earth. Satellites have detected gamma ray bursts emanating from thunderheads, whereas red flashes have been linked to powerful burst of radio waves. NASA planned to fly a jet loaded with cameras and instruments across the thunderstorm belt of South America in February to begin serious study of upper atmospheric lightning.

NASA invited bids from the nation's aerospace companies to develop two reusable rocket designs under a novel strategy that called for the industry to pay much of the cost. The goal was to enhance the competitive footing of U. S. companies in the lucrative global commercial launch market while lowering the amount spent annually by the federal government on space transportation.
NASA requested proposals for two vehicles, X-33 and X-34, to prove the concept of single-stage to orbit. The X-33 would be a technology demonstrator vehicle and the X-34 would be a reusable, or partially-reusable, booster for placing small payloads into a low Earth orbit. Significant cost-sharing by industry was anticipated. (NASA Releases 95-1, 23, 38 & 40)

A Russian space enthusiast, Sergei Leskov, lamented the declining state of the Russian space program in the January 19 issue of "Izvestia." Production of rockets and other hardware has declined in the last few years, Leskov said, and even the hardware in orbit was on its last legs. The Mir space station, too, had grown old and increasingly gave mission controllers nasty surprises. He noted that during the past five years, funding of the space sector had been cut five-to-ten-fold in certain areas. The contract with the United States for construction of the Alpha space station had been the salvation of the Russian space sector, but only a small range of enterprises were involved in it, and the project did not promote development of new technologies. Without an infusion of more money, Leskov wrote, the Russian space sector could find itself as much a part of history as the Pyramid of Cheops. (BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, Jan 23/95).

In experiments aimed at answering one of the most intriguing questions in particle physics and cosmology, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico produced especially strong evidence that elusive particles called neutrinos do indeed have mass. If proven, the finding means that neutrinos could constitute a major component of the mysterious invisible matter, the long-sought missing mass, that cosmologists think fills and shapes the universe and could dictate its fate. Finding a mass for the ubiquitous neutrino would help toward completing an inventory of the missing matter, a tally that will determine whether the universe will fly apart, fall in on itself, or settle on a middle path. D. Hywel White, leader of the research team, said that the most likely explanation for the observed behavior of neutrinos produced by a proton accelerator was that these particles have some as yet undetermined amount of mass.

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) found an oxygen atmosphere on Jupiter�s second moon, Europa. This detection was made by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, both in Baltimore. They used data provided by HST�s Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) instrument from observations taken on June 2, 1994. Europa�s atmosphere is only one hundred billionth that of Earth. Europa, about the size of Earth�s moon, has an unusually smooth surface of solid water ice. The oxygen on Europa, whose surface temperature is -230 degrees Fahrenheit, is formed from purely non-biological processes. Water vapor and the gases oxygen and hydrogen are formed by the combination of sunlight and the bombardment of the dust and charged particles trapped in Jupiter�s intense magnetic field.

Radioactive debris leaking from a large group of orbiting Russian nuclear reactors make up the puzzling clouds of junk orbiting Earth. This is the conclusion of a team of scientific sleuths who have been sifting clues for five years. The clouds, which seem destined to grow, are threatening to wreak havoc in the most crowded orbit in the heavens, roughly 600 miles up. In all, 33 nuclear-powered radar satellites that spied on the movements of Western warships were launched into orbits about 150 miles above the Earth. Afterward, as a safety precaution, Moscow boosted the old reactors into parking orbits roughly 600 miles up. Published designs of the Russian space reactors show they were filled with sodium-potassium coolant. Liquid droplets moving at kilometers a second are just as dangerous to a spacecraft as a solid object. While the drops pose no radioactive health danger to humans, they will force engineers to add more shielding to help protect new spacecraft. (NY Times, Feb 26/95)

Astronomers using NASA�s Astro-2 observatory announced the definitive detection of one of the two original building blocks of the universe-the element helium created in the Big Bang explosion. The evidence was found using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), one of three ultraviolet instruments on the Astro-2 observatory which was operated in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its 17-day mission in March. Johns Hopkins University astronomers were able to detect the helium in the light from a distant quasar called HS1700+64, about 10 billion light years away. The astronomers were essentially looking at the universe when it was a quarter of its present age.
The Hubble Space Telescope has detected a long-sought population of comets dwelling at the icy fringe of the solar system. Based on the Hubble observations, astronomers estimate the belt contains at least 200 million comets. The existence of a comet belt encircling our solar system-like the rings of Saturn-was first hypothesized more than 40 years ago by astronomer Gerard Kuiper. The theory remained conjecture until 1992 when ground-based telescopes began detecting about 20 large icy bodies ranging from 60 to 200 miles in diameter. Hubble was able to identify objects just a few miles across. This region is thought to be the source of the short-period comets that orbit the Sun in less than 200 years. The planet Pluto is considered by astronomers to be the largest member of the Kuiper Belt region. The comet-disk lies just beyond Neptune and might stretch 500 times farther from the Sun than Earth.

Astronomers have confirmed the existence of a brown dwarf, the object of a 30-year search. Twenty to 50 times the size of Jupiter and too hot to be classified as a planet, GL229B is a small companion to the cool red star Gliese 229 in the constellation Lepus. It is near the theoretical limit (eight percent of the mass of the Sun) where a star has enough mass to sustain nuclear fusion. The brown dwarf was first sighted using the 60-inch observatory on Mt. Palomar. Scientists identified it in October 1994. Follow-up observations were made by Hubble�s Wide Field Planetary Camera-2 on November 17, 1995. Another Hubble observation six months from now will yield an exact distance to GL229B.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) shows that radio galaxies(which existed when the universe was half its present age(are surprisingly varied and intricate structures that are even more complex than previously thought. A team of astronomers at Cambridge University, England, is analyzing 28 radio galaxies that have been imaged by HST in visible light, by the Very Large Array Radio Interferometer, and by the UK Infrared Telescope. They propose that the remarkable structures seen in the Hubble images are different manifestations of activity associated with radio galaxies. The new details may be a combination of light from massive star forming regions, small satellite dwarf galaxies, and bow shocks caused by jets of hot gas blasted out of the galaxy�s core by a suspected black hole. The period of strong radio emissions is quite short relative to the total lifetime of a galaxy. (NASA Release 95-133)

A natural laser in space was detected coming from a young, very hot, luminous star in the constellation Cygnus. The laser was created as intense ultraviolet light from the star excites the densely packed hydrogen atoms in the gaseous, dusty disk surrounding the star. When infrared light shines on the excited hydrogen atoms, it causes the atoms to emit an intense beam of light at exactly the same wavelength, creating the circumstellar laser. This natural laser was detected on NASA�s Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) during missions based on Hawaii. The existence of such natural lasers was predicted more than 15 years ago.

NASA physicists have assembled the first view of the spiral structure of our solar system�s magnetic field. The aerial photo of the interplanetary magnetic field became possible as Ulysses flew over the south pole of the Sun in 1994. The method involved tracking the bright spots of radio waves excited by moving electrons ejected from the Sun at speeds over 62,100 miles per second. Such spots are caused by solar flares or other explosive events on the Sun. The travel of electrons is constrained to the large-scale magnetic field lines, much as cars follow roads. A chart of the received radio emissions shows they follow the expected spiral shape, even including kinks due to variations in solar wind speed. At these high speeds, the whole path takes about 20 minutes to Earth�s orbit. (NASA Release 95-185; W Post, Oct 23/95)

The Hubble Space Telescope has provided pictures of a special type of newborn star emerging from dense, compact pockets of interstellar gas called evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs). Hubble found the EGGs, appropriately enough, in the Eagle nebula which is a star-forming region of the nearby constellation Serpens. Many EGGs are found at the tip of the two largest finger-like features protruding from the nebula�s monstrous columns of cold gas, dubbed �elephant trunks.� Photos of EGGs at different stages of being uncovered provide an unprecedented look at how stars and their surroundings appear before they are truly stars. This process of forming stars from high-speed columns of hydrogen is quite different from the process of stars forming in isolation. The EGGs appear unable to form the disks that go on to become solar systems.

The 15-foot, 9,000 pound docking tunnel came with two new solar arrays, one built in Russia and one provided by NASA, that would be assembled later. The link up, which occurred on November 15, required the pilot, Kenneth Cameron, to aim for a target about three inches in diameter and connect at a speed of less than one-tenth of a mile per hour. The quarter-million-pound spacecraft docked with Mir, of about the same weight, as they sped through space at 17,500 mph. They remained docked for three days. Mission STS-74 ended on November 20, paving the way toward assembly of the International Space Station beginning in November 1997.

An international team of scientists have examined data from the Japanese/U.S. X-ray astronomical satellite �ASCA� which may confirm how cosmic rays achieve speeds near the speed of light. Enrico Fermi suggested a theory in 1949 in which charged particles are bounced between turbulent regions inside the shock front of a supernova explosion. Bouncing much like a ping pong ball between a table and a paddle as the paddle is brought closer to the table, a charged particle gains energies up to 100 trillion electron volts. The tell-tale clue to the discovery was the detection of two oppositely-located regions in the rapidly expanding remnant of the Supernova of 1006 AD. The ASCA satellite contains telescopes for simultaneously taking images and spectra of X-rays, allowing astronomers to distinguish between different types of X-ray emission from nearby regions of the same celestial object. ASCA was launched February 20, 1993. (NASA Release 95-208)

Dr. Daniel S. Goldin, head of the nation�s space agency, has won support in the White House for his philosophy of smaller, better, and less expensive spacecraft. A case in point is the early planning for a Pluto mission. Four years ago, engineers came up with a concept costing as much as $4 billion. After many redesigns they developed a mission, called Pluto Express, at an estimated cost of $400 million. Instead of packing many instruments into a single craft weighing several tons, engineers designed two lightweight craft weighing as little as 300 pounds each. In the proposed mission, the craft would be launched separately, perhaps by Russian Proton rockets, on �fast� trajectories. They should be able to reach Pluto in 6 to 8 years, compared to Voyager 2�s travel time of 12 years to distant Neptune.
