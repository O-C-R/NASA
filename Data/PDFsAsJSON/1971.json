Galaxies previously had been obscured by interstellar dust in Milky Way. Team had begun study after Landau read 1968 report of Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei that two strange objects had been observed on infrared photo Maffei made of region between constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia. Using Mount Palomar and Lick Observatory telescopes and advanced astronomical tools and research techniques, team had located galaxies twice as far from earth as Andromeda, nearest galaxy to Milky Way. Team believed brighter of new galaxies might be larger than either Milky Way or Andromeda and thus possibly largest member of local group of galaxies, measuring 50 000 to 100 000 light years in diameter.

If their existence could be confirmed, it would mean rewriting books on magnetism and electrodynamics. Dr. Price\u2019s group of scientists appeared to have found two fossil tracks of nuclear type of particles which, theoretically, could have been made by monopoles in two lunar cysts. (Lannan, W Star, 1/14/71, A3) Dr. Aleksander P. Vinogradov, Soviet academician and Director of Vernadsky Institute for Analytical Chemistry in Moscow, told conference U.S.S.R. would continue to explore moon with unmanned spacecraft and would attempt bolder missions in future. He believed U.S.S.R. would exchange lunar samples with U.S. beginning with samples of Sea of Fertility returned by Soviet Luna 16. He said main task for Lunokhod 1, Soviet moonwalker still on moon, was to determine how eight-wheeled vehicle could best move about moon and how it could best be used in future. \u201cWe discovered that the moonwalker can move in very large angles and can go down into craters at angles of 20 degrees. The mechanical qualities of this car are very good.\u201d Dr. Vinogradov said Lunokhod 1 carried instrument to analyze soil, but device had not done so thus far. He described Luna l6 samples as bearing no evidence of water or life on moon. Drill used to dig samples had been stopped at 330 mm (13 in) below lunar surface because it hit rock. \u201cWe were afraid to send it any deeper.\u201d Dr. Vinogradov described Sea of Fertility as \u201cblackish powder\u201d sprinkled with \u201ccosmic beads.\u201d Luna 16 sample was similar to soil brought back by Apollo 12 from Ocean of Storms and not very different from samples returned by Apollo 11 from Sea of Tranquility. Age of Sea of Fertility had been calculated at 4.6 billion yrs, older than some rocks returned by Apollo missions. (O\u2019Toole, W Post, 1/15/71, Al) Dr. Paul W. Gast, chief of msc Earth and Lunar Sciences Div., reported discovery by msc scientists of \u201cexotic components\u201d in lunar soil believed to be fragments from primitive crust that covered moon 4.5\tbillion yrs ago. Fragments differed from other Apollo lunar samples and were thought to be pieces of crustal bedrock scattered by impact of meteorites pounding more ancient lunar highlands. Discovery, through chemical analysis, supported theory that moon once had hot, molten surface and that crust had hardened as it began cooling off. Discovery also helped explain why lunar soil was mostly one billion years older than lunar rocks. Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory described norite found in chemical analysis of five soil samples. Norite was lighter in color than most Apollo samples and did not appear to be chemically native to landing sites. Most norite represented \u201cnearsurface material in an ancient lunar crust.\u201d Coarser grained relative of norite might have come from \u201csomewhat deeper in the moon\u2014 perhaps several miles.\u201d If discovery proved true, samples would go back in age to beginnings of solar system. Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg\u2014Cal Tech physicist who had dated Apollo 12 Sample 13, oldest rock yet found, at 4.5 billion yrs (other Apollo 12 rocks were about 3.4 billion yrs old)\u2014said Sample 13\u2019s oldest parts were granite that crystallized early in lunar history and could fie some of original crustal material and some of \u201cmagic component\u201d that accounted for difference in ages of lunar rocks and soil. Dr. Wasserburg believed that fact there was always some missing ingredients in lunar soil meant soil contained debris from granites and other materials originating elsewhere on moon. Dr. Gary V. Latham, Apollo program chief seismic investigator, reported Apollo 12 seismometer was recording weak but frequent moon-quakes along rilles near landing site. He suggested rilles might be \u201cfault zones,\u201d where slight movements in lunar surface were occurring. (Wilford, NYT, 1/17/71, 4:7; Gast, msc)",

Low, Acting NASA Administrator, in luncheon speech before National Space Club in Washington, D.C.: Cooperation with Western nations in past decade had included 70 countries, 250 specific agreements, and more than 24 joint satellite projects at run-out cost in excess of $400 million. More than 50% of total had been funded by other nations. In 1970s, \u201copportunities exist for cooperation on a significantly larger scale.\u201d U.S. wished \u201cto build a foundation for important benefit- and cost-sharing in the major space programs of the future.\u201d Canada, Japan, and Australia\u2014\u201ccountries having the most obvious potential for post-Apollo work-sharing\u201d\u2014had been given \u201cevery chance to become fully acquainted with our plans and studies\u201d to enable them to decide whether they wished to commit their own resources. European Space Conference had put several million dollars into studies of post-Apollo program possibilities and some member countries had invested still larger amounts. British, French, and West German firms were working with NASA prime contractors on space shuttle design studies. Europe would have to choose between significant participation in shuttle funding and funding independent European rocket program. Decision would be necessary \u201ceven if Europe funds only 10 per cent of the shuttle\u2019s price tab.\u201d U.S. had said it would \u201csell launch services for projects consistent with peaceful purposes and existing international agreements . . . [and] that general technical access to the entire program would be available, but that technology at the level of commercial know-how would be transferred in either direction only where one side required it to complete its commitments to the other.\u201d Since Europe was talking of only 10% share of shuttle program, \u201cwe said that we would retain decision-making responsibility except where European costs were directly affected, in which case decisions would be joint.\u201d In U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space, \u201cit is particularly important that we give clear recognition to both . . . competition and cooperation.\u201d U.S. was competing with U.S.S.R. \u201cbecause accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today\u2019s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.\u201d U.S. was cooperating with U.S.S.R. \u201cbecause we both live in a vast universe that must be explored, where important new knowledge is to be gained, for the benefit of all men, everywhere.\u201d While U.S. retained demonstrated lead over U.S.S.R., \u201cit will not be an enduring lead without major new initiatives on our part\u2014 initiatives like the space shuttle and the exploration of the outer planets. . . .\u201d In Jan. 18\u201421 Moscow talks with Soviet Academy of Sciences, \u201cwe specifically agreed, initially, to exchange three grams [0.11 oz] of sample obtained from Luna 16, for three grams each from Apollo 11 and 12. These relatively small amounts are sufficient for detailed scientific examination of a comparative nature.\u201d Additional meetings on compatible docking arrangements had not been held because \u201cdocking discussions are well underway, and the planned exchange of information is taking place.\u201d On visit to Soviet cosmonaut training area at Star City, \u201cwe were welcomed by Cosmonauts Beregovoy, Nikolayev, Leonov, Shatalov, and Valentina Tereshkova.

Low, NASA Acting Administrator, said: \u201cFor the past several years we have reported ... a further decrease in budget authority. This year we can report a clear halt in this trend: the budget authority for FY 1972 is at the same level as the funds appropriated for FY 1971. The exact figure for FY 1972 is $3,271 billion. NASA would complete Apollo program with four previously planned missions but would delay Apollo 17 five months to ensure that mission carried experiments originally scheduled for canceled Apollo 18 and 19. Skylab missions would be delayed about four months, to follow as soon as practical after last Apollo flight. Plans for unmanned planetary exploration included two Mars orbiters in 1971, Jupiter flybys in 1972 and 1973, launch in 1973 for Venus-Mercury flyby in 1974, and two Viking launches in 1975 to land on Mars in 1976. Dr. Low said NASA had asked for $190 million for space shuttle in FY 1972. \u201cWe have included in our budget $100 million. This reduction means essentially that we will move out with the engine development exactly as we had planned; that we are still in a position to make a decision after we have completed the studies on the air frame development, whether to continue with additional design or whether to proceed with the development of the air frames.\u201d Near-earth science programs included Orbiting Solar Observatories in 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1975 and last orbiting Astronomical Observatory in 1972. Space applications program would progress as planned, including two erts, two Nimbus experimental weather satellites, two Synchronous Weather Satellites, and two advanced communications experiments with ATS\u2014F and ATS\u2014G. New FY 1972 projects would include start of work on High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and program for exploration of outer planets. \u201cTo do this we will develop a versatile new spacecraft, and we will plan Grand Tour missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-1977; and to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, in 1979.\u201d NASA also would study mission to orbit Jupiter as alternative to first Grand Tour. Major new initiative in aeronautics in FY 1972 would be development of experimental stol aircraft. Downward trend in aerospace industry employment on NASA programs would be halted during FY 1972. \u201cAlthough aerospace jobs will continue to decline in FY 1971, we expect employment to start increasing by the middle of FY 1972, with the end-of-year level being about equal to that at the beginning of the year.\u201d NASA would reduce civil service work force by 1500 positions by end of FY 1972, bringing total decrease to 6800 since July 1967.

First of its kind, 8-m (25-ft) vessel could remain under water for up to 48 hrs. (AP, W Star, 1/30/71, A9) January 31-February 9: nasa\u2019s Apollo 14 (AS-509) carried three-man crew on successful lunar landing mission. LM-8 Antares landed on moon\u2019s Fra Mauro and two astronauts conducted experiments and explored lunar surface for 9 hrs 24 min before rejoining orbiting CSM\u2014110 and returning safely to earth with lunar samples in CM Kitty Hawk. January 31~February 3: Spacecraft, carrying Astronauts Alan B. Shepard, Jr. (commander), Stuart A. Roosa (cm pilot), and Edgar D. Mitchell (lm pilot), was launched from ksc Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at 4:03 pm est Jan. 31 by Saturn V booster. Launch was 40 min 3 sec later than planned because of high overcast clouds and rain. Delay caused revision of flight azimuth from 72Â° to 75.6Â°. Launch was watched by about 2500 invited guests, including Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, Prince Juan Carlos and Princess Sophia of Spain, and Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Jr. Spacecraft and S\u2014IVB combination entered parking orbit with 188.9-km (117.4-mi) apogee and 183.1-km (113.8-mi) perigee. Midcourse correction (MCC\u20141) modified trajectory so spacecraft arrival time at moon would be same as if launch had been on time. CSM separated from lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:02 get. Onboard TV was initiated to cover CSM docking with LM, but difficulty in docking was encountered. First five docking attempts by cm pilot Roosa were unsuccessful. Mission Control in Houston, watching on TV, studied problem that could prevent extraction of LM and make lunar landing impossible. Alternate missions also were under study. Astronauts noted catches seemed properly cocked but did not release. Sixth try however, was successful; docking was achieved at 4:57 get, 1 hr 54 min later than planned. Separated S-IVB/iu impacted lunar surface at 83:18 get (2:41 am est Feb. 4) at 7Â°49' south latitude and 26Â° west longitude 174 km (108 mi) southeast of planned impact point. Apollo 12 seismometer detected impact and showed vibrations for about 2 hrs. Unscheduled 2-hr 22-min TV transmission from spacecraft was initiated at 10:00 get to troubleshoot probe and drogue of docking mechanism. Crew removed probe and drogue but found no foreign material or abnormal damage. Capture latch assembly was actuated and system performed nominally. Crew and ground were unable to determine why CSM and LM had failed to dock properly, but they found no indication that systems would not work normally again. Officials decided mission would continue as planned [see Feb. 1]. Second midcourse correction, with 10.1-sec sps burn at 30:36 get, increased velocity by 21.7 m per sec (71.1 fps). Following maneuver, crew completed about nine frames of dim-light photography on earth\u2019s dark side and continued to check out systems, get update was performed at 55:40 GET to add the 40 min 3 sec lost by launch delay. MCC\u20143, scheduled for 60:38 get, was not necessary. Third TV transmission, for 42 min beginning at 60:40 get, showed Shepard and Mitchell transferring into LM and checking out LM systems. MCC\u20144, at 77:38 get with 0.6-sec sps burn, changed velocity 1.1 m per sec (3.5 fps). Shepard and Mitchell reentered LM and checked out systems before firing rcs thrusters at 104:28 get to separate CSM and lm. Spurious bit in lm guidance computer was corrected to preclude inadvertent January 31-February 9: Propelled into space by the Saturn V, Apollo 14 carried Astronauts Alan B. Shepard, Jr., Stuart A. Roosa, and Edgar D. Mitchell to the moon on the third .successful United States lunar landing mission. After Feb. 5 touchdown, Shepard and Mitchell explored the Fra Mmtro area for 9 hours 24 minutes in two extravehicular periods before the LM Aniares lifted them off to rejoin Roosa in the orbiting cm Kitty Hawk for the return to earth. Prelaunch activities were monitored by Dr. George M. Low (at left below), Acting nasa Administrator, and Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, in Firing Room 2 at ksc. abort during powered descent, and Shepard controlled descent manually. LM Antares landed on moon\u2019s Fra Mauro at 108:54 get (4:17 am est Feb. 5) on 8Â° slope 9\u201418 m (30-60 ft) short of planned landing point. \u201cWe seem to be sitting in a bowl,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s choppy, undulating. There is a large depression to our right to the north of us, which forms another bowl. And I can see several ridges and rolling hills of perhaps 35 to 40 feet (10 to 12 meters) in height.\u201d First eva began 49 min later than planned because of intermittent plss communications. Shepard started down ladder, deployed mesa containing camera which recorded descent, and stepped on lunar surface at 114:30 get (9:53 am est Feb. 5). Mitchell stepped down six minutes later. \u201cNot bad for an old man,\u201d Mission Control told Shepard as he touched surface. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Shepard replied \u201cI\u2019m on the surface. It\u2019s been a long way and I\u2019m here. The surface on which the forward footpad landed is extremely soft. . . . it\u2019s in a small depression. The soil is so soft that it comes all the way to the top of the footpads, it even folded over the sides to some degree. ... we can see the boulders on the rim. It looks as though we have a good traverse route up to the top of the Cone.\u201d Crew collected 19.5-kg (43-lb) contingency sample; deployed TV, S-band antenna, American flag, and solar wind composition experiment; and photographed lm, lunar surface, and experiments, alsep was deployed about 152 m (500 ft) west of lm and laser-ranging retrorefiector was deployed about 30 m (100 ft) west of alsep. Mitchell conducted active seismic experiment, firing 13 thumper shots into lunar surface. Signals were recorded by geophones and transmitted to earth. Eight of the 21 cartridges misfired, but the 13 fired sent vibrations 18-21 m (60-70 ft) into moon. Crew was granted 30-min extension on EVA and reentered LM after 4 hrs 49 min. After resting inside lm and checking plans for second eva period, astronauts left lm at 131:48 get (3:11 am est Feb. 6)\u20142 hrs 27 min earlier than planned. Astronauts loaded met with photographic equipment and lunar portable magnetometer (lpm) and proceeded toward Cone Crater, met bounced slightly during traverse but appeared stable. Astronauts\u2019 main problem was lunar dust which stuck to their space suits up to their knees. \u201cWe\u2019re filthy as pigs,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be covered with dust before long.\u201d lpm site measurement was made at first stop and lpm traverse measurement was later made near Cone Crater. Geological features were described and materials collected. Crew was unable to reach rim of Cone Crater because slopes were steeper than expected and climb would have required running behind time line by about 30 min. Samples were collected in blocky field near rim. On return leg of traverse crew dug 0.5-m (1.5-ft) trench and collected samples. Unsuccessful triple-core-tube attempt was made and other containerized samples were collected. Alignment adjustment was made to alsep central station\u2019s antenna to improve signal strength being received at msfn ground stations. Crew was unable to perform a number of secondary tasks because of timeline and minor problems. Just before reentering LM Shepard made surprise announcement: \u201cYou might recognize what I have in my hand as the handle for the February 4-6; Tracks of the modularized equipment transporter, used for the first time on the Apollo 14 mission, were photographed, (at top left) leading across the lunar surface from the LM Antares. The inverted umbrella of the S-band antenna was positioned by the astronauts to the left of the lm. Lunar dust clung to the legs of Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell (above) as he moved across the surface during extravehicular activity. Meanwhile, in the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Texas, a seismic reading of the Feb. 4 impact on the moon of the Saturn launch vehicle\u2019s S-IVB stage was examined by Dr. Maurice Ewing (bottom left), Director of Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, and Columbia graduate student David Lammlein. The impact released energy comparable to M tons of tht. contingency sample return and it just so happens to have a genuine six iron on the bottom of it.\u201d Shepard dropped golf ball on lunar surface and on third attempt drove ball about 366 m (400 yds). Astronauts reentered LM at 136:26 GET, after 4 hrs 35 min, bringing total eva time to 9 hrs 24 min. While LM was on moon, Roosa, orbiting moon in csm, completed bootstrap photography of Descartes landing site and astronomic photography, including Gegenschein experiment, and prepared for shortened rendezvous technique. Shepard and Mitchell depressurized lm, discarded excess equipment, repressurized lm, and lifted off lunar surface with 43 kg (94.8 Ihs) of samples at 142:25 get\u201433 hrs 31 min after landing on moon. During braking phase for docking, telemetry indicated that abort guidance system had failed, but no caution and warning signals were on. Docking was accomplished successfully at 144:13 get (3:36 pm Feb. 6) with no probe-drogue problems. Probe was returned to earth for postflight analysis. Excellent TV during rendezvous and docking showed docking maneuver clearly. Crew transferred from LM to CSM with samples, equipment, and film. LM ascent stage was jettisoned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 148:22 GET (7:05 pm est Feb. 6) at 3Â° 35' south latitude and 19Â° 40' west longitude. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 alseps. Transearth injection maneuver, on schedule at 149:16 get, injected CSM into transearth trajectory after 66 hrs 40 min (34 revolutions) in lunar orbit. cm Kitty Hawk separated from sm at 216:12 get. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned and Kitty Hawk splashed down in mid-Pacific about 7 km (4 nm) from recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans at 216:42 get (4.05 pm est Feb. 9). Astronauts, wearing flight suits and masks, were carried by helicopter from CM to recovery ship, where they entered mobile quarantine facility with recovery physicians and technician. Crew, physicians, and technician would remain inside MQF until ship neared Samoa and would then be transferred to another MQF for flight to LRL quarantine in Houston. CM was retrieved and mated to MQF transfer tunnel on board recovery ship. From inside MQF-CM containment envelope, MQF engineer removed lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and CM was sealed until delivery to LRL. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown via Pago Pago to Houston for lrl. Primary Apollo 14 objectives\u2014to make selenological inspection, survey, and sampling of materials in preselected region of Fra Mauro; deploy and activate alsep; develop man\u2019s capability to work in lunar environment; and photograph candidate exploration sites\u2014were achieved. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance was near nominal except for docking problems, spurious signals, and an occasional loss of communications. Flight crew performance was excellent. Crew exhibited exceptional poise during CSm/lm docking attempts and while troubleshooting AG computer. Accomplishments included first use of met, largest payload\u201432 500 kg (71 650 lbs)\u2014placed in lunar orbit, longest distance traversed on lunar surface, largest payload returned from lunar surface, longest lunar surface stay time, longest total EVA, first use of shortened rendezvous technique, first active seismic experiment, and first inflight technology demonstrations. Apollo 14 was 11th Apollo mission to date, 8th manned Apollo mission, and 3rd successful lunar landing mission. Apollo 11 (July 16-24, 1969) and Apollo 12 (Nov. 14-24, 1969) had proved capability to land men on moon and retrieve lunar samples for study on earth. Apollo 13 (April 11\u201417, 1970), aborted by sm tank explosion, had demonstrated capability to perform under emergency situation and return crew safely to earth under alternate plan. Apollo program was directed by nasa Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, msfc for Saturn V launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations.

Low, Acting nasa Administrator, testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on NERVA space nuclear propulsion program: \u201cAs we prepared our FY 1972 budget request, we were faced with one of three choices for nerva\u201d\u2014to continue with full scale development of flight engine; proceed at reduced rate, emphasizing technology and long-lead time development; or cancel nerva program. \u201cBecause there is simply no need to proceed with full scale development now, and in view of fiscal constraints, we decided to . . . continue with the development of long lead items and technology, but to not proceed with the full development effort. This will preserve the technology that has already been gained, and the hard core capability that now exists, without requiring a major expenditure of funds.\u201d nasa and aec support of nerva project was \u201cclear example of sustained support over many years of an advanced development even though we have not yet come to the point of proposing the specific missions on which it would be used.\u201d While best chemical propulsion systems operated at specific impulse of 450 sec, \u201cwith nuclear propulsion we have demonstrated . . . equivalent specific impulse of 825 seconds and have every confidence that the technology we are developing . . . can raise this to at least 900 seconds. Thus, our justification for the large and continuing investment in the nerva program is that we have a way of breaking one of the principal limiting constraints on space flight by doubling our propulsion efficiencies for many important classes of large space missions.\u201d Dr. Low, in response to questions, testified that nasa plan to stretch out nerva development program would necessitate immediate employment cutback from 2500 persons to 800. U.S. had invested $1.4 billion in nerva since 1955. (Transcript; W Post, 2/24/71; B Sun, 2/24/71, A7) Milton Klein, Manager, nasa-aec Space Nuclear Systems Office, testified on nerva program status: \u201cEighteen rocket reactors have been tested, each adding importantly to our knowledge. Two experimental engines, which couple the reactor with the other principal components necessary to form a complete nuclear rocket engine, have been operated. The last of these engines, XE, was started up 28 times and tested over a wide variety of Conditions. We have accumulated over 14 hours of system operating experience, including more than four hours at or near design power.\u201d Specific impulse \u201cof 825 seconds has been demonstrated for extended durations in a flight size reactor. A range of thrust levels, including 75,000 pounds [34,000 kg], has been demonstrated over a wide range of conditions, including the ability to throttle down to about one-half design thrust at full specific impulse. The ability to stop and start at will has been demonstrated. Finally, this system has proved to be quite predictable, an important feature from a development and operational standpoint.

The problems of developing such a system are exceedingly complex. Involved are aircraft, airways, airports, avionics, ground transportation, and appropriate regulations. To be acceptable, the system must be low in noise, low in pollution, and low in its contribution to the congestion of local transportation. The service must be easily accessible, dependable, and comfortable. And the fare must be reasonable.\u201d If development were to take normal course, \u201cit would move ahead very slowly.

Finally the Soviets have a systematic continuing manned space flight program and have stated that they expect to fly a space station before we do.\u201d U.S. should continue to compete with U.S.S.R. \u201cbecause accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today\u2019s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.\u201d Dr. Low believed U.S. could cooperate with U.S.S.R. \u201cin the areas we have under discussion without prejudicing any of our vital national interests.\u201d nasa was reexamining procurement policies and practices and \u201cbeginning a serious critical appraisal of the proper size, composition, and organization of NASA\u2019s institutional base.\u201d Position reduction of 1500 in FY 1972 budget was in anticipation that \u201creduction of this magnitude would be found possible without unduly impairing our ability to carry out the program. Our budget justifications show this reduction as a flat percentage cut\u2014about 5.1%\u2014in all of our major activities. The actual adjustments . . . will be refined as our study of the nasa institutional base proceeds.\u201d nasa program was 1.4% of U.S. budget, contrasting with 53% for domestic programs related to human and physical resources, yet U.S. stood to gain \u201ctremendous benefits now and in the future\u201d from exploration and applications of space science and technology. And whole future \u201cas a nation and as mankind\u201d depended on space science. \u201cFor in order to survive in the changing environment on our planet Earth, we must understand the processes that govern our universe.\u201d Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, said purpose of nasa Meteorology Program was to \u201cdevelop and demonstrate sensors and spacecraft for making those meteorological measurements that will enable a continued improvement in weather forecasting throughout the world with an ultimate view to a limited degree of weather modification and control of severe weather systems. Projections indicate that by about 1980 it should be possible to reach a global capability to acquire information throughout the atmosphere and to develop comprehensive weather models. Once developed, these models can be used to make 14-day weather forecasts and long-range climate estimates.\u201d Ability to develop weather models would permit basic experimenting in weather control. Space shuttle was key nasa development believed essential in 1970s, Dr. von Braun said, presenting U.S. with its greatest technology challenge for space in this decade. \u201cPreliminary analysis indicates that if the shuttle is used in lieu of current expendable systems, the transportation costs will be reduced by at least a factor of ten. . . . Only by an investment now will we be able to have operational an economical transportation system by the end of the 1970\u2019s to support a vigorous and balanced space flight program.\u201d (Transcript)",

Findings were from studies by scientists of Univ. of Washington at Seattle and Univ. of California at Berkeley. Dr. Cornelius A. Tobias and Dr. Thomas F. Budinger of Univ. of California at Berkeley had twice exposed themselves to low doses of cyclotron-accelerated cosmic rays aimed at their eyes in effort to reproduce flashes described by Apollo 11 Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell. Scientists said they saw flashes that differed from visual phenomena associated with x-rays or electrical and magnetic exposures. They concluded that flashes came from ionization and excitation of atoms in retina as it was bombarded by cosmic rays. Evidence indicated flashes were detected by retinal rods, structures in eyes that allowed night vision. Radiations were not believed to be hazardous to astronauts on short flights, but long-duration effects had not yet been evaluated. (Wilford, NYT, 3/4/71, 18)",

Jackson, Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, said aeronautics was largest part of OART program for first time. In military aviation, \u201cwork is under way at the Centers in support of the F-14 for the Navy. . . . Over a dozen wind tunnels and simulators . . . are used in this support. We are helping the usaf with . . . the F\u201415, their new B\u20141 bomber and we plan to assist\u201d with the A\u2014X. One ARC facility was on indefinite loan to USA. \u201cIn all, we use over a third of our available facility time to support military needs. Research on transonic aerodynamics, the NASA supercritical airfoil, fly-by-wire flight controls, spin stabilization, and advanced structures using beryllium or composites are some of the areas where NASA is making research contributions to meet military requirements in the future.\u201d In civil aviation effort, OART was providing DOT with assistance on sst. arc was assisting faa in certification studies of Concorde and sst. arc flight simulator for advanced aircraft was \u201cproving to be the most useful facility available in the free world for studying airworthiness standards for supersonic transports.\u201d NASA and DOT were completing joint study of \u201crelationships between the benefits that accrue to the Nation from aviation and the level of R&D effort. The study displays the ways in which civil aviation can affect regional development, population distribution, [and] land use, and contribute to many other social and economic goals of the Nation.\u201d Problems under study included aircraft noise, air pollution from aircraft engine emissions, and aeronautical operating problems \u201csuch as approach and landing safety, delays, congestion, and community noise caused by operation of aircraft.\u201d oart Aeronautical Operating Systems Div. had established joint stol operating problems experiments program with dot and faa, and Aeronautical Life Sciences Div. \u201cto study man\u2019s role in advanced aeronautical systems ... as an operator, as a passenger, and as a member of the community exposed to air operations.\u201d Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Deputy Associate Administrator (Aeronautics), described improvements in aircraft materials and structural design: \u201cI have been particularly impressed with the progress of the composite materials. The potential of boron and carbon fibers imbedded in an epoxy resin matrix to provide high strength, low weight structures has been discussed with you for several years. This year the testing of special glass fibers has revealed the possibility that low cost, stiff composites may be fabricated with much greater strengths than previously thought possible. Composites are finding application both as a replacement for metallic components and by augmenting metal strengths using selective reinforcement. In the forthcoming year we propose to construct several airplane components of primary structure for installation and flight demonstration. We believe that these new materials will find widespread use in the industry when the technical risk has been demonstrated to be acceptable.\u201d Milton Klein, Manager of Space Nuclear Systems Office, reported on progress of nerva program: \u201cThrough the systematic engineering design process . . . design concepts to be incorporated in nerva were formulated, requirements were specified, and a baseline engine design has been established. The design provides a thrust level of 75 000 lbs [ 334 000 newtons], and a specific impulse of 825 seconds. High reliability and safety in operation are provided through the use of redundancy in critical areas and conservative design approaches. The endurance goal for the reusable system is 10 hours, coupled with the ability to undergo 60 start-and-stop cycles, and the key fuel element technology continued to make good progress toward that goal.\u201d (Transcript)",

I did not succeed in bringing the two together. In addition, in January our delegation was invited to the principal Soviet tracking station in the Crimea. Unfortunately, the time available . . . did not permit us to make this visit, but we have every intention of doing so in the future.\u201d Advocating \u201cair of cautious optimism,\u201d Dr. Low said U.S.S.R. had, \u201cin effect, met the schedules laid down in the first agreement with a variance of only a few days. In any event, we have laid out and agreed to specific milestones for an even-handed exchange, so that neither side will gain more than the other.\u201d In response to question, Dr. Low said military components of U.S. and Soviet space programs had not been discussed at NASA-Soviet Academy of Sciences meetings.

      "story": " Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, testified on aerospace unemployment before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1972 authorization hearings: From number of studies of unemployment of scientists and engineers, estimated 30 000 to 40 000 were out of work at end of 1970. \u201cThe majority of these came from aerospace-related industries. Projections indicate that this number could more than double by June 1972, which means that as many as 30 percent of the Nation\u2019s aerospace scientists and engineers will be unemployed. The effect of this national trend\u2014in terms of an individual scientist or engineer being reemployed\u2014is magnified by the concentration of this unemployment, geographically and by training and experience. . . . This not only causes great personal hardship but . . . represents the loss of a tremendous national resource.\u201d NASA-sponsored survey by Battelle Memorial Institute of persons laid off by group of nasa contractors from June 1968 to September 1970 had made preliminary findings: only 31% had found permanent jobs, 32% had found temporary jobs, 32% were still unemployed, and 5% had left work-force. Average person was unemployed 31 weeks. Of those who had found permanent jobs, only 18% returned to aerospace. Of those permanently employed outside of aerospace, only 12% reported having positions highly related to aerospace skills and 50% reported new positions unrelated to aerospace. Unemployment rate of those over 50 was 48%. Of those who had found permanent work outside, 31% said they would not return to aerospace if given opportunity; 16% said they would. Preliminary results of survey indicated \u201cwe are losing much of the aerospace capability that is an indispensable ingredient of our long term economic strength and national security.\u201d In closing, Dr. Low made point that there was \u201cno either/or choice between technological advances and social advances. Without technology, we cannot maintain the capability to deal effectively with any national problem.\u201d Dr. Low was questioned on his testimony that U.S.S.R. was spending more on R&D than U.S. was spending in total science and technology area. He answered that Soviet space program, with apparent Soviet policy of steadily increasing r&d investment, would soon match and then surpass U.S. program in size and accomplishment. \u201cFor this comparison, I am dealing with the combined civil and military space programs of both nations; to try to differentiate between civil and military activities of the U.S.S.R. would be speculative at best. The most difficult comparison to try to make between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. economies or programs is in terms of absolute costs: each national economy is geared and motivated to produce a different, nonparallel mix of goods and services.\u201d (CR, 7/31/71, E8611\u20142) Dale D. Myers, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, discussed future of Apollo program: \u201cWe can now move with confidence to the final phase. ... In these last missions, we will expand the capability of the system very dramatically. Design changes in the spacecraft and supporting equipment will allow the two astronauts in the lunar module to remain on the moon up to 67 hours, as compared with 34 hours on Apollo 14. The scientific payload landed on the moon will be doubled to above 1200 lbs [544 kg]. Changes in the command and service modules will permit up to 10 days total flight time and major increases in orbital scientific activities. During the Apollo 15 and 16 missions small subsatellites will be placed in lunar orbit and will continue to make scientific measurements long after the astronauts return to earth.\u201d In Skylab program, \u201cthree separate three-man Skylab flight crews will be selected during the coming year. Scientist astronauts will be included. . . . They plan to perform about 50 experiments in various disciplines. Twenty of these are in the life sciences, to determine how human beings adjust and perform under the conditions of prolonged space flight, up to 2 months\u2019 duration. \u201cThey will also operate the Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package in the second space flight phase of NASA\u2019s earth resources program. These observations will be in conjunction with [and] complementary to those [of] the automated earth resources test technology erts, to be launched in 1972.\u201d FY 1972 request for space shuttle of $100 million would provide for broad spectrum of studies, including analysis of new alloys and promising external materials for thermal protection; test demonstrations of design concepts for structures; wind-tunnel tests to define aerodynamic heating, launch aerodynamics, etc.; design of long-leadtime hardware, subsystems, and test devices; initiation of scaled model for flight tests; dynamics testing; electronic-data-bus-system demonstration testing; and integration of upgraded fuel-cell electrical power subsystem with other components for proof-of-concept testing. (Transcript) Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, testified on dod applications of space transportation system and dod-nasa teamwork on space shuttle: \u201cPresent dod satellite communications program consists of two major systems: The long distance point to point or strategic system and the local-area multiple-user or tactical system. . . . We are pursuing a new system called Defense Satellite Communications System, Phase II, which can provide many voice channels to selected limited areas of the earth. These present and proposed systems give us the flexibility for voice and teletype communications from our forces overseas and allow rapid transmission of photographic images from operational theaters to the United States.\u201d In conjunction with NASA studies, usaf was analyzing defense applications of space shuttle to provide better insight into utility of concept for dod. usaf was providing NASA with data to help ensure that configuration was of maximum utility to dod. nasa and usaf had worked jointly on engine development. Air Force \u201chas supported advanced development efforts on liquid rocket engines in the past, and more recently concluded a hydrogen/oxygen high performance engine demonstration program.\u201d Engine, XLR-129, had \u201cprovided the basis for selection of the reusable high pressure rocket engine concept for the shuttle. It also provided design data for a 250 000-pound [1100-kilonewton] thrust engine which supports the current shuttle engine design concepts.\u201d In operational testing area, \u201cusaf and NASA recently conducted unpowered approach and landing demonstrations with F\u2014Ills and B-52s. . . . These demonstrations investigated terminal area energy management for maneuvering reentry vehicles and have a relationship to the Space Shuttle operational concepts.\u201d (Transcript)",

When future space programs using the shuttle are compared with those using conventional launch vehicles, the shuttle offers a very real economic advantage.\u201d Shuttle development should proceed in FY 1972 because necessary technology was available, delay in development would widen existing four-year gap in U.S. manned space flight schedule, and shuttle was \u201ckeystone to the total plan for the U.S. space program.\u201d NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers discussed candidate concepts for space shuttle: \u201cThe principle objective in examining various systems is to determine which systems have the greatest potential for low operational costs together with low development costs. The most attractive system ... is the fully reusable system where nothing is discarded in the course of the flight and the orbiter and booster are \u2018turned around\u2019 with minimum maintenance for reuse. This concept has been the subject of intense \u2018phase B\u2019 definition studies over . .. the past 9 months.\u201d Dr. John E.

That\u2019s how we felt as our rather big Soyuz eased up to the station. \u201cThe rendezvous maneuver began from a long distance away. At first we could not see the orbital station and we corrected our orbit to get closer. We first saw the Salyut from a distance of about 15 kilometers [9 mi]. At that distance we were able to see the station through a special optical device. At first it looked very tiny, just a black spot... of small size. The station flashed special light beacons for easier recognition. From that moment on we kept it constantly in view as we proceeded with the rendezvous maneuver. \u201cAs we approached the station, we kept looking at the station through instruments. It was quite an imposing sight. Then the docking took place. All the time we kept the required components of the station in the field of vision of our television and optical devices. Then we separated and circled the station, looking at it from all sides and shooting movie film of it. \u201cIt was an overwhelming sight: There was this structure in flight, with a tremendous amount of apparatus and all sorts of antennas.\u201d' (Shabad, NYT, 4/26/71,1; 4/27/71, 30) Cosmonaut Konstantin P. Feoktistov later said that in future, \u201cit will become necessary to learn to dock a relatively small transport spaceship with a high flying multipurpose laboratory. ... it is already necessary to look for more national technical solutions, in particular of docking units, as much depends on their design and perfection. A new version of docking units was tested during the flight.\u201d Cosmonaut Boris Yegorov said \u201coperations of docking and rendezvous lead to a considerable emotional burden on the cosmonauts. Medical men and engineers are looking for and finding the most rational combination of man and automatic equipment in such a complex maneuver in orbit. . . . quite a few problems of engineering and cosmic psychology must be solved to achieve the best possible coordination of man and automatic equipment.\u201d Soviet comments on its space station program had shifted in emphasis to possible future docking experiments between Salyut satellites and manned spacecraft and had \u201cleft open the question of whether . . . Soyuz 10 . . . succeeded in doing all it set out to do,\u201d Anthony Astrachan later suggested in the Washington Post.

He was unable to pinpoint quake source, except that they emanated from somewhere along 1290-km (800-mi) line between seismometers left on moon by Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 astronauts. (O\u2019Toole, W Post, 4/27/71, A3) Discovery by Uhuru (Explorer 42) Small Astronomy Satellite (launched Dec. 12, 1970) of slowdown in spin rate of x-ray star Centaurus X\u20143 in Milky Way Galaxy was reported by Dr. Riccardo Giacconi and Dr. Wallace Tucker of American Science and Engineering, Inc. Change, deduced April 12 from star\u2019s pulsation\u2019s, was caused, scientists thought, by some violent event, such as vast in-fall of material onto star.

Using tank containing cleaning fluid 1.6 km (1 mi) underground in gold mine in South Dakota, Dr. Davis was detecting average of one solar neutrino every third day. Detection was difficult because neutrinos had no electric charge and floated freely through atom unless they hit its nucleus squarely. If Dr. Davis\u2019 observations were confirmed, they would contribute to understanding of how sun produced energy. Neutrinos were thought to be largely produced by reactions that began with fusion of two hydrogen nuclei (protons). (Sullivan, NYT, 4/30/71, 3:23) Dr. V.

Jackson, Associate Administrator, oart, at 1971 Society of Automotive Engineers Meeting in Atlanta, Ga.: \u201cThe first objective of our work on design principle for quiet engines is an experimental CTOL [conventional-takeoff-and-landing] engine and nacelle with 15 to 20 PNdb [perceived noise in decibels] less noise than the comparable JT3D class of engines in service today. Program began in 1969 and would be completed by end of 1972. General Electric Co. and nasa\u2019s LeRC were working together on program. \u201cIt is on schedule and should meet or surpass the noise reduction objectives. We believe that production of quiet engines using this technology could begin to be available for retrofit and new aircraft beginning in 1976. . . . Such quiet engine installation in aircraft and the size of the 707 and DC-8 could permit this class of aircraft to operate fully 10 db lower than the present FAR 36 standard for new aircraft.\u201d nasa expected \u201cto continue technology that will show how to drive the noise level down another significant increment like 6 db within a few years.\u201d Aircraft \u201cthe size of the 707 should be able to operate at a noise level of 92 EPNdb [effective perceived noise in decibels]. Our objective is to develop the necessary technology for this by 1977. Production engines meeting such noise standards could then be developed by industry through normal development and certification cycles and be available for next-generation aircraft of all types beginning in the late 1970\u2019s or early 1980\u2019s.\u201d (Text)",

Armstrong, on the Apollo 11 mission, became the first man to set a foot on the lunar surface, at 10:56 pm edt, July 20, 1969. mary aim of passive seismic experiment was to discover where moon-quakes occurred. \u201cSo far we have identified 11 zones in which moon-quakes occur, hut one of these is particularly active, accounting for about 80 percent of the energy we record.\u201d Source might be \u201can isolated pocket of magma under pressure at depths between 30 and 400 miles [50 and 600 km],\u201d Third seismometer, to be placed on moon by Apollo 15, was expected to provide data as to whether all 11 zones corresponded to same source mechanism; i.e., small magma reservoirs. Active zone fell on line that bisected Apodo 12 and 14 seismometer stations, \u201cso that makes 15 an exceedingly vital station to us. If we just get one perigee passage and a couple of these moonquakes before station 12 or 14 ceases to function, we\u2019ll have taken quite a step forward.\u201d Apollo 15 would be at edge of prominent mascon basins, Serenatatis and Imbrium. \u201cWe expect ... to impact an S-IVB smack in the middle of one of them, probably Serenatatis. So this will he the first time we get seismic waves propagating through one of these mascon features, and, hopefully, we will be able to say something about how its structures differ from the other mare we have been able to record seismic waves through.\u201d Edward M. Davin, Program Scientist, Lunar Surface Experiments, said Apollo 12 magnetometer had been \u201cvery successfully recording a surprising magnetic field. . . . we now have a general model of the moon based upon three layers ... a crust, an inner layer, and a core.\u201d Apollo 15 lunar surface magnetometer could determine \u201cif there is any asymmetry in the magnetic field\u201d and provide additional information on electrical conductivity that indicated thermal distribution of lunar interior. jpl scientist Dr. Conway W. Snyder said solar wind spectrometer experiment would he \u201cmeasuring the weather in space. The solar wind which is a plasma\u2014this is an ionized gas\u2014is quite analogous to weather on earth. ... it is the phenomenon that determines what magnetic fields are in space, affects cosmic rays, and generally is the fundamental entity in space once you stop considering the planets themselves.\u201d With addition of second spectrometer on moon \u201cwe hope to be able to start making some definite interpretations of the very complicated kind of plasma effects that go on the moon.\u201d Suprathermal ion detector experiment was described by Rice Univ. scientist Dr. Kent Hills. Apollo 12 and 14 ion detectors had revealed ion clouds that were not lunar-oriented hut had been formed elsewhere \u201cfrom an expanding neutral gas cloud.\u201d With Apollo 15 experiment, third station north of other two would give \u201cextended distance with which to investigate these things and ... a different direction.\u201d Cold cathode gauge experiment would indicate amount of gas on moon, Dr. Francis S. Johnson of Univ. of Texas at Dallas said. Ion detector already on moon had detected gas clouds in which concentration sometimes increased 100 times. With second gauge \u201cwe hope that there will be the prospect of seeing the same event on two gauges, and then we will be able to tell quite a lot more about where these gas sources would be and also learn something about how they propagate across the lunar surface.\u201d Heat flow experiment, with 3-m (10-ft) drill, was to measure amount of heat coming from interior of moon, Columbia Univ. astronomer Dr. Marcus E. Langseth said. Measurement would be made by monitoring heat budget in near-surface material (lunar regolith) over one year with thermometers on probes about 2 m (6 ft) below lunar surface. Measurements could be useful in resolving contradictory data from magnetometer experiments on Apollo 12 and 14. Experiments outside Apollo 15 alsep package\u2014laser ranging retro-flector, lunar field geology, and lunar soil mechanics\u2014were discussed by Wesleyan Univ. astronomer Dr. James E. Faller; Donald A. Beattie, Program Manager, Lunar Surface Experiments; and Dr. James K. Mitchell of Univ. of California at Berkeley. Laser array would provide third leg of triangle formed by laser retroflectors on Apollos 12 and 14, improve ranging reliability from current stations, and \u201cprovide for greater efficiencies in telescope use time.\u201d Geology experiment objectives were to sample Apennine Mountain front, study Hadley Rifle, examine mare, sample volcanic complex to north of landing site, and study cluster of craters southeast of landing site. Soil mechanics experiment would measure density, strength, compressibility and adhesive and cohesive characteristics of material on lunar surface. \u201cThe thing that is going to be of considerable interest is the lunar roving vehicle because if we can calibrate this vehicle ... a knowledge of vehicle tracks and power consumptions should provide . . . continuous record of the soil conditions as the crew moved from point to point.\u201d (Transcript)\t'",

(Goddard News, 6/14/71, 1) Orbital parameters for Soyuz 11 were apogee, 237 km (147.3 mi); perigee, 163 km (101.3 mi); period, 88.4 min; and inclination, 51.5Â°. Spacecraft docked with Salyut 1 at 10:45 am Moscow time (3:45 am edt) June 7. Tass announcement said: \u201cIn accordance with the Soviet programme of creating long-term orbital stations, the \u2018Salyut\u2019 orbital scientific station has started to function as the first piloted scientific station. . . . After successfully docking the Soyuz-11 transport spaceship with the scientific station . . . the crew of Soyuz-11 entered the scientific station. Solved for the first time was the engineering and technical task of delivering a crew to an orbiting scientific station by a transport ship.\u201d Tass said Salyut-Soyuz space system was 20 m (66 ft) long, weighed more than 25 tons, and consisted of compartments containing equipment for scientific and technical experiments, for spacecraft control, and for crew work and rest. Cosmonauts would check out spacecraft subsystems; test orientation and navigation equipment; study geological-geographical objects on earth\u2019s surface, atmospheric formations, and snow and ice cover; study physical characteristics, processes, and phenomena in atmosphere and outer space; and study medico-biological influence of space flight factors on human organism. Cosmonauts checked out systems, conducted experiments, and sent messages of thanks to scientists, engineers, and workers who took part in creation of space station system. TV transmissions showed crew performing duties in spacecraft. After one week in orbit, crew was in good health and had completed first phase of experiments with all systems functioning normally. Crew was allowed one-day rest before continuing experiments. By 1:00 pm Moscow time (6:00 am edt) June 13 Salyut-Soyuz station had completed 100 orbits of earth. Cosmonauts continued to follow preplanned program of work, rest, and two hours of exercise per day and reported they were in good health. Experiments included communications with ground via orbiting Molniya I comsat, astronomical observations, medical experiments, observation of cyclone in Pacific near Japan, and experiments with plants in hothouse on board. They reared tadpoles into frogs and grew cabbages and onions. By 12:00 noon Moscow time (5:00 am edt) June 22 station had completed 245 orbits of earth. Station completed 18th day in orbit June 24, surpassing 17-day 17-hr endurance record set by Soyuz 9 June 2\u201419,1970. On June 29 cosmonauts completed flight program and prepared for reentry. Crew transferred equipment to Soyuz 11 and undocked from Salyut 1 at 9:28 pm Moscow time (2:28 pm edt). Crew reported successful undocking and said all systems were functioning normally.

Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified June 15 on nasa policy on backup spacecraft and Centaur reliability: \u201cIn the manned program, all possible steps are taken to assure the safety of the astronauts. Single point failures are reduced to an absolute minimum. Missions are planned to build upon the previous missions so as to reduce the number of unknowns.\u201d Within missions, \u201cplateaus are established so that all systems can be checked out in real time prior to committing to the next plateau. Vigorous testing procedures coupled with redundancy and in many cases dual redundancy are adopted before a system is \u2018man-rated.\u2019 \u201d In Skylab \u201cwe are building a back-up workshop which will be brought right up to the point of actual checkout. This will permit us to proceed with the program even in the event that the first workshop would not be successfully launched. Similarly, we will have a single back-up Command and Service Module-Saturn IB capability for the three manned visits to the workshop.\u201d Capability was built into program and was \u201ckey to the plan for a rescue capability in Skylab which we recently adopted.\u201d In earth-orbital automated programs \u201cwe generally plan a series of related missions, using identical or similar hardware. If we have a mission failure, decisions will then be made, based on all available factors, whether we will (1) prepare and fly a specific back-up to the mission which failed, (2) modify succeeding flights ... to achieve the objectives, or (3) defer achieving the mission objectives to future years.\u201d In planetary programs, with launch opportunities at only discrete intervals, NASA usually had provided for two identical launches. Each launch in dual mission was planned to complement its twin, while at same time serving as backup if twin were lost. This year Manner 9 was backup, flying hybrid mission. Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle had history of 3 failures out of 16 operational vehicles, without apparent relationship between failures, giving probability of success of 80% if based solely on past experience. Launch vehicles for automated missions\u2014such as Scout, Delta, and Atlas-Centaur\u2014were \u201ccomplex systems without much redundancy, and cannot be expected to achieve reliabilities much greater than about 90% without very major and costly changes. They certainly cannot be considered \u2018man-rated\u2019 vehicles.\u201d Addition of redundant systems would be investigated again but was not complete solution. Redundancy added weight, reduced payload capability, and was expensive. For launch vehicles of size of Titan-Centaur, which would carry Viking and Grand Tour payloads, additional redundancy might be practicable and desirable and would be actively studied. Major increase in reliability of achieving orbit would be one of important attributes of space shuttle. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, on June 16 continued testimony on backup philosophy, expanding on application in ossa: \u201cWe do not schedule backup missions for observatory spacecraft. We always buy, and intend to fly, at least two flight units of a new series of observatory-class spacecraft. When we have a failure or a malfunction in a spacecraft or a launch vehicle we will always do everything possible to thoroughly understand and correct all other future missions which could conceivably be subject to a similar malfunction. When we have a failure we will always review the effect of the loss on the program, determine the alternative recovery plans by which we can attain the objectives of the lost mission, assess the cost and any other impact of those alternatives on the program and then decide which alternative to choose.\u201d Vincent L. Johnson, Deputy Administrator for Space Science and Applications, testified June 17: \u201cIn the basic considerations which establish the philosophical approach to reliability of unmanned space vehicles, the over-riding necessity for protection of the lives of human passengers is absent. The result is an approach to reliability in which cost and simplicity play a much larger part. We have not imposed a requirement for total elimination of single point failure modes, but have concentrated upon reducing the probability of failure by careful design, parts application, major quality and reliability efforts, and, most importantly, tender loving care. Our launch vehicles . . . are characterized as simplex systems, implying lack of the complexity characteristic of redundancy.\u201d (Testimony; Subcom Rpt, 10/71)",

Among the nations, security and cooperation\u2014on every front from space to the seabeds\u2014are being enhanced through negotiations, treaties, and conventions.

International meeting of scientists hosted by NAS included symposia and working groups on 1970 total solar eclipse, astronomical observations from space, use of stratospheric balloons in space research, and lunar lasers. Grumman Aerospace Corp. scientist Dr. Henry C. Courten, professor of astronomy at Dowling College, said mysterious tracks on photographic plates he made during 1966 and 1970 solar eclipses appeared to be of small planet or asteroid belt inside Mercury\u2019s orbit. Cal Tech scientist and lunar expert Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg told cospar meeting four rocks gathered by Apollo 14 astronauts had ages ranging from 3.85 billion to 3.95 billion yrs. Ages were surprising \u201csince it was anticipated that Fra Mauro would yield rocks of greater antiquity.\u201d Discovery suggested that volcanism was active on moon far longer than had been thought and was still forming lunar crust more than 600 million yrs after moon came into being. It also suggested that Sea of Rains had been carved by collision 600 million yrs after moon\u2019s formation, or 100 million to 150 million yrs later than lunar experts had originally believed. Soviet scientists Yuri G. Nefyuduv, L. I. Kakurin, and A. D. Yegorov said Soyuz 9 Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Vitaly I.

He asked, \u201cWhat better tribute to the memory of Yuri Gagarin can we offer than the hope that the growing unity of efforts in space\u2014which this cospar meeting so well exemplifies\u2014 may one day extend to all the Earth?

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified before Senate Committee on Appropriations\u2019 Subcommittee on hud, Space, and Science during hearings on NASA FY 1972 appropriations bill. He urged that \u201cstrong program in space and aeronautics is essential to our longterm national well-being. Our capabilities as a Nation to deal with domestic problems of high priority\u2014poverty, cities, the environment . . . and indeed, our pursuit of happiness and cultural advance\u2014ultimately depend on whether we can maintain a strong economy with continually increasing productivity. Increasing productivity, in turn, depends primarily on technological advance, which, in turn, results primarily from the large scale focussed technological efforts like our major space programs.\u201d In addition were both long-term and near-term direct benefits, many already realized. \u201cWhen 50,000 lives were saved as a result of satellite advance warning at the time of hurricane Camille, the space program probably paid for itself.. . . \u201cI believe that the space program is a value in itself to the nation and to the whole world. With our everyday preoccupation, necessarily, with the many serious and often depressing problems we face . . . there is, I believe, a human hunger for positive elevating goals to work for at the same time as we do what needs to be done in all these other difficult areas. I believe the strong attraction that the landing of the first man on the moon had on people everywhere, and much of the underlying basis of support in the country for the space program, stems from the fact that the space program provides such goals. The space program gives us goals seemingly beyond human capability, goals which transcend earthly boundaries.\u201d Space shuttle had tremendous impact for future because it not only reduced cost by being reusable itself, but it also gave options of reusing payloads. \u201cYou do not have to throw them away once you put them up there. . . . There are many more application satellites we can use with this kind of an arrangement, because we will be able to reuse them.\u201d Skylab, \u201cfirst and only NASA experimental space station,\u201d due to fly in 1973, would be \u201clarger but 2 years later than the Soviet Salyut now in orbit.\u201d U.S.S.R. probably would be able to \u201cdo things in space, laboratories, 2 years earlier than we ... to know what the earth is like, to know what the clouds are like, to understand more about the earth\u2019s resources. . . . Another aspect, which I am uncertain about, is what they plan to do in a military way. . . . they will have the potential of doing military things on this same vehicle. We do not plan to do this on the Skylab. We also must consider the scientific value of Salyut, which I think is important, but not as important to us as the applications and the military aspects of it.\u201d Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Richard C. McCurdy testified that \u201cmodels\u201d of anticipated further reduction of 1500 civil service positions in fall \u201cindicate that we have reached a point in which really good people of considerable experience will be going out the door.

An important characteristic for flight projects is its gravity which will allow us to send a spacecraft to study Jupiter and then continue on\u201d to investigate outermost planets of solar system. JPL scientist James E. Long recommended spacecraft be launched in 1981 for insertion into Jupiter orbit early in 1984 after 750-day trip from earth. \u201cDepending on Jupiter\u2019s radiation hazard, the spacecraft will have an active life in orbit of six months to a year.\u201d It was \u201cimperative that we get direct measurements well into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere over long periods . . . to determine the dynamic processes involved.\u201d Technology for Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft (tops), sustained by self-repairing computers and capable of 10-yr scientific missions to outer planets, was described by jpl engineers Carl C.

Both had built-in redundancy, with backup parts for each unit that might fail. Easton said star computer was spacecraft\u2019s brain and cats computer its nervous system. Selfrepairing computers were needed for outer planetary mission because \u201cpotentially hazardous environments, such as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, or radiation from Jupiter itself, require that Grand Tour spacecraft subsystems be self-adaptive to either transient or permanent failures.

Berry, msc Director of Medical Research and Operations, said cosmonauts could have been killed by a toxic gas that accidently escaped, either by a chemical reaction or by a substance being heated inadvertently. He said odds were 1000 to 1 against one cosmonaut dying from effects of 24 days of weightlessness and it was almost impossible for all three to die simultaneously from weightlessness. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told press cosmonauts\u2019 deaths might have been caused by failure of spacecraft\u2019s oxygen-supply system or by physical rupture of spacecraft. Deaths, he said, were \u201ca terrible tragedy. They were pioneers in their achievements in space\u2014in establishing the first manned space station. Our hearts go out to their families and to their colleagues. The cause of their death is not yet known to us. But I would speculate that the fault was with the spacecraft and not with the men. In all of our experience man has readily adapted to new conditions, while machines have sometimes failed.\u201d Dr. Low said he did not expect changes in nasa\u2019s Skylab program because of cosmonauts\u2019 deaths: \u201cAll of our experience in 24 manned flights suggests we can and should move ahead.\u201d (upx, W Star, 7/1/71, A3; NASA Activities, 7/15/71, 107)",

NASA mission objective was to place satellite in orbit where it could monitor sun\u2019s x-ray and UV emissions. Solrad 10, 115-kg (253.5-lb) 12-sided cylinder, carried 14 experiments to monitor solar electromagnetic and uv radiation continuously and to measure, on command, stellar radiation from other celestial sources. Information gained by satellite was expected to contribute to better understanding of physical processes in solar flares and other solar activities and potential effects of this activity on shortwave communications and on manned space travel. Satellite was third in series of solar radiation satellites launched from Wallops Station in joint NASA\u2014nrl program.

The variation of the pressure over the planet reveals the topography to vary over 7 kilometers [4Yz miles] in height and to be correlated with visible features. The carbon dioxide polar cap, in addition to being a cold trap for volatile gases in the atmosphere, may also be a very efficient absorption trap for nonvolatiles.

Apollo 15 was first spacecraft to have even a near miss from lightning strikes while being prepared for launch. [W Post, 7/25/71, A16) July 26\u2014August 7: nasa\u2019b Apollo J5 (AS\u2014510) carried three-man crew on fourth successful lunar landing mission. LM-10 Falcon landed on moon\u2019s Hadley-Apennine region and two astronauts conducted experiments, rode first manned lunar roving vehicle (lrv) on moon, and explored lunar surface. After 66 hrs 55 min on surface, Falcon rejoined orbiting CSM-112 Endeavor and astronauts transfered for safe return to earth with lunar samples, Spacecraft and S-1VB combination entered parking orbit with 171.4-km (106.5-mi) apogee and 169.4-km (105.3-mi) perigee. Translunar injection (tu) was achieved at 2:56 get and csm separated from lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:22 get. Docking of csm with lm at 3:34 get was shown clearly by onboard color TV. S-IVB aps burns were conducted at 5:48 get and 10:00 get to send stage toward moon. Separated S-IVB/iU impacted lunar surface at 79:25 get (4:59 pm edt July 29) at 1Â° south latitude and 11.9Â° west longitude, 188 km (117 mi) northeast of Apollo 14 landing site and 355 km (221 mi) northeast of Apollo .12 landing site. Impact was detected by Apollo 14 seismometer 37 sec after impact and by Apollo 12 seismometer 55 sec after impact. . First midcourse correction (MCC-1) was canceled because spacecraft trajectory was near nominal. Shortly after csm-lm docking, telemetry data indicated electrical short in service propulsion system (sps). Troubleshooting isolated problem and MCC\u20142 at 28:41 get used sps bank A to analyze apparent intermittent short. Data indicated bank A could be safely operated manually. Modified procedures were developed for using bank B alone for remaining midcourse corrections except lunar orbit and transearth insertions, which would be dual bank burns. Scott and Irwin entered lm at 33:56 get, 50 min earlier than planned, to check out LM communications and other systems. TV pictures of csm and lm interiors were shown between 34:55 and 35:46 get. During checkout crew discovered range/range-rate exterior glass cover had broken, removing helium barrier. Crew began lm housekeeping V/2 hrs earlier than scheduled and vacuumed broken glass. At 61:13 Get, during preparations for water chlorination, water leak developed in cm chlorination septum gland but was stopped by crew, following repair instructions from ground, and water was absorbed with towels. Door of scientific instrument module (sim) was jettisoned at 74:06 get. July 29\u2014August 4: Apollo 15 entered lunar orbit with 314.8-km (195.6-mi) apolune and 107.5-km (66.8-mi) perilune after LOI burn at 78:32 get (4:06 pm edt July 29). \u201cThis is really profound . . . it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Scott said of view from moon. Apennine Mountains looked unreal. \u201cThey stand out in tremendous relief. They appear to be smooth or rounded. But they are cratered and in many places rough in texture. We don\u2019t see any jagged peaks. They don\u2019t look like . . . any other mountains we\u2019ve seen on earth.\u201d csm-lm undocking and separation maneuver was initiated during 12th lunar revolution, on far side of moon at 100:14 get, but spacecraft did not undock. Worden entered tunnel to inspect csm\u2014LM umbilical and found plug was loose. After he reconnected plug and adjusted spacecraft attitude, undocking and separation were achieved at 100:39 get\u2014about 25 min later than planned. lm Falcon touched down in moon\u2019s Hadley-Apennine region near Salyut Crater at 104:42 get (6:16 pm edt July 30) about 600 m (656 yds) north-northwest of planned target. \u201cOK Houston,\u201d Scott said after touchdown, \u201cthe Falcon is on the plain at Hadley.\u201d He said LM\u2019s engine had stirred up so much dust that landing site had been completely obscured from 15-m (50-ft) altitude to touchdown: \u201cWe flew ifr from then on down.\u201d\t> Stand-up extravehicular activity (seva) to observe and photograph landing site and surrounding area began after cabin depressurization at 106:43 get. Scott put his head out of upper hatch and described and photographed area for 33 min. Scott said he could describe site July 29-August 4; Apollo IS entered lunar orbit July 29 and the lm Falcon touched down in the moon\u2019s Hadley-Apennine region July SO for three eva periods of exploration. The lunar room# vehicle Rover, deployed during the first EVA July 31, was photographed by Astronaut James B. Irwin near Hadley RiUe (right center above), with the Hadley Delta in the background and St. George Crater partially visible at the upper right edge. Astronaut David R. Scott was working at the Rover. In the photo at right Irwin scooped a trench, with Mount Hadley in the background. A gnomon indicated the local vertical and the sun angle. Meanwhile CM pilot Alfred M. Worden, orbiting Hie moon in Endeavor, completed lunar and astronomic photography. for hours. Area was covered with craters, but strewn with very few large boulders; it was hilly, hut not rocky or rugged. First EVA began July 31 at 9:04 am EDT. Scott climbed down ladder, deployed mesa containing camera which recorded his descent, and stepped on lunar surface. Irwin followed and, while Scott removed TV camera from mesa and deployed it on tripod, Irwin collected contingency sample. Crew had difficulty deploying lev Rover; during checkout they found that front steering mechanism was inoperative and that there were no readouts on lev battery No. 2 amp-volt meter. Battery was found to be operating satisfactorily and decision was made to perform EVA-1 without LEV front-wheel steering. Crew mounted LEV and proceeded on EVA-1 traverse at 121:45 CET. Crew described EVA as \u201cexploration at its greatest,\" and repeatedly used words \u201cfantastic,\u201d \u201cbreathtaking,\u201d and \u201cspectacular\u201d to describe features as they rode Lrv at about eight km per hr {five mph). Scott said Rover handled quite well: \u201cIt negotiates small craters quite well, although there is a lot of roll. The steering is quite responsive . . . and 1 can maneuver pretty well. . . . There is no accumulation of dirt in the wire wheels.\u201d Stops at stations where crew collected lunar samples and took photos were broadcast on TV with excellent transmission. At end of traverse alsef was deployed. Scott and Irwin reentered LM after 6 hrs 33 min exploring surface, 28 min sooner than planned because Scott used up more oxygen than anticipated.\t' After resting inside LM, recharging and repairing portable life support system (plss), and reviewing plans for second EVA, astronauts left LM at 142:15 get (7:49 am Edt Aug. 1). Lrv was powered up, circuit breakers were cycled, and lrv front steering was found to be completely operational. EVA\u20142 traverse included stops at Spur Crater, Dune Crater, Hadley Plains, and area between Spur and Window craters. Numerous samples and photos were obtained and TV transmission was good. Crew completed heat Sow experiment initiated during EVA\u20141, collected core sample, and deployed U.S. flag. After stowing sample container and him in LM, astronauts reentered LM at 149:27 GET, after 7 hrs 12 min on surface during EVA-2. Third eva began at 163:18 get (4:52 am edt Aug. 2), 1 hr 45 min later than planned because of cumulative changes in surface activities timeline. Late start and requirement to protect nominal liftoff time required shortening EVA. Alternate EVA plan was devised with traverse west from lm to Hadley Rifle. Astronauts traveled to Scarp Crater, \u201cThe Terrace\u201d near Rim Crater, and Rim Crater, collecting samples and photographing lunar surface features. Scott tripped over a rock July 29-August 4: The command and service modules were photographed in lunar orbit from the lunar module, giving a view of the scientific instrument module (sim) bay, housing cameras and sensors to record data from the moon\u2019s surface and atmosphere. and fell, but experienced no difficulty in getting up. Astronauts retrieved drill-core-stern sections and samples near ALSEP, returned to LM, off-loaded LRV and stationed it for TV coverage of lm liftoff, and reentered lm at 168:08 get, after 4 hrs 50 min\u2014bringing total EVA time to 18 hrs 35 min. While lm was on moon Worden, orbiting moon in Endeavor, completed lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous. His observations included discovery of fields of cinder cones made by volcanic eruptions, delineation of landslide or rock glacier on northwest rim of crater on lunar farside, interpretation of ray-excluded 2one around crater P roc ulus as result of fault system, and discovery of layers on interior walls of several craters, suggesting volcanic collapse craters of calderas in maria. Scott and Irwin depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment, repressurized LM, and lifted off lunar surface with 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples at 171:34' get (1:11 pm edt Aug. 2)\u201466 hrs 55 min after landing on moon. Liftoff, accompanied by usaf anthem \u201cOff We Go Into The Wild Blue Yonder\u201d taped and broadcast by astronauts from LM, was photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon and was seen by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked successfully at 173:36 GET, as TV viewers watched. Scott and Irwin transferred from LM to csm with samples, equipment, and film, csm-lm separation and LM jettison were delayed one revolution to verify that CSM and LM hatches were completely sealed, LM ascent stage was jettisoned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 26Â° 22' north latitude and 15' east longitude at 181:30 get, 93 km (59 mi) west of Apollo 15 alsep site. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12, Apollo 14, and Apollo 15 seismometers. Orbit-shaping maneuver was performed during 73rd lunar revolution in preparation for subsatellite launch. Scientific subsatellite was launched at 222:39 get (4:13 pm edt Aug. 4) into lunar orbit with 141.3-km (87.8-mi) apolune and 102.0-km (63.4-mi) perilune. Hexagonal, 36-kg (80-lb) satellite 79 cm (31 in) long and 36 cm (14 in) in diameter carried three experiments and was housed in SIM bay with seven other new experiments. Satellite extended three l^-m (5-ft) booms, one with magnetometer to measure interplanetary and earth magnetic fields near moon and two for stabilization. Satellite also carried charged-particle sensors and equipment to detect variations in lunar gravity caused by mascons. Transearth injection maneuver at 223:49 get put CSM on trajectory for home after 85 hrs 18 min (74 revolutions) in lunar orbit. cm Endeavour separated from sm at 294:44 get. Drogue and main parachutes deployed but one of three main parachutes partially closed during descent, causing harder landing than expected. CM splashed down in mid-Pacific about 10.1 km (5.5 nm) from recovery ship U.S.S. Okinawa at 295:12 get (4:47 pm edt Aug. 7)-\u201412 days 7 hrs 12 min after liftoff. Astronauts, wearing fresh flight suits, were carried by helicopter to biomed area* on recovery ship for post-flight examinations. After being declared in very good shape, astronauts were flown on following day to Hickam afb, Hawaii, and to Ellington afb, Tex. CM was retrieved and placed on board recovery ship. Lunar samples, data, and equipment were flown to Ellington afb, and cm was off-loaded at San Diego. Mission achieved primary Apollo 15 objectives: to make seleno-logical survey and sampling of materials in preselected area of Hadley-Apennine region; emplace and activate surface experiments; evaluate capability of Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time, increased eva operations, and surface mobility; and conduct inflight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance were near nominal except for intermittent short circuit in Delta V thrust switch A, CSM\u2014LM failure to undock properly, and increase in CM tunnel pressure preceding lm jettison. Flight crew performance was excellent. Accomplishments included first use of Lrv, lunar surface navigation device, direct lunar communications without lm relay, and ground-controlled remotely operated TV camera on moon; largest payload in earth orbit (140 310 kg; 309 330 lbs) and largest payload in lunar orbit (33 803 kg; 74 522 lbs); longest lunar surface stay time, lunar surface eva, distance traversed on lunar surface (28 km; 17.4 mi), and lunar orbit time (74 orbits); first subsatellite launched in lunar orbit; and largest amount of lunar samples brought to earth. Apollo 15 was 12th Apollo mission to date, 9th manned Apollo mission, and 4th successful lunar landing mission. Apollo 14 mission had been conducted Jan. 31\u2014Feb. 3. Apollo program was directed by OMSf; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MSFC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and Ksc for launch operations.

At the end of their three days on the moon and six in lunar orbit, the astronauts . . . had gathered more scientific information about the moon than all the manned and unmanned spacecraft that had flown before them.\u201d Cameras and instruments in SIM had made first extensive observations from lunar orbit. One of first findings was confirmation that moon was not perfectly round and was dimpled. Evidence from seismometer was backed up by bistatic radar in which spacecraft signals were used to penetrate lunar surface to core. Seismometer\u2019s reception of LM\u2019s impact on moon indicated that even small explosion or impact could be recorded at extreme range and verified earlier hypothesis that meteorite impacts were being recorded daily from all over lunar surface. Addition of Apollo 15 station to existing seismic net completed triangular array of instruments for determining focal points of moonquakes. Data from cold cathode gauges at Apollo landing sites and mass spectrometer in orbiting Endeavour confirmed presence of thin lunar atmosphere. Spectrometer picked up pockets of neon and argon and scooped up carbon dioxide that had apparently burst from fissure near where sun was lighting lunar surface at daybreak. Other data obtained by Endeavour\u2019s instruments indicated lunar highlands were rich in aluminum and deficient in magnesium. Waterless basins were rich in magnesium and deficient in aluminum. Most highland regions contained three times as much aluminum as lowlands, and one mountainous region had five times as much aluminum as typical lunar basin. Magnetometer on subsatellite launched into lunar orbit discovered moon had electromagnetic boundary layer. Camera system recorded data for comprehensive map of areas never before flown over, with details and resolution previously impossible. Report by Astronauts David R. Scott and James B. Irwin of terracing along sides of Hadley Rille identical to terracing noted on sides of two tallest mountains in Apennine group\u2014Hadley Delta and Mt. Hadley\u2014 suggested mountains and Hadley Rille had been thrust up from moon by internal pressures that built up inside moon when object the size of state of Rhode Island struck moon and created Sea of Rains 4 billion yrs ago. Scientists had previously thought Hadley Rille to be younger than mountains and independent of their formation. Samples might hold clues to sun\u2019s history and its effects on earth climate, past and future. Walter Sullivan said in New York Times: \u201cSun-determined changes in the earth\u2019s climate have controlled man\u2019s history, from the ice ages that plagued the cave men to the desiccation that buried Middle Eastern civilizations, not under invading armies but invading sands.

The wave enveloped me the moment our lunar module, Falcon, cleared the peaks of the Apennines and pitched over for our final descent to the moon.\u201d Greatest thrill had been discovery of anorthosite rock: \u201c. . . I radioed to mission control, \u2018I think we found what we came for.\u2019 I must confess that the sight of that rock, sitting there millions of years waiting for our arrival, set off another wave of excitement for me.

You know, there are lots of eggs spread across the lawn, hut there\u2019s only one golden one, and there it was\u2014The Golden Egg.\u201d Astronaut James B. Irwin said, although others might describe moon as barren and desolate dead world, \u201cit can be a beautiful one to anyone who loves the mountains of earth. . . . When I first climbed down the ladder ... I was really taken back by those mountains [that] almost encircled Hadley Base. They seemed so close and so tall. But the real surprise was that the mountains, at first sight, were not grey or brown as I had expected. They were golden. Looking to the south and east, I saw the reflection of the early morning sun glancing off the mountains, especially Hadley Delta, giving them a glow of gold. It seemed like a friendly place, which surprised me. . . . you would have thought we would have felt a little lost, a little out of place. But no, I felt that I was where I should be.

Cosmos 434, launched Aug. 12, was said to have been test of variable-thrust, restartable rocket engine similar to onboard propulsion system in Apollo CSMs. Other launches identified by experts were Cosmos 379, Nov. 24; Cosmos 382, Dec. 2; and Cosmos 398, Feb. 26. Crucial hardware believed to be missing from launches was Saturn V-size booster. Some of these spacecraft had traveled farther in space than previous Soviet flights testing manned spaceflight equipment; at least three, including Cosmos 434, had demonstrated greater ability to maneuver in space than any previous Soviet manned flight. British space expert Geoffrey E. Perry, who had first announced discovery of Soviet launch site at Plesetsk in 1966, had said in telephone interview with Times that \u201cthe Russians have never made orbital changes to the degree that they have demonstrated on these Cosmos flights.\u201d He was convinced that \u201cthe Soviet Union is testing a large rocket engine similar to the one aboard Apollo. Even some of the velocity changes made by these Cosmos flights almost exactly match the velocity changes of Apollo for such maneuvers as lunar orbital insertion and trans-earth injection.\u201d All four Cosmos were believed to have been launched by Proton, D-type, or SL-4, nonmilitary boosters with about half the thrust of Saturn V.

Monitoring device, when tested over California lakes and offshore areas, had produced results that conformed closely to readings obtained by arduous direct sampling of waters. Ultimate goal was to develop satellite-borne system that could monitor global productivity of oceans. Dr. Charles A. Berry, nasa Director of Life Sciences, said newly completed studies of medical data from Apollo 14 had shown radiation exposure to crew that was more than twice that of previous Apollo missions. Primary reason for higher exposure was passage of Apollo 14 spacecraft close to Van Allen radiation belts. Dr. Berry said radiation dose was \u201cof no hazard or biological significance.\u201d Soviet scientists said later that cosmonauts carried special antiradiation drug on all space flights but had never used it. Dr. Berry said Apollo 14 Astronaut Stuart A. Roosa had lost 27% of fluid within his body cells during mission. His total body water had dropped 18% and red cells in his bloodstream had decreased 9%. Losses had been far less for other Apollo 14 astronauts and no such dramatic losses had been recorded for Apollo 15 astronauts, indicating that individual responses to space varied widely. Heavy loss of \u201cexchangeable\u201d potassium had been noted in astronauts during extended missions. On Apollo 15, loss had been as great as 15%. Potassium was deemed exchangeable because it could move readily in and out of tissues and thus could be purged from body. E. G.

It could be made from various materials depending on purpose. (NYT, 10/2/71; Pat Off pio) Tetr 3 (tetr-d) Test and Training Satellite, carried pickaback on Delta 2nd stage, was ejected into orbit with 571-km (354.8-mi) apogee, 391-km (243-mi) perigee, 94.3-min period, and 33.0Â° inclination. Primary objective of 45-lb (20.4-kg) secondary payload was to test Manned Space Flight Network and train msfn personnel. Second-stage anomaly of launch vehicle separated spacecraft at pitch angle outside normal sun acquisition limits. For eight hours following orbital insertion, ground controllers manually commanded spacecraft to despin. Pitch angle was then changed to place it within automatic acquisition range. Sail section was commanded to acquisition mode and sail acquired and locked onto sun at approximately 2:00 pin edt. Batteries were then charged. Orbit would permit observations for more than a year. Oso 7, improved over earlier osos, provided for increase in experiment size and weight and power and extended capability in pointed mode, including stability and pointing during night portion of orbit. It was spin-stabilized; weighed 636 kg (1403 lbs); carried six scientific experiments; and had two main sections\u2014wheel (lower), which carried nondirectional scanning experiments and basic support equipment, and sail (upper), which carried pointed experiments. Experiments, designed to continue and extend work of preceding oso spacecraft, were provided by gsfc, nrl, mit, Univ. of New Hampshire, and Univ. of California (San Diego). Oso 7 was 8th in series of 11 OSO spacecraft designed to provide direct observations of sun during most of 11-yr solar cycle. Oso 1 (launched March 7, 1962) and Oso 2 (launched Feb. 3, 1965) had passed their six-month lifetimes and together provided more than 8600 hours of scientific information, oso-c (launched Aug. 25, 1968) had failed to reach orbit when booster malfunctioned.

Shatalov, Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, and Nikolay N. Rukavishnikov. Soyuz 10 linked up with Salyut 1 for 5% hours, undocked, and reentered April 25. Second phase began June 6 with orbiting of Soyuz 11, carrying Cosmonauts Georgy T. Dobrovolsky, Vladislav N. Volkov, and Viktor I. Patsayev. Spacecraft docked with station June 7 and Soyuz 11 three-man crew transferred to Salyut 1 for 23-day stay. While on board, crew carried out comprehensive scientific and technical studies and experiments. Upon return June 30 after record-breaking near-24 days in space, three cosmonauts were found dead in spacecraft. Soviet authorities said deaths were caused by sudden loss of pressure in Soyuz capsule. Salyut 1 remained in orbit until Oct. 11, when braking engine was switched on to decelerate spacecraft; station began descending trajectory and entered atmosphere. Lost with Salyut 1 were films, tapes, biological samples, and scientific experiments left on board by Soyuz 10 cosmonauts.

(W Post, 11/12/71, A36) First photos were obscured by dust storm but before end of month Mariner 9 had shown that Mars bulged at equator, was \u201crougher gravitationally\u201d than expected, and probably had wide variety of rock compositions; instruments had detected small amounts of water vapor at south pole and warmer air pockets above pole [see Nov. 16-23]. Spacecraft also made man\u2019s first close photo of potato-shaped Martian moon Deimos [see Nov. 26\u201427] and photos of moon Phobos [see Nov. 29-30]. First Mariner photos from orbit were broadcast live by national TV network, but detail was limited by dust storms that had raged on surface since September. Dr. Robert H. Steinbacher, jpl project scientist, said \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that as the storm dies down we can get some good pictures of the dust settling to the surface. This is an unprecedented chance to watch changes in the Martian weather.\u201d He said that if cameras worked properly pictures would be 1000 times better than any earthbound telescopes had taken. On Nov. 14 spacecraft transmitted three sequences of TV pictures. Of more than 60 photos returned, only seven revealed surface features. Dust storm continued and atmospheric experts could see no sign of abatement. Dust obscuring planet was apparently very fine sand which high winds pushed to height of as much as 16 km (10 mi) above surface. On fourth orbit spacecraft successfully completed orbit trim maneuver at 9:44 pm est Nov. 15. Maneuver changed orbital period of spacecraft to make it synchronous with Mars viewing period of Deep Space Station antenna at Goldstone, Calif. New orbital parameters were 1394-km (866.2-mi) periapsis altitude, 11-hr 57-min 12-sec period, and 64.34Â° inclination. Data from remote-sensing instruments confirmed earlier observations that carbon dioxide was major constituent of Martian atmosphere and also suggested possibility of \u201chot spots\u201d on planet. Dr. Ellis D. Miner of JPL said sensor detected average temperature rise of 6.7 K (12Â°F) in area 24 km (15 mi) square below Mars equator. Temperature rise might indicate hole in cloud cover exposing mountain peak or plateau reflecting residual heat or evidence of internal source of heat on Mars, uv spectrometer data indicated dust storm was made up of fairly coarse-grained, sandlike particles, (nasa Proj Off; Wilford, NYT, ll/14r-16/71; O\u2019Toole, W Post, ll/14r-15/71; W Star, 11/16/71, A4)",

We are well prepared for the next logical steps in near-Earth space. I wish very much we could continue lunar exploration . . . but if we have to make hard choices in this decade, then the right choice is to return to Earth orbit and defer lunar exploration.\u201d nasa hoped to keep open option of additional Apollo missions in earth orbit. \u201cThis would enable us to carry out additional experiments in our Earth resources program, and would also facilitate our planning for cooperative flights with the Soviet Union.\u201d Worldwide demand for applications satellites could be met only by production of space shuttle. \u201cThe key to our ability to help our country and to serve mankind is now the shuttle.

      "story": " NASA held Mariner 9 press conference at JPL. Discussion centered on dust storm that had covered planet since mission began and on origin of Martian craters. Dr. Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said storm had begun 10 wks earlier, had reached peak of intensity in 5th wk, and was gradually but continuously clearing. Project scientists disagreed, however, how long dust would obscure Mars; predictions ranged from a few weeks to months. If storm continued throughout mission, primary objective might have to be changed. Dr. Smith explained prime objective \u201cwas to map 70 percent of the planet in high resolution. If the storm does not clear up immediately, it will not be possible to do that within the nominal mission. An alternative might be to focus on the phenomenon that we have on our hands; that is, the dust storm. And instead of studying it in bits and pieces and waiting for the planet to clear up ... to rearrange our sequences to make an all out study of this atmospheric phenomenon.\u201d Failure to complete mapping as planned would not significantly affect Viking Mars landing mission because, with only slight degradation, Viking zone could be mapped in last half or last third of Mariner 9 mission. \u201cAlso Viking has the capability to keep its landers in orbit for as long as two months while it does the mapping . . . [and] the capability to do some photographic site selection even if there were no usable pictures returned from \u201971.\u201d Dr. Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey described four high points on Mars, all with large summit craters, suggesting that they might be volcanic calderas. Great alignment of relatively young topographic highs with summit craters suggested that Mars was geochemically active\u2014that in not too distant past there had been extensive volcanic activity. Similar features might be found at lower elevations; they would be of interest because they had been, and still might be, hot. Such volcanic sources had, according to most opinions, produced terrestrial atmosphere; that is, carbon dioxide and water had come from such volcanic vents. Dr. Masursky emphasized that volcanic theory was not agreed on; project scientists\u2019 views ranged from \u201cagreement, to skepticism, to outright disbelief.\u201d Data on Mars moons Deimos and Phobos were described by Dr. James B. Pollack of ARC. Deimos was 12 by 13km (7% by 8% mi) and Phobos was 21 by 26 km (13 by 16 mi). Moons were \u201camong the darkest objects in the solar system,\u201d reflecting only about 5% of sunlight that fell on them. Moons\u2019 darkness could be attributed to basalts or carbonaceous chondrites in soil. If scientists could determine reason for darkness, they would soon be able to determine whether moons were captured asteroids or remnants of material from which Mars was formed. (Transcript)",

During that period a small part of a panorama was transmitted in which no discernible details were detected because of [the lack of] contrast. Now, it is still difficult to say what caused the termination of the transmission. It is possible that it was associated with the local peculiarities in the landing area, which are completely unknown, or with the dust storm raging at the time.

Mars 2 and Mars 3 dropped instrumented capsules on Mars surface. Mars 2 capsule crashlanded and Mars 3 capsule transmitted 20 sec. Lunokhod 1 lunar rover carried to moon on board Luna 17 Nov. 17, 1970, continued to explore lunar surface until October 1971, when isotope heat reserves were exhausted during its 11th lunar night. Japan launched two satellites\u2014Tansei and Shinsei. China launched Chicom 2, France launched Tournesol, U.K. launched Prospero, and Italy launched San Marco 3. (nasa Release 71\u2014245; NASA Lifting Body Off; GSFC Sounding Rocket Br; NASA Exec Secretariat; Sheldon, United States and Soviet Progress in Space, Library of Cong, 1/22/72) \u2022 NASA\u2019s scientific and societal achievements advanced national goal of alleviating environmental problems and expanding basic research on behalf of humanity, as public pressed for immediate, usable returns from research in all fields. Apollo manned missions swelled storehouse of lunar information. Unmanned astronomical missions gathered unique data, including new clues to Martian atmosphere. NASA-developed inventions saw increased use beyond space exploration\u2014in environmental sciences, communications, medicine, industry, and agriculture. U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. space meetings set stage for future joint space missions. And balanced program of space and ^aeronautics, despite low funding level, continued to raise U.S. prestige as aerospace pioneer while it worked to improve man\u2019s future. Some observers, however, warned of higher rate of technological advances abroad than in U.S. and of ever-growing U.S.S.R. space program and technological capability. Soviet expenditures on space were estimated at level about double U.S. peak expenditure of lÂ°/o of GNP when combined nasa-dod space program was at highest level and four times present level. Dr. James C. Fletcher was nominated new nasa Administrator by President Nixon. President of Univ. of Utah and former aerospace executive, Dr. Fletcher took office April 27. He succeeded NASA\u2019s third Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, who had resigned Sept. 15, 1970, to return to industry. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, had served as Acting NASA Administrator in the interim. Operating at lowest budget level since 1962, nasa in 1971 continued phase-out of Apollo program with successful completion of Apollo 14 and 15. Man\u2019s fourth landing on moon, in Apollo 15 mission, proved to many that man had an effective scientific role in space. At year\u2019s end, Apollo 16 had been scheduled for March 1972, with Apollo 17 to complete program later in year. Reduced funding forced additional reduction of personnel as well as program cutbacks, stretching out remaining Apollo missions, delaying first Skylab flight, and slowing studies of space shuttle, nerva nuclear rocket engine program was reduced to holding action. Bioscience funding was eliminated. Aerospace employment in industry throughout nation also fell, reflecting cuts in DOD spending as well as in NASA\u2019s. During year, however, Skylab hardware manufacture neared completion and space shuttle work continued. Shuttle preliminary design contracts were extended so that nasa could examine alternative configurations, contingent on Administration approval of shuttle development. In erts program, aircraft tested remote sensing devices for gathering earth resources data and first satellite for global monitoring of resources was scheduled for 1972. During 1971, instrumented aircraft measured air pollution, investigated corn blight infestation, and sought hidden natural resources. Pioneer-F spacecraft for planned 1972 launch and December 1973 Jupiter flyby went into final manufacturer\u2019s tests. Increased emphasis on aeronautics included research into aircraft noise reduction, increased air transport efficiency with use of supercritical wing, and STOL aircraft for transportation. To emphasize practical goals of space science, NASA established new Office of Applications, increased technology utilization budget from $1 million to $5 million, and issued request for proposals for additional uses of space-developed technology to solve problems of society. Among NASA projects were nsf contract to investigate use of solar cells to electrify homes and buildings and hud contract to study application of space technology to sewage recycling. Joint nasa-dot study resulted in recommendations for civil aviation R&d policy (card). Research achievements at NASA centers included ARC discovery of amino acids\u2014building blocks of life\u2014in second meteorite. Discovery strengthened case for chemical evolution of life elsewhere in universe. NASA FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion was $27 million more than requested $3,271 billion and $29 million above FY 1971 appropriation of $3,269 billion\u2014halting downward trend but far below 1965 peak of $5,250 billion.

Joint NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences meetings on compatible spacecraft rendezvous and docking system progressed to discussion of possible joint test missions. Data obtained by NASA\u2019s Mariner 9 and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 probes were exchanged under agreement that covered broad range of U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space science and applications. Agreement on future exchanges of medical and biological manned space flight data called for meetings between U.S. and Soviet experts at least annually. U.S. and U.S.S.R. exchanged Apollo 11 and 12 and Soviet Luna 16 lunar samples and Soviet scientists were among 750 experts attending Second Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute in Houston. First U.S.-U.S.S.R. Conference on Communications with Extraterrestrial Intelligence was held in Soviet Armenia. Joint meeting of NASA and European Space Conference (esc) identified candidate areas for possible European participation in U.S. post-Apollo space programs, including design and development of space shuttle subsystems. International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey at Univ. of Michigan was cosponsored by NASA, Dept, of State, usn, and aid to inform representatives of 51 countries and international organizations of latest techniques for interpreting earth resources data acquired by aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. nasa\u2019s C-130 aircraft equipped with remote-sensing devices participated in U.S. survey of Jamaica\u2019s natural resources undertaken at request of U.N. and Jamaican government. NASA signed agreement with West Germany for series of barium-ion-cloud (bic) probe launches, and new sounding rocket agreement was signed with France. Under sounding rocket agreement, 20 French Centaure and NASA Nike-Cajun rockets would be launched from Kourou Center, French Guiana, in cooperative France-U.S. upper-atmosphere research project. By end of year NASA had entered into cooperative agreements with 39 countries, including agreements on lunar samples, tracking and data acquisition, and geodetic satellite program. Scientists of 87 countries besides U.S. were participating in cooperative ground-based programs and personnel exchanges and 62 countries were exchanging scientific and technical information. Since the beginning of 1962, NASA had launched 21 satellites under international agreements, in addition to flying 21 international experiments on NASA satellites. Since the beginning of the sounding rocket program, 683 cooperative rockets had been launched for research, (nasa Release 71\u2014245; NASA Int Aff; \u201cSelected Statistics on Int\u2019l Affairs,\u201d 2/17/72; A&A, 1971)",
