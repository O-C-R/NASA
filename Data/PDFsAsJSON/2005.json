The new policy detailed broad principles and national security goals for providing access to space for military satellites, spy spacecraft, and other government missions, emphasizing the creation of a robust program for space exploration. The policy called for astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020, planned for future human missions to Mars, and supported the commercialization of large parts of the space industry. Under the new policy, the government would fund Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation rockets to launch government satellites through the end of the decade. At that time, the White House expected that the private sector would have developed launchers that were less costly and more flexible. The policy also reiterated President George W. Bush\u2019s plan for the retirement of the Space Shuttle at the completion of ISS constructionestimated to occur at the end of the decade. The projected retirement of the fleet required that the DOD and NASA recommend the best option for replacing the Space Shuttle.

In addition, the agencies would use heavy-lift rockets, which the military was developing, for satellites and other robotic missions.(U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, \u201cU.S. Space Transportation Policy Fact Sheet,\u201d 6 January 2005, http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=15010 (accessed 18 August 2009); Gwyneth K.

Members of the newly formed Personal Spaceflight Federation and its Industry Consensus Standards Organization voiced their concern that the government would attempt to implement additional regulations, thereby overregulating the new industry and stifling innovation. The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 required the FAA to issue licenses for the launches of privately built spacecraft and had given the FAA three years to issue rules for licensing. However, the Act also prohibited the FAA from issuing safety regulations for passengers and crew for eight years, unless specific design features or operating practices had resulted in serious or fatal injuries. U.S. Representative James L. Oberstar (D-MN), ranking member of the Transportation Committee, objected to that approach and had introduced his own bill (H.R. 656), requiring the FAA to include in its licensing rules minimum safety and health standards for spacecraft passengers and crew. FAA Administrator Marion C. Blakey agreed with regulation of private spaceflight in principle but suggested that such oversight needed to develop alongside the industry, emphasizing the difficulty in stipulating regulations for vehicles that did not yet exist.(Leslie Miller for the Associated Press, \u201cSpace Entrepreneurs Fret Over Federal Regulation,\u201d 10 February 2005; Kelly Young, \u201cFledgling \u2018Space Federation\u2019 Fears Over-Regulation,\u201d New Scientist, 11 February 2005; Beth Dickey, \u201cFAA Proposes Rules for Future Spaceliners,\u201d Government Executive, 15 February 2005; U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Aviation, Commercial Space Transportation: Beyond the X Prize, 109th Cong., 1st sess., 9 February 2005.)",

Without this zone, satellites would have no safe area in which to orbit. The discovery, which NASA described as unexpected, resolved a 40-year debate about how the safe zone forms and how the region clears after magnetic storms fill it with radiation. Previously, the prominent theory held that turbulence in the zone generates radio waves in space, which clear the radiation. However, lightning also generates radio waves. The research team had confirmed the lightning theory using a global map of lightning activity created from data that the Micro Lab 1 spacecraft had collected. The team had also collected radio-wave data from the Radio Plasma Imager aboard the Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) spacecraft, combining that data with archival data from the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft. These two data sets showed that radio-wave activity in the safe zone closely follows terrestrial lightning patterns; if the radio waves had originated in space rather than Earth, no such correlation would exist. Therefore, the team had concluded that lightning clears radiation within a few days following magnetic storms. According to NASA, engineers could eventually design spacecraft that generate radio waves at the correct frequency and location to clear radiation belts around other planets, enabling humans to explore planets and moons such as Jupiter\u2019s Europa.(NASA, \u201cNASA Finds Lightning Clears Safe Zone in Earth\u2019s Radiation Belt,\u201d news release 05-070, 8 March 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/mar/HQ_05070_radiation_belt.html (accessed 29 June 2009); Agence-France Presse, \u201cLightning Cuts Safe Zone Between Earth Radiation Belts: NASA,\u201d 9 March 2005.)",

Overall, the Bush administration had proposed a 2.4 percent increase in NASA\u2019s budget, with most of that increase directed toward funding travel to the Moon and Mars, initiatives requiring NASA to eliminate or reduce its other programs, such as aviation research. NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Aeronautics Research J. Victor Lebacqz defended the program, remarking that the United States remained a global power in aviation and had developed technologies to improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and increase efficiency of aviation operations. However, Lebacqz stated that NASA needed a clearer vision for the goals of the program. John M. Klineberg, a retired NASA official and industry executive, who had headed a National Research Council (NRC) study group in 2004, testified before the committee. The NRC study group had published a review of NASA\u2019s aeronautics programs. Klineberg warned against using the group\u2019s recommendations out of context to justify major cuts in programs. He testified that NASA\u2019s proposed aviation-research budget was a disaster, putting the program at risk of becoming irrelevant to the future of aeronautics in the United States and throughout the world. In an interview following the hearing, Klineberg emphasized that the study group had suggested consolidating and focusing programs but did not support budgetary cuts eliminating entire areas of research.(Warren E.

The new images, made with the HST\u2019s newest camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), were among the largest and sharpest the Hubble had yet captured, so sharp that, even if enlarged to billboard size, the image would preserve the stunning details. The new image of the Eagle Nebula revealed ultraviolet light originating from a group of massive hot stars and sculpting a tall, dense tower of gas. The new image of the Whirlpool galaxy, in addition to displaying its classic features, revealed a companion galaxy located at the end of one of the Whirlpool galaxy\u2019s arms. The launch of the HST in 1990 had ushered in a new era in astronomy. Before the existence of the HST, no telescope had viewed the universe in visible light from above Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which blurs light and causes images to appear fuzzy. Among its many achievements, the HST had helped astronomers calculate the precise age of the universe; helped confirm the existence of dark energy; detected small protogalaxies; proved the existence of supermassive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and demonstrated that the process of planetary system formation is common throughout the galaxy.(NASA, \u201cHubble Celebrates 15th Anniversary with Spectacular New Images,\u201d news release 05-104, 25 April 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/apr/HQ_05104_HST_anniversary.html (accessed 29 June 2009). 782 NASA, \u201cNASA Establishes Exploration Systems Advisory Committee,\u201d news release 05-106, 25 April 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/apr/HQ_05106_esac_meeting.html (accessed 29 June 2009).)",

In November 2003, the Voyager team had announced unusual events in the mission\u2019s history, signaling that Voyager 1 had reached the edge of the solar system. However, scientists disagreed as to whether the craft had actually encountered termination shock or was merely approaching the region at the edge of interstellar space. NASA explained that scientists had based the evidence that Voyager 1 had encountered termination shock on the craft\u2019s measurement of a sudden increase in the strength of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind, combined with an inferred decrease in speed, which happens when the solar wind slows down. Additionally, Voyager had observed an increase in the number of high-speed, electrically charged electrons and ions, as well as a burst of plasma-wave noise, which scientists had expected to occur when Voyager 1 passed the termination shock. Eric Christian, Discipline Scientist for the Sun-Solar System Connection Research Program at NASA Headquarters, remarked that Voyager\u2019s observations over the past few years had shown that termination shock is far more complicated than previously thought. When Voyager 1 entered the heliosheath, the craft was 8.7 billion miles (14 kilometers) away from Earth, the farthest any human-made object had traveled.(NASA, \u201cVoyager Spacecraft Enters Solar System\u2019s Final Frontier,\u201d news release 05-131, 24 May 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/may/HQ_05131_Voyager_agu.html (accessed 14 September 2009); Guy Gugliotta, \u201cVoyager at Edge of Solar System,\u201d Washington Post, 25 May 2005.)",

The last step produced vortexes\u2015or microscopic whirlpools\u2015throughout the resulting fluid. The vortexes provided conclusive evidence of superfluidity because, whereas rotating a container of normal fluid causes the fluid to spin, rotating a container of superfluid does not cause the frictionless superfluid to spin but, instead, produces vortexes in the superfluid that continue to spin as long as the fluid remains a superfluid.

In the past, scientists had usually analyzed changes in solar magnetic fields to forecast solar storms (also called solar flares), but this method had demonstrated limited reliability.

Using data from numerous NASA satellites, 130 astronomers from around the world found that short GRBs originate from neutron stars and not\u2015as some theories had suggested\u2015from supernovas. More specifically, satellite data showed that short GRBs originate from collisions involving a neutron star and either another neutron star or a black hole. However, the data was not conclusive regarding the exact type of collision that causes short GRBs, because the brevity of these events makes them difficult to observe directly.(Luigi Pir, \u201cShort-Burst Sources,\u201d Nature (London) 437, no. 7060 (6 October 2005): 822\u2013823; Dennis Overbye, \u201cScientists Trace Gamma Rays to Collision of Dead Stars,\u201d New York Times, 6 October 2005.)",

According to current scientific theories, a black hole\u2019s immense gravity is able to pull millions of stars close to the black hole and to destroy stars.

Furthermore, the number of stars near the black hole is around 10,000, far less than scientists would expect if the black hole\u2019s gravity had drawn the stars toward it. Therefore, the scientists had concluded that the Chandra data supports an alternative theory of why stars are near black holes.

In addition, JAXA officials reported that they were uncertain whether Hayabusa\u2019s probe had actually collected samples from the asteroid.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cJapan to Wait Two Years Before Starting Space Probe\u2019s Return,\u201d Washington Post, 15 December 2005; JAXA, \u201cStatus of the Hayabusa,\u201d news release, 14 December 2005, http://www.jaxa.jp/press/ 2005/12/20051214_hayabusa_e.html (accessed 28 July 2009).)",

      "story": " NASA announced that it would remove the potentially problematic foam insulation ramps from the Space Shuttles\u2019 external fuel tanks before the next Shuttle launch, which NASA had scheduled for 2006. NASA had examined the foam ramps after a portion of foam had separated from Discovery during its July 2005 launch, nearly striking the Shuttle. The event was similar to the one that had contributed to the destruction of Columbia in 2003. Engineers had designed the foam ramps\u2015formally called Protuberance Air Loads (PALs)\u2015to protect Shuttle tanks\u2019 fuel- pressurization lines and electrical cables from potentially damaging winds during launch. NASA technicians remained unsure of why the foam ramp had separated from Discovery, but inspections conducted in November 2005 had revealed small cracks in a PAL. The PAL with the cracks was on a tank that NASA had tested before Discovery\u2019s launch but had not used for that mission.(Warren E.

      "story": " Scientists using NASA\u2019s HST announced the discovery of two new rings and two new moons around the planet Uranus. The newly discovered rings\u2015faint bands of dust that undergo continual change, with dust spiraling out of the rings\u2015are replenished by debris from collisions between asteroids and the newly discovered Uranian moon called Mab. The discovery of the rings increased the number of known Uranian rings to 13. The discovery of the two moons, which the scientists named Cupid and Mab after mythological and Shakespearean characters, increased the number of known Uranian moons to 27, the most of any planet in the solar system. Scientists also remarked that the orbits of known Uranian moons had changed since Voyager 2 had last observed them in 1986. Scientists described the dynamic nature of Uranus\u2019s moons and rings as indicative of dynamism throughout the solar system. Scientists hoped that observing Uranus would help them better understand this dynamism.(Mark R. Showalter and Jack J.

      "story": " ESA launched the satellite Giove A on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket at 5:19 a.m. (UT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The satellite was the first component of a satellite navigation system called Galileo. According to ESA\u2019s plan, the Galileo system would consist of 30 satellites and would commence operations by 2008. ESA had created Galileo to reduce European dependence on the United States for satellite navigation services and to provide more accurate civilian services than the GPS, a system that the U.S. military had created. According to ESA, users who had mobile phones with integrated chips would be able to use Galileo to find directions to particular destinations, such as parks and restaurants. Galileo would be capable of providing civilian users with real-time positioning accuracy to within 1 meter (3.28 feet). Civilian services from the GPS were accurate to nearly 5 meters (16 feet).(Molly Moore, \u201cWith Satellite Launch, E.U.
