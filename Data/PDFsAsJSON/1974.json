Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of the Science Policy Research Div. In its manned program the U.S.S.R. had launched a Salyut 2 space station 3 April 1973 but a failure\u2014possibly a wildly firing thruster\u2014had damaged the station, which reentered the earth\u2019s atmosphere May 28. Other later attempts to launch and man a space station also appeared to have failed. Two manned launches, Soyuz 12 and Soyuz 13, had been successful in September and December, the second spacecraft remaining in space eight days to conduct astrophysical, biological, and earth resources experiments. By 30 June 1974 the United States expected to have spent $75 billion on combined military and civilian space programs since the beginning of the space program, spending about $4.7 billion in FY 1974. The Soviet Union did not publish space budget data, but its program was thought to be \u201cat least of the same magnitude as that of the United States at its former peak\u201d of $7.7 billion a year. The U.S. had several major space research and development centers operated by the military and private industry as well as NASA. There was no reason to believe the Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped but missiles of similar capabilities and different design philosophies which had appeared in Moscow parades \u201csuggest the existence of more than one design and development team for space work.\u201d The U.S. had launch vehicles scaled to lift payloads weighing from 9 kg to 136 000 kg. The Soviet Union had started to use in 1957 its original intercontinental ballistic missile and still used the same basic vehicle with stages added to improve performance. The very large Soviet vehicle predicted by NASA officials had not been seen. A Soviet lunar landing did not seem imminent but was still expected, as part of Soviet long-range plans, as soon as the problems of unreliable hardware were solved. U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. cooperation in space efforts was \u201cthe hope of well-intentioned people everywhere.\u201d Two motives for cooperation were to lessen tension and to save money. Although there was already exchange of information between scientists and engineers, \u201cno assessment of the overall prospects can be made successfully without forecasting the future political climate.\u201d (Text) Despite the loss of the prime power chain, causing automatic transfer to the backup system, Mariner 10\u2019s instruments continued scientific studies. Comet Kohoutek\u2019s tail was observed in the extreme ultraviolet range. On 13 Jan. hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensity, beginning 20° from the comet\u2019s nucleus, climbed rapidly as the nucleus region drifted toward the uv airglow spectrometer\u2019s field of view. The nucleus was scanned 16 Jan. On 17 Jan., while the spacecraft was powered down for its second trajectory correction maneuver, shutting off several instrument heaters allowed the TV optics heaters, which had failed to function earlier, to turn on. Scientists had feared that below-freezing temperature might prevent camera operation during the Venus encounter. On 21 Jan., instruments for Comet Kohoutek and solar wind experiments were turned on. On 22 Jan. the uv spectrometer measured hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensities out to 17° to map the comet\u2019s hydrogen cloud. Comet Kohoutek was scanned seven hours 24 Jan. by the UV spectrometer\u2014the only instrument of its kind to observe the comet from outside the earth\u2019s own hydrogen cloud. During the seventh and final roll calibration maneuver 28 Jan., telemetry indicated a rapid increase in the use of attitude control gas, the nitrogen gas supply dropping from 2.7 to 2.1 kg. The gyros were turned off and the spacecraft put into celestial control, with the sun and the star Canopus as references. Nitrogen-gas-use rate returned to normal and estimates of the supply indicated a comfortable margin for reaching Mercury and executing experiments. The backup electric power system was still in use, as studies of that problem continued. On 31 Jan. Mariner 10 was 3 200 000 km from Venus and 38 800 000 km from the earth, traveling at 30 238 km per hr.

Launched by NASA 3 Nov. 1973 toward Venus and Mercury, Mariner 10 would be the first two-planet mission, the first spacecraft to use gravity-assist from one planet to reach another, and die first to take closeup photos of Venus. Dr. S. Ichtiaque Rasool, nasa Deputy Director for Planetary Programs, said Venus was the planet most similar to the earth in size, density, and distance from the sun. If its atmosphere were like the earth\u2019s, Venus should also have similar temperature, but the temperature had been found to be very high, 755 K (900°F). And the atmosphere was 100 times denser than the earth\u2019s, in one theory acting as a blanket, absorbing the radiation that tried to leave the surface and giving a \u201cgreenhouse effect.\u201d Further, the Venus atmosphere had been determined by measurements from the earth and by U.S.S.R. spacecraft to be mostly carbon dioxide. Chief questions were: Why such a high temperature? Why such a heavy atmosphere? Why did the earth get all the liquid water and on Venus everything stayed in the atmosphere? The earfii had life because it had oceans. Why did it happen on earth and why did it not happen on Venus? And what could happen to the earth if pollution or other causes should increase its temperature? \u201cHow much increase in temperature do you need to have the whole thing go this way, and you become like Venus, not next week, but [in] millions of years. Is a process like that feasible at all on the earth?\u201d (Transcript)",

      "story": " Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the budget statement he had given at a 2 Feb. press briefing. The FY 1975 NASA budget plan for new authorization of $3,247 billion and spending of $3,273 billion, although a \u201cconstrained budget,\u201d would carry forward the programs planned in FY 1974. Goals and major programs were the same, with three new projects in space science and applications, but the space shuttle had been slipped four to six months. NASA\u2019s FY 1974 budget had \u201creflected a sharp temporary reduction, because of Government-wide fiscal problems . . . , below the $3.4 billion level previously planned as the long-term level.\u201d Increases in FY 1975 and later years were therefore \u201cin order to approach again the level required to maintain . . . advances in space and aeronautics for the rest of the decade.\u201d The FY 1975 increase of \u201cabout $100 million,\u201d however, was less than required to return to NASA\u2019s complete program as planned, and adjustments had been necessary. Principally, the first manned orbital flight of the shuttle was rescheduled to the second quarter of 1979, instead of the end of 1978, but NASA had a \u201cfirm commitment now\u201d that there would be no more slips for budgetary reasons, and none was expected for technical reasons. NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly said at the briefing the stretchout was expected to increase shuttle costs about $50 million \u201cin 1971 dollars.\u201d The $800 million requested for the shuttle was $89 million less than NASA had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. In the three new space flight projects, Pioneer Venus had top scientific priority as the next step in planetary exploration. Two missions launched in 1978 would study the Venus atmosphere for a better understanding of that planet and of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, meteorology, and climatology. In the second new start, seasat, an experimental applications satellite, would measure ocean characteristics to aid scientific understanding of ocean dynamics and determine if a forecasting system could be developed, seasat-a was to be launched in 1978. The third start, the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (hcmm), would launch an Explorer satellite in 1977 to make thermal measurements of the earth\u2019s surface to help find mineral resources and potential geothermal energy sources and to discriminate rock structures for planning civil works such as highways. NASA was asking $6 million to build the world\u2019s first large infrared telescope, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, for planetary research to complement planetary space flights, especially to provide data for the 1977 launch of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probe. Another new thrust, still in the planning stage, was the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) , to return the large amounts of data expected from the shuttle in the 1980s and permit phase-out of some tracking stations. NASA would not develop the spacecraft for the TDRSS but would lease satellite services from a private organization, beginning in CY1979. Analysis of data from the Skylab missions that were ending with the 8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4 would continue for many years. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project joint engineering and training activities with the U.S.S.R. were on schedule. All shuttle hardware prime contractors and most subcontractors had been selected, and the Dept, of Defense tentatively planned to modify an existing upper stage for use as an interim space tug with, the shuttle. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, was still working well, exceeding its design life by more than six months. ERTS-b, previously planned for 1976 launch, had been moved to 1975. A number of nasa and 11 commercial applications launches were scheduled during the year. A nominal communications satellite research program would be continued.

H.R. 10392 had been introduced 19 Sept. 1973 to authorize nasa research toward development of economical, energy-conserving systems with clean emissions and improved performance. Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified 4 Feb. that Lewis Research Center was testing epa\u2019s experimental engine, under a June 1973 agreement with epa on work toward a low-pollution gas-turbine-powered vehicle. Upgraded engine work would be completed by mid-1975 and vehicle performance evaluation before the end of CY 1975. First results of Jet Propulsion Laboratory investigations of hydrogen injection into fuel to improve efficiency and reduce pollution in conventional automobile engines promised achievement of 1977 Federal emission standards with 25% improvement in fuel economy. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin testified that, in addition to the gas turbine engine, a broader, longer range, advanced technology program was under way, with 13 industry contracts for such improvements as a low-emission combustor, higher-temperature heat exchangers, lower-cost turbine discs, turbine wheel cooling, and low-cost fuel controls. Dr. William H. Pickering, Jpl Director, reported a test automobile using bottled gas to inject hydrogen into the fuel had already met the carbon monoxide emission standard and had almost met the nitrogen oxide standard, although the hydrocarbon emissions remained a problem. With engine modifications to produce hydrogen from gasoline, instead of using bottled gas, performance per gallon of fuel was expected to improve 25% over the conventional engine. (Transcript) 4- 8 February: The first meeting of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization\u2019s Assembly of Parties was held in Washington, D.C. Seventy-two of the eighty-four member governments were represented. Raymond J. Waldmann (U.S.) was elected Chairman and Dr. Osama Anani (Jordan) was elected Deputy Chairman. Elected as Vice-chairmen were Ambassador Alejandro Orfila (Argentina), Ambassador Adolfo Alessandrini (Italy), Ambassador Leonard 0. Kibinge (Kenya), and Ambassador Motoo Ogiso (Japan). The Assembly of Parties found that the proposed U.S. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) and maritime satellite system would not interfere with the intelsat system, goes was technically compatible with the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital space by the existing or planned satellites. The maritime satellite system would not prejudice direct satellite telecommunication links. The Assembly refused a United Nations request for free use of INTELSAT satellites, although a priority access arrangement, for periods not exceeding 90 days during an emergency, would be worked out. (intelsat Release 74-12). 5- 22 February: Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, passed within 5800 km of Venus\u2014within 15 km of the planned aim point\u2014at 1:01 pm edt 5 Feb. The encounter sequence was accomplished according to plan and data were transmitted over the 45 million km between the earth and Venus at a rate of 117.6 kilobits per sec. Excellent ultraviolet cloud-structure pictures and new data on particle environment and mass, density, and shape of the planet were returned. Because Mariner 10 approached Venus on the dark side, the TV sequence was not begun until shortly before the encounter, at 12:21 pm edt. The spacecraft flew behind Venus at 1:07 pm edt for 20 min; TV signals were stored on tape and recovered without difficulty after Mariner 10 emerged from the occultation zone. During occultation, the spacecraft\u2019s radio antenna was aimed toward the edge of the planet so that the radio signals were bent around Venus by the extremely dense atmosphere and sent on to the earth. All science instruments functioned normally except the scanning electrostatic analyzer. The TV sequence was completed 13 Feb. after some 4165 pictures were returned to the earth. During the flyby, the 503-kg spacecraft used the gravitational field of Venus to slow its speed and direct the flight path toward a 29 March encounter with Mercury. By 22 Feb. Mariner 10\u2014its speed increasing as it came nearer the sun\u2014was traveling 3 million km per day toward the planet. Preliminary science results were presented at a press briefing 7 Feb. at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Herbert S. Bridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, said the solar wind was interacting with the ionosphere of Venus, producing a magnetic tail that could be detected as a modified plasma flow as far out from the planet as 500 Venus radii. Dr. James A. Dunne, Mariner project scientist, said the magnetic field doubled just before radio occultation but that no evidence of an intrinsic planetary magnetic field was found. Preliminary radio science results indicated that Venus was very round, 100 times less oblate than the earth, and confirmed that Venus had a dayside ionosphere. The mass of the planet was slightly less than that derived from previous data. Hydrogen was a major element of the Venus cloud deck, possibly present in droplets of sulfuric acid as well as water vapor. Manner 10 found no evidence of deuterium on the planet, indicating that the hydrogen had originated from the solar wind. Helium, carbon, and atomic oxygen were found in the atmosphere, with possible traces of argon and neon. Outer atmosphere temperature of 590 K (600°F) was suggested. TV data indicated a uniform main cloud deck with three or four layers and a stratified haze layer. TV pictures in uv showed a classical \u201cY\u201d feature that originated in the equatorial region and spiraled toward the pole. Clear circulation patterns could be seen at the poles, caused by rising gas transporting excess solar heat from the equatorial zone by convection. The atmosphere was smooth, with no swirling storms, (nasa mor, 11 March 74; Briefing transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 5 Feb. 74, 18; 6 Feb. 74, 1; Miles, LA Times, 6 Feb 74)",

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented nasa\u2019s $3.247-billion FY 1975 budget request\u2019 and program [see 4 Feb.] to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences to open hearings on the nasa authorization bill. In a review of FY 1974 accomplishments, Dr. Fletcher pointed out that as the Skylab program came to an end the three crews had traveled some 113 million km and orbited the earth 2475 times in a working scientific laboratory\u2014chalking up \u201cabout 100 miles per gallon of fuel.\u201d Skylab had focused on the sun, the earth, and man. \u201cApollo extended man\u2019s reach to the moon; Skylab added near-Earth to man\u2019s domain.\u201d In answer to questions Dr. Fletcher said the principal difference between nasa\u2019s minimum request to the Office of Management and Budget and the final figures sent to Congress by the President was the $89 million subtracted from the shuttle program, causing a four- to six-month delay. Other differences brought a total decrease of $124 million below \u201cwhat we could have gotten by with without any major changes\u201d in nasa\u2019s program. The proposed minimum budget would not have restored any of the programs nasa had had to drop because of FY 1974 budget cuts and therefore had been \u201cwell below the constant level\u201d envisaged for nasa in FY 1973. Of $7.9 million cut from aeronautics programs, the chief reduction was in the quiet propulsion lift technology program, deleting the system integration model effort. Deletion of $1 million from the requested technology utilization increase canceled proposed increases in numbers of dissemination centers and reduced buildup of support to state and local governments. A $5.7-million cut in the amount requested for earth observations instruments had deferred their development. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, said there had been \u201csome discussions during the past several months\u201d of an omb proposal to consolidate weather satellite programs under the Department of Defense. NASA, dod, omb, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had decided \u201cto keep separate systems for the dod and NASA [with NOAa], but we will make maximum use\u201d of hardware commonality in building satellites for them.

Early research had shown that high-temperature thermionic converters combined with a compact nuclear reactor could provide an efficient power plant for advanced planetary missions. NASA technology would now focus on thermionic energy conversion for achieving highly efficient operation at lower temperatures. During the Apollo and Pioneer programs, NASA had proved the advantages of a small (40- to 70-w) radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator power system, which had operated at 6% efficiency at a cost of $20 million per kilowatt. NASA was developing technology for a 0.5- to 2.0-kw gas-turbine conversion system (Bray-ton energy conversion system) to achieve efficiencies of 25% and reduce costs to one fourth. Gaseous-core nuclear rocket research had led to plasma-core reactors as advanced energy sources for terrestrial as well as space propulsion uses; use of uranium hexafluoride as plasma fuel was expected to achieve efficiencies of more than 50%. Lewis Research Center research into superconducting magnets and plasma confinement and heating in advanced steady-state schemes was expected to show within a year whether a superconductive magnetic apparatus (summa) could produce fusionlike plasmas as predicted.

Mars 6 and 7, launched 5 and 9 Aug. 1973, would approach Mars in March. During a 22 Sept. 1973 interview with Tass, Director Roald Sagdeyev of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences had said one of the four Mars probes would softland near the Martian south polar cap to test the physical properties of the soil and surface rocks and check the possibilities of transmitting TV pictures of the surrounding terrain to earth.

At 8.1 min from launch, after normal separation from the Titan booster, the Centaur main-engine start failed and the vehicle automatically went into the restart sequence. A second attempt to start the engine failed at 9.2 min after liftoff. Since the vehicle had not achieved orbital velocity the Range Safety Officer at the Antigua, West Indies, tracking station transmitted destruction commands and the Centaur was destroyed at 12,5 min after the liftoff. The vehicle fell into the Atlantic Ocean 3530 km downrange. Inflight data indicated that the liquid-oxygen boost pump had failed to operate during both attempted engine starts. A committee was formed to investigate the failure and recommend corrective action. Although the primary objective of demonstrating the capability of the Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was not accomplished, some objectives were fulfilled: demonstration of the capability of the launch facility to support a Titan-Centaur launch, structural integrity of the vehicle, Centaur guidance and control of the Titan, Titan-Centaur separation, and Centaur standard shroud capability. The Viking Dynamic Simulator had been instrumented to verify flight loads for the two planned 1975 missions to Mars. Remaining attached to the Centaur stage, the vds was to have flown a typical Viking launch trajectory with a shortened bum to limit the spacecraft to a low earth orbit, to test the guidance system, and estimate injection accuracy. The sphinx Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment spacecraft had been intended for launch into an elliptical orbit to investigate the effect of charged particles in space on high-voltage solar cells, insulators, and conductors. The launch vehicle combined NASA\u2019s versatile high-energy liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen Centaur upper stage with the Air Force-developed Titan III booster, a two-stage liquid-propellant core rocket augmented by two strap-on solid-fueled rocket motors. It was designed to fill the performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and the Saturn vehicles and boost NASA\u2019s heaviest unmanned payloads into orbit or interplanetary trajectories. The first of six scheduled operational missions\u2014the U.S. and West German Helios solar probe scheduled for the fall\u2014would be configured to a two-burn mission to obtain data lost on the proof flight. The Titan-Centaur program was managed by NASA\u2019s Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center was responsible for the Titan-Centaur system. The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Organization was responsible for the Titan IIIE booster, including aerospace ground equipment and Launch Complex 41 site activation.

Another concept, for an attachable SEP module, would provide propulsion only and depend on spacecraft subsystems for all other functions, seps would carry a cluster of six to nine thrusters, fueled by ionized mercury, and two lightweight 27-m solar-array wings to supply 25 kw of power to the thrusters and payloads. It was being designed for use with the space shuttle and space tug, and application of an attachable Sep module to a Mariner spacecraft was being studied. The tug, supplemented by seps, would be able to deploy and retrieve a 2500-kg geosynchronous equatorial payload in 100 days, tripling the amount the unaided tug could deliver. After one delivery, the seps could continue to operate between the shuttle orbit and intermediate orbits, delivering and retrieving 20 more payloads before the thruster life was used up.

The tentative payload model\u2014presented to Congress in October 1973 to show \u201cwhat could be done in the 1980s\u201d when the space shuttle was in use\u2014included as many as 10 missions to the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn. In 1990 and 1991 two very heavy payloads might be sent to orbit one of Jupiter\u2019s moons and land an instrument package. Tentative missions to the inner planets included five missions to Venus, one of them with a lander, and two spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Tentative Mars missions included one spacecraft to orbit the planet, two landers, and two to return samples from the two moons of Mars. Lunar missions under consideration included a lunar polar orbiter in 1979, two other orbiters in the 1980s, two lunar rovers in the 1980s, a lunar halo satellite to ensure communications with the hidden side of the moon, and two lunar rovers in 1990 and 1991 that could return samples to the earth from any point on the moon. Other plans under consideration were a flyby and rendezvous with Comet Encke and a landing on the nucleus, a flyby of Haley\u2019s Comet in 1985, and two missions to asteroids in 1986. Of the 810 total payloads, 57 were designated for planetary exploration and 753 for earth orbit. Scientific satellites for earth orbit were Large Space Telescopes, High Energy Astronomical Observatories, Large Solar Observatories, Large Radio Astronomy Observatories, and x-ray telescopes. The large spacecraft would be unmanned but visited regularly by space shuttle crews and brought back to earth for refurbishing. In the applications field were large Earth Observatory Satellites. And NASA expected to orbit 120 communications and navigation satellites for other agencies or private industry through 1991, not including those for DOD. Of some 300 payloads to be flown in the Spacelab, most would be NASA payloads in the fields of astronomy, physics, earth observations, earth and ocean physics, communication and navigation, life science, and space technology. Of non-NASA payloads, 10 would be for private industry space processing, beginning in 1985. Some 10% were expected to be flown for foreign users. The large number of contemplated missions, even with the increasing number of U.S.S.R. launches, was expected to have very little impact on the environment. Effects of the major constituents of the solid-fueled rocket booster exhaust\u2014water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and aluminum oxide\u2014would be negligible. (Text)",

Gatch \u2019was lost at sea while attempting the first transatlantic balloon flight. Gatch lifted off from Harrisburg, Pa., 18 Feb. in a two-meter sealed gondola, the Light Heart, suspended from 10 helium-filled balloons. He hoped to reach 12 000-m altitude and ride the jet-stream winds across the Atlantic to Europe, but changes in air currents pushed him south of his planned course. Radio contact was made with Gatch 19 Feb. by an airliner 1600 km east northeast of Puerto Rico. He was spotted at 305-m altitude 21 Feb. by a Liberian ship 1670 km off the coast of Africa. Further inconsistent and unconfirmed radio contacts and sightings made tracking Gatch\u2019s balloon difficult. After reports of a sighting on the Spanish Sahara, the Spanish Foreign Legion searched the 480-km Moroccan-Spanish Sahara border for two days, while U.S. military aircraft and ships were put on lookout. The Dept, of Defense ordered an intensive visual radar and radio search 1 March of the Atlantic Ocean 1530 km west of Africa, but the search was given up 6 March after exploration of 578 000 sq km of ocean.

Scientists had thought the solar wind reached the earth because of an expansion of the sun\u2019s corona, but Skylab data indicated the sun\u2019s magnetic fields confined the corona material and pulled it inward. The corona expanded and escaped in a significant amount only through coronal holes in the magnetic field. Dr. Charles A.

However, after the 59-day Skylab 3 mission the compensating response of the blood-forming elements was faster, returning the mass almost to the pr'eflight level within two weeks after splashdown\u2014rather than the six weeks required after the 28-day Sky-lab 2 mission. The Skylab 4 crew (which splashed down Feb. 8 after 16 Nov. 1973 launch) showed much less red blood cell loss and a much faster return to preflight levels after the 84-day mission, indicating adaptive changes to the space environment.

To provide organizational focus, a Research Division had been reestablished, to which the oast Research Council would report its evaluation of NASA\u2019s basic research. New research included an acoustic composite nacelle program to reduce noise and fuel consumption and a program to develop new higher performance materials for advanced turbine engines. New starts in long-haul technology, including the active control aircraft program and a remotely piloted research vehicle, would help increase productivity and efficiency, environmental acceptability, and reduced fuel consumption. A new Office of General Aviation Technology had been organized in FY 1974 to improve aircraft and increase safety. Research using a new low-speed airfoil, a derivative of NASA\u2019s supercritical wing research, showed a 30% increase in maximum lift and a 50% increase in the lift-to-drag ratio over conventional airfoils. New programs in advanced avionics technology, including microelectronics and digital circuitry, would provide practical low-cost systems for general aviation. (Transcript)",

The spacecraft would be shuttle-retrievable for refurbishment and reflight with advanced solar physics experiments in the 1980s. Requested funding for the Large Space Telescope (Ls\u2019r) for FY 1975 was $6.2 million, to proceed with design of telescope optics, detectors, and support systems. NASA had originally planned to spend about $10 million in FY 1975 on the lst\u2014to be launched on the space shuttle in 1980\u2014but reduced the request to reflect the four- to six-month delay in shuttle development. NASA\u2014in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, and West Germany\u2014was developing an Aries sounding rocket to support the physics and astronomy program. Aries, which used the 2nd stage of surplus Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles, would provide a greater lift and longer flight time than possible at the price of rockets now in use. Cost overruns on the 1975 two-spacecraft Viking mission to Mars could total 10% of the original $838-million estimate for the program because of hardware development problems. Major problems with the biology instrument included packing the sophisticated instruments into a small volume, development of very small valves to inject sufficiently small amounts of nutrients into Martian samples, and thermal control. The instrument was running $21.2 million over the budgeted cost. Difficulties also had been encountered in producing enough 0.005-cm plated magnetic wire of uniform characteristics for the onboard computer. Dr. Naugle said that, although the overall coniplexity of the spacecraft had been underestimated, \u201cwe expect these problems to be solved and to launch both Viking spacecraft on schedule in 1975.\u201d (Transcript) Experiments were designed to demonstrate an attitude control accuracy of better than three arc minutes using a gas jet system, measure the performance in orbit of operational infrared sensor components, demonstrate an inexpensive Canopus sensor of high reliability, measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft, determine interference generated by the propane gas control system, demonstrate a basic sensing element with application in digital sun and earth albedo sensors, and measure degradation of silicone solar cells in orbit.

Because of die anomaly, the spacecraft batteries had overheated and data collection from the main telemetry system had been discontinued; since 22 Aug. 1972, data from the primary experiment had been transmitted through the backup system, which operated on solar cells only. Flight data showed that the bumper concept was six times more effective than a single-wall structure, twice the anticipated effectiveness.

There had been no demonstration that the aircraft could work effectively in a massive air battle. In addition, GAO questioned whether the aircraft\u2019s large radar would be susceptible to enemy jamming from distances as great as 320 km and whether the planes would become high-priority targets. Sen. Eagleton therefore had requested the Senate Armed Services Committee to deny aw ACS production in 1974. (Getler, W Post, 11 March 74, A2) 11, 21 March: Joint hearings on the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act, S. 2495, were held by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the Committee on Commerce. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said NASA supported the broad objectives of the bill, which would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to establish within NASA an Office of Technology Applications to support the proposed National Resources Council. However, NASA already had an effective technology utilization program and did not require additional authority to ensure that its technological capabilities were effectively used. Dr. Fletcher said he could give more support to the bill if the responsibility for a proposed survey of technological resources were given to the existing Domestic Council. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National Science Foundation Director, said technology coordination and planning analysis could be more effectively done by an augmented Federal Council for Science and Technology than by the proposed Council. In addition, although NASA had great technological resources, it was essential that mission agencies should be held to their originally defined responsibility. Dr. Philip Handler, President of the National Academy of Sciences, said the bill unduly emphasized technological resources of NASA and the aerospace industry, when the real issue was how to use the entire Federal science and technology effort in combination with private industry resources within coherent national programs and plans. Instead of direct authorization to NASA, a similar amount should be made available to the President or a council, such as the Council of Economic Advisors or the Council on Environmental Quality, to allocate and coordinate. Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., President of the National Academy of Engineering and former NASA Deputy Administrator, favored a compact organizational structure with leadership appointed by the President and a research staff independent of all agencies and industry. NASA-developed technology could be used with that in other agencies and private industry. NASA laboratories should be used whenever appropriate. Employees and facilities of Lewis Research Center, which was preeminent in the fields of air-breathing and space-propulsion systems, could be applied effectively to energy research and development.

Currie, Dept, of Defense Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testified on dod space programs before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1975 NASA authorization hearings: dod would provide an interim, upper, orbit-to-orbit stage (oos) for initial use with NASA\u2019s space shuttle until NASA could develop a permanent space tug. The oos, which would provide the high orbits necessary for about 60% of military payloads, would be a low-cost modification of an existing upper stage and would be phased to coincide with the first operation of the shuttle orbiter in 1980. About $3.0 million would he spent in FY 1975 to select stage configuration and initiate detailed specifications. The oos would have no payload retrieval capability and might not be reusable but could be used by NASA or any other shuttle user during early shuttle operations, dod would install facilities to provide initial shuttle capability at Vandenberg Air Force Base in December 1982. Shuttle hardware, software, operating procedures, and ground equipment would be common and interchangeable to the maximum extent possible between KSC and Vandenberg. During FY 1974 DOD had initiated the development and validation plan for the navstar Global Positioning System, using satellites to provide worldwide precise positioning and navigation, accurate to tens of meters. The system, usable for civilian purposes as well as military, would halt the proliferation of specialized systems. The Navy\u2019s Fleet Satellite Communications System (fltsatcom) , to provide reliable beyond-the-horizon communications for command and control of mobile DOD forces, was \u201cwell into development.\u201d Terminal equipment for the fleet would be installed in FY 1975 and FY 1976 and would be operated through minimal leased transponders in Communication Satellite Corp.\u2019s Maritime Communications Satellite System pending full operation of fltsatcom in 1976. Three operational early warning satellites were in geostationary orbit. DOD would seek to improve coverage and mission duration and continue development of a simplified processing station.

The device, Nu-Life, made up of two tiny video display screens and a miniature computer, was operated by inhaling and exhaling into a plastic tube or controlled by eye rotation, a turn of the head, or a touch of the tongue. (AP, B Sun, 21 March 74, A3) 23 March-5 April: NASA\u2019s Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, became the first spacecraft to explore Mercury, during a 12-day flyby of the planet\u2014 returning some 1700 TV photos and much new information on its atmosphere, surface, mass, and shape. The incoming encounter sequence began 23 March at 5 600 000 km from Mercury, transmitting the clearest photos yet taken of the tiny planet. Although most of the photos were recorded on tape before transmission, real-time photos with reduced resolution were sent to analyze the reflective properties of Mercury at different lighting angles. By 28 March photos were showing the-planet to he heavily cratered like the moon. During the incoming near-encounter, from 17 to 3% hrs before encounter, 18 frames were transmitted. Mosaics were made for locating smaller areas photographed later at higher resolutions. Spacecraft instruments identified an extremely thin atmosphere surrounding the planet, containing helium at concentrations above lunar levels and small amounts of neon, argon, and possibly zenon. Mariner 10 passed within 704 km of Mercury at 4:47 pm edt 29 March, within 56 km of the aim point. Data were transmitted without interruption over the 150 000 000-km distance until earth occultation began at 4:50 pm edt. Radio signals were recovered following the 12min occultation. Photos of the planet\u2014described by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory as \u201csuperb\u201d\u2014showed details less than 1.6 km in size and covered almost half the planet\u2019s surface, which was pocked with craters as deep as 32 km and between 8 and 160 km wide. Giant cracks in the surface suggested high heat beneath. Some ancient volcanic activity was seen in a few rille-like ravines that crossed the craters and domelike hills. Absence of halo craters indicated young craters probably had been covered by the dust storms that constantly swept the planet. At a jpl press briefing following the encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher said onboard instruments showed that Mercury had an unexpected magnetic field, estimated to be 1 % that of the earth. The magnetic field was measured at 90 to 100 gammas at the spacecraft\u2019s closest approach, with an extrapolated value at the surface of 100 to 200 gammas. As Mariner 10 raced by Mercury on 30 March, photos of the morning side of the planet showed a much smoother region than the rugged area seen under the afternoon sun. The north pole region appeared much less pitted and flatter than the south pole. Instruments found that Mercury was two-thirds iron, making its density greater than previously believed and probably responsible for the unexpected magnetic field. Concentrations of uranium and thorium were comparable to those on the earth. Preliminary results, presented at a 31 March press conference at jpl, included a Mercury mass measurement 100 times better than previous ones, a detached well-defined bow shock wave, a temperature varying from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side (\u2014 300°F to 800°F) with no thermal anomalies detected, opaque surface soil with the top few centimeters 1.0 to 1.5 times as dense as water and 50% as porous, and high-energy electrons in the mev range observed from 700 to 5000 km above the surface. An ultraviolet scanner had detected what appeared to be an egg-shaped moon moving in orbit around Mercury, but the Mariner navigational team later identified the object as a dim but very hot star, known as 31 Crater in the constellation Corvus. Despite a power anomaly, Mariner 10 continued to transmit TV pictures in real-time at 117.6 kilobits per sec and tape-recorded frames at 22.05 kbps. TV imagery was discontinued 5 April when the resolution became equal to that of earth-based telescopes. All mission events were accomplished as planned and the mission was adjudged successful 22 April. The spacecraft was expected to swing back by Mercury in September, (nasa mor, 24 April 74; jpl Press Kit, 19 March 74; NYT, 24 March 74, 30 March\u20141 April.74; W Post, 29 March\u20141 April 74; W Star-News, 28 March 74; LA Times, 20 March-1 April 74)",

The Taurus-Littrow landing site for the 7-19 Dec. 1972 final mission of the lunar landing program had been the most diverse in both geologic features and samples brought back. Seismic traverse experiments had indicated basaltic flows extended to a depth of 1.2 km. The traverse gravimeter experiment had provided limits to the density of underlying material and permitted development of models to help interpret mascons. Analysis of mare basalts from the Apollo 11,12,15, and 17 missions and from the U.S.S.R.\u2019s Luna 16 indicated that the filling of the mare basins took place mostly between 3.2 billion and 3.8 billion yrs ago. Formation of more than 90% of the cratering was believed to be 4 billion yrs earlier. Highland material collected on Apollo 14,16, and 17 missions showed a widespread occurrence of breccias with an apparent age of 3,8 billion to 4.1 billion yrs, with strong evidence that rocks as old as 4.5 billion to 4.6 billion yrs existed on the moon. Dark mare regions were thought to be underlain by lava, but craters had been mostly caused by impacting projectiles. The moon was once active volcanically but was now quiet, with any activity since 3 billion yrs ago highly restricted or nonexistent. It had a crust more than 60 km thick and a negligible overall magnetic field. Two theories of lunar evolution had come from mission data. The first was that the planet was chemically layered during its formation, with a low interior temperature gradually increasing, perhaps reaching the melting point in the last billion years, while the initial heat of the exterior gradually decreased. The second theory assumed that the moon, chemically homogeneous and molten during formation, underwent extensive chemical differentiation resulting in surface concentration of radioactivity very shortly after formation. None of the three theories of origin of the moon\u2014separation from the earth, capture from a solar orbit, or formation from a dust cloud\u2014could be absolutely eliminated by data collected to date, but chemical differences made it unlikely that the moon was torn from the earth.

The space animals were sluggish immediately following spacecraft recovery but their memory and coordination remained unimpaired. Capillary blood showed major changes in content, and bone marrow cells were markedly reduced in number. Organs taken from a group of rats that had undergone autopsy within 24 hrs of spacecraft'recovery showed no major pathological changes except for a marked weight reduction in the lymphoid glands and a small increase in the adrenal glands. The changes were viewed as stress reaction to flight conditions. A degree of atrophy had been noted in the hind muscles. Most of the disorders disappeared in a second group of rats during a 25-day observation period before autopsy.

Spacecraft and experiment assembly was to be complete by mid-1974. A cooperative program with the European Space Research Organization, called International Sun-Earth Explorers (isee), planned three satellites to make simultaneous measurements. Two spacecraft, \u201cMother\u201d built by the U.S. and \u201cDaughter\u201d built by ESRO, would travel close together in the same highly elliptical orbit, measuring magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and plasma properties.

The spacecraft would travel around the sun and close to the earth to learn what radiation was impinging on the earth\u2019s magnetosphere.

A cooperative effort with esro and the United Kingdom would be the International Ultraviolet Explorer (iue) scheduled for launch into geosynchronous orbit in 1976 to observe high-resolution spectra in the uv with a telescope controllable from the ground in real time.

NASA had defined no technical need for U.S. representatives at the Soviet launch site during actual liftoff; U.S. specialists would be in the control center. Apollo docking module and Soyuz life-support-system tests were reviewed, in addition to safety assessment reports on control systems and spacecraft manufacturing test and checkout. Schedules for each of the five joint experiments\u2014ultraviolet absorption, biological interaction, microbial exchange, multipurpose furnace, and artificial solar eclipse\u2014 were approved. Agreement was also reached on the basic approach and content of the joint flight readiness review, to be held in May 1975. The U.S.S.R. crew and U.S. astp Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton walked through hundreds of procedures for the first time as crews, to verify the integrity of the docking module that would connect the Soyuz and Apollo command and service modules. At a 26 April press conference Stafford demonstrated his proficiency in the Russian language by answering newsmen\u2019s questions in Russian.

The heat sources caused the atmospheric gases to rise locally to lower pressures. As the altitude increased the gases condensed, forming the aerosols that colored the clouds. The aerosols then sank and were again evaporated by the higher pressures and temperatures, creating an up-and-down circular motion within the red spot. Dr. Gehrels said that the spot \u201cis not a unique feature.\u201d Pioneer 10 photos showed other areas of rising clouds. \u201cWe see quite a few of these that occur in equatorial regions.\u201d Dr. James A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa scientist, said that Jupiter had been identified for the first time as a source of energetic particle emissions. The earth had been known to be a feeble emitter but Jupiter emitted particles at a strength detectable from fractions of an astronomical unit up to four or five au from Jupiter. The discovery had dramatically changed interplanetary science from its traditional hypothesis that energetic particles observed in space had come only from the sun or from local acceleration.

Klebesadel of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory said that satellites, placed in a 100 000-km orbit as part of the Air Force Vela series developed to monitor the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has monitored 27 high-intensity explosions in space over four years. The explosions, which had produced unusually large amounts of gamma and x-ray energy, might be in the Orion arm of the galaxy, where the earth was. Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said nine current theories of the origin of the explosions included exploding stars, or supernovas; objects falling into neutron stars; and unusually large solar flares or sunstorms on distant stars.

Poritzky said it was NASA\u2019s responsibility to build a technology base for aeronautics through innovative independent research in addition to undertaking directed research in response to specific problems. Also vitally important was NASA\u2019s responsiveness to the needs of other agencies. Airlines recommended a $24.5-million increase in funding for NASA\u2019s aeronautical programs\u2014 for propulsion environment-impact minimization, aircraft operations, alternative fuels, wake-vortex minimization, and noise research. James J. Hartford, Executive Secretary of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, testified that some cuts in the NASA budget were \u201cpenny wise and pound foolish.\u201d Additional but \u201crelatively modest\u201d funding would prevent the High Energy Astronomical Observatory (heao) program\u2014which was to investigate the scientifically exciting black holes in space\u2014from \u201climping along.\u201d Scientists had been skeptical of the usefulness of the space shuttle to science, but the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount discoveries had so far exceeded expectations that astronomers \u201ccould hardly wait\u201d for the Large Space Telescope, planned for launch on the shuttle. \u201cThat project unified the space science community\u201d as \u201cnothing ever did in the past.\u201d Other \u201clogical follow-ons\u201d to the approved program were urged: Mariner Jupiter-Uranus 1979 mission, Jupiter orbiter, Venus atmospheric probe, and a follow-on to the Viking Mars 1975 with a rover capability. Hartford also suggested that NASA and other Government agencies were not doing enough work in space applications. Cuts in NASA\u2019s communications satellite research and development program had been based on the incorrect assumption that private industry could take on full comsat r&d with no further Government stimulus. Early commercial exploitation of communications R&D had been rapid only because Government research had reduced risks to an acceptable level. Competition was now coming from Canadian, Japanese, and European organizations with \u201ca lot of government backing\u201d who had developed a technical capability approaching that of the U.S. and were willing to take high risks.

The spacecraft entered a lower-than-planned transfer orbit with a 32 895km apogee, 180-km perigee, 9-hr 37-min period, and 24.5° inclination. The apogee boost motor boosted the spacecraft into a near-geostationary orbit with a 32 828.3-km apogee, 30 747-km perigee, 20-hr 39-min period, and 2.0° inclination, with an eastward drift of approximately 56° per day.

The automatic station was separated from a platform rocket system in earth orbit and put into a close-to-planned trajectory for the moon. A flight-path correction maneuver 30 May aimed the spacecraft toward a selected area of near-moon space. Luna 22 went into circular orbit of the moon 2 June, with a 220-km apogee, 220-km perigee, 130.0-min period, and 19.6° inclination. The Soviet press reported 3 June that all instruments aboard the spacecraft were functioning normally and scientific investigation of the moon had begun. Luna 22 was transferred into an elliptical orbit with a 244-km apogee and 25-km perigee 9 June to take detailed TV photos of the lunar surface and to study surface relief using an onboard altimeter. Chemical composition of rocks was obtained by determining the gamma radiation. After completion of the photography program the spacecraft was moved to an orbit with a 299-km apogee and 181-km perigee. By 19 June Luna 22 had completed 187 orbits of the moon; all equipment continued to function normally, (gsfc SSR, 30 June 74; Tass, fbis-Sov, 30 May 74, Ul; 4 June 74, Ul; 20 June 74, Ul; SF, Nov 74, 434) 30 May\u201428 June: NASA launched Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite from Eastern Test Range at 9:00 am edt on a Titan TlIC launch vehicle. The booster ejected the transtage and spacecraft into an elliptical parking orbit with a 626-km apogee and 152-km perigee. At the second equatorial crossing the first bum of the transtage placed the spacecraft in a transfer orbit. Launch, parking orbit, and transfer orbit were close to the program plan. At 3:29 pm EDT, Ats 6 was injected into geosynchronous orbit with a 35 845.6-km apogee, 35 774.1-km perigee, 23-hr 57-min period, and 1.8° inclination. The near-perfect orbit eliminated need for corrections, leaving nine kilograms of fuel for operational contingencies. The spacecraft separated from the transtage at 3:33 pm EDT. An orbital correction 7 June changed the 0.27°-per-day westward drift to a 0.05° eastward drift. Checkout of spacecraft systems and onboard experiments was completed 28 June with no significant anomalies. The mission was adjudged a success 26 Sept Primary objectives of the mission were to inject the spacecraft into near-geostationary orbit, erect and evaluate a nine-meter antenna to provide a good-quality signal to small inexpensive ground receivers, stabilize the spacecraft using a three-axis control system, and support user-oriented applications experiments. Secondary objectives were to demonstrate new technology in aircraft and maritime traffic control and infrared earth observations; acquire system data for communications applications in space, including spacecraft-to-spacecraft relay; test spacecraft control; and measure particles and radiation. The 20 experiments included a health-education telecommunications experiment to broadcast programs in several languages simultaneously to citizens in remote areas of the country. The satellite also would aid in remote medical telediagnosis and teleconsultation, transmitting patients\u2019 medical records to faraway hospital centers for emergency assistance. One year after launch Ats 6 would be moved over Lake Victoria in Central Africa. India would then use the satellite to broadcast programs teaching agricultural techniques, family planning and hygjene, school courses and teacher education, and occupational skills to 5000 villages. The $600 ground receiving terminals each consisted of a receiver, converter, and three-meter chicken-wire antenna.

Naugle, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, said at a space transportation system press briefing in Washington, D.C. Sounding rockets gave the scientist an immediate return of data but only for a very short-duration flight. Satellites provided longer mission times but it might be five to seven years from the initiation of the project until data were received. Experiments flown on the shuttle could remain in orbit from 7 to 30 days and then be returned immediately for evaluation. This capability would be a powerful tool in the development of new technology. Dr. Myron S. Malkin, Space Shuttle Program Director, said NASA\u2019s commitment to Congress called for a total development cost of $5.15 billion in 1971 dollars for two operational shuttle vehicles plus $10.5 million for each of 725 missions projected for 1980-1990. Mission costs would be shared by participating experimenters, and estimates were now running at $9.05 million per flight because of reduced estimates for external tank development. Cost for a shuttle flight, which could take 29 500 kg into orbit, contrasted with $18 million for a 4500-kg payload launched on an expendable Atlas booster and up to $58 million to orbit 14 000-18 000 kg on a Saturn IB. Shuttle development was on schedule; the first approach and landing tests were to be in the second quarter of 1977 and the first manned orbital flight in 1979. Orbiter manufacture was under way. The main engine oxygen burner had been tested 14 April and the first big engine firing was scheduled for the end of 1975.

John V. Goldsmith, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, said the total annual U.S. production of photovoltaic solar cells was 50 to 75 kw, mostly for spacecraft systems. In space, solarcell systems were without parallel but large-scale applications on the earth could not be achieved until systems could be produced in adequate volume at commercially competitive prices. Goldsmith recommended a large-scale photovoltaic technology development program and said that a terrestrial photovoltaic system, with advantages of an inexhaustible energy source and minimal environmental impact, could be reduced in cost from its current $30 per watt to an economically feasible $0.50 per watt by 1985 but would require Federal funding of more than $250 million. Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, NASA Assistant Administrator for Energy Programs, said NASA was continuing investigations of orbiting satellite power stations. A microwave energy project was studying problems of processing large amounts of power. However, an orbiting power station would weigh 11 million kg and require a second-generation shuttle in addition to a nuclear-powered shuttle to put it into synchronous orbit. (Transcript)",

Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, said during a 4 July Tass interview that the main objectives of the mission were \u201ctesting methods and systems of controlling the craft, improvement in the life-sustaining complex, [and] exploration of new possibilities of using both separate craft and groups of space objects to accomplish scientific and applied tasks in a nearearth orbit.\u201d Tass also reported that a 4 July trajectory correction placed the spacecraft in an orbit with a 277-km apogee, 255-km perigee, 89.7min period, and 51.6° inclination. All spacecraft systems were successfully checked out and the crew was reported to be in good health. The Soyuz 14 cosmonauts rendezvoused and docked with Scdyut 3 on 5 July during their 17th orbit, successfully demonstrating techniques the Soviets would use during the July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project maneuvers. After docking, Popovich and Artyukhin checked the station\u2019s onboard systems and microclimate and entered the 99-cu-m three-room laboratory. During their 15-day mission the cosmonauts studied geological-morphological objects on the earth\u2019s surface, atmospheric formations and phenomena, physical characteristics of outer space, and manufacturing techniques, as well as testing the Salyut space station\u2019s improved design and solar-panel energy system. The crew also studied the influences of space on the human organism and exercised to prevent loss of muscle tone, using an onboard comprehensive trainer to simulate running, jumping, and weight lifting. . Tass reported 15 July that some Soviet scientists considered terminating the mission because unexpected, intense solar flares 4-8 July dramatically increased the radiation exposure. However, because the flares subsided and the space station\u2019s orbit prevented excessive exposure, the crew\u2019s work was not disrupted. While the cosmonauts worked in space, two Soviet researchers lived in a duplicate station on the ground, simultaneously performing the same work. All commands relayed to the orbiting Salyut 3 were first checked on the ground and alternate versions of decisions for unforeseen situations were calculated. On 8 July the U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project crew, in training at Star City for the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. mission in 1975, telegraphed congratulations to the Salyut 3 cosmonauts on their \u201cgreat success.\u201d They said they looked forward to meeting the two after their \u201chappy return.\u201d By 18 July the crew completed most experiments and began transferring equipment to Soyuz 14. After checking out spacecraft systems, the cosmonauts undocked 19 July. Retrorockets were fired, parachutes deployed, and Soyuz 14 softlanded at 5:21 pm Baykonur time (8:21 am edt) 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan 2000 m from the planned target after 15 days 17 hours 30 min in space. The crew left the spacecraft unaided, and on-the-spot medical checks showed the cosmonauts\u2019 health was \u201cgood.\u201d All mission tests were reported completed. For the first time, a U.S.S.R. orbital mission had been in touch with mission control continuously because of maritime tracking. Salyut 3 was the third space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew on Soyuz 10 docked with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. A second crew, launched 6 June 1971 aboard Soyuz 11, entered the orbiting station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days. The three died during reentry when an open valve evacuated air from the spacecraft. Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973 but apparently an explosion or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 20-26 June, 3\u201410 July 74; gsfc SSR, 30 June, 31 Aug 74; Tass, FBis-Sov, 25 June-23 July 74; UPl, W Star-News, 14 July 74; Browne, NYT, 9, 20 July 74; SBD, 9, 27 July 74; A&A 1973)",

      "story": " The National Academy of Sciences issued Scientific Uses of the Space Shuttle, report of a July 1973 conference in Woods Hole, Mass., sponsored by the nas Space Science Board. The conference, attended by 61 U.S. and European scientists from seven scientific disciplines, concluded the shuttle could be an important asset to scientific research. Increased size, weight, and simplicity permitted for payloads would be of chief importance. But many potential advantages depended on innovative management and clear-cut, efficient, and flexible procedures for flying multipurpose missions. Small experiments could be flown cost-effectively on small standardized pallets with integrated experiments, put on standby and flown when space was available. The projected 28-day sortie mission would be valuable for most disciplines but major programs requiring longer observation times should be carried out on free-flying automated spacecraft launched from a pallet in the shuttle\u2019s payload bay. Cost-effectiveness of recovering and refurbishing payloads in orbit required additional study. A sophisticated Large Space Telescope\u2014proposed for launch on the shuttle\u2014might be worth the cost to revisit and service or return to earth. But visits to less expensive spacecraft in inconvenient orbits might prove too costly. Limits on recoverable payload weight might also restrict recovery. Scientists expressed concern that weight requirements for men in addition to a crew might limit scientific payloads. A manned Spacelab module was considered essential for biomedical research but other disciplines could often use a smaller module housing a payload specialist and his console. Because of weight penalties, real-time control and evaluation might be best supplied by a ground-based control using a shuttle-to-ground communications system, such as the proposed Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) , giving continuous global coverage with a high rate of data interchange.

Black holes were believed to be superdense collapsed stars with gravity so great that even light could not escape. Uhuru had detected radiation from the x-ray source Circinus X-l with characteristics similar to those detected in 1972 by TJhuru and in 1973 by Oao 3 for the suspected black hole Cygnus X-l. Varying periods of x-ray intensity had indicated that Circinus X-l was possibly binary; the x-ray energy spectrum had showed changes from 2 to 20 kev. No optical counterpart for the x-ray-source had been found. Black holes might be an answer to two basic problems in cosmology, Walter S. Sullivan had written in the New York Times Magazine 14 July. All visible material accounted for only 2% of the matter necessary to prevent the universe from flying apart in a continuing expansion; some scientists thought black holes might well make up the deficit. Also, black holes might provide the \u201cglue,\u201d the necessary gravity, to keep clusters of galaxies from flying apart. Not all scientists were convinced of the existence of black holes, but the holes\u2019 strange effects\u2014such as the slowing of time, the tight curvature of space, and the influence of gravity on light\u2014had been anticipated by Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. One major dilemma was what happened within a black hole. Some scientists had proposed that a star drawn into a black hole by its gravity might emerge in some other time and place as a quasar and that quasars\u2014■ exceptionally bright objects of relatively small volume and high density\u2014might be \u201cwhite holes\u201d into which energy was pouring from somewhere else, perhaps even another universe.

At 9:32 am edt, the moment of launch, Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., unveiled a plaque designating the site a National Historical Landmark. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told the thousands of guests: \u201cNo matter our achievements, ... we cannot relax our pursuit of knowledge, for we must face the coming crises of our time. Every effort must be made to see that the opportunity which our technology presents is not lost. We may be sure that the opportunity will not occur soon again, if ever. To fail now would mean a ravaged environment and depleted resources\u2014 a plunge into a new and terrible Dark Age from which there would be no return.\u201d Unless \u201cwe continuously restore the fund of basic knowledge, we shall ultimately exhaust it. . . . \u201cSome day we will establish scientific outposts on the Moon, and even tap its mineral resources. And in the not-too-distant future astronauts may tread the surface of Mars and the glaciers of the moons of Jupiter in search of extraterrestrial life. . . . The future began here at 9:32 a.m. on July 16, 1969. At that moment on July 16 in the year 2069, launch windows to Mars, Neptune, and Pluto will be open. Will we fly through those windows? I think we will.\u201d In 19 July ceremonies at the San Clemente, Calif., Western White House, Armstrong presented President Nixon a plaque bearing the names of each astronaut who had represented \u201cthis country in a flight above the surface of the Earth.\u201d President Nixon told Armstrong the greatest contribution to the space program was not the exploration or technology but the \u201cspirit you and your colleagues . . . have had the opportunity to demonstrate.\u201d The Smithsonian Institution hosted 20 July activities marking the day of the landing. Speaking on the Mall in Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks said Apollo 11 had been a \u201cdramatic demonstration . . . that progress in human affairs does not spring full blown from the efforts of one man or group of men. What we saw was the culmination of the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers from Leonardo da Vinci ... to the Apollo 11 astronauts. Each built on what his predecessors had accomplished until the accumulation of knowledge made possible the kind of quantum leap forward represented by the Apollo Program.\u201d Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, called the day of the landing \u201cthe day man ended an era of one-planet civilization and began a new age as traveler and colonizer of the universe.\u201d Despite difficulties, men would \u201cmake more of these steps into the vast but exciting reaches of the solar system.\u201d A 21 July service at the Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C., dedicated the Space Window donated by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator at the time of the landing. The window, designed by Rodney Winfield, depicted whirling orange, red, and white stars and orbiting planets on a deep blue and green field. A thin white trajectory, representing a manned spacecraft, emphasized man\u2019s minuteness in God\u2019s universe.

Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) said experimenters using Ats 6, launched 30 May, had urged another launch because more than the planned one year of operation over the U.S. was needed to complete experiments. Two satellites in orbit at the same time would \u201cgreatly improve the experimental information necessary for further decisions on the use of advanced communications satellites.\u201d Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said that ats satellites held \u201cthe promise of improved health care at reduced costs\u201d for people in remote regions of the U.S. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified that Ats 6 was in excellent condition and had a life expectancy of three additional years over the U.S. following its return from the planned year of operation over India. In addition, use of the U.S.-Canada Communications Technology Satellite scheduled for a mid-December launch could provide experimenters additional experiment time and continuity. Dr. Fletcher expressed NASA opposition to the bill, saying it would cost $4 million more than the bill provided, to cover the cost of the Titan IIIC launch vehicle. To avoid further costs, a decision to launch another spacecraft would have to be made by September, when the NASA and industry ATS team were to be disbanded. A seventh ats satellite could be considered a potential operational vehicle and the user community might consider bearing the costs. (Transcript)",

      "story": " A probe into the next 50 yrs was the subject of a series of articles in Saturday Review/World. Soviet atomic scientist Andrei D. Sakharov envisioned flying cities\u2014artificial earth satellites with important industrial functions. The satellites would hold nuclear and thermonuclear installations with radiant cooling of heat exchangers, to avoid heating the earth, and would also serve as cosmic research laboratories and way stations for long-distance flights. Sakharov also foresaw greater attempts to establish communication with other civilizations by searching for and transmitting interplanetary signals on all known wavelengths and searching outer space for space stations of extraterrestrial civilizations. Powerful telescopes set up on the moon would permit scientists to see planets orbiting the nearest stars. Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong said that in 50 yrs every interesting crater and cranny of the moon would have been visited and revisited and lunar exploration would be replaced by lunar exploitation. Underground lunar colonies, protected from extreme temperatures, would consist of pressurized compartments connected by tunnels. One day man might want to build an atmosphere on the moon to avoid the inconveniences of living in a near vacuum, but in the nearer future the use of the moon\u2019s vacuum for activities such as materials processing was a major reason for being there. Craters on the dark side of the moon, always facing away from the earth, could hold radio and x-ray telescopes for transmissions, unadulterated by earth noise, to and from outer space. Deep craters, which received no sunlight and had temperatures nearing absolute zero, would be ideal for low-temperature laboratories where scientists could investigate the point where molecular motion nearly stops. Lunar agriculture would be underground under lights in modified lunar soil fed with a nutrient solution. Although by 2024 the only extraterrestrial colonies would be on the moon, men probably would have visited Mars and a few selected celestial bodies. Men exploring space might well use a miniaturized heart-lung machine, circumventing the need for breathing and spacesuits. Dr. Wernher von Braun, former Marshall Space Flight Center Director, predicted a worldwide satellite search would be started for additional deposits of metal ore, coal, oil, shale, and natural gas. Satellite data would also provide key data for a badly needed worldwide food supply management system. Von Braun predicted nuclear lasers in geosynchronous orbit would handle millions of TV channels simultaneously and billions of telephone conversations and would lead to worldwide video-telephone service. Advanced meteorological satellites would provide accurate two-week weather forecasts and disaster warnings, saving millions of dollars in property damage. (Saturday Review/World, 24 Aug 74)",

Maj. de Seversky had begun his career as a pilot in the Czarist air force in Russia during World War I. After coming to the U.S. in 1918 he contributed to military and commercial aviation, helping to develop the first fully automatic synchronous bombsight, gyroscopically stabilized flight instruments, inflight fueling techniques, and a variety of landing gear for seaplanes and aircraft. He also led the effort to design, huild, and test an all-metal fighter aircraft, the P\u201435, the first aircraft to fly faster than 480 km per hr. In 1931 he founded the Seversky Aircraft Corp., the forerunner of Republic Aircraft Corp. During World War II de Seversky became one of the country\u2019s leading advocates of strategic air power, saying that the U.S. could not win a \u201climited war fought with traditional forces.\u201d He argued that \u201cthe whole military philosophy must be changed or we shall forever trail the rest of the world not only in conventional aircraft, but in intercontinental ballistic missiles and even in man-made earth satellite development.\u201d (Fraser, NYT, 26 Aug 74, 32; AP, Orlando, Florida, Sentinal Star, 26 Aug 74, B4) Tass reported 28 Aug. that on the second working day the cosmonauts felt well and had made \u201cexperiments to perfect the technique of piloting the ship in different flight regimes.\u201d During maneuvering Soyuz 15 approached the Salyut 3 space station many times, the cosmonauts controlling spaceship functions, observing the approach, and inspecting the station.

He was buried three hours later in a simple funeral near the Kipahulu church on Maui. In Washington, President Ford said: \u201cNearly half a century has passed since his courageous solo flight . . . but the courage and daring of his feat will never be forgotten. For years to come, we will also remember the selfless, sincere man himself . .., one of America\u2019s alltime heroes and a great pioneer of the air age that changed the world.\u201d For the transatlantic flight, airmail pilot and barnstormer Lindbergh had helped design a Ryan monoplane, calculating every ounce. When the Spirit of St. Louis landed at Le Bourget airfield, Paris, at 10:22 pm 21 May 1927 after a 33-hr 29-min flight, Lindbergh was greeted by 25 000 wildly cheering persons. British, French, and Belgian governments awarded the flyer their highest decorations for valor. He received the first U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross and the Medal of Honor and was promoted from lieutenant to colonel in the Army Air Corps Reserve. Following goodwill flights throughout the U.S. and Latin America, sponsored by the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, Lindbergh served as adviser to Pan American World Airways and to the predecessor of Trans World Airlines, helping to lay out transatlantic, transcontinental, and Caribbean air routes for commercial aviation. He served as a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 1931-1939, heading the special committee that recommended to Congress expansion of U.S. aircraft research facilities and establishment of what became the Ames and Lewis Research Centers. After the kidnaping and murder of his first son and the subsequent publicity, Lindbergh moved to Europe in 1935, where he studied the military forces of the European countries. His conclusion that the German Luftwaffe would be superior to the combined forces of the Allies, his acceptance of the Service Cross of the German Eagle from the German government, and his opposition to U.S. participation in World War II provoked the U.S. public to question his patriotism and he resigned his commission in the Army Air Corps. During the war he was a consultant to bomber aircraft manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and United Aircraft Corp. He traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Navy\u2019s Corsair F-4U under flying conditions and there, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. Following the war, his commission restored and promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Lindbergh was a technical consultant for Government and private industry in missile and space flight programs. As a consultant for Pan Am he worked on design specifications for the Boeing 747. Lindbergh devoted the later years of his life to writing and speaking on world conservation policies.

Dr. G. D. Whedon of the National Institutes of Health stated that weightlessness could threaten capable musculo-skeletal functions during space flights lasting up to three years unless measures could be developed to prevent significant losses of calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Continued loss of calcium could cause astronauts to break their backs or legs and could promote formation of kidney stones. Dr. William E. Thornton, life scientist in the jsc Astronaut Office, reported that by Mission Day 3 all Skylab crewmen had lost more than 2000 cc (2 qts) of extravascular fluid from calf and thigh; at recovery, a sharp reversal was noted. The Thornton team suggested that the reason for the shift was the intrinsic and unopposed lower limb elasticity, which forced venous blood and other fluids toward the head. Other investigators reported that such cardiovascular changes as the heart\u2019s decreased ventricular size and the suppression of red blood cell production was the body\u2019s accommodation to weightlessness. These physiological changes had been the expected response to a lack of exertion; they reversed after the astronauts\u2019 return to earth, (jsc Roundup, 30 Aug 74,1-2; JSC proj off, interview, 12 Aug 75; Altman, NYT, 1 Sept 74,14)",

(ComSatCorp Release 74-44) 30 Augusta-14 September: NASA launched Ans 1 Netherlands Astronomical Satellite from Western Test Range on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle at 7:08 am PDT (10:08 am edt). The satellite entered an elliptical polar orbit with a 1167-km apogee, 254-km perigee, 99.0-min period, and 98.1° inclination\u2014significantly different from the planned circular orbit\u2014because of a malfunction in the 1st stage of the Scout. Changes in the spacecraft program and scientific instrument operations program were made to accommodate to the actual orbit. Although the orbit hindered the observation program, the primary objective\u2014to increase the scientific knowledge of stellar ultraviolet and x-ray sources\u2014could be achieved. The spacecraft was pointed at the sun, the solar panels were deployed, and fine pointing in a three-axis stabilized condition was established. All three experiments\u2014a hard x-ray experiment provided by the U.S. and a uv telescope and soft x-ray experiment provided by The Netherlands\u2014 were turned on by 8 Sept. In-orbit checkout of experiments and spacecraft was completed 13 Sept, and the operational phase of the mission began 14 Sept. Principal effect of the orbit on the scientific program was the loss of observing time. The higher apogee placed the spacecraft in the Van Allen radiation belts longer than planned, creating a more intense radiation background than anticipated. The uv telescope could operate effectively for 70% of each orbit and observe lOth-magnitude stars only when the spacecraft was below 500 km. Only 5th-magnitude or brighter stars were observable most of the time. The U.S. x-ray experiment could make effective observations about 25% of the total possible observing time; the experiment could operate below 700 km but not over the poles or the South Atlantic Anomaly. The soft x-ray experiment consisted of a large-area detector, which was operating similarly to the U.S. experiment, and a grazing-incidence telescope, which was seriously affected by the radiation background. Although much of the acquired data was not usable, most future data might be recovered through improved analysis techniques. Despite the problems, the orbit would provide nine months of full sunlight, rather than the six months expected, permitting reobservations of objects observed during the first three months. In addition, aerodynamic drag would lower the apogee over a period of time, decreasing the passage time through the Van Allen belts. Ans 1 was launched under a Memorandum of Understanding signed 5 June 1970 by NASA and the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite Program Authority (anspa) . NASA provided the x-ray experiment, spacecraft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle and services, and limited tracking and data acquisition.

At most, the planet probably had only a small rocky core deep below the heavily clouded atmosphere. Jupiter\u2019s great red spot probably was the vortex of a gigantic storm that had raged along a 40 000-km front for 700 yrs. Analyses by NASA experimenters and other scientists had shown that the Pioneer 10 information, the first measurements made from closer than the earth, contradicted some previous theories and verified others. As early Pioneer 10 reports had indicated [see 25 Jan., 2 and 9 April], Jupiter\u2019s turbulent interior was much hotter than expected, its magnetic field much larger than some predictions, and its radiation belts far more intense. The planet was a source of high-energy particle radiation, the only one in the solar system besides the sun. In its atmospheric circulation patterns, cyclones and anticyclones (ascending and descending) were stretched around the planet, rather than being circular as on the earth. This \u201cweather-stretching,\u201d probably caused by heat radiation from the planet\u2019s interior and its 35 200-km-per-hr rotation speed, accounted for Jupiter\u2019s planet-girdling, alternating brown-red and gray-white cloud bands. Density of the four largest moons decreased from the density of rock for the innermost lo and Europa to the density of a water-ice and rock mixture for the outer Ganymede and Callisto.

Comparative studies of metal solidification had suggested that a more uniform distribution of short-grained structures under weightlessness might become the basis of space technology, with the added attraction of using the sun as an energy source.

The satellite was placed in a close-to-planned transfer orbit with a 36 107-km apogee, 231-km perigee, and 24.76° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired 13 Oct., circularized the orbit with 35 766km apogee, 35 244-km perigee, 23-hr 42-min period, and 0.5° inclination. By 25 Nov. the comsat was operating normally at its station at about 90° W longitude above the equator. The launch had been twice delayed, once for investigation of the entire Delta program and once for a last minute check of a connector pin. When launched, the vehicle performed as planned with two minor exceptions (both due to human error): the 2nd-stage cold-gas redundant altitude-control system switched from primary to backup nozzles because the guidance system had been programmed with too low a moment threshold and the umbilical end fitting was damaged because a tether had been improperly installed. Neither problem compromised the NASA mission objective: to place the satellite in an orbit of sufficient accuracy for transfer into a stationary synchronous orbit while retaining sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission lifetime requirements. The objective was met, and the mission was adjudged successful 30 Oct. Westar 2 joined Westar 1, launched 13 April 1974 and later placed in geosynchronous orbit at 99° W longitude.

The satellite carried white laboratory rats, steppe tortoises, insects, and fungi in a test of the combined effects of weightlessness and radiation. A cesium-137 gamma radiation source within the spacecraft provided an average radiation dose of 32 rads per hr on command from the earth. Beginning on the 10th day of the flight, the rats were exposed to doses of gamma-quantums ranging between 200 and 1000 rads over 24 hrs. After return to the earth 12 Nov., the rats were found to be more pathological and less active than after corresponding control experiments. The change in the hemopoietic and lymphoid organs was more sharply pronounced than in the Cosmos 605 experiments (31 Oct.\u201422 Nov. 1973). While experiment results were processed, research was continuing on methods of antiradiation protection by deflecting particles with an electric field.

In a 23 Oct. letter to Gallagher, Dr. James C.

The U.S. would not exclude Soviet newsmen from the U.S. liftoff. The Public Affairs Agreement provided that, beginning with the Soyuz launch and ending with the Apollo recovery, onboard information from both spacecraft, voice communications between the spacecraft, and ground communications with both spacecraft, as well as ground-based and onboard TV, would be exchanged immediately. The first real-time TV coverage of a Soviet launch would be released to the West. Factual information on joint activities would be released immediately.

The number of college students in junior classes in aerospace engineering had dropped 75% during 1968-1973, although civil aeronautics export business had increased fivefold in the past 10 yrs.

The spacecraft then headed on toward a September 1979 encounter with Saturn. Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, had been the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter\u20143 Nov. 1973\u20149 Jan. 1974. The success of that mission permitted NASA scientists to attempt a somewhat riskier approach with the backup Pioneer 11, a clockwise trajectory by the south polar region and then straight up through the intense inner radiation belt by the equator and back out over the north pole. Although the spacecraft went within 42 000 km of the planet at 12:22 am est 3 Dec., its peak speed of 171 000 km per hr and the trajectory\u2019s high latitude prevented serious radiation damage. The Jupiter mission of Pioneer 11 was to map the magnetic field; measure distributions of high-energy electrons and protons in the radiation belts and look for auroras; find a basis for interpreting radio emissions from Jupiter; detect and measure the bow shock and magnetospheric boundary and their interactions with the solar wind; verify the thermal balance and determine temperature distribution of the outer atmosphere; measure the hydrogen-helium ratio in the atmosphere; measure the structure of the ionosphere and atmosphere; measure the brightness, color, and polarization of Jupiter\u2019s reflected light; perform two-color visible-light imaging; and increase the accuracy of orbit predictions and masses of Jupiter and its moons. The interplanetary mission was to map the interplanetary magnetic field; study the radial gradient of the solar wind and its fluctuations and structure; study the radial and transverse gradients and arrival directions of high-energy charged particles (solar and galactic cosmic rays); investigate relationships between the solar wind, magnetic field, and cosmic rays; search for the boundary and extent of the heliosphere (solar atmosphere) ; determine the density of neutral hydrogen; and determine the properties of interplanetary dust. Hurtling toward and then away from Jupiter, Pioneer 11 sent data back to the earth at 2048 bits per sec throughout most of the month before and after encounter. Picture-taking of Jupiter began 18 Nov., at 14 800 000 km out from the planet. From 25 Nov. through 8 Dec., imaging and polarimetry observations were made 23 hrs a day. On 26 Nov. Pioneer 11 crossed the detached bow shock wave (7 772 000 km out) at the juncture of the solar wind and Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field and entered the magnetosphere (6 923 000 km out). In five hours the spacecraft passed undamaged through this first field of intense radiation. On 1 Dec. it crossed the orbit of Callisto\u2014outermost of the five inner moons\u2014and began returning its best pictures of Jupiter. On 2 Dec. Pioneer 11 crossed the orbits of Jupiter\u2019s four closest moons and entered the inner radiation belt. During this last leg of the approach to the south polar region, the spacecraft continued the imaging and sensing of the planet and moons and made a closeup, two-hour scan that included the red spot portion of the surface. Less than 12 hrs before the spacecraft passed behind Jupiter, an intense peak of electron radiation built up a 4000-v electric charge within the spacecraft. The charge created an electric arc that signaled heater lines to turn on\u2014drawing spacecraft power and weakening the signal to earth. In about three hours the problem was identified and override commands from earth switched the beaters back off. At midnight on 3 Dec. Pioneer 11 entered Jupiter radio occultation\u2014 a blackout that lasted 42 min while the spacecraft swung behind the 142 744-km-dia planet\u2014moving from the south pole straight up over the north pole. Since Pioneer 11 radio signals required 46 min to cross the 737 million km separating the earth and Jupiter at the time of encounter, the spacecraft had already circumscribed tbe planet before the earth lost contact with its signal. During occultation the spacecraft passed through the most intense radiation (up to 40 000 times as much in the earth\u2019s radiation belts), reached its greatest speed (171 000 km per hr) and came closest to the planet (witbin 42 000 km of the cloudtops). At 1:24 am EST\u201462 min after periapsis\u2014the signal reached earth, indicating that the spacecraft had emerged from behind the planet and that all systems had survived the most critical phase of the mission. Temporary failures had lost some data, but no permanent damage was sustained. Following the Jupiter encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, renamed the spacecraft Pioneer-Saturn as it headed toward the planet Saturn. The exact target point had not been selected but scientists considered an interesting possibility was to target the spacecraft to pass between Saturn and its rings and then close by Titan, one of Saturn\u2019s moons and a possible location of life. The five-year, 2.4-billion-km trip to Saturn would carry Pioneer-Saturn about 160 000 000 km above the orbit planes of most planets. Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to use the gravity of an outer planet to throw it to another planet farther out, came the closest to Jupiter, was the fastest spacecraft yet launched, and was the first spacecraft to photograph Jupiter\u2019s polar regions. Pioneer-Saturn was expected to become the first spacecraft to pass far from the ecliptic plane and the first to reach Saturn. Pioneer 11 confirmed, but somewhat modified, the findings of Pioneer 10. The model of a relatively flat, disclike magnetosphere was challenged by new evidence suggesting a large, blunt magnetosphere of irregular and fluctuating shape. Temperature measurements of about 125 K at cloud-tops supported Pioneer 10 readings, which were lower than those indicated by earth-based observations. Imaging revealed a decrease in the banding structure of the planet with increased latitude and a more mottled structure across the poles, (nasa Releases 74-292, 74-300; Hall, Opp, et al., Science, 2 May 75, 445-77; NASA Pioneer Mgr, interview, 12 Nov 75; NASA press conference transcript, 19 Nov 74; Perlman, SF Chron, 3 Dec 74; O\u2019Toole, W Post, 3 Dec 74, Al; Sullivan, NYT, 4 Dec 74, 27; Mead, San Jose Mercury, 5 Dec 74; NYT, 9 Dec 74)",

The three spacecraft entered almost identical, near-to-planned, polar orbits. It was the first triple launch for a Thor-Delta. Noaa 4 entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1444-km perigee, 115min period, and 101.7° inclination, as the fourth operational Improved Tiros Operational Satellite in the joint NASA and Dept, of Commerce program to provide global cloud-cover observations.

Rukavishnikov, from Bay-konur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam at 2:40 pm local time (4:40 am est) in preparation for the July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. The spacecraft, identical to the one that would fly during the ASTP mission, entered orbit with a 280-km apogee, 194-km perigee, 89.3min period, and 51.8° inclination. Tass reported the purpose of the mission was to test the spacecraft\u2019s onboard systems, which had been \u201cmodernized to meet the demands of the joint flight\u201d; make scientific and technical investigations; and observe and photograph sections of the earth\u2019s surface for the solution of economic problems. In a prelaunch Tass interview, Filipchenko said that the mission was to last several days. \u201cThis would be enough for us to test carefully all the ship\u2019s systems, above all its docking gear.\u201d Using a passive simulator docking ring, Soyuz 16 would make docking and separation maneuvers in almost all the ASTP modes. In addition, U.S.S.R. astp Technical Director Konstanin D. Bushuyev said in a launch-day Tass interview, the crew would check out the Soyuz life support system, which had been redesigned for better compatibility with Apollo. Soyuz normally had a cabin pressure of 10 newtons per sq cm (14.7 psi) and an atmosphere similar in oxygen content to terrestrial atmosphere. Apollo maintained its pure oxygen atmosphere at 3.5 newtons per sq cm (5 psi). To reduce the acclimation period for the crews\u2019 transition between the two atmospheres, the U.S.S.R. had agreed to reduce the pressure and increase the percentage of oxygen in the Soyuz atmosphere. The system\u2019s capacity also had been increased to accommodate four persons. On 3 Dec. NASA, which had been tracking Soyuz 16 since shortly after launch, began a 15-day joint tracking rehearsal with the U.S.S.R. After the mission, information gathered by nine U.S. tracking stations would be compared with data from Soviet tracking stations.

A year-long Jet Propulsion Laboratory study had indicated that deposits had resulted from migration of salt-saturated aqueous solutions to Io\u2019s surface from a warm or hot interior followed by loss of the water to space. Salt-rich materials could have been produced by the leaching of carbonaceous meteorites. According to Dr. Fraser P. Fanale, jpl team leader, the deposits could account for Io\u2019s high reflective power, the absence of ice hands, and the dark reddish poles. Sodium vapor emissions from Io had been first reported in February 1973 by Dr. Robert Brown of Harvard Univ. Subsequently, the cloud of sodium was observed to extend more than 320 000 km from Io. In August Dr. Fanale with two other astronomers had proposed explanations for the sodium emissions. Proton bombardment experiments had indicated that sodium and other atoms had been blasted from Io\u2019s surface by the impact of Jupiter\u2019s magnetospheric protons, electrons, and ions and had formed a cloud around Io.

New air tanks were built of spiral-wound glass fiber over an aluminum liner to provide a lighter and more durable system. (NASA Release 74-320) 10 December-16 January 1975: nasa launched West German-built Helios 1 solar probe at 2:11 am Est from Eastern Test Range on a Titan IIIE\u2014 Centaur vehicle, putting it on a path that would take it closer to the sun than any spacecraft had yet traveled. The spacecraft first entered a parking orbit and then an elliptical orbit of the sun with a 0.985-au aphelion, 0.3095-au perihelion, 190.15-day period, and 0.02° inclination to the ecliptic. All vehicle systems performed normally during launch. The Titan-Centaur carried a Delta solid-fueled rocket-motor kick stage as a 4th stage and required seven interdependent ignition systems. Following separation from the 1st stage, the Centaur, with 2300 kg of propellants remaining, began maneuvers to provide data for the 1977 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, future synchronous orbit missions, and continued development of the launch vehicle. Maneuvers included a one-hour coast and restart, three-hour coast with thermal maneuvers, boost-pump operation experiment with igniter on, and zero-g boost-pump dead-head operation. Helios 1 was to investigate the fundamental solar processes and solar-terresfrial relations by studying the solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust from launch to the first perihelion, 0.31 au from the sun. The 370-kg spool-shaped spacecraft carried 10 instruments\u20147 West German and 3 U.S.\u2014to measure the solar wind, magnetic field, and related shock waves; study radio waves and oscillations in the electron plasma; measure the spatial gradient of solar and galactic cosmic rays; observe composition and dynamics of interplanetary dust; and monitor x-ray activity of the solar disc. By 16 Jan. orientation and spin-rate maneuvers had been conducted and the high-gain antenna despun and pointed toward the earth. Control of the spacecraft had been passed to Germany. Instruments had been turned on and were operating normally with two exceptions: One of two antennas in the U.S. plasma-wave experiment had jammed during extension and unrolled inside the drive enclosure, producing an electrical ground and degrading all low-frequency data. Rewinding the antenna had not eliminated the ground. In addition, operation of the high-gain antenna for the West German plasma experiment produced a space . charge near the spacecraft, preventing detection of electrons with energies less than 100 ev. The medium-gain antenna would be used during selected periods. To prepare for its demanding mission, Helios 1, designed to withstand the highest temperatures ever demanded of a spacecraft, had been successfully subjected to six days at 644 K (700°F), the highest heat load expected at 0.3 au, during spring 1974 tests at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft had also withstood radiation 11 times the solar intensity at the outer edge of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Independent payload components, louver systems, optical surface reflectors and mirrors, and several layers of insulation dissipated spacecraft heat. In addition the spacecraft spun at one revolution per second to distribute evenly the heat coming from the sun. Temperatures within the experiment area were kept between 263 and 303 K (14° and 86°F). A second Helios spacecraft would be launched in 12 to 18 mos and information from the two spacecraft would be received simultaneously from widely differing locations, for comparison with each other and with data from Pioneer- and iMP-class spacecraft. Helios, the third cooperative U.S. and West German project, was agreed,on during 1966 talks. Following technical discussions and mission definition, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed 10 June 1969. NASA provided three scientific instruments, spacecraft technical support, launch vehicle and operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition and flight operations. The German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) designed, built, and tested the spacecraft and provided seven scientific instruments, data acquisition and analysis, and spacecraft control.

He ruled out manned programs other than the space shuttle, but NASA would not become an all-purpose technology development agency for energy, ground transportation, and similar nonspace systems. Applications and materials processing would be important. Dr. Fletcher believed NASA\u2019s program was acceptable to Congress and to the White House and that its future problem would not be wholesale cancellation of the space program but surviving annual budget cuts. Increased competition for money and staff attention in congressional space-related committees could aggravate NASA\u2019s budgetary problems, according to Science. Observers had predicted that Congress would be faced with a choice between the shuttle and continuation of the space science and applications program. The decision could rest on the support of the shuttle program by organized labor, as it had in a 1972 Senate attempt to kill the shuttle. Some scientists had suggested that a $l-billion NASA budget cut would be better for science than a $100-million cut because the former would entail canceling the shuttle, in theory freeing money for space science.

The 402-kg satellite entered a transfer orbit with a 38 071-km apogee, 402-km perigee, 688.2-min period, and 13.2° inclination. Nine seconds after the Thor-Delta\u2019s 3rd stage separated from the 2nd stage, the inertial measurement unit (the altitude-sensing portion in the 2nd-stage guidance system) stopped functioning, but the failure did not affect the path of the already separated 3rd stage. In addition, the main engine cutoff was achieved by fuel depletion with 430 kg liquid oxygen remaining instead of with the planned depletion. The anomalies, which did not affect the mission, were under investigation. Ground controllers in West Germany activated the apogee kick motor, the first using liquid propellant, at 6:00 pm est 21 Dec., putting the spacecraft in circular geosynchronous orbit with 35 810-km apogee, 35 767-km perigee, 23-hr 56-min period, and 0.3° inclination. The spacecraft was despun and three-axis-stabilized and its large solar panels were successfully deployed 24 Dec. Symphonie 1 drifted eastward to its final station at 115° W longitude over the west coast of Africa and began operations 2 Jan. 1975. The NASA mission objective\u2014to launch the spacecraft into a transfer orbit that would permit the onboard propulsion system to place it in an accurate synchronous orbit\u2014was satisfied and the mission was adjudged successful 6 Jan. Symphonie 1 would provide 1200 telephone circuits, 8 voice channels, and 2 color TV channels for experimental communications between Europe, Africa, and South America. The first of two Symphonie satellites, provided for by a French-West Germany agreement signed June 1967, the satellite was developed by a French-German industrial consortium under the direction of the French Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (cnes) and the West German Gesell-schaft fur Weltraumforschung (Gfw). In October 1973 NASA agreed to provide the launch vehicle and services on a cost-reimbursable basis and in June 1974 signed a launch services contract with CNES-Gfw. Goddard Space Flight Center in cooperation with French and West German ground stations was responsible for tracking the spacecraft during launch and transfer orbit operations. GSFC was also responsible for the launch vehicle. (nasa mors, 13 Dec 74, 6 Jan 75; NASA prog off, interview, 29 Aug 75; NASA Release 74-316)",

      "story": " Tass announced that the flight of the U.S.S.R.\u2019s Salyut 3 orbiting space station, launched 25 June, would soon end, after completion of a six-month program that doubled the flight duration originally planned. During its six months operation the spacecraft had performed more than 400 scientific and technical experiments, received more than 8000 control commands from the earth, conducted more than 200 \u201cdynamic operations,\u201d conducted 70 TV transmission and 2500 telemetric sessions, fired its thrusters more than 500 000 times, and generated 5000 kw of electricity with its solar panels. A two-man crew, launched 3 July on Soyuz 14, boarded the space station and spent 15 days living and working in space. A second crew, launched 26 Aug. on Soyuz 15, failed in several attempts to dock with the station and returned to the earth after 48 hrs in space. Since that time Salyut 3 had operated in an unmanned automatic mode. The Western press later speculated that the mission was being ended to prevent any interference with the mission of Salyut 4 [see 26 Dec.\u20149 Feb. 1975]. The retrorockets were fired 24 Jan. 1975 and the station reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean after 213 days in space. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 26 Dec 74, Ul-2; 24 Jan 75, Ul; gsfc SSR, 28 Feb 75; Soviet Aero, 6 Jan 75,1) 26 December\u20149 February 1975: The U.S.S.R. launched Salyut 4 space station into earth orbit and 16 days later launched Soyuz 17 with a two-man crew to join the Salyut and establish a manned orbital laboratory. Salyui 4 was launched 26 Dec. from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam into orbit with a 252-km apogee, 214-km perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the purpose of the mission was to test the design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct scientific studies and experiments in space. The news agency also reported that onboard systems and equipment were operating normally. The Western press reported that major maneuvers 29 and 30 Dec. put the station at a record high altitude for a Salyut space station, reaching an orbit with a 350-km apogee and 337-km perigee by 31 Dec. Soyuz 17, launched at 2:43 am 11 Jan. 1975 local time (4:43 pm est 10 Jan.) from Baykonur Cosmodrome, carried cosmonauts Lt. Col. Aleksey A. Gubarev and Georgy M. Grechko into orbit with a 249-km apogee, 186-km perigee, 88.9-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the mission would carry out joint experiments with Salyut 4, including a comprehensive checkup of the spacecraft\u2019s onboard systems in various flight conditions. In a launch-day interview with Tass, Maj. Gen. Georgy T. Beregovoy, head of the Soviet cosmonaut training center, said that Soyuz 17- was in \u201cno way connected with additional checkups of \u2018Soyuz\u2019 systems before its rendezvous with \u2018Apollo.\u2019 \u201d An orbital correction raised the spacecraft to an orbit with a 354km apogee, 293-km perigee, 90.7-min period, and 51.6° inclination, permitting Soyuz 17 to dock with Salyut 4 on 12 Jan. The spacecraft was moved automatically to a distance of 10 m from the station and then the cosmonauts completed docking by manual control. The crew entered the space station, switched on the power and radio transmitters, and inspected the scientific equipment. In a 14 Jan. interview with Tass, Dr. Konstantin P. Feoktistov, cosmonaut who had helped design the space station, said that Salyut 4 improvements included three panels of solar batteries that were positioned like the tail of an aircraft and could be individually oriented toward the sun. The panels permitted the energy supply in the station to be replenished without using fuel for spacecraft orientation. Other improvements had been introduced in the flight control systems. During a broadcast from the spacecraft over Moscow Radio 15 Jan., Gubarev and Grechko said they had set up the first Soviet space-based teletype communications station. The teletype could receive and copy communications from the earth while the cosmonauts were busy at other tasks. Tass reported 17 Jan. that the cosmonauts, neither of whom had been in space before, had become accustomed to weightlessness about the fifth or sixth day of flight. During nearly 30 days aboard Salyut 4, Gubarev and Grechko used a newly developed high-resolution solar telescope to study solar phenomena, x-ray telescopes and sensors to study the flux of x-radiation from celestial bodies, and an infrared spectrometer to examine the earth\u2019s radiation. The cosmonauts also studied effects of weightlessness on the human vestibular function, cardiovascular system, and blood; made earth resources observations; and studied the earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. They resprayed two telescope mirrors dulled by exposure to space; carried out biological \u201cOasis\u201d experiments using insects, microorganisms, tissue cultures, and plants; and tried recycling water, condensed from the cabin atmosphere, for drinking and food preparation. The crew began preparations for their return to earth 9 Feb., transferring equipment to Soyuz 17. The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 17 and undocked from the space station at 11:08 am Baykonur time (1:08 am est). Soyuz 17 softlanded in the U.S.S.R. 110 km northeast of Tselino-grad, Kazakhstan, \u201cin complex meteorological conditions\u201d after 29 days 13 hrs 20 min in space. The Soyuz 17 cosmonauts had broken the previous 23-day 18-hr 22-min Soviet record for time in space set by the Soyuz 11 crew on Salyut 1 (6-30 June 1971) before they were killed during reentry. On-the-spot and later medical checks showed that the Soyuz 17 cosmonauts had \u201cwithstood well the long space flight.\u201d Salyut 4 was the fourth space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew, launched on Soyuz 10, docked with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. The Soyuz 11 crew, launched 6 June 1971, boarded the station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days before their reentry tragedy. Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973, but an explosion or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable.

The U.S.S.R. orbited 95 payloads in 81 launches; Italy launched 2 payloads, using NASA launch vehicles; and Japan launched 1. U.S. launches included 16 payloads in 14 NASA launches and 12 spacecraft in 8 Dept, of Defense launches. For the first year since 1967 the U.S. launched no men into space, although Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue completed the longest mission yet accomplished by man when they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 8 Feh. after 84 days in space. The U.S.S.R. orbited three two-man crews during the year, including two crews to dock with the Salyut 3 space station. The Soyuz 14 crew docked and worked aboard the laboratory for nearly 16 days, but Soyuz 15 failed to dock and it returned to earth after 48 hrs in space. Soyuz 16 tested the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project configuration in December. The U.S.S.R. also launched the Salyut 4 orbiting space station, to be joined by a two-man crew in January 1975. The 16 NASA-launched payloads\u2014li paid for by domestic and foreign corporations or foreign governments\u2014included 7 communications, 1 applications technology, 2 meteorological, and 6 scientific satellites. These were in addition to 2 Italian-launched cooperative scientific satellites. Comsats included two spacecraft launched for United Kingdom military communications ■\u2014Skynet IIA into too low an orbit, followed later by the successful Skynet IIB, Westar 1 and 2, launched for Western Union Telegraph Co., were the first U.S. commercial domestic communications satellites. The most complex and versatile of the Applications Technology Satellites, Ats 6, went into orbit in May. The spacecraft was transmitting medical and educational telecommunications to small inexpensive ground stations in remote areas of the U.S. and would, in 1975, he positioned to broadcast educational programs to 5000 villages in India. Symphonie 1 was launched for France and West Germany as the first of two experimental communications satellites. Intelsat-lV F-8 was launched for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, and Amsat Oscar 7 for Radio Amateur Satellite Corp. as a secondary payload on the Noaa 4 launch. The two meteorological satellites included Synchronous Meteorological Satellite Sms 1, launched for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Sms 1 was the first meteorological satellite in synchronous orbit. Noaa 4 was launched as part of noaa\u2019s global weather watch program. All but one of NASA\u2019s six scientific payloads were cooperative efforts with foreign countries. Miranda (UK-X4) was launched for U.K. to measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft as well as test spacecraft systems. Spain\u2019s first satellite\u2014Intasat, put into polar orbit as a secondary payload with Noaa 4\u2014began studies of the ionosphere. Two spacecraft were launched in cooperation with West Germany: Aeros 2 to measure aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and solar ultraviolet radiation, Helios 1 into solar orbit to investigate interstellar space closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft had and to gather extensive new data on the sun. NASA and The Netherlands joined to orbit The Netherlands Astronomical Satellite Ans 1 to study stellar uv and x-ray sources. NASA\u2019s only all-U.S. scientific payload, Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52), was launched into polar orbit to study plasma properties of the magnetosphere over the north polar cap. A Titan-Centaur proof-flight vehicle carrying a Viking spacecraft model and a sphinx satellite failed to achieve orbit and was destroyed during launch operations. The new NASA launch vehicle later successfully launched Helios 1. Italian launch crews, using NASA launch vehicles, launched two satellites into earth orbit from the San Marco launch platform in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast. San Marco 4 in February carried two U.S. and one Italian experiment into orbit to measure diurnal variations in the equatorial neutral atmosphere. Ariel 5 was launched in October for U.K., to study galactic and extragalactic x-ray sources, in the first Italian launch for a country other than the U.S. or Italy. Japan launched its fifth satellite, Tansei 2\u2014Japan\u2019s first on a guided booster. In addition to the three manned Soyuz missions^ the U.S.S.R. launched 2 Salyut space stations; 3 unmanned Soyuz spacecraft identified as Cosmos 638, 656, and 672 ; 7 Molniya comsats; 5 Meteor meteorological satellites; 2 cooperative Intercosmos; 2 Luna lunar probes; and 71 spacecraft under the Cosmos designation. Space Science and Exploration Besides the new scientific satellites, NASA continued systematic exploration of the solar system as Pioneer 11, launched in April 1973, sped to within 42 000 km of Jupiter 3 Dec. The spacecraft photographed the giant planet and its moons, transmitting new information on the planet\u2019s weather patterns, atmosphere, and radiation belts. Data from Pioneer 11 and its predecessor Pioneer 10, which had encountered Jupiter in December 1973 revealed that Jupiter was hotter than previously estimated and composed largely of liquid hydrogen. Cyclones and anticyclones stretched completely around the planet with rising grey-white cloud ridges extending 20 km above Jupiter\u2019s distinctive orange-brown belts. Jupiter\u2019s great red spot was probably the vortex of a great storm that had- raged along a 400 000-km front for centuries. At year\u2019s end Pioneer 11 was speeding toward rendezvous with Saturn to give man his closest look at that planet while Pioneer 10 raced to cross the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and become the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. Meanwhile Mariner 10\u2014after passing within 5800 km of Venus and sending back new information on particle environment, mass, and density of that planet\u2014made two successful flybys of Mercury in March and September. The spacecraft transmitted data that gave scientists mass measurements 100 times better than previous ones, described a detached, well-defined bow shock wave, and showed temperatures varying from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side ( \u2014 300°F to 800°F). During the two encounters the spacecraft photographed 45% of the planet\u2019s surface. By the end of the year Mariner 10 was headed for a third Mercury encounter in March 1975. Preparations for the two 1975 Viking missions to Mars continued with the qualification-testing of Viking science instruments, engineering subsysterns, and entire orbiter and lander spacecraft. During the last quarter of the year the lander successfully completed critical surface simulation tests that included subjecting the spacecraft to temperatures approximating Martian conditions and dropping it from 0.6 m to determine the effects of landing shocks on the integrated Viking equipment. A detailed spacecraft design for the 1977 Mariner mission to Jupiter and Saturn was completed while a major effort to find a satisfactory way to protect the spacecraft from Jupiter\u2019s strong radiation continued. A major new space science start, approved in nasa\u2019s FY 1975 budget, was the 1978 dual Pioneer-Venus mission to obtain detailed measurements of the Venus atmosphere with an orbiter and four atmospheric entry probes. Hughes Aircraft Co. was chosen in February for spacecraft design, with an option for spacecraft development, and experimenters and scientific instrumentation were selected in June. NASA continued preparations to place the Large Space Telescope in earth orbit to make detailed astronomical observations 10 times deeper into space than possible before. During 1974, preliminary system definitions and advanced technological development were carried out on selected elements of the LST. Besides preparing for future missions, scientists continued analysis of data accumulated from previous missions. A Lunar Data Analysis and Synthesis program began to correlate existing data and data still being collected by the five Apollo lunar surface-experiment packages (alsep) left on the moon during the lunar landing program. With the conclusion of the Skylab flight program, large volumes of new data on the sun and the earth and the most comprehensive inflight data yet on man\u2019s adaptation to space flight became available. During the year sounding rockets, balloons, telescopes, and instrumented aircraft continued to increase knowledge of the universe. NASA launched nearly 80 sounding rockets from sites around the world. A significant accomplishment was the launch of 54 sounding rockets within 24 hrs to support the Joint NASA-Air Force Atmospheric Layering and Density Distribution of Ions and Neutrals (aladdin) program. During 1974 scientists in programs outside NASA as well as in, using data from both orbital and suborbital programs, discovered a 13th moon of Jupiter, observed a pulsar that was a member of a double star system, obtained new data on the size and shape of the Crab Nebula, discovered a galaxy six times larger than any previously known in the universe, and made the greatest advance yet in cometary research with the study of the Comet Kohoutek, including first-time identification of water molecules in a comet. The U.S.S.R. continued a program of space exploration with the launch of lunar probes Luna 22 in May and Luna 23 in October. Luna 22 studied the lunar surface and atmosphere from lunar orbit. Luna 23 was damaged while landing on the moon\u2019s surface and its work was discontinued after three days of equipment testing. Space Transportation and Technology The space shuttle program accelerated, with funding increasing from $475 million in FY 1974 to $800 million in FY 1975. But this total reflected an $89-million cut by the Office of Management and Budget from planned space shuttle funding, delaying the program four to six months. The final maj or contract was awarded and design work neared completion; by year\u2019s end the program moved into hardware test and fabrication stages. Construction of the shuttle runway at Kennedy Space Center began in April and throughout the year contracts were awarded for additional space shuttle facilities. The European Space Research Organization selected VFW-Fokker/ ehno Raumfahrttechnik GmbH as prime contractor to design and build Spacelab for missions on the shuttle. Primary efforts were directed toward planning early shuttle missions and making analyses for a NASA mission model. In solid propulsion technology, the final motor\u2014the first with a restart capability\u2014in a series of high-efficiency solid-fueled motors was successfully static-fired. The October firing marked the first time a spacecraft solid-fueled motor had been fired, quenched, reignited, and requenched. Another significant step was the static-firing of a thermally sterilized solid-fueled motor. Electric propulsion\u2014attractive as auxiliary propulsion for long-life station-keeping and attitude control\u2014took a stride forward with the tests of a 4.5-millinewton (0.001-lb-thrust) ion engine aboard Ats 6. In spacecraft energy system technology, solar cells were made from a silicon ribbon grown directly from the liquid state, a critical first step in low-cost manufacture of solar cells. Other advances were made in laser, nuclear, atmosphere-entry, material-and-structures, guidance, and control-and-information technology. The X\u201424B lifting body completed 15 flights in the NASA and Air Force program to develop a safe piloted vehicle for reentry from space flight and to develop hypersonic technology. Following the first supersonic flight in March, the vehicle\u2019s performance and handling qualities were evaluated in the speed range between mach 1.6 and landing. NASA\u2019s aeronautics research and development program to reduce fuel consumption, reduce undesirable environmental effects, improve safety, and advance technology continued during the year. Flight tests of an F\u2014111 equipped with the NASA-developed supercritical wing demonstrated a 15% reduction in fuel consumption. Other tests using flexible aircraft skin concepts, composite materials, active-control technology, and alternative fuels also demonstrated reduced drag and potential fuel savings. In NASA\u2019s refan program\u2014an effort to reduce noise of the JT8D engine that powered most of the Nation\u2019s narrow-body commercial fleet\u2014three refanned engines demonstrated in ground tests that the ground area affected by objectionable noise from commercial aircraft could be reduced by 75%. In another technique, a DC-8 using a NASA-developed two-segment landing approach reduced the ground area affected by excessive noise 53%. Efforts to measure and reduce aircraft engine exhaust in the atmosphere continued with the Global Air Sampling Program. A United Air Lines, Inc., Boeing 747 equipped with an atmospheric sampling instrument began measuring aircraft pollution on commercial air routes, while the clean combuster technology program was expanded to reduce engine emissions. Programs to improve aircraft safety continued to make progress. Techniques to reduce hazardous trailing vortices were flight-tested. A NASA-developed prototype system to track aircraft wakes near airports, allowing traffic controllers to adjust aircraft spacing more closely, was being operationally evaluated at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. The Dept. ,of Defense A-10 close-air-support program moved into production stage, with the first of six aircraft in final assembly and checkout. Production of an initial increment of 22 aircraft was approved in December, with a full production decision expected late in 1975. dod\u2019s B-l advanced strategic bomber moved through engine preliminary flight-readiness tests in April, rollout in October, and first flight in December. Following flight testing, a production decision would be made in 1976. The first operational F\u201415 advanced tactical fighter was delivered in November. At year\u2019s end 20 test aircraft had accumulated more than 300 flight hrs. International Cooperation Aerospace activities continued to become more international. Of the 16 NASA-launched payloads, 10 were cooperative efforts with foreign organizations. In addition, the 2 Italian-launched payloads carried U.S. experiments. During the year negotiations were completed on an agreement for NASA to furnish reimbursable launches for three future synchronous-orbit Japanese satellites, nasa-esro Spacelab working groups met throughout the year on experimental objectives and user requirements. Investigators from 42 countries and 5 international organizations were selected for Earth Resources Technology Satellite follow-on investigations, and Italy and Iran signed agreements with NASA to build earth stations to receive ERTS data directly. The 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project neared flight readiness. Joint compatibility tests of communications and docking systems were carried out and intensive joint flight-crew and flight-controller training was begun. Apollo hardware was completed. The U.S.S.R launched two unmanned and one manned Soyuz spacecraft (Cosmos 638 and 672 and Soyuz 16) to check out new systems and equipment for the joint mission. NASA and the Soviet Academy of Sciences approved public information plans and plans for prelaunch testing at the U.S. and U.S.S.R. launch sites. U.S. and Soviet specialists exchanged information about the moon, planets, environmental problems, and biomedical results from U.S. and U.S.S.R. space flights. U.S. and Soviet scientists preparing a joint experiment using Ats 6 data met in the U.S. in October for technical coordination. And plans were formulated in October for a U.S. life science experiment to fly on the next available Soviet biological satellite. For 101 days, June-September, the U.S. and 69 other countries participating in the Global Atmospheric Research Program\u2019s Atlantic Tropical Experiment monitored nearly every known meteorological factor along a 52-million-sq-km tropical area of land and sea from the eastern Pacific Ocean across Latin America, the Atlantic Ocean, and Africa to the western Indian Ocean. More than 4000 persons using 41 ships, 40 instrumented buoys, 12 aircraft, and 6 satellites probed from 1.6 km below the sea surface to the top of the atmosphere to improve weather predictions, assess pollution, determine the feasibility of large-scale weather modification, and establish new bonds of international cooperation. \" Applications and Energy During 1974 space technology continued to make significant contributions to the quality of life. In addition to 1974-launched Ats 6, Sms 1, Westar 1 and 2, Intelstat-lV F-8, and Noaa 4 to improve weather predictions and communications on the earth\u2014Erts 1, launched in July 1972, completed 29 mos in operation. Erts 1 had transmitted more than 100 000 photos covering three fourths of the world\u2019s land masses and coastal areas, erts data\u2014used to monitor urban and agricultural development, locate air and water pollution, update maps, and find new water and mineral resources\u2014had been provided to more than 300 U.S. and foreign investigators in government, universities, and industry, erts\u2014b development continued on schedule. NASA\u2019s pollution monitoring program\u2014to develop and demonstrate technology to monitor atmospheric and water pollution\u2014completed its second year. Procurement for design and construction of the Nimbus-G Oceanographic and Air Pollution Observing Satellite, planned for 1978 launch, was under way. The Lower Atmospheric Composition and Temperature Experiment (lacate) was demonstrated in May and a test in the advanced applications flight experiment program-\u2014using balloons, sounding rockets, and aircraft as well as ground-based experiments\u2014successfully gathered atmospheric data over a five-hour period. dod expanded and improved its Defense Satellite Communications System and let contracts for Phase 1 navstar global positioning satellites. The Defense Meteorological Satellite program continued to furnish weather data for military and civilian use. Space technology continued to be applied to medicine. A digital computing cardiotachometer to monitor heart rates, an automated blood pressure monitoring system, and a new method of attaching artificial limbs were among the NASA-developed contributions demonstrated in 1974. An Office of Energy Programs was established in NASA to focus the application of its aerospace technology to energy needs. In addition to programs to reduce aircraft air pollution and energy consumption and develop new fuels, NASA, under the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 and in cooperation with the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal agencies, was investigating the use of solar energy for heating and cooling buildings. An experimental solar house at Marshall Space Flight Center would ultimately derive up to 85% of its heating and cooling energy from the sun. Solar heating and cooling were being demonstrated in school. NASA continued research on wind energy systems, with the construction of a 100-kw wind-powered generator at Lewis Research Center; low-pollution, low-fuel-consumption automotive engines; aerodynamically designed vehicles to increase fuel economy; energy conversion systems. NASA distributed some 300 new Tech Briefs and 30 special compilations of new technology items to 15 000 subscribers in business and industry. Use of Regional Dissemination Centers for space technology applicable to other uses increased 34%, to 4000 clients. Tracking and Data Acquisition The Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (stdn) supported some 40 flight projects during 1974, including all NASA\u2019s earth-orbital missions as well as space projects of foreign governments and private industry. Congress authorized funds for procurement activities for a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss)\u2014two earth-orbiting satellites leased by NASA to relay data between low-altitude spacecraft and a single ground station. The authority to proceed further was subject to additional congressional review of a NASA-owned versus a leased system. (Pres Rpt 74; NASA Release 74r-330; NASA Activities, 15 Dec 74; A&A 74)",
