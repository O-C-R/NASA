That is why we have chosen the lunar exploration as an immediate national goal of prime importance. \u201cWhen will we clearly achieve the pre-eminence we seek ? This is not an easy question. The answer depends not only on_the sustained effort and investment we make, but on what the .Russians do. Their system lends itself to concentration of resources on specific tasks, but their system like any other is faced with conflicting demands for priority. At the present time we simply cannot know what level of investment they expect to make on a long-range space program.

Sternglass, physicist at Westinghouse Research Laboratories, proposed theory at American Physical Society in New York that would offer a unified concept of nuclear and electrical forces, heretofore considered separate phenomena, and would reduce all matter to two particles\u2014electron and positron. Sternglass hypothesized that all other particles found in atom (30 or more in recent years) are merely combinations and variations of negatively-charged electron and positively-charged positron. Simplest such grouping is single electron-positron pair, whirling near speed of light, which exhibits same properties as elementary particle known as neutral pi meson. Two such electron pairs, Sternglass said, exhibit properties of elementary particles K meson and Rho meson; other systems similarly account for all heavy mesons \u201cwithin a few per cent of their observed values.\u201d Combinations of electron-positron pairs with proton can explain other elementary particles classed as hyperons. Sternglass had assumed that Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity, which states that an object\u2019s mass increases with its velocity, governs particles\u2019 behavior; thus, if charged particles move fast enough and close enough in their orbits, they will generate sufficient force to hold atomic nucleus together.

[under the different lighting conditions that prevailed, the separated sustainer stage] was almost black in appearance, rather than the shiny silvery vehicle that Astronauts Glenn and Carpenter had seen at this time and that I had observed on the launching pad .... \u201cAt about 10 minutes 30 seconds, I went back to flying-by-wire, low, and tracked the sustainer as it traversed down through the window, and it was a thrill to realize the delicate touch that it is possible to have with fly-by-wire, low. . . . The control system was so effective that it just amounted to a light touch and maybe a few pulses in either axis to get the response I wanted. I could point the spacecraft at anything I wanted to. I could see the sustainer and track it, but I do not believe the relative motion problem would be so easy to solve that I would be able to steam along and join up with it. Although the relative velocity was on tne order of 20 to 30 feet per second, it was enough to cause a problem, particularly at a time when one is becoming acclimated to a new environment. These problems would be difficult to solve by one\u2019s own trajectory analysis, since there were no systems aboard to aid the pilot in solving the problem. I think that when we build up to the rendezvous technique, one will need more time than that just at the point of insertion to effect this rendezvous, even with proper training. The use of time while orbiting in space is only earth relative, therefore if a rendezvous is not hurried, the task should be relatively simple .... \u201cA smog-appearing layer was evident during the fourth pass while I was in drifting flight on the night side, almost at 32° South latitude. I would say that this layer represented about a quarter of the field of view out of the window, and this surprised me ....

The accuracy of visual observation will affect the complexity of the guidance system and the total thrust requirement for close-in maneuvering. For this reason, man\u2019s visual performance capability must be defined as accurately as are other design data for successful space missions. (Ling-Temco-Vought, Inc.; Space Information Digest, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1/28/63) During January: Dr. Douglas McKie, Univ. of London, writing in Jan. 1963 Endeavour, traced the history of the metric system, a subject of renewed interest in the U.K. since Parliament was considering; the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures. Dr. McKie pointed out that the recent adoption of the wavelength of a line in the spectrum of krypton-86 as the basis for an international unit of length was the realization of an old French dream at the time of the adoption of the metric system\u2014the use of an invariable natural standard. At the time of the French Revolution, Dr. McKie asserted, France had become weary of the chaos of variable systems of weights and measures and the government and the National Academy urged the States-General to adopt a national system. The States-General authorized the Academy to formulate a system of weights and measures based on measurement of an arc of the meridian as the universal standard and decimals as the notation system. This was done by 1793, but Revolutionary politics intervened, having done away with the States-General and even replaced the Academy. Not until Dec. 10, 1799, did the new standards become legal, and by then it had been discovered that the earth was not a perfect sphere and therefore that the arc of the meridian was not the invariable standard the Academy had thought.

Some more recent data indicate, moreover, that these secular changes are energy dependent. It has been noted that large time fluctuations somewhat similar to this phenomena [sic] were previously observed to occur in connection with the natural belts. The observed decrease of intensity in certain regions, and the other associated changes in the electron distribution, indicate a complicated phenomenon of considerable scientific interest.

So that more nearly synchronous orbit could be achieved, signal was sent from usns Kingsport in Lagos harbor, Nigeria, commanding satellite\u2019s apogee motor to fire 10 min. earlier (at 5:42 a.m.) than firing time set on onboard timer, syncom received and stored signal, and at 5:42 a.m. signal was sent from Kingsport to execute the command. 20.1 sec. later, ground reception of satellite telemetry abruptly ceased. Because apogee motor was to have fired for 21.2 sec., Colonel Warren said it was \u201cdifficult to imagine that these two events are unrelated .... \u201cSo, what can we make of all this ? First we know that synoom is in orbit. If the apogee motor did not fire, it is still in the elliptical orbit and will eventually be found, either by optics or by radar. If the apogee motor did fire, syncom is in a very high altitude orbit, and without telemetry, there is only a slim chance that it will be found. A search has been organized which will continue until such time as it is found, or until further search seems unwarranted.

One example is the recent agreement between the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the Gemini program. The intent is to insure that the scientific and operational experiments undertaken as a part of the Gemini program will be directed towards satisfying both military and nasa requirements and objectives .... \u201cOur forward space development program integrates the rad work of many years into a cohesive space program. Funding for all facets of the program is not included m the FY 1964 budget, but the program will provide for Air Force space activities for the near future. \u201cThe Air Force has developed a solid foundation of space on which military capabilities can be built. These efforts have brought us to a point where significant military space possibilities are (dearly apparent. Utilizing the technological base so far established, the Air Force must translate these technical capabilities into actual defense systems. The time required to move from a development state to operational systems is measured in years. Yet, it is the ready military capability, not the technological base, that accomplishes deterrence. Accordingly, the Air Force proposes to begin some of these conversions at once. \u201cThe forward program aims at two basic objectives: \u201cfirst, to enhance the general military posture of the United States by building a defense capability in space. Space is not only a new area of vulnerability to attack, but also affords important means of supporting the terrestrial forces of the U.S. in relation to a military threat posed by a hostile power. \u201csecond, to provide a capability within the space region for the purpose of denying to a hostile power the uninhibited military exploitation of space, and to provide a system of protection for U.S. scientific activities in space . . . .\u201d (Text; A-N-AF J oumal and Regi ster, 3/2/63,17,37)",

It is hoped that further data may reveal the presence of magnetic waves m space ana ciam^ me interactions oetween tne magnetic field and the plasma. ...\u201d mariner ii data on ionized particles in space revealed a flux of about 100 million particles per sq. centimeter per sec. in the range from few hundred to a thousand electron volts. In range 0.5 to 10 mev for protons, \u201cvery few exist at times, but at other times their flux may be a number of times that of cosmic rays. In the range of energies 10 to 800 mev for protons, there is nearly complete absence of particles normally [with great number possible during solar flare]. Above 800 mev, galactic cosmic rays enter interplanetary space and these decrease in numbers quite rapidly as the energy decreases. ...\u201d Data obtained from two-way doppler tracking of the probe during its flight would enable scientists to calculate the mass of Venus with probable error of 0.005 per cent (compared to probable error of 0.05 per cent calculated by astronomers); to determine precise locations of tracking stations on earth\u2014specifically, to calculate exact location of Goldstone Tracking Station to within 20 yards, calculated to within 100 yards before mariner n mission; to determine value of Astronomical Unit, established by radar observations as 92,956,220 mi.\u201450,000 mi. longer than that by classical astronomical observations; and to determine precisely the mass of the moon, now known to certainty of 0.1 per cent. Dr. Eberhard Rechtin, Director of jpl\u2019s Deep Space Instrumentation Facility, reported mariner ii\u2019s flight \u201cresulted in accumulation of some 65 million bits of information with an accuracy of at least one per cent and yet with the use of only three watts of radio frequency power.\u201d (nasa Releases 63-36-1, -2, -3, -4, -5; nasa Press Conf.

      "story": " Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert said in address at Patrick afb :\t. . about our future in space, let me establish two bench marks. The first is that the Air Force needs everything it can get from nasa. nasa needs us, too, as the record of how nasa puts things into space indicates, but if there weren\u2019t a nasa, the same facility and capability would have to be created some other way.\t... \u201cThere is reassuring precedent for the principle of having an outside-of-defense civilian agency provide the type of support we need. The case at point is the Atomic Energy Commission. Our own nuclear weapon flexibility as well as the Polaris-carrying submarine is sufficient testimony. \u201cThe clear lesson for us in the space field is that we must put requirements on nasa to meet whatever part of our needs can be met in this way. We must utilize every possible resource to build the necessary military capability and I can assure you that nasa is ready to respond. Jim Webb, the nasa Administrator, harbors no illusions about nasa\u2019s responsibilities in support of national defense requirements. \u201cThe second bench mark is that there is no such thing as peaceful space or military space. There is just space. The new and massive space program in a civilian agency was launched nearly five years ago, with\u2014for reasons which seemed not unreasonable at the time\u2014a great hullabaloo about peaceful objectives .... \u201cWe have a lot to learn. The recent agreement with nasa for joint participation in the Gemini program is one way. That agreement represents an answer from both dod and nasa to critics wbo said there was no place in space for military man. Our own activity directed toward manned space vehicles will increase, and with nasa\u2019s back-up, we\u2019ll attain the needed capability earlier than we would otherwise. \u201cA term you hear around Washington to denote the areas of cooperation between government agencies is \u2018interface.\u2019 Here at Patrick is one of the primary \u2018nasa\u2014Air Force interfaces.\u2019 Such terms usually leave me pretty cold but this one does have some descriptive value. \u201cThere will be plenty of problems between the Air Force and nasa, but not by any means all at the \u2018interface\u2019 points such as the Cape. We wouldn\u2019t either one be true to trust or tradition if there weren\u2019t. Any machine as big as the national space effort is bound to have some kind of friction. But just remember, a clutch is a friction interface. Its purpose is to join two shafts for the transmission of power. \u201cThe power we can get will provide protection for the free world in space. This was my third point\u2014to make sure that no aggressor can exploit space, either for expansionism on earth or interference in space with the peaceful pursuits of the free world. . . .\u201d (Text)",

Superiority in the space environment with its great advantages and benefits will be won and very likely can be held by that nation which first fashions into a usable system all of the scientific knowledge, all of the technology, all of the experience, all of the space launch and terminal facilities, and all of the aids to space navigation required for safety and regular services. \u201cThese are the capabilities and resources which the United States must have, and this budget is designed to make rapid progress toward acquiring them. \u201cmoving from our present position to achieve mastery of space requires that we add substant ially to our scientific knowledge and to our utilization of technology. The nasa program is progressing on both of these fronts. In a complex effort such as this, conducted in a new medium about which much is yet unknown, the scientists and the engineer inevitably must work closely together and grow increasingly dependent upon one another. . . . \u201cThe nasa program, therefore, is designed to expand both science and technology. We are moving forward on a broad front. We have avoided becoming trapped in a narrow program\u2014one limited, for example, to developing only the technology needed to reach the moon with state-of-the-art hardware.

It is not too much to say that in many ways the viability of representative government and of the free enterprise system, in a period of revolutionary changes based on science and technology, is being tested in space. \u201cThird, our national defense\u2014perhaps even our national survival\u2014demand that we act to insure that no hostile force will be permitted to use space as an unchallenged avenue of aggression against us. \u201cThe fourth and most important of the major reasons for undertaking a broad national program of space research and development\u2014the one which promises the greatest rewards for mankind\u2014the technological applications which will flow from it, will offer vast returns op our space investment here on earth over many years ahead.\u201d (Text)",

Mr. Webb cited Section 305 of the Space Act of 1958 authorizing the nasa Administrator to waive Government patent rights, then outlined present nasa patent policy, and explained how proposed policy would extend patent waiver. \u201cA careful comparison of the proposed revision with the terms of the present regulations . . . will show, I believe, that the public interest in inventions which come out of nasa\u2019s research and development contracts is more clearly stated and would, in practice, be fully protected .... \u201cIt is evident from nasa\u2019s present waiver regulations and the proposed revision that we are convinced that the public interest is often best served by permitting a contractor or subcontractor to retain commercial rights to inventions made in the course of doing research and development work funded by nasa\u2014provided, of course? the Government acquires a royalty-free license for use of the invention for governmental purposes, and provided, also, that the invention is actually worked, nasa\u2019s policy is intended to encourage use of inventions in two ways: first, by bringing the stimuli of the patent system into play and, second, by withholding the full benefits of waiver until public realization of the fruits of the invention have been achieved. Such a policy offers many advantages over a restrictive policy which would permit contractors to retain patent rights only in the exceptional case. The economy should not be deprived of the substantial benefits of the patent system. Incentives for contractors to conceal and protect new technological developments as trade secrets rather than to disclose them as patentable inventions are not desirable in government contracting for research and development. Historically, patent protection has been one of the rewards for full disclosure and publication . . . .\u201d (Testimony; Wash. Post, 3/15/63)",

The central question ... is whether the terms of the contract will encourage tbe contractor to apply his full teclmical background and experience to the Government. These considerations also apply to contracts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The national interest requires greater uniformity between dod and nasa patent practices since they are drawing on the services of the same sector of industrial research and development competence. \u201c. . .1 feel that a reasonable basis for framing a government-wide patent policy can be found. It seems important for the Government to move in the direction of a more consistent policy that will eliminate the unhealthy confusion and instabilities that attend the present situation. Such a policy should provide for the Government to retain title in the range of circumstances that I listed earlier; but it is necessary to recognize that, because of the problems of the type that concern the Department of Defense and nasa, any policy, to be realistic, should enable industry to retain exclusive rights in certain circumstances ....

Schriever (usaf) told Central Florida Medical Meeting, Orlando: \u201cThe successful development of space technology required major contributions from aerospace medicine. These contributions are twofold: first, an increased knowledge of the biological problems that wTill be encountered in space flight; and second, the development of equipment and techniques that will enable man not only to survive, but also to operate effectively in space. We ha ve already made great progress through the Air Force high altitude research, through simulation of the space environment, and through the Mercury program. But additional knowledge and experience will be required to conduct extensive manned operations in space. . . . \u201cOne of the major problems to be encountered in manned space flight is radiation, which may actually become a limiting factor on the duration of flights in a given orbit. This may come from several sources\u2014from solar flares, from space-ambient radiation such as found in the Van Allen belts, or from nuclear devices that may be exploded in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. There are two approaches which are being taken to the solution of this problem, and they may be used in conjunction. The first is shielding, which is the current means of protection against radiation. But in space systems, where weight is of critical importance, conventional shielding methods are likely to be out of the question. \u201cThe second method seeks to make use of a drug with antiradiation properties. Some 1,800 potential antiradiation drugs are currently being evaluated, and a number of them appear to hold great promise. Several interesting facts have already emerged from these studies. For example, cells with less than the normal supply of oxygen are protected from radiation damage. Stimulating the production of white blood cells and slowing the metabolism also protect the cells to some degree against radiation damage. Ideally, we would like to discover an antiradiation drug that can be administered orally without toxic side effects . . . .\u201d (Text)",

It does seem likely that as our national investment in space research and development increases, California will find it more difficult to maintain its present percentage of the total . . . .\u201d nasa\u2019s procurement, Mr. Webb said: \u201cIn short, we are making a deliberate effort to use the self-policing forces of the market place, to avoid building government competition with industry, and also to maintain sufficient managerial and technical capability in our own organization to make certain that our contractors are giving us the reliability we must have and the taxpayers a dollar\u2019s-worth of work for every dollar we spend.\u2019\u2019 In reviewing the international aspects of the nasa program, the nasa Administrator cited the provisions of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, and said: \u201cSome citizens, who regard military necessities as the prime justification for our space effort, find it difficult to accept the open, unclassified character of our civilian space program. Some regard basic scientific results as a national treasure, which should be kept under lock and key, and ask \u2018Why do we give away our secrets to the Russians?\u2019 \u201cThe answer is that our program involves both science and technology. There are no real secrets of nature, and it would be self-defeating to try to classify the science and principles of nature. On the other hand, technological advances and inventions are the product of men and effort, and can properly be classified and kept from potential enemies where the national interest so requires. \u201cAccordingly, our national space program moves forward with the basic scientific research conducted by the civilian agency, available to the whole scientific community, but technological development conducted by both nasa and the Department of Defense which is shared by both agencies, and classified when defense and military interests are involved. In this manner we have protected our national security while making the maximum contribution to the advancement of science . . . .\u201d (Text) March 27: In a letter to Rep. George P. Miller (D.-Calif.), Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner discussed the problems of scientific manpower. \u201cThe manyfold demands for technical manpower draw on the same pool of talent\u2014for defense and space, for innovation of civilian products able to compete in a world market, for meeting such domestic problems as mass transportation and environmental pollution associated with a rapidly urbanized society, for medical advancement, and for the effective management of our resources in such a way that we can help upgrade the way of life of citizens throughout the world without downgrading our own. Superposed on these requirements is the need for science, mathematics and engineering teachers to meet the rapidly growing college enrollment. A sharp competition for manpower has resulted, particularly for the superior individual having advanced training. In that competition, not all sectors of demand have succeeded in meeting their needs, and the future outlook is not encouraging. \u201cFor the first time, we are confronted with a plurality of goals that may well outstrip our technical manpower resources. \u201cFaced with the same manpower problem as the Soviet Union, how, in a democratic society where each citizen must have a free choice of his or her occupation, do we meet this challenge? \u201cThe urgent need for more individuals having advanced training is clear .... To keep pace with our national needs, it is the judgment of the Presidents Science Advisory Committee that we should and could increase the number of Ph.D.'s each year in engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences (emp) to reach 7,500 in 1970, the number of master\u2019s or equivalent to 30,000. This annual production of 37,500 advanced degrees by 1970 should be compared with 15,000 in 1960, 11,000 in 1950. \u201cA substantial fraction of these new graduates, incidentally, must be plowed back into the universities for teaching, and soon .... With regard to students, the major barrier to continuation of full-time graduate study is financial .... Another barrier is inadequate graduate facilities .... In addition, there is very convincing evidence that some geographical areas produce a much greater proportion of doctorates than others .... Relatively few students are prepared to study more than several hundred miles from their homes. It would thus appear that we have a special problem in terms of meeting an unequal geographical distribution of centers of educational excellence. \u201cThe present barriers to graduate education\u2014limitations in student support, number of faculty, and educational facilities\u2014 must be overcome. It is to that end that the President has proposed that the Federal Government take the initiative and provide the leadership needed to meet these national needs. \u201cTo meet goals for graduate education in the three fields of potential shortage\u2014engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences\u2014it is of critical importance that we increase the number of graduate students enrolling in the fall of 1964 from the 22,000 which may be expected on the basis of projected trends to some 30,000 .... Support would be provided within existing legislation, through nsf, aec, and nasa fellowships, and through new nsf science development and training grant programs .... In virtually all of these cases, assistance to students would be accompanied by a grant directly to the college or university to help meet the true cost of education, and thus would assist the university to maintain an internal balance between fields .... The President also proposes Federal support for new physical facilities .... \u201cThe proposed program is designed to achieve a substantial and unprecedented acceleration in the rate of production in advanced degrees in these three fields.\u201d (nasa Leg. Act. Rpt. 11/86, 6/10/63)",

The experimental device is made with a fiber of transparent material of the same type used in making many familiar clear plastics. Employing a newly discovered physical effect, it produces coherent pulses of intense crimson light at the highest visible frequency yet known to have been attained by a laser. The unique laser mechanism that is employed may permit the development of plastic lasers that emit coherent light over the visible spectrum from infrared through ultraviolet. The way may now be opened for the use of still other materials that resist laser action when contained in inorganic crystals. Some of these materials may be capable of producing coherent light at yellow, green, blue, and other frequencies. (Data Supplied by Radio Corp. of America; msfc Space Information Digest, 4/15/63)",

Their brilliance, they believe, may make it possible to penetrate two to three times deeper into space than was considered possible with present-day telescopes. Five of these super-bright celestial bodies have so far been recognized. Radio astronomers detected them by their radiations of energy in the longer wavelengths, at radio frequencies. They were identified in the third Cambridge (England) Catalogue of Radio Sources as 3C\u201448,3C-196,3C\u2014286, 3C-147, and 3C-273. The objects are so bright that they had been thought to be nearby stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy, but there is now growing evidence that they are very distant galaxies involved in titanic explosions. The study of such distant objects is vital to cosmologists in determining the kind of universe we live in\u2014whether it will continue expanding, stop expanding, or will eventually contract. {NYT, Western Edition, 3/26/63, Wm.

Further, those things which are made for space travel receive no compromises from that harsh environment. Which is to say that a very large part of the total space work is at the very leading edge of the state-of-the-art; and that in another large part of the state-of-the-art must be extended. \u201cIt is reasonable to think that an effort of such size, range and sophistication, extending over a number of years, cannot fail to have major scientific and economic consequences: consequences that begin as scientific and technological advances and then are converted into new techniques of manufacture, new systems of organization, and new products and services. The space effort will be, we think, altogether comparable in its effect on the American economy to that of World War II. Our objective is to maximize, to facilitate, to speed up this effect. . . . \u201cWe are aware that past experience indicates severe problems in the transfer of government research and development efforts to private use. However, we feel that the Nation\u2019s well being requires a major effect to determine whether these problems can be solved.\u201d (Testimony)",

It is no tribute to modem science to jump lightly to the conclusion that all its secrets of particle physics, or molecular lift, or heredity, or outer space, are now within miraculously easy reach. The truth is more massive and less magical; it is that wherever we turn, in defense, in space, in medicine, in industry, in agriculture, and, most of all, m basic science itself, the requirement is for better work, deeper understanding, higher education. \u201cAnd while I have framed this comment in the terms of the natural sciences, I stand squarely with those who insist that at every level of learning there must be an equal concern for history, for letters, and the arts\u2014and for man as a social being, in the widest meaning of Aristotle\u2019s phrase.

      "story": " Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director nasa Goddard Institute of Space Studies, speaking at the American Society of Newspaper Editors, attempted to explain the \u201cscientific effort\u201d in the context of the entire space program: \u201cI think, personally, that there is also a powerful general stimulus wbich comes from the need for developing new ideas and technologies to operate in and master a new environment. One must go back to the explorations of the late 15th Century to find a parallel to what we are about to witness in the next 30 to 50 years. Those explorations 450 years ago and their results awakened interest in the world and an intellectual ferment which were the necessary foundations for the development of a scientific revolution. \u201cThe ideas of a scientific revolution could not have flowered in a static society with fixed ideas of what could and could not be done. It took the explorations of the 15th and early 16th centuries to shake established notions enough to permit the birth of modem scientific thought. In a subtle and deep sense, this is one of the reasons for the interest of the scientist in the exploration elements of the space program .... \u201cI think that the history of the last 100 years demonstrates that we need not expect a very long wait before space research will feed back into everyday affairs and play a role in them. \u201cIn the 19th century, the lag was rather long. The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published a treatise on electromagnetism in 1864, but not until 1901 did Marconi transmit the first wireless signal across the Atlantic. \u201cMore recently, in 1932, Chadwick discovered the neutron in England. Fermi set the first atomic pile critical at Stagg Field in Chicago in 1942, only 10 years from the basic discovery to a very formidable application. \u201cStill more recently, Bardeen and Brattain and Shockley at the Bell Labs discovered the transistor in 1948 and only six years later the first transistorized power amplifier appeared on the market .... \u201c. . . the exploration of the moon has a very special role to play, precisely for the reason that would make one think the moon is uninteresting scientifically\u2014specifically because the moon is a relatively lifeless body. It has no atmosphere, no oceans, nothing to wear away the record of the history of the solar system, and of whatever has occurred to the surface of the moon since its birth. \u201cOn the earth, record of even tremendous surface events disappear within 10 to 50 million years, a very short time compared to the age of the planet, and mountains form and are turned over. With the action of weather, everything changes and disappears as the millions of years go by. That is probably also true on Mars and Venus which resemble the earth in this respect. But the moon has no oceans, no atmosphere, no mountain-building activity that we can discern. For this reason, the moon is a kind of Rosetta Stone of the solar system from which we can read the past. That is why it is so interesting to the scientist. He has the opportunity to find there the record of the early history of the solar system. \u201cTo the student of the origin of the earth, the moon is even more interesting scientifically than Mars or Venus. \u201c. . . if the moon and the planets were formed out of gas and dust in the condensation that surrounded the primitive sun, then we can expect such condensation to accompany the birth of every star. There are one hundred billion stars in our galaxy alone. Nearly every one of them we expect to have a planetary system around it. Some small fraction of those planets will be at the right distances from their suns, from their stars, and of the right size to have conditions favorable to the development of physical life as we know it. \u201cIf that is the case, it follows that life must be a relatively commonplace thing, physical life in the universe . . . \u201c. . . there is one small instrument on the Tiros which has not achieved as much attention as it deserves. The size of a quarter, it is a black disc which detects the infrared energy radiated from the top of the atmosphere. That is the energy which is reflected back into space from the earth. We can accurately estimate the energy coming to the earth from the sun and we can take the difference between the two and calculate the amount of energy remaining in the atmosphere. \u201cThis energy deposited in the atmosphere constitutes the driving force that generates weather activity. With the aid of satellites, for the first time we can measure the energy difference and hope to break through from the day-to-day forecasting, which depends on immediately preceding events, to the week-long or two-week forecasts.\u201d (Text)",

This process of choice must begin with a requirement for solid indications that a proposed system would really add something to our national security . . . . \u201cDevelopment costs alone on typical major weapons systems today average upward of $1 billion. Over a billion dollars was spent on the atomic airplane, which was little closer to being a useful weapon when we canceled it, shortly after taking office, than it had been half a dozen years earlier. Eighty million was spent on the Goose decoy missile, essentially a pilotless aircraft that the enemy would confuse with our B-52\u2019s .... \u201cThe RS-70 is an example of a weapon which, it seems to me, fails to meet the basic requirement for a major systems development: a solid indication that the weapon, if developed, would add significantly to our national security. It happens to be a particularly expensive weapon: to develop, procure, and operate a modest force of these planes would cost us at least $10 billion. Yet considering the weapons we already have, or will have by the time the RS-70 could be operational, it is very hard to see how this weapon would add to our national security .... \u201cAs weapons systems grow more complex, more expensive, and more difficult to maintain in a high state of military readiness, it is essential that we limit as far as possible the number of new systems that we bring into operation; for we want to be as sure as possible that wTe can depend on every system to operate when it is really needed. A basic fact of life is that under the chaotic conditions of combat you do not get anything like the efficiency of weapons systems that you get on a test range.

Welsh, Executive Secretary of nasc. reviewed the national objectives in space: \u201cFirst of all, there is an over-all policy objective, which the President has expressed as the determination of this country \u2018to become the world\u2019s leading space-faring nation.\u2019 It is worth mentioning that this is a broad umbrella. . . . Suffice to say that the space program is not a one-project design nor a short-run episode. It is a growing, expanding, multi-project program, which I predict will become an increasingly significant part of our way of life. As important as it is, the moon project is not the whole space program; it is just one portion and one phase of an over-all program which has breadth through variety and depth far into the future. \u201cA few features of this broad space policy are: \u201c1. Its objectives are peaceful . . . the distinction as to what is peaceful and what is not peaceful is a matter of intent and is not determined by what agency of the government engages in them .... \u201c2. Our policy asserts that space travel and space exploration are subject to international law and that such activity should be consistent with the provisions of the United Nations charter. . . . \u201c3. It is our policy to seek increased international cooperation in, and mutually advantageous agreements for, the orderly and open conduct of space and space related activities .... \u201c4. It is also our policy that the concept and performance of our space responsibilities shall be maintained and strengthened as a national program rather than a series of separate and unrelated projects. . . . \u201c5. There are inherent risks in space exploration, particularly in manned flight, and they must be recognized .... \u201c6. While we must continue to improve on state-of-the-art competences, it is essential that we strive just as hard to make so-called quantum jumps in technology and performance .... \u201c7. It is a significant element of policy that progress be the joint product of government and private enterprise. . . . \u201cIn conclusion, the national space program is an essential and dynamic feature of our economy. It benefits the many rather than the few. It strengthens the nation, both at home and abroad. It looks forward rather than backward. It highlights the contributions of the most able technologists and the most able managers and gives them an unprecedented peacetime opportunity to repay more fully the special bonus they have received by living in this great country. \u201cWe can afford the space program. We must afford it. We can be satisfied with nothing less than first place\u2014to the moon, to the planets, and throughout the solar system.\u201d (Text)",

This has been helped by the fact that it has become obvious that nasa does not intend to neglect scientific exploration because of the Apollo priority. As the nasa program has unfolded with the years, it has become apparent that considerable scientific exploration by instrumented satellites and probes is a necessary preliminary to extending the parameters of manned space flight. It is also evident that manned space flight itself will offer a greater opportunity for scientific exploration of the universe than could ever be possible using only remotely controlled instruments and data transmission .... There are a great many valid, vital reasons why this nation must continue to press its exploration of space at the maximum feasible pace. \u201cWe intend to discuss them as the Apollo debate continues.

Wk., 4/29/63,17) April£9: aec Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, speaking at Centennial Charter Day Convocation, Univ. of Massachusetts, said: \u201cIf we look back a number of centuries to the Middle Ages, we find that man and society in the Western World were dominated by rather static concepts. The individual was born into a world that was essentially unchanging by our standards. He was not very important. Poverty, disease, toil, and natural calamities were simply an inevitable part of life. He accepted the proffered explanations of the world and the universe, and his curiosity was not encouraged. Man was a fearful and superstitious plaything of his environment. The concept that man might improve his lot was not widely considered. Nor were the tools at hand for such a task. \u201cThe beginning of the changes in this outlook are generally identified with the Renaissance and the Reformation. The questioning and inquisitive human spirit could not be stifled forever. Men began to question old forms and beliefs\u2014in religion, politics, and the law; in art and literature; and in science and philosophy.\t* \u201cThe process of breaking out of a closed world and liberating the mind was a slow one, and it is by no means complete. There were many landmarks, established by many brave men in all walks of life, on the route to liberation. An example was the overthrow, by the evidence produced by Copernicus and Galileo, of the dogmatic concept that the earth is the center of the universe. It is difficult for us today to estimate the impact, on a closed system of thought, of the knowledge that the earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. If such an important belief could fall, were not others vulnerable ? While science was opening man\u2019s eyes to the truth of his surroundings, a change was m the making concerning the concept of nian himself. The themes of individual rights ana freedom were being developed in the period of the enlightenment and the first crystallization of these revolutionary ideas was in the American Revolution\u2014the first revolution of which I am to speak to you today. Beginning with the Declaration of Independence and culminating with the adoption of the Constitution, the place of the State was confined to protecting the rights of the individual and becoming the instrument for man\u2019s self-government .... \u201cThe freedom to embrace new ideas, the concept that men need not accept miserable conditions of life, and the hope inherent in science, unleashed as never before the economic energies of man. Our second revolution, the industrial revolution, and the rise of science and technology, saw a beginning of the realization of . . . a huge increase in industrial and agricultural production at a cost of less total labor, the conquest of many diseases, the lengthening of life, the improvement of health .... \u201cAs we now enter the early stages of the scientific revolution\u2014 our third revolution\u2014the full flower of creative evolution is bursting upon us. Yet \u2018powerful as the forces of science and technology have already demonstrated themselves to be, relatively speaking we are only beginning to feel their influence. Our Nation and the world are committed to an accelerating cycle of knowledge-gathering and knowledge-exploitation. We cannot visualize in detail the consequences for the future. We can, however, clearly see that we can, if we have the wisdom, create an environment essentially of our own choosing. The scientific revolution can provide for the essential needs of men around the globe. Our small world will grow smaller. At the same time our perspective will be broadened unimaginably by the exploration of space. We can only guess at the distant impact of this dynamism on man, his institutions, the content of thought and the quality of life. We can be sure, however, that successful adaptation to the changing environment can be achieved, in an atmosphere of freedom, only through advancement of men generally to higher 1 eve's of education . . . .\u201d (Text, in CR, 4/29/63, 6847\u201449) April 29: Addressing the Senate space committee, Deputy Defense Secretary Roswell Gilpatric summed up dod\u2019s philosophy on space: \u201cThe United States has a single national space program. . . . Space, like other mediums, affords useful and often unique ways for achieving defense objectives. Some of these are by no means uniquely military . . . similar remarks would apply to machines and devices used in the air, on land and on sea, and space is no exception. ... As a corollary to these observations, the totality of our military space efforts, assessed from a national rather than a departmental standpoint, greatly exceeds the efforts of the Department of Defense alone. Space systems and devices are not simply military or non-military merely because they are developed by one agency or another.\u201d (M&R, 5/6/63) April H9: General Bernard A.

I believe that our [the United States\u2019] undoubted leadership in pure science will continue to be nurtured by the openness, freedom, and free enterprise spirit which characterize our society. Our accomplishments in pure science will provide a vast reservoir of ideas for important achievements in applied science, and our innate good sense and good will lead to a voluntary rational measure of coordination and control in those areas which are indispensable for the achievement of our national objectives in applied science. I believe that the Soviet methods of strict supervision and control will lead to numerous short-range breakthroughs in applied science but that the momentum will not be sustained unless there are also significant advances in their pure science. A great improvement in the quality of these achievements will depend upon their ability to fully establish the conditions of scientific freedom which are essential for highly creative work in pure science. \u201c. . . If the Soviet Government comes to realize\u2014and I believe that the Russian scientists already do\u2014that scientific and political freedom go hand in hand and that it is difficult to guarantee scientific freedom without a major liberalization of Soviet society in all its aspects, there is bound to be a great efflorescence of pure science in the Soviet Union. And if a large measure of political freedom is established in the Soviet Union, it is quite likely that we shall be sending our American astronauts together with their Russian counterparts on joint expeditions to the moon and other celestial objects beyond.\u201d {CR, 5/27/63, 9036-38) During April: Air Force launched an Atlas F with a Chrysler-built nose cone on a 5,000-mile flight from Cape Canaveral to the vicinity of Ascension Island in a continuation of the Advanced Ballistic Re-entry System (Abres) test program.

It had two fundamental purposes originally which we have not given up and which we still consider to be of paramount importance\u2014to gain experience in prolonged weightlessness and to gain experience in rendezvous before Apollo .... \u201cHowever, as we developed the Gemini program, we found it was not wise to have only an updated Mercury spacecraft. We. found as we developed the subsystems for Gemini that it was much wiser to incorporate technology known today\u2014not something that was early developmental technology of the past. This concept would lead us step by step toward Apollo, and we would reap tremendous benefits from it. Ip addition ... it became quite apparent to us that this would be a very useful Earth orbital spacecraft .... \u201cIn developing the Gemini subsystems, we find that they are better and more sophisticated than initially conceived and the spacecraft is much more sophisticated than anticipated. Therefore, the costs tend to be higher and the time scales longer .... \u201cWe had planned to have the first manned Gemini flight the second flight, during the first quarter of 1964. Our present plan is that the first manned flight in the series would not be until the fourth quarter of 1964. Our current plan grew in part from the advisability of having more sophisticated subsystems, which required more time, and in part from a reorientation of the profram to include a second unmanned flight before the manned ight .... \u201c. . . the Titan II . . . has had some developmental problems over and above what we had anticipated. However, the problems are always encountered in a developmental program. In our opinion it will be safer to use the Titan II for manned flights if we have two structural missions. We will have more time to eliminate the developmental problems .... \u201cWe are planning an unmanned flight at the end of this year and about the middle of next year. We plan to have a manned flight in the last quarter of 1964 . . . .\u201d (Transcript)",

Webb, in keynote address May 6, cited recommendation by Iowa Summer Study that one or more scientists be included in Project Apollo lunar flights: \u201cTo those who have the responsibility for success in reaching the moon, it has appeared that the nature of the Apollo effort requires the training of astronauts who have substantial experience as test pilots in high speed jet aircraft, and to the extent possible engineering training as well. \u201cMeanwhile, it is apparent that the view of the scientists that trained scientific personnel should participate is valid, and that at the earliest appropriate stage in the program scientists will be included on Apollo missions. So far as we can now tell we are obligated to utilize astronauts with the maximum of test-flight experience and highly conditioned reflexes on the first flight of the most difficult of all undertakings. Should training and experience in intermediate flights indicate otherwise we will, of course, take this into consideration in determining the stage of development in manned space flight at which a scientist-astronaut will directly participate. \u201cIn its effort to insure maximum scientific benefit from the manned space flight program nasa is doing several things: \u201cFirst, manned space flights are being used to take scientific measurements in order that they will provide results beyond crew training and technological experience. \u201cSecond, efforts have already begun to provide scientific training for the present group of astronauts including geological field trips to enhance their capacity for scientific observation. \u201cThird, a manned space science working group has been established [within nasa] .... This group is already at work in the planning of a program for training scientists for space flight . . . .\u2019\u2019 (Text) Dr. David H.

Shea, Deputy Director for Systems in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, reviewed U.S. manned space flight program. Describing Project Gemini, he said:\t. . the Gemini is more than an experimental spacecraft. At the end of its scheduled developmental flight program, it will be available for missions ranging from scientific and engineering experiments to the ferrying of astronauts to and from a permanent space laboratory. The end goal of Gemini is, therefore, an operational spacecraft which can be launched by relatively small boosters. We expect Gemini to be a useful space vehicle for several years .... The Gemini spacecraft will reach operational status by 1966 . . . .\u201d (Text)\t. Capt. Robert F. Freitag (usn), Director of Launch Vehicles and Propulsion in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, said: \u201cThe nation\u2019s program to achieve pre-eminence in space and to insure that, the United States occupies first place among the nations of this world in science, in technology and in conquest of space is critically dependent on the power of the rocket. \u201cYou may have heard much about the \u2018booster gap\u2019 and the effect this situation has had on our position vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union started well ahead of us in the development of large rockets, so necessary for manned flight. The Soviets have been ahead of us, and are still ahead of us in their ability to launch reliably large masses to Earth orbit. \u201cHowever, with the acceleration of our own progress and by the establishment of our program on a sound engineering basis we can, we believe, surpass the Soviets in time and clearly establish and demonstrate United States pre-eminence in manned space flight. . . .\u201d (Text) Reviewing nasa space program, Director of nasa Office of Programs D. D. Wyatt said: \u201cIn its broadest context the nasa program can be classified into three complementary parts. First, we have those phases of the program which are aimed at the exploration of the very nature of space .... \u201cThe second major element of our program is aimed at the earliest practical utilization of space for the benefit of mankind .... \u201cComplementing our programs to understand and define space is a third major program element aimed at developing and improving the highly complex technologies which will enhance our future capabilities in space . . . .\u201d (Text) John E. Naugle, Director of nasa Geophysics and Astronomy Programs, said: \u201c. . . the scientific program which we have in nasa is a logical extension of the research work which has been underway in laboratories on the earth since the time of Galileo. Just as astronomers once carried their telescopes to the top of a mountain to see better, now we carry telescopes beyond the earth on rockets and satellites. By doing this we see entirely new phenomena and enable scientists to broaden their studies in certain scientific disicplines . . . .\u201d He then discussed scientific results from each of the six scientific satellites launched by nasa since beginning of 1962 (oso i, explorer xiv, explorer xv, alouette i, ariel, and explorer xvii).\t(Text) nasa Director of International Programs Arnold W. Frutkin said in May 7 address delivered by J. H. Barnes, nasa Chief of Cooperative Programs, Office of International Programs: \u201cWhat other nations are doing in space and in particular, what they are doing together, is in fact small when compared with the resources going directly into national programs in the US and the ussr. Yet, what has been accomplished provides substantial evidence of the feasibility, the benefits, and the promise of joint action by the nations in this new field . . . .\u201d (Text) Edgar M. Cortright, Deputy Director of nasa Office of Space Sciences, described scientific spacecraft now under development, and said: \u201cWe must continually assess our progress .... The flight performance of our spacecraft has been increasing dramatically .... The useful life of unmanned spacecraft launched in 1962 has exceed six months and is still rising because most of those intended for long life are still operating successfully. \u201cOur progress with launch vehicles has been equally gratifying. In 1962, 82% of all major nasa launchings were successful. This performance has been paced by the remarkable Thor-Delta which has successfully launched 16 out of 17 spacecraft. In addition, the huge Saturn has scored 4 out of 4 perfect flights. During this time period, both the Thor-Delta and the Scout payloads were increased over 60% at no increase in their $2.5 million and $1 million price tags. These dramatic increases in performance, life, and reliability of spacecraft and launch vehicles represent by far the most effective way to achieve economy in the space program . . . .\u201d (Text) nasa Director of Advanced Research and Technology Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff said: \u201cThere are four principal areas where a continuing and driving program of advanced research is required if this nation is to achieve pre-eminence in aeronautical and space activities in the decades to come. These are energy conversion and propulsion; materials and structures; control, guidance and communications; and space sciences and the environment of space.\u201d (Text) Louis B. C.

Like Columbus, we have been told time and again, the United States today lives in an age of discoveiy. Like Columbus, the United States must got fail to seize its moment of greatness. \u201cWhile popular and plausible, the comparison strikes Barron\u2019s as unfortunate. To begin with, in contrast to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Columbus raised the funds for his epoch-making voyage at least partly from private sources. Far from setting out to discover America, moreover, the admiral and his financial backers merely sought to find a shorter\u2014hence more profitable\u2014route to the Indies; their primary aim was to make money, not history. Finally, though Washington has chosen to ignore the inconvenient fact, the conquest of the new world yielded Spain, after a short-lived fling at glory, four centuries of economic and political decay. \u201cThe parallel to Columbus can be pushed too far, not only by friends of the space program but also by its foes. Nonetheless, the lessons of the past, coupled with some contemporary widsom on the subject, underscore the need for a sweeping reappraisal of the current U.S. space program. For example, lawmakers now suspect that nasa\u2019s skyrocketing budget (from which, according to the administration, not 1 cent can be cut without courting disaster) is designed to serve political as well as scientific ends. In turn, scientists, who know how to weigh alternatives, have grown increasingly skeptical of the overwhelming emphasis which Washington has placed upon landing a man on the moon. Thereby, they claim, the United States has ignored far less costly and more fruitful avenues of lunar exploration, while neglecting other promising ventures in space.

Committee on The Peaceful Uses of Outer Space convened in Geneva. {NYT, 5/3/63) Mercury spacecraft faith 7, with Astronaut Leroy Gordon Cooper (Maj., usaf) as pilot, lifted off Pad 14, Cape Canaveral, at 8:04 a.m. est. Atlas launch vehicle placed spacecraft in initial orbit of 166-mi, apogee, 100-mi. perigee, 88.7-min. period, 32.5° inclination to equator, 17,544-mph speed. Be-sides participation in flight procedures, astronaut ate, slept, and conducted scientific experiments. Because automatic control system (acs) failed during 19th orbit, spacecraft was oriented manually during 22nd orbit, retrorockets were fired manually, and re-entry phase was conducted without acs. faith 7 landed two miles from U.S.S. Kearsarge near Midway Island in Pacific. Value of trained pilot\u2019s presence in spacecraft was underscored by successful mission achievement despite acs failure. MA-9 provided biomedical data confirming man can survive and function during prolonged space flight with no ill effects. Experiments during flight included: ejecting from spacecraft in third orbit a 10-lb. flashing-beacon sphere (testing visibility of objects in space in preparation for future rendezvous maneuvers), which Cooper sighted during fifth and sixth orbits; photographs of zodiacal light nighttime airglow layer; horizon definition experiment, using colored filters in 70-mm. camera; radiation measurement experiment, using Geiger counters mounted on spacecraft exterior and detectors inside spacecraft and inside astronaut\u2019s space suit; tethered balloon experiment (to measure atmospheric drag) which Cooper attempted in sixth orbit but balloon did not deploy; infrared photography for meteorological purposes; television photography, which achieved historic \u201cfirst\u201d in U.S. manned space flight with direct transmission of TV pictures to tracking stations; cabin environmental temperature study, another historic \u201cfirst\u201d with cabin coolant valve and fan turned off from orbit #5 until about two hours before re-entry, astronaut relying on space suit for cooling while cabin temperature stabilized at around 96° F; HF antenna tests, another \u201cfirst\u201d, involving transmissions with antenna horizontally polarized and vertically polarized; ground light experiment, with astronaut observing three-million-candlepower xenon light at Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa; window attenuation experiment, with astronaut viewing calibrated standard light source and stars to evaluate transmission of light through spacecraft window; and white paint patch measurements, investigating changes in paint pigments during re-entry heating. Cooper\u2019s historic flight covered estimated 593,885 mi. in 34 hrs. 20 min. Nearly 36 years before, Charles Lindbergh\u2019s historic flight from New York to Paris covered 3,610 mi. in 33 hrs. 30 min.

Webb reviewed early history of U.S. development in aeronautics, noting U.S. was far behind m aircraft development in 1915, when naca was formed: \u201cThe wisdom of its [naca\u2019s] establishment was amply demonstrated over the ensuing years, and led ultimately to United States supremacy in civil and military aviation . . . .\u201d He noted U.S. was behind in 1957 when U.S.S.R. orbited sputnik i, then cited formation of nasa in 1958 and President Kennedy\u2019s recommendation in 1961 of accelerated program \u201cto give the nation a clearly leading role in the conquest of space. \u201cI review this history because it is necessary occasionally to remind ourselves of the past if we are to have a clear view of the Sresent. With a warning clearly sounded in space, the nation etermined, for the first time, that it would seize the opportunities offered by man\u2019s new ability to explore space, and that it would not be content merely with catching up with somebody else. Instead we set our sights on the most challenging goal within our reach, which could be achieved within a time scale competitive with the ability of others to do the same, and determined that we would explore the moon with men within this decade. \u201cNothing in recent history suggests that we have reason now to change our course .... \u201cThose who view the lunar program simply as a propaganda effort fail to grasp that not only our prestige, but our capacity for constructive international leadership, our economic and military capacity for technological improvement, depend upon our ability to achieve acknowledged superiority in science and technology, and to use this capability in our own behalf and that of our allies . . . .\u201d (Text) Dr. Raymond L.

Although it is impossible to predict quantitatively the impact on transportation of current aeronautical and space research, past experience has shown that we may predict with confidence that it will be considerable . . . .\u201d (Text) Najeeb E.

For example, clearly it is up to the Government to play a role in the development of a supersonic transport, if this Nation is to provide such an aircraft .... \u201cI believe the government should act only in areas where the people \u2018cannot so well do for themselves\u2019 even in this increasingly complex and technical world, and that we who are charged with making decisions affecting the public must be convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that there is a need for the Federal Government to conduct the activity at all . . . .\u201d (Text)",

It Should, nevertheless, require a national, rather than a single agency decision, to get it under way. There is no question that, if a decision is made to proceed, the Department of Defense should be a full partner in this enterprise all the way, and may even qualify for management of the national project to satisfy both nasa and dod needs.

Work is done best\u2014even by the technical community\u2014which is not exempt from the laws of human nature\u2014when a specific goal is set. An objective of landing on the moon in the 1960\u2019s . . . permits us to work at a challenging pace; yet, does not absorb a greater percentage of the nation\u2019s resources than our country can afford. This is only one percent of the gross national product at current rate .... \u201cProject Apollo does not fit the description of a crash program.- The wartime Manhattan project was a crash program. We used all the resources we could to develop the atomic bomb in the shortest period of time, regardless of cost. We maintained duplicating operations over a 3-year period in the hope that one would work\u2014and one did, in time to help win a war. Apollo is no such project. If it were, we would not have had the controversy over whether earth-orbiting rendezvous, lunar-orbiting rendezvous, or a direct landing was the best way to get a man to the moon. A crash project would have gone into operational stages of all three alternatives to a moon landing .... \u201cThe shortage of scientific manpower has not been aggravated in a measurable way by Apollo. Those critics who fear that it has, have not established their case. For example, in 1970, it is predicted that U.S. scientists and engineers will total 1,995,000, of which only 114,700 or less than 6 percent, will work for nasa and its contractors.

It has included all unclassified information made available to it by norad except for a period from January to April 1963 when it was thought that each agency, nasa and dod, would handle its own reporting, nasa has resumed publishing all unclassified information received from norad . . . . \u201cIn summary, nasa was never assigned the responsibility for reporting satellite tracking information but did agree at dod\u2019s request, when the dod\u2019s Space Tracking effort became operational, to disseminate all unclassified information on satellites to the scientific community using the information made available to it by NORAD. \u201cThere apparently has been some variation in the type and scope of the information which Defense has made available to us. We have released all unclassified material received from norad without modification . . . .\u201d Under recent nasa-dod agreement, nasa\u2019s Satellite Situation Report lists information on Soviet satellites when such information is: (1) cleared for release by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, (2) officially reported to U.N. Registry and confirmed by norad tracking data, and (3) publicly announced by Soviet government ana confirmed by Subcommittee members joined Chairman John E. Moss (D.-Calif.) in accusing nasa of \u201cunjustified subservience\u201d to dod policy. Chairman Moss said that \u201cofficial space information has dwindled to the point where a true perspective of where we stand, in relation to the Russians, scarcely exists so far as the general public is concerned .... [dod policy] clearly has resulted in the withholding of information vital to public understanding of United States and Russian space activities.\u201d Asked if any Soviet space failures in recent months had been kept secret by U.S. authorities, Dr. Simpson replied that his answer could be given only in executive session.

Perhaps even more important is the clear evidence that these successes engender growing interest and greatly expand the basis for succeeding cooperative enterprises. \u201cWe are quite aware of our great indebtedness to European science and technology. We believe that the freest possible association of our respective programs, where they complement and support each other, is the soundest way to proceed if we are to continue to benefit in this way and if we are to reciprocate generously. I believe that in the long run cooperation between nasa for the United States and esro and eldo for Europe affords the best means to expand the hard core of cooperation in space research, and that such collaboration will have the greatest potential for further extension to forward-looking nations everywhere in the world . . . .\u201d (Text)",

The decision-making process does not allow for vacuums; failure to decide on a schedule for attempting to reach the moon is equivalent to setting no deadline at all. Work is done best\u2014even by the technical community\u2014which is not exempt from the laws of human nature\u2014when a specific goal is set. An objective of landing on the moon in the 1960\u2019s was chosen as the one that would permit us to work for a lunar landing in a rapid, yet efficient manner. This permits us to work at a challenging pace; yet, does not absorb a greater percentage of the Nation\u2019s resources than our country can afford. This is only 1 percent of the gross national product at current rate. \u201cOnce having been made\u2014in 1961\u2014the decision is subject to review and modification every year at budget time and can be modified within limits .... nasa is not immune from congressional appropriations review .... \u201cAdministrator Webb has announced that nasa, in this decade, will accomplish all the programs now planned, including lunar landing for under $35 billion. This is less than two-thirds of the budget requested by the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1964 alone\u2014a small price for the experience, technology, industrial base, and facilities which may be required for national security .... \u201cMr. President, there is ample room in the current debate on the space program for divergent views and criticism and for constructive suggestions.

U.S. scientists, headed by Dr. Richard W. Porter and participating through nas Space Science Board, delivered 70 papers at Fourth International Space Science Symposium held in con j unction with cospar meeting, (nas Release) Dr. Richard W. Porter, head of U.S. delegation, summarized U.S. space activities from approximately Jan. 1 to Dec. 31,1962: more than 100 high-altitude research balloons; approximately' 846 synoptic rockets (by Meteorological Rocket Network from six North American sites); and more than 100 scientific sounding rockets. U.S. had announced launching of 19 scientific and scientific-applications satellites and space probes. (Porter, Report to oospar) Head of Soviet delegation A. A. Blagonravov summarized Soviet space activities of 1962: launching of interplanetary probe mars i; 71 geophysical and meteorological sounding rockets; 12 unmanned (Cosmos) satellites; and two manned spacecraft. Elaborating on mars i, he said that at 106,000,000 kilometers from the earth \u201ca defect in the probe\u2019s orientation system resulted in a violation of the directionality of the probe\u2019s antenna to earth, making it impossible to maintain further radio contact with the probe.\u201d (NTT, 6/4/63,10) Soviet scientist S. V. Vemov reported on June 4 that cosmic-ray bombardment of earth from outside the solar system had doubled in last five years. Findings were based on more than 4,000 Soviet scientific balloon flights since 1957. (Underwood, NYT, 6/5/63) On June 5, nasa Goddard Space Flight Center offered world scientists the design of small rocket payload and ground telemetry station suitable for ionospheric research, gsfc scientists Siegfried J. Bauer and John E.

Post, 6/6/63) Dr. Wilmot N. Hess, Chief of nasa Goddard Space Flight Center Theoretical Div., said that U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion July 9, 1962, as well as Soviet high-altitude nuclear explosions Oct. 22, Oct. 28, and Nov. 1, added temporarily to radiation particles in Van Allen belts. Lifetime of electrons and protons trapped by earth\u2019s magnetic field had been \u201cone of the most important and perplexing problems in radiation belt work for several years . . .

Eve Star, 6/6/63) U.S. and U.S.S.R. delegations on June 6 announced readiness of their countries to cooperate in iqsy space experiments. Also at cospar, Japanese scientists reported plans to use U.S. Relay communications satellites for television broadcasts of Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964. (upi, Wash. Post, 6/7/63) Dr. W. R. Adey of ucla Brain Research Institute on June 7 challenged Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper\u2019s report that he sighted smoke rising from individual houses in Tibet during his MA\u20149 orbital space flight. Dr. Adey asserted weightlessness produces feeling of euphoria: \u201cUnder such conditions one is inclined to make judgments that are not critical, because normal controls on judgment are not operative .... Unrecognized disorders of visual perception and of judgments arising therefrom may be of considerable importance in space research.\u201d Dr. George T. Hauty of faa Civil Aeronautics Research Institute reported on experiments showing that marked reduction of sensory stimuli could induce slowing of subject\u2019s thought processes and even hallucinations. (NYT, 6/8/63, 26; Electronic News, 6/10/63) B. E. Welch of usaf School of Aerospace Medicine reported that results of six experiments showed oxygen toxicity would not be problem with pure-oxygen atmosphere in 17-day manned space flights, (nas Release) Dr. William F. Neumann of Univ. of Rochester Medical Center said astronauts under weightlessness up to two weeks could be expected to lose some calcium from their bones, probably equivalent to calcium loss of bedridden patient over 6-7 weeks: \u201cFor flights longer than two weeks, particularly space-capsule flights of indefinite length, grave questions of the continued normalcy of bone structure and bone development arise.\u201d (NYT, 6/8/63, 26) Soviet scientist V. V. Sharnov reported that moon was covered with slag-like material, confirmed by Soviet radioastronomical observations. Speculating on surfaces of Mercury and Mars, he said former should resemble that of moon and latter was \u201cmostly covered with dust. The fact that this material remains uncemented is a result of humidity.\u201d Radar contact with planet Mercury was made at distance of 54 million mi. Radar contact with planet Venus permitted refinement of value of astronomical unit obtained in 1961 and estimate of Venus rotational period. (Underwood, NYT, 7/9/63,81; Av. Wk., 6/10/63, 31) Dr. D. E. Graveline of usaf School of Aerospace Medicine reEorted provision of artificial gravity in manned spacecraft was eing considered for prolonged manned space flights. Artificial gravity may be required because re-entry after a month or more of weightlessness could be dangerous to human beings\u2014in prolonged weightlessness, natural processes which attune the circulatory system to gravity forces would decay, and body could not make necessary readjustment to g forces encountered in re-entry (NYT, 6/8/63,26; AP, Balt. Sun, 6/9/63) R. S. Young of nasa Ames Research Center reported June 8 on experiments providing evidence that certain earth organisms survive and grow under simulated Martian environment. Experiment simulated equatorial summer day-night cycle on Mars with presence.of water; further experiments were being conducted to determine minimum water and nutritional requirements for these organisms and to find their shortest growing period. If experiments show terrestrial organisms can survive \u201cunder the most rigorous laboratory simulation\u201d of Martian environment, there would be \u201cdecisive evidence\u201d of need for spacecraft sterilization. (nas Release) Dr. Carl Sagan of Harvard Univ. Observatory said June 9 that astronomer on Mars, using most advanced equipment known today, would probably be unable to prove existence of life on earth. Of 80,000 photographs of earth taken from \u201can American Tiros satellite, only one could be interpreted as showing biological life on earth.\u201d (AP, NYT, 6/10/63)",

We must recognize that we cannot undertake such a mission until the Apollo mission begins to phase out. \u201cIf, as will probably be the case, rendezvous in earth orbit and some orbital assembly or propellant transfer will be required to perform the Mars landing missions, an earth orbiting space laboratory will probably precede the accomplishment of the actual planetary missions.

Every time communication channels have increased, they have been loaded to capacity almost at once\u2014new means for communication have never caused the abandonment of the old ones. During 1960 there were more than three million overseas telephone calls, and reliable estimates indicate a sevenfold increase in overseas calls during the next decade. Such an increase in traffic will overtax the current and planned undersea cables, and high frequency radio facilities. And our current communication facilities have no capability for transmitting television. . . . \u201cCommunications satellites should soon be providing a substantial increase in our capabilities for world-wide high quality common carrier communications, at least over those routes where the volume of traffic exceeds present or forecast capabilities, and is also great enough to justify the necessarily large investment in a communications satellite system. Eventually, we hope that communications satellite technology will be improved to the point where service can also be provided to areas not served by other means, either because of their isolation or because the traffic volume does not justify an investment in more conventional communication means. \u201cThe objective of the United States in this area was voiced by President Kennedy in a public statement, not too long ago, in which he said: \u2018There is no more important field at the present time than communications, and we must grasp the advantages presented to us by the communications satellite to use this medium wisely and effectively to insure greater understanding among the peoples of the world.\u2019 \u201d (Text)",

Although the report of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics is a major milestone on the road to approval of the 1964 nasa Budget, it is still too early in the consideration of this budget by Congress to draw firm conclusions as to what the final result will be. The House subcommittees have given the nasa programs a most careful review, accumulating data from hearings which will total more than 4,000 pages of testimony. Their devotion and attention to details has been impressive, but in my opinion the overall result of their actions is an inadequate level of support for a program that is urgently needed, has achieved a high level of success, and is now giving this nation the promise of early preeminence in all phases of space exploration and use. In the areas reduced, nasa will present a strong case for restoration as the legislation proceeds to enactment. \u201cAfter its many details were brought under close scrutiny, and the possibility of postponement of many of these examined, the Committee has endorsed the program and the way it is being carried out but decided to defer approval until subsequent budgets in a number of important areas. My view is that the necessary resources should be authorized this year, rather than have important segments postponed with the consequent introduction of uncertainty at many levels in the government-industry -university team now engaged in this urgent national effort. \u201cAt the reduced level of funding recommended, we will certainly have to slow up or postpone a number of programs and direct a reduction in the scheduled level of effort in the plants of our contractors where 90% of the work of the space program is done. Unless an adequate level of support is restored, momentum already attained with great effort and difficulty will be lost and the stretch-out required will add to the final cost of the work required to carry out the program.\u201d (Statement)",

What we are interested in is what their capabilities are. While I have seen the statement of Mr. Lovell [July 16] about what he thinks the Russians are doing, his information is not final. Their capacity is substantial; there is every evidence that they are carrying on a major campaign and diverting greatly needed resources to their space effort. With that in mind, I think that we should continue. It may be that our assumption or the prediction . . . that they are not going to the moon might be wrong a year from now, and are we going to divert ourselves from our effort in an area where the Soviet Union has a lead, is making every effort to maintain that lead, in an area which could affect our National security as well as great peaceful development ? I think we ought to go right ahead with our own program and go to the moon before the end of this decade. \u201cThe point of the matter always has been not only of our excitement or interest in being on the moon, but the capacity to dominate space, which would be demonstrated by a moon flight. [This] I believe, is essential to the United States as a leading free world power. That is why I am interested in it and that is why I think we should continue, and I would be not diverted by a newspaper story.\u201d Asked about the possibility of cooperating with U.S.S.R. in a joint lunar mission, he replied: \u201cWe have said before to the Soviet Union that we would be very interested in cooperation. As a matter of fact, finally, after a good many weeks of discussion, an agreement was worked out on an exchange of information with regard to weather, but we have never been able to go into more detail. The kind of cooperative effort which would be required for the Soviet Union and the United States together to go to the moon would require a breaking down of a good many barriers of suspicion and distrust and hostility which exist between the communist world and ourselves. \u201cThere is no evidence as yet that those barriers will come down, though quite obviously we would like to see them come down. Obviously, if the Soviet Union were an open society as we are that kind of cooperation could exist, and I would welcome it. I don\u2019t see it as yet, unfortunately.\u201d (Text. Wash.

Anderson, Chairman of Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Replying to scientists critical of pace set for landing men on the moon, the authors said: \u201cThis question requires a further exploration of the motives underlying the U.S. space effort. Is it primarily a scientific program, or is it motivated by a broader concern with the national interest ? Looking back to the overwhelming support given the new space program by the Congress in 1961, it seems clear that this support was not tendered for scientific reasons primarily, but came from a deep-seated conviction that the expanded program will make an important contribution to our future strength and security. We believe that this is the reason why the people have supported the enlarged space program. That brings us to the point on which we take issue with some of our scientific colleagues, who complain, \u2018The scientific exploration of the moon has been accorded a secondary priority in the lunar program.\u2019 This remark is based on the premise that science should have top priority in the space program. However, while science plays an important role in lunar exploration, it was never intended to be the primary Objective of that project. The impetus of the lunar project is derived from its place in the long-range U.S. program for the exploration of the solar system. The heart of that program is man in space, the extension of man\u2019s control over his physical environment. The science and technology of space flight are ancillary developments which support the main thrust of manned exploration, while at the same time they bring valuable returns to our economy and our culture. The science which we do in space provides the equivalent of the gold and spices recovered from earlier voyages of exploration. It is the return to the taxpayer for his investment in his nation\u2019s future. But the driving force of the program is not in scientific research alone, valuable though that may be in the long run. Thus, the pace of the program must be set, not by the measured patterns of scientific research, but by the need for a vigorous response to the national challenge . . . .\u201d (Text, CR, 7/31/63, A4874-76)",

And if you can do that there is an advantage, it still seems to me, to the offense because they can pour in 200, or 300. \u201cAnd therefore, the problem is not the size of the bomb but rather the problem of discrimination, the problem of selectivity, targeting and all the rest. \u201cOn those matters we can continue to work.

Our point is illustrated by recent experience in developing experiments to be sponsored by the Defense Department on the Gemini flights. Although the concerted joint effort, under the guidance of the Gemini program planning board, has been fruitful, it has become obvious that an earlier beginning of intensive collaboration might well have allowed greater results. Looking to the future, we hope to apply this lesson in the establishment of an orbital space station program. We view a space station as an essential preliminary to an operational space defense system, and as a valuable source of experience which will apply to nasa objectives. As this program is in the early conceptual phase, we think it possible to begin now to fully exploit its high potential to serve both civilian and military needs.

Allen discussed proposed Government-industry program to develop supersonic transport aircraft in light of past progress in U.S. aircraft development. \u201cThe first large expansion of passenger air transportation in 1931 employed trimotored airplanes each of which provided on the average, in actual operation, about 3,500 seat-miles of transportation per day. These airplanes cost $75,000 each. In rapid jumps we have been able successively to increase the capability of the product until now, in the form of the 707 or the DC-8, it is delivering 400,000 seat-miles per day, which is 114 times the output of the 1931 trimotor. The jet airplane cost is $6 million, or 80 times the cost of the trimotor. \u201cEach step of progress which has made this change possible has been larger than the one before, and the jump to supersonic is by far the largest of all. The development cost has mounted accordingly . . . .\u201d He cited Boeing\u2019s financing in 1935 of prototype four-engine airplane which became the Flying Fortress, at cost of $660,000, and Boeing\u2019s designing and building in 1952 of first U.S. jet transport, at cost of nearly $20 million. \u201cA prototype supersonic transport of the type regarded now as most practical is estimated to cost a possible $150 million .... \u201cAlready Boeing has expended in the neighborhood of $15 million on supersonic transport study .... But the big costs are still ahead in supersonic prototype development .... \u201cIt becomes evident that there is valid reason for the initiative which our Government is taking in developing means to finance the program and that the continued cooperation of Government, the manufacturing industry and the airline industry is required in working out a program that can be practically accomplished with the economic capability of industry and will serve the national interest. \u201cIn carrying out this program and undertaking to meet the intensive competition which we will face from abroad, we feel it is important, as Federal Aviation Agency Administrator N.

Halaby has recognized, that we retain the advantages of the private enterprise system of contractual responsibility which has proved so effective in the past . . . .\u201d (Text, CR, 8/12/63, A5106-07)",

( XT A C * T?ol QOCp AO 1 7\t\\ ^ j.. ilu.l AtV/iGiVOU WW X I Cl J Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Director of Space Sciences, said in introductory lecture: \u201cThose who argue that we should dispense with the frills of science and space exploration, and concentrate on the necessities of military development, forget that we can\u2019t really say what the military necessities in space will be. Our crystal ball is not that good, and it would be foolhardy to pretend that it is. We do not wish to develop a Maginot line in space, only to have it flanked by forces of greater flexibility. We need to develop in a broad way our space capability so that we shall have the ability to move in any direction required by future events to meet any threats along whatever lines may develop. \u201c. . . Out of this broad activity in space will come the ability of the United States to use space and to operate in space either as it may chose to do voluntarily or may find itself compelled to do in its own defense. The development of our ability to operate in space, including manned space flight, gives to our country another dimension in which to meet the challenges\u2014both opportunities and threats\u2014of the future. We can do engineering in space, advance our science in a way that cannot be accomplished at the surface of the earth, and extend the range of practical applications for the benefit of man. And, if necessary, we can thwart the attempts of any enemy to use space against us. \u201cIn this day and age we cannot afford to ignore this last point. In our own self interest, and for the safety of our country, we cannot permit others to develop space capabilities that we cannot match, and that may, therefore, be used disastrously against us. \u201cThis is a capability we must have to ensure our survival in the space age as the independent, self-determining nation that our forefathers set us up to be, and that we have always insisted on is is the capability that we shall have from the development of the ability to investigate scientifically with satellites and space probes, and from space applications, from the ability to perform manned space flight and manned space operations, from the vast complex of manufacturing and assembly plants, launchings complexes, tracking and telemetering facilities, and from the invaluable experience that this initial stage in the space program will give us. \u201cThis is the most significant point about the present era in space. This is the most important aspect of the present activity in space. \u201cWe are now laying the groundwork for whatever role we may have to play in space in the future. We are ensuring that no one will ever be in a position to use space against us while we, helpless and frustrated through lack of the necessary space capability, have to take what comes . . . .\u201d (Text) Dr. Wilmot N. Hess of Goddard Space Flight Center told Conference August 14 that U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion in 1962 provided new information for determining path and rate of decay of high-energy electrons, thus providing better understanding of the Van Allen radiation belts. \u201cWhile the nuclear explosion shortened the lives of some satellites and increased the intensity of radiation around the globe, it had a valuable side effect. \u201cTo students of the Van Allen belt, it was almost like having a controlled experiment in space . . . .\u201d (AP, NYT, 8/15/63, anna i geodetic satellite\u2019s flashing beacons had resumed after more than two months of blackout, Richard B. Kershner of Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory disclosed in Aug. 15 press conference.

Thompson, Director of nasa Langley Research Center, addressed banquet. Dr. Thompson called on educators attending the conference to join with nasa and other research organizations to develop new and more effective means for accelerating effective distribution and assimilation of newly acquired research information. He cited prospective establishment of Virfinia Associated Research Center (varc) adjacent to the lshc pace Radiation Effects Laboratory at Newport News, Va., as a new and imaginative device to promote flow of knowledge between a major laboratory and three outstanding Virginia institutions of higher learning. (LaRc Release) Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Chief of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center\u2019s Flight Operations Div., said Aug. 16: \u201cThe first U.S. manned spaceflight program [Project Mercury] was designed to (1) put a man into earth orbit, (2) observe his reactions to the space environment, and (3) bring him back to Earth safely at a point where he could be readily recovered. All of these objectives have been accomplished, and some have produced more information than we expected to receive . . . .\u201d Discussing the stringent reliability requirements of manned space flight: \u201cThe smallest mistake in a man-rated system can bring totally unexpected results. The unexpected is the rule in the unknown, and if man is going to live in the region beyond our atmosphere, he is going to live under new rules or not at all. We have been aware of these rules . . . but they have not been brought to our attention so vividly as they have in the manned flight program .... \u201cThe manned space flight program has added greatly to our knowledge of the universe around us and demonstrated that man has a proper role in exploring it. There are many unknowns that lie ahead in space, but we are reassured because we are confident in overcoming them by using man\u2019s capabilities to the fullest ... . We now depend on man in the loop to back up automatic systems rather than using automatic systems alone to insure that the mission is accomplished .... We have arrived at what we think is the proper mixture of that formula. Man is the deciding element; but we cannot ignore the usefulness of the automatic systems.\u201d Kraft told news conference that two engine problems were encountered in the Titan II booster for Project Gemini. Titan II\u2019s first stage generated chugging oscillation which could cause \u201cthe pilots to have their eyeballs shook out.\u201d Second stage engine was producing only about 90% of desired thrust. Both problems apparently were associated with turbine drive mechanisms (msc Release 63-126; AP, Chic. Trib., 8/17/63) Gerald M. Truszynski, nasa Deputy Director of Tracking and Data Acquisition, discussed satellite data recovery and tracking system for manned satellite program. He described the manned space flight network used in Project Mercury and the augmentations planned for support of Project Gemini, concluding: \u201c. . . while certain equipment augmentations will be effected, many of the techniques learned during the Mercury program, particularly in terms of procedures required to assure positive Network support, will be utilized in Gemini and in this way, an ever-increasing background of know-how will be available for the extremely complex missions which will be encountered in the manned lunar landing program shortly to be upon us.\u201d August 13: Spokesman for Westinghouse Defense Center, which was preparing program definition study of nonmilitary navigational satellite under nasa contract, predicted navigation by satellite could become reality \u201cin three or four years ....

Unfortunately, in the same context approximately 90 per cent of our flight failures, not to mention flight delays, arise from electronic failures.

We have agreed there should be only one project for the time being because this will be a 2 or 3 billion project. We have agreed we will not proceed unilaterally. A decision, of course, has to be made as to what, if anything, in the 1965 budget will be in this field or another .... \u201cAs to the further exploration of the moon, the definition is a very variable one. You might leave an astronaut out and, figuratively speaking, take camping equipment along for a few days. Or you might convert a whole lunar bug to a freight carrier to extend the length of stay. You can go from that to a lunar base where you try to build a station, as m the Antarctic, that man can occupy for some time .... \u201cAll of these things run into the billions of dollars and certainly Congress will be involved in it. \u201cThere are people who favor one or another of these projects. I personally favor the manned orbital laboratory as being the next project. What we find on the Moon may change our minds on this, but from present knowledge I feel priority should go to a manned orbital laboratory. Some of this equipment has been in space for a period of a year or more. That is the length of a trip to Mars or Venus and back. \u201cAs you know, the matter of making major decisions of this kind in Government is a complicated one and I cannot say at this time when the hardware will be recommended by the administration.

We are using unmanned vehicles to help predict weather around the world, to improve navigation, to make possible international television and other communications, and to keep track of what the enemy is doing to establish missiles and other weapon systems aimed at us. \u201cNot only have we learned more about the planet Mars through unmanned space research, but we\u2019ve gained much knowledge of the vast reaches of space in between and beyond .... We\u2019ve pursued unmanned space research down far more streets and alleys than have the Soviets. \u201cFor the most part, our unmanned satellites are yielding knowledge that will assure success with manned flights into space in the future. For that reason, if no other, it is easy for the unmanned satellite program to be overlooked, its significance lost in the international competition of manned flights. This is a pity, for what we do in unmanned space exploration today is the very foundation on which we will build future manned space exploration. \u201cIn saying this we are not being partisan to the claim so often heard these days that we ought to forget about the manned program and explore space only with unmanned vehicles. We regard the controversy as a mere tempest in a teapot that will prove meaningless in time . . . .\u201d (CR, 8/20/63)",

The meeting of the subcommittee provided once more the occasion for the scientists of the two leading space powers to continue their private talks on cooperative space programs. \u201cThe World Meteorological Organization, the International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization continued to participate actively in the field of peaceful exploration and use of outer space. \u201cNo agreement was reached on legal problems relating to outer space, but a valuable exchange of views took place in the Committee and its legal subcommittee . . . .\u201d (Text, CR, 8/27/63, 15099-103) During August: The Atlantic Monthly published an article \u201cWhy Land on the Moon?\u201d by Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director, Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Dr. Homer E. Newell, Director, Office of Space Sciences, nasa. \u201cThese are the specific values of space exploration: the benefits of basic research, economically valuable applications of satellites, contributions to industrial technology, a general stimulus to education and to the younger generation, and the strengthening of our international position by our acceptance of leadership in a historic human enterprise. The current discussion of these values of the space program has served the United States well in directing its attention to questions of national purpose. But, however we may try to break the program down into its elements and to attempt a detailed balancing of debits and credits, the fact remains that the space effort is greater than the sum of its parts. It is a great adventure and a great enterprise, not only for the United States but for all humanity. We have the power and resources to play a leading role in this effort, and it is inconceivable that we should stand aside. \u201cScientific administrators ask . . . can we afford the cost of the space program in technical manpower? Their concern is heightened by the fact that federal activities in defense, space, and atomic energy together consume nearly half of the science and engineering talent available in the United States. But is the space agency the major consumer of trained manpower within this federal complex of technical agencies? In actuality, nasa will be using six percent of the national manpower pool in science and engineering through its contracts with private industry, plus an additional one percent in government laboratories. If the space program has substantial value, this is not an overwhelming drain.\u201d (Text)",

I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the moon. \u201cSpace offers no problem of sovereignty; by resolution of this Assembly, the members of the United Nations have foresworn any claims to territorial rights in outer space or on celestial bodies, and declared that international law and the U.N. charter will apply. Why, therefore, should man\u2019s first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition ? \u201cWhy should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction and expenditure? Surely we should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two countries\u2014indeed, of all the world\u2014cannot work together in the conquest of space, sending some day in this decade to the moon, not the representatives of a single nation, but the representatives of all humanity. \u201cAll these and other new steps toward peaceful cooperation may be possible. Most of them will require on our part full consultation with our allies, for their interests are as much involved as our own, and we will never make an agreement at their expense. \u201cMost of them will require long and careful negotiations.

Albert Thomas \u201cI am very glad to respond to your letter of September 21 and to state my position on the relation between our great current space effort and my proposal at the United Nations for increased cooperation with the Russians in this field. In my view an energetic continuation of our strong space effort is essential, and the need for this effort is, if anything, increased by our intent to work for increasing cooperation if the Soviet Government proves willing. \u201cAs you know, the idea of cooperation in space is not new. My statement of our willingness to cooperate in a moon shot was an extension of a policy developed as long ago as 1958 on a bipartisan basis, with particular leadership from Vice President Johnson, who was then the Senate Majority Leader .... Our specific interest in cooperation with the Soviet Union, as the other nation with a major present capability in space, was indicated by me to Chairman Khrushchev in Vienna in the middle of 1961, and reaffirmed in my letter to him of March 7,1962 .... So my statement in the United Nations is a direct development of a policy long held by the United States Government. \u201cOur repeated offers of cooperation with the Soviet Union have so far produced only limited responses and results .... But as I said in July of this year, there are a good many barriers of suspicion and fear to be broken down before we can have major progress in this field. Yet our intent remains: to do our part to bring those barriers down. \u201cAt the same time, as no one knows better than you, the United \u2022 States in the last five years has made a steadily growing national effort in space .... \u201cThis great national effort and this steadily stated readiness to cooperate with others are not in conflict. They are mutually supporting elements of a single policy. We do not make our space effort with the narrow purpose of national aggrandizement. We make it so that the United States may have a leading and honorable role in mankind\u2019s peaceful conquest of space. It is this great effort which permits us now to offer increased cooperation with no suspicion anywhere that we speak from weakness. And in the same way, our readiness to cooperate with others enlarges the international meaning of our own peaceful American program in space. \u201cIn my judgment, therefore, our renewed and extended purpose of cooperation, so far from offering any excuse for slackening or weakness in our space effort, is one reason the more for moving ahead with the great program to which we have been committed as a country for more than two years. \u201cSo tne position of the United States is clear.

By 1961, out of 54 flights, the success ratio was 83 per cent.

Summing up Project Mercury MA-9 flight, he said: \u201cHie performance of Gordon Cooper proved in detail man\u2019s integration with the operation of the spacecraft systems. This accomplishment of the Mercury program is of major significance as it does indicate that much more dependence can be placed on man as a reliable operating portion of the man-spacecraft combination ....

Papers reported on radiation effects on seeds, fruit flies, animal tissue, and bacteria as well as on cosmonauts Gagarin, Titov, Nikolayev, and Popovich, who experienced no harmful effects.

Most of the scientific exploration of space and the useful applications of space flight thus far have been made possible by automated spacecraft. Development of these spacecraft and their many complex subsystems is setting the pace today for many branches of science and technology.

One can see a political and technical argument over the \u2018Apollostok\u2019 (or should it be \u2018Vostapollo?\u2019) which would leave the moon safe from assault for at least a couple of decades.\u201d (A-N-AF Journal <& Reg., 9/28/63, 14)",

Webb summarized the five years of space achievements and looked ahead: \u201cFrom the first two United States satellites, Explorer I and Vanguard I, launched early in 1958, we learned that the earth was slightly pear-shaped rather than being the sphere it had been thought to be. We also learned that the earth was surrounded by a zone of radiation, called the Van Allen Belt after its discoverer Dr. James Van Allen. \u201cIn addition to these first satellites of scientific significance, we have orbited highly successful weather and communication satellites, probed the area of Venus, put men into orbit and brought them safely back to earth, and sent thousands of sounding rockets into space to study the earth\u2019s environment. From these and other experiments installed in more than 100 satellites and deep space probes, we have succeeded in vastly expanding knowledge and understanding of our own planet earth and of the solar system of which it is a part .... \u201cLooking ahead through the remainder of this decade, we have set our sights on a truly global weather satellite system, advanced communications and navigation satellites, space observatories for astronomical and solar studies, and a manned expedition to explore the moon . . . .\u201d Awards were presented by Mr. Webb, nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L.

Most people have centered on only one of them.\u201d The five elements were (1) measures against war by accident or miscalculation; (2) measures against surprise attack; (3) measures to curb the nuclear arms race; (4) exchange of information and persons; (5) U.S. consent to Gromyko\u2019s proposal to negotiate an agreement not to orbit large nuclear weapons. \u201cAnd then he added as a sixth item, we should also explore, now mark you, he said explore, possibilities for cooperation in manned space flight and then set a clear indication that he was not thinking of a limited exploration, that rather he was thinking of a broad exploration . . ., that we could even go step by step to the planning of a joint expedition.\u201d Speaking of the preparations for the President\u2019s U.N. speech, Mr. Webb said: \u201c. . . I myself personally attended a meeting in the White House called by Mr. Arthur Schlesinger, perhaps a month ago, to consider things that the President might want to discuss at the United Nations. And I did myself on the day before Mr. Gromyko\u2019s speech have a long talk with the President, maybe 35 or 40 minutes, about the whole space program in which we discussed this. And I think I should say that he had his office phone me in St. Louis on Thursday afternoon after Mr. Gromyko made his speech to read me the language that he then decided he would use, because it seemed such a natural follow-on to Mr. Gromyko\u2019s proposal.\u201d (Text)",

It was the day that the Soviet Union put Sputnik I in orbit. Do you remember the thoughts which flooded in on us that day? Thoughts of embarrassmefit\u2014dismay\u2014concern. ... We could even try to say that satellites were just stunts, that Sputnik was a silly hunk of iron.

In the fiscal year of 1961, of all Federal funds for basic research, the physical and biological sciences got 97 percent. \u201cThere are many traditional reasons for reemphasizing the humanities\u2014which today are more important than ever. \u201cIn the first place, a thorough grounding in the humanities is vital training for many leaders who can wisely manage people as well as sufficiently manage machines. This need exists in universities, in public service, and in business. \u201cSecondly, as our planet continues to shrink, we will more and more have to become citizens of the world. We must acquire a better understanding of the language, history, and culture of people of other lands. With present day mass-destruction weapons, this understanding is not just desirable\u2014it\u2019s vital. \u201cFinally, the greater our skills in the humanities\u2014in literature and the arts\u2014the greater our capacity for a constructive use of leisure time, which is bound to increase as machines lift old burdens from men\u2019s shoulders and minds. \u201cOn this sixth anniversary of the flight of sputnik, we can be sure of one thing; no second sputnik will come along to jolt us into action, and do for American education in the humanities what the first Sputnik did for American education in the sciences.\u201d {CR, 11/12/63, A7010-A7012)",

The satellite signal is still useful for position reference. explorer xiv, launched on October 2,1962, had an initial elliptical orbit of 61,500-mi. apogee and 173-mi. perigee. After 10 months, gravitational influence of the sun and moon had changed the orbit to 60,220-mi. apogee and 1,280-mi. perigee, with a period of about 37 hours. Some 6,500 hours of data were received from the satellite. While not all the data had been analyzed, Dr. L. Cahill, Univ. of New Hampshire, said a number of new insights had already emerged, among them being: earth\u2019s magnetosphere, as shown by mapping charged particles, flared away from the earth in an ogival\u2014pointed arch\u2014shape; confirmation that the vector magnetic field changes gently from a dipole configuration to a radial field at increasing distance on the night side of the earth near the equatorial plane; and further evidence probably supporting explorer vi\u2019s finding of a ring current flow on the night side of the earth.

Among amendments rejected were ones which would have (1) reduced nasa r&d funds by another $700 million and set limitations of $597,400,000 on Project Apollo and $124,400,000 on lunar and planetary exploration; (2) deleted the facility construction funds for the proposed nasa electronics center ($3,990,000); and (3) reduced the amount for development of a supersonic transport aircraft from $60 million to $500,000.

Although not so intended, it pulls the rug from under those among us\u2014such as economizing Congressmen and excessively zealous scientists like Linus Pauling\u2014who have been clamoring for an end to our country\u2019s program to place Americans on the moon by 1970. \u201cThese people, with much naivete (to use a polite word), have attached an extravagant degree of importance to Premier Khrushchev\u2019s recent remarks vaguely suggesting that he may be withdrawing the Soviets from the lunar race .... their latest space shot plainly, and disturbingly, indicates that they are well ahead of us with the kind of rendezvous capability that is essential to efforts to place men on the moon and bring them back safely .... \u201cClearly, we must run this race as swiftly as we possibly can.\u201d {OR, 11/4/63, A6869) November S: Reviewing the U.S. manned lunar landing program, John Finney of the New York Times concluded that the race to the moon had always been a one-sided one, that there was no evidence that the Russians were building the large rocket that would be necessary for such a venture, that they were rather proceeding on a building-block program in space tnat eventually would lead to a lunar landing, but not as a special, high-priority project. This, Finney said, was also the approach of the U.S. until May 1961. \u201cThen, in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the first Soviet manned space flight, the Kennedy Administration ordered an abrupt change in course.\u201d The original justification was that U.S. prestige was at stake. As time went on and budget resistance developed in Congress, the Administration argument shifted to one of attaining \u201ca position of preeminence\u201d in space. Also the potential military benefits were emphasized more and more. Finally, the President\u2019s proposal for the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. manned lunar program seemed to undercut all preceding positions.

      "story": " U.S-S.R. and U.S. were reported by the Washington Post to have reached agreement on frequency allocation for communications satellites at the International Telecommunications Union-sponsored conference in Geneva. In previous years the Soviet Union had opposed any space activity by nongovernmental organizations, but in recent months had dropped its opposition to private firms, such as the U.S. ComSatCorp, operating in space. Original positions at the conference had seen the U.S. ask for reservation of 2,725 megacycles in a highly sought-after portion of the microwave spectrum, while the U.S.S.R. had favored only 1,600 me. Details of the compromise position would emerge when both nations went before the full convention. (Wash.

(AAA, January 1964, p. 5) Partial results announced by Univ. of Stockholm scientists from the U.S.-Swedish series of sounding rocket experiments made in July and Aug. 1963 showed extremely low temperatures to be associated with the presence of noctilucent clouds. Sounding rocket data from the Kronogard firings indicated that up to 35 mi. temperatures closely followed the profile found over the U.S. and other countries. The temperature increased from about \u2014 50°C ( \u201458°F) at 10 mi. to slightly above 0°C (32°F) at 32 mi., where absorption of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation by ozone molecules causes a warming. Above this level, temperatures decreased again to a normal minimum at 50 mi. of 120°C ( \u2014184°F). When noctilucent clouds were present at this altitude, however, the temperature dropped to what appears to be the lowest temperature ever recorded in nature\u2014 \u2014143 °C (\u2014 225° F).

(AAA, January 1964, 5) Editorial in Aviation Week and Space Technology by Editor Robert Hotz criticized the national space policy as \u201cbadly shredded\u201d by President Kennedy\u2019s recent statements, called for a new statement of policy \u201cbased on solid elements of national interest\u201d before the FY 1965 budget debate begins in Congress. (Av. Wk., 11/4/63) Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of afsc, spoke to the aiaa/ asd Vehicle Design and Propulsion Meeting in Dayton, Ohio, on the future of areonautical systems. He predicted a continued need for aircraft in the weapons inventory, cited particular improvement potential in cargo aircraft and V/Stol. Another potential was that \u201cfuture space operations may require the use of recoverable boosters, for reasons of both efficiency and economy. The first stage of such a booster system would probably be a recoverable air-breathing vehicle.\u201d Two technical areas of particular promise were identified as materials and propulsion. \u201cWe have identified new materials that are stronger, lighter, stiffer, and able to withstand higher temperatures. For example, new types of metallic fibers may be feasible in forming extremely strong, lightweight composite structures. If such projected applications prove to be practical, then we may be in for a revolution in aircraft design and fabrication. \u201cThere also appear to be high payoffs in the propulsion area. New technology should enable us to achieve better thrust-to-weight ratios and to move away from single point design. \u201c. . . Engineers are almost always overly optimistic about the next two or three years and unduly conservative in their estimates of a 15-year period or more. There were study groups in the 1950\u2019s that denied the practicality and feasibility of icbm\u2019s, the turbofan, and hypersonic flight. Ten years ago, so-called \u2018sound engineering judgment\u2019 would not have forecast the present generation of systems. The point is that \u2018engineering judgment\u2019 does not always give the best evaluation of long-range predictions. The crucial question to ask is, \u2018Does a new concept defy known scientific principles?\u2019 If it does not, then the technical problems will eventually be overcome.\u201d (afsc Release 310-R-9<)",

It is that any problem can be solved by gathering enough scientists and giving them enough money .... It is folly to thus proceed. The great scientific steps forward originate in the minds of gifted scientists, not in the minds of promoters. The best way to proceed is to be sure that really inspired scientists have what they need to work with, and leave them alone. \u201cIf the country pours enough money into research, it will inevitably support the trivial and the mediocre. The supply of scientific manpower is not unlimited. \u201cIn any broad program of research the keyword in regard to any one aspect of the program is \u2018relevance.\u2019 It is a good word to have in mind in examining any research program. Competent directors of research know what it means. Probably \u2018conducive to progress toward the main object of a program\u2019 is as good a definition as any. Just finding out something new is not by itself sufficient justification for research. It needs to mean something when we find it. \u201cWhen scientific programs are judged by popular acclaim we inevitably have over-emphasis on the spectacular. That is just what we have today. The deeply important scientific advances moving today are not easy to understand. If they were they would have been accomplished long ago. Outstanding scientific progress, which will most affect the lives and health of our children, is not grasped by many.\u201d Objecting to the practice of the government and the armed forces of utilizing universities in the management of secret programs, Bush said: \u201cIt should never be forgotten that the main task of the universities is to educate men. The country will need skilled professional men in the future as much as it will need new knowledge. As we now go we are not meeting this challenge sufficiently. Every research program placed in a university should be so ordered that its product is not only new knowledge but skilled educated men.\u201d (Text)",

In fact, the tendency of the present Administration is in the opposite direction\u2014away from any military capability in space whatsoever other than conventional unmanned missiles.\u201d Meanwhile, the report charged, the civilian space program \u201chas grown so big so fast that waste and inefficiency have been all too inevitable.\u201d Although nasa was taking some steps to tighten controls, it \u201ccould and should do more.\u201d In international space agreements, the report charged that the U.S. had given more than it received in the agreements reached with the Soviet Union. Furthermore it contended that the Administration was usurping the powers of Congress by entering into a series of space agreements without submitting them to the Senate for its advice and consent. Finally, the report expressed concern over rising costs of Federal r&d and its competition with industry. \u201cCompetition between Government and industry in research and development appears to be increasing rather than decreasing, with industry operating at a natural and unnecessary disadvantage. This apparent imbalance should be corrected.\u201d (NTT, 11/22/63, 21) The old question of whether sun spots affect human behavior received new empirical evidence. Drs. Howard Friedman, Robert 0. Becker, and Charles H. Bachman of the State Univ. of New York and Syracuse Univ., reported on a study they had made in which the daily admission rate in seven New York psychiatric hospitals was compared with the daily variation in the earth\u2019s magnetic field over a period of four years. The comparison revealed that \u201cthe greater the intensity of the earth\u2019s magnetic field due to \u2018sun spots\u2019 and other natural interference coming out of the cosmos, the higher the rate of psychiatric hospital admissions.\u201d The effect was explained by the fact that all creatures with central nervous systems operate on self-generated, direct-current electricity. The same is true of radio transmitters and receivers. In both cases the electric impulses must travel through the earth\u2019s magnetic field. This magnetic field is normally smooth flowing. Only when it is disturbed does radio transmission suffer. The doctors reasoned that the same thing might occur in the human nervous system. The doctors concluded: \u201cSpeculatively, the results are in keeping with the conception of the behavior of an organism being significantly influenced, through the direct-current control system, by external force fields Attention is thus invited to a hitherto neglected dimension in the complexity of psychopathology specifically, and perhaps generally in all human behavior.\u201d (upi, Wash.

Centaur began as a low-priority, financially austere feasibility study, in competition with high-priority defense programs. As its importance to the national space effort became more apparent, its terms of reference were changed; and, as time passed, its inherent technical difficulties came to the surface; technical difficulties, I might add, that we have learned to expect in most new programs. \u201cCertainly, the original flight schedule of Centaur was overly optimistic. Hindsight also tells us that the complexity of the program was greatly underestimated . . . .\u201d Referring to press articles charging $100 million was wasted in Centaur program, based on gao investigative report, Rep. Miller pointed out: \u201cThat report was misinterpreted by the press, and a closer look at it will reveal that no such conclusion was drawn by the Comptroller General. The alleged $100 million waste included $76 million reportedly lost in Hie Advent project, the military communications satellite project .... \u201cWhile there can be no doubt that certain programs incurred losses because of the unavailability of Centaur on schedule, it is incorrect and unfair to attribute the entire unrecoverable loss associated with the Advent program to Centaur, as the press apparently did. Suffice it to say that the Advent project had its own severe management and technical difficulties which led to its cancellation in June 1962.\u201d He called the Nov. 27 flight test of AC-2 \u201ca significant advance in the development of a new technology upon which much of America\u2019s future space effort depends . . . .\u201d\t(67?, 12/2/63, 21906 ff.)",

Thus the technological advances which it produces will come not as the mere by-product of an effort launched to satisfy other needs, but as the fruit of an effort deliberately undertaken to stimulate advances in the forces that make for economic growth, and meet the demands of a nation immersed in a new flood of scientific discovery and technical progress. \u201cThroughout history, and even in the early years of the present century, man has been slow in the application of basic discoveries to practical use. In the past,, the utilization of new technology has rarely depended so much on the worth of the discovery as on what one economist has called \u2018the mentality of the times.\u2019 The willingness of people to accept and appreciate change, the belated appreciation of a previously undetected need, an imaginative leadership able to foresee the potential applications and benefits of new ideas, coupled with the wisdom and determination to insure that new knowledge is put to practical use, have always been key elements in the march of human progress. \u201cToday, confronted with an unprecedented explosion of knowledge, and an ever shortening time lag between discovery or invention and practical use, the search for new knowledge and its application cannot proceed at a leisurely pace\u2014certainly not if the nation and its industries are to compete successfully with rapidly expanding foreign industrial capability in the world economic competition which exists today.

History has witnessed in our country two revolutions\u2014the revolution inspired by our Founding Fathers which gave birth to this Nation, and the Industrial Revolution, inspired by man\u2019s inventive spirit, which gave us a place among the nations of the world. We are involved now in a Third Revolution\u2014the Revolution of Science, inspired by our educated men and women\u2014which is strengthening our position as a leader of nations. \u201cDuring the last several decades, and especially the last two decades, this Nation and the world have witnessed a remarkable expansion and extension of knowledge. This knowledge has been and is being transformed into the outlines of a new and revolutionary society. We have all been part of a new tide of exploration and discovery, not limited to the dimension of the past but creating new dimensions of its own. \u201cIndeed, the revolutionary accomplishments of the past decade\u2014in space\u2014have extended man\u2019s reach far beyond this planet. We now know that the search for new knowledge, if not restricted to subjects of foreseeable and immediate practical importance, results in an unexpected increase in our understanding of physical or biological phenomena. The increases, in turn, give rise to far-reaching practical applications which could not have been anticipated from the original basic research. Our scientific knowledge and technology are advancing at an explosive rate. The time lag between the discovery of a fundamentally new scientific principle and its application in engineering is now very short, and these rapid developments are changing the lives of all of us in many ways which we only dimly perceive . . . .\u201d (Text)",

Dr. Hornig has been one of the 18 members of the President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee since 1960. Dr. Hornig was reported as saying that the place of basic research was distorted by the legacy of World War II when concentrated scientists were able to convert the most abstract scientific notions into impressive useful devices: \u201cThe days of pie-in-the-sky promises of basic research are over. The mood 20 years ago was one that suggested by turning loose great numbers of scientists miracles happened. Well they did happen, and I suppose it was logical that after the war the same notion would carry over. \u201cOnly it doesn\u2019t work that way today. Miracles of the kind performed during the war are a little harder to find. Scientists are no longer concentrated nor are their efforts. They do come, of course, but over periods of years .... \u201cThe meaning of Sputnik,\u201d Hornig said, \u201cwas that it demonstrated the Soviets were capable of big-time technology; capable, if you will, of playing in the big leagues.\u201d He declined to label the American attempt to send men to the moon as a \u201crace.\u201d \u201cThe moon is, after all, the first important object beyond the earth. . . . There are valid scientific objectives to be pursued on the moon\u2019s surface all linked to gaining new insights into cosmology and to providing clues to man\u2019s destiny. That is, where we came from. ... (H. Simons, Wash.
