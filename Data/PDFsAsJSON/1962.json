In this magnetosphere there is only a handful of matter but a very wide range of charged particles trapped by the earth\u2019s magnetic field. Density of electrons is now considered to be 108/cm2/sec as opposed to the 1011 derived from previous satellites. Radiation levels of protons in the lower portion of the magnetosphere were found to be the same as reported by previous satellites, so that the magnetosphere still poses a formidable radiation problem to extended manned flight. At about 10 earth radii the magnetosphere ends abruptly. Above it is an extended area, about 20,000\tkm. across, of electromagnetic turbulence and featuring very low energy particles on the order of 1 to 20 kilovolts.

The second of the anticipated major advances will be a theoretical revolution, the nature of which will depend on results of improved observation techniques.

Under this concept, an Apollo-type vehicle wollid fly direct to the moon, go into orbit around the moon, detach a small landing craft which wollid land on the moon and then return to the mother craft, which wollid then return to earth. Advantages wollid be the much smaller craft having to perform the difficllit lunar landing and take-off, the possibility of optimizing the smaller craft for this one function, the safe return of the mother craft in event of a landing accident, and even the possibility of using two of the small craft to provide a rescue capability.",

Pitten-drigh, Professor of Biology, Princeton University, said that biological engineering for manned space flight will have an influence on theoretical physiology, but that \u201cspace technology holds far less promise of any revolution in biology than in physics.\u201d The possibility of extraterrestrial life, he described as \u201cthe most exciting scientific question of the day.\u201d Optimum conditions for a manned spacecraft with regard to temperature, moisture, oxygen, and carbon dioxide can be specified. But \u201cwe have difficulty in being precise about anything else.\u201d He pointed to the possible exclusion of heavy radiation by means of an intense magnetic field, but \u201ccan man perform normally in such intense magnetic fields?\u201d Little is known about the reliability of algae, and new studies of photosynthesis and techniques of algoculture are needed. Rhythmic innate oscillations, previously considered superficial to the physiological architecture of organisms, are \u201ca highly significant parameter of physiological organization.\u201d And the possible effect of the earth\u2019s gravitational field on normal physiological function is not fully known. Dr. Pittendrigh concluded: \u201cClean questions and clean answers are going to be difficult for some time. When we put organisms into space at present and detect deleterious effects, we are simply unable to disentangle the many variables that exist there and decide which has been responsible.\u201d",

He discussed the chemical reactions which must have existed in the primitive terrestrial environment and produced organic matter. The critical event was the origin of a molecular system capable of synthesizing itself, and \u201cthis event\u2014which occurred some 4,200 million years ago\u2014can be identified with the origin of life on Earth.\u201d From then on the long evolutionary sequence from molecule to Man was under way. Dr. Sagen asserted that \u201cthrough the interaction of organic molecules life must arise on countless other worlds, in our solar system, and other solar systems . . . [but] the forms of living organisms on other planets must be intriguingly diverse.\u201d Dr. Sagen reviewed the improbability of life on Venus, the possibility of life on the moon, and the \u201cfavorable\u201d environmental features for life on Mars. It is not, he said, a closed question with regard to life on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Astronaut Carpenter performed series of space science and technical development experiments including visual and photographic observations of star fields and \u201cwhite particles,\u201d consumption of solid foods, release of tethered multi-colored balloon to test sighting, and observation of separated Atlas booster. 81,200-mile flight featured attitude stabllization and control pilotage for completion of three orbits, and monitoring of control-systems fuel for proper retrofire attitude. Re-entry caused landing impact point over 200 miles beyond intended area and beyond radio range of recovery forces. After landing, Carpenter egressed through top of capsule and climbed on inflated raft awaiting rescue, to be joined by two usaf paramedics, Airman John T. Heitsch and S/Sgt. Ray E.

This accounted for some 175 miles of the 250-mile overshoot as well as a deviation of 15 miles to the north of the orbital track. Other factors that contributed to the overshoot were the retrorockets delivered about three per cent less than the specified thrust, and the retrorockets fired about three seconds late.\t_",

Likewise, all space missions involving re-entry and landing require that the spacecraft move back through the air space on their return to earth. . . . \u201cIt now appears that the manned vehicles which will be developed over the next five to ten years wlli enter the atmosphere rather steeply, level out, and glide at altitudes ranging from about 25 to 60 miles for distances perhaps as great as 7,000 to 10,000\tmiles before landing. Inevitably, it wlli become necessary to know in advance whether any portion of the re-entry phase of a manned space flight violates the territorial air space of another State because of the altitude at which its land or territorial waters may be overflown. . . . \u201cIt wollid be most unwise to attempt to reach a solution to the so-called \u2018boundary\u2019 problem on the basis of the difference between the regimes of aerial flight and space flight. But even if it were possible to define a boundary between those regimes on scientific and technical grounds, it wollid bear no necessary relationship to the national interests which the principle of territorial sovereignty is designed to serve. \u201cI think it is evident that if this problem is to be solved it will be done on the basis of an accommodation of the political interests of the States concerned, and not on the basis of scientific or technological criteria.\u201d",

Dryden; Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Director, Office of Manned Space Flight, D. Brainerd Holmes. Mr. Webb paid tribute to the Russian accomplishment as \u201cdemonstrations of a very real technological capacity, an ability to plan and engineer and build and fly vehicles that can carry man for extended periods of time. . . . They do have significance.\u201d Dr. Dryden felt that the flights essentially conformed to the stated Russian objective, \u201cto subject two men to identical space exposures, and weightlessness . . . plus . . . longer duration, which is needed to do this.\u201d Dr. Seamans noted that \u201cas far as guidance accuracy is concerned, what they achieved is roughly comparable to what we achieve in our Mercury flights. To me the significant element here is that on the second flight they were able to take off within a limited period of time . . . countdowns can be protracted for one reason or another.\u201d Mr. Holmes said he was not surprised at the Russian flights: \u201cI think we would be selling the Russians pretty short if we didn\u2019t feel that a year after they launched a Vostok on a booster that could lift that kind of a weight, something of the order of 10,000 pounds, that they couldn\u2019t indeed perform in this fashion.\u201d Asked whether the nasa manned space flight program could be accelerated, Mr. Webb answered that the booster program could be accelerated with a crash program spending another $1 to $2 billion a year. \u201cYou can get more done. It wlli be done inefficiently. We believe we have a program [now] that marries all of the considerations in an effective way . . .\u201d To the question of who wollid first land on the moon, Mr. Webb replied, \u201cI think we will make the manned lunar landing and return before they do.\u201d As to future Russian capability, Dr. Dryden said: \u201cthere is a possibility that the Soviets can do circumlunar flight before we can. I once said there is a fifty-fifty chance, certailliy no better than that, that we collid do that as early as they can. It is for this reason, in fact, that our national goal was set at the lunar flight because this does require another booster on the part of the Russians as well as ourselves. \u201cEver since the Space Agency has been formed we have been waiting for this other shoe to be dropped. People have told us every month, the Russians are going to produce this big booster in the next few months. Now four years have gone by and they have not yet shown us this big booster. To the best of our knowledge they have developed lighter-weight nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles rather than bigger space boosters. This is not to say that they may not be doing this. All I am saying is that they will require a bigger booster to land men on the moon.\u201d",

Seadragon, nuclear-powered submarines based in different oceans, had made underwater rendezvous beneath the ice at the North Pole. In answer to questions on the present and future significance of the flights of vostok iii and iv, President Kennedy said: \u201cWell, we are second to the Soviet Union in long-range boosters. I have said from the beginning\u2014we started late; we\u2019ve been behind. It\u2019s a tremendous job to build a booster of the size that the Soviet Union is talking about, and also of the much larger size which we're presently engaged in in the Saturn Program. \u201cSo we are behind. We\u2019re going to be behind for a while. But I believe that before the end of this decade is out, that the United States will be ahead. But it\u2019s costing us a tremendous amount of money. We\u2019re putting a tremendous effort in research and development; but we just might as well realize that when we started\u2014we started late. \u201cLast year, as you know, we made a decision to go to the moon, with bipartisan support, and it\u2019s going to take us quite a while to catch up with a very advanced program which the Soviets are directing . . . thereV no indication the Soviets are going to quit .... \u201cBut we\u2019re in for some further periods when we\u2019re going to be behind. And anybody who attempts to suggest that we\u2019re not behind misleads the American people\u2014we\u2019re well behind\u2014-but we are making a tremendous effort. \u201cWe increased, after I took office, after four months, we increased the budget for space by 50 per cent over that of my predecessor. The fact of the matter is that this year we submitted a space budget which was greater than the combined eight space budgets of the previous eight years .... \u201c. . . we are spending for military purposes in space three times what we were in 1960\u2014about $1,500,000,000. The two, at least at present, the two important points that should be kept in mind are the ability to build a large booster which can put a large satellite into atmosphere. That is being done, nasa is doing that, though there has been, of course, under Titan III contract, a booster program for the military. \u201cIn addition, the guidance, navigation, etc., that\u2019s extremely important. That we are making a major effort in. And so that I recognize that there are those who oppose this program and then suddenly a month later say we ought to suddenly go ahead on a different basis. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that 40 per cent of the R and D funds in this country are being spent for space. That\u2019s a tremendous amount of money and a tremendous concentration of our scientific effort. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we can\u2019t always do better. But I think the American people ought to understand it\u2019s billions of dollars we\u2019re talking about which I believe a month ago a prominent\u2014 mentioned as a great boondoggle. \u201cI think it\u2019s important, vital and there is a great interrelationship between military and peaceful uses of space. But we\u2019re concentrating on the peaceful use of space which wlli also help us protect our security if that becomes essential. . . .\u201d",

      "story": " Congressman George P. Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, defended the U.S. space program in speech on floor of the House. Arguing that Soviet vostok in and iv manned orbital flights did not justify changes in the U.S. program, he said: \u201cCertainly I will not stand here and say that more and better military space programs should not be undertaken. What I do say is that a considerable effort in this field has long been underway and that the Monday-morning quarterbacks whose teeth start chattering after every Russian \u2018spectacular\u2019 might exhibit a bit more faith in those who have the actual responsibility for the defense of the country. . . . \u201c[We should not overlook] . . . the fact that the Soviets have now demonstrated two important capabilities: First, that they have sufficient launch facilities and rocket reliability to launch two manned spacecraft within a short time, and second, that they have the ability to time launches with great precision. These capabilities are an important step toward the development of the rendezvous and docking technique which will be of great value in achieving many advanced objectives in space exploration, some of which may have potential military value. \u201cThese, I think, are the formidable implications of their recent feat. But these implications are no reason for us to put our program in a constant state of flux, with projects starting, stopping, and shifting in response to each new Soviet development. Our undertaking is gigantic, immensely complex. It cannot be assembled and disassembled and redesigned and reassembled without losing its direction and momentum, and the space contest itself. . . . \u201cThere is a suggestion that the military services should duplicate work now in progress under the civilian agency. There is nothing particularly military about solutions to problems involved in the effects of long-term weightlessness, radiation, and isolation. The capabilities of both civilian and military research agencies should be brought to bear on these problems in a coordinated manner. \u201cOn the record, then, it appears that the critics of our space program are not asking that we do twice as much\u2014but that we do everything twice. I do not think the economy will take that, but even if it would\u2014it just does not make sense. \u201cAnd how about the reciprocal use of the knowledge we are gaining? Science knows no exclusive applications technologically speaking, what is developed by civilians can be used militarily and vice versa. . . . \u201cIt seems farily well established that the real cause of all this squabble about the military-in-space stems from an inhouse difference of opinion within the military establishment. The problem is not that our civil space program is retarding the military. On the contrary, it is enhancing it and will continue to do so in the future. The problem is that the military space enthusiasts have not been able to obtain all the green lights they want from their bosses. ... I am confident the controversy will be resolved in time\u2014and expeditiously, I hope.\u201d",

First, the goal has been identified. We are to land American explorers on the moon. Second, the timetable has been laid down. We are to carry out the mission and return the U.S. explorers safely to earth within this decade. Third, we have settled on the organization to meet the national goal on schedule. Finally, we have selected the method which we believe can accomplish the lunar expedition on the shortest possible time schedule, with the greatest assurance of success, and at the least expense. You do not need to be a specialist in management to realize that decisions such as these are central to the success of any job\u2014what to do, when to do it, who is to be in charge, and how it is to be done. In the United States space program, these fundamental decisions have been made. And we have proceeded with the work to carry them out at the swiftest pace consonant with other processing needs of the country and with the resources available .... \u201cThe achievement which stands out [in the manned lunar landing program] . . ., in my opinion, has been the launching by the people of the United States of a truly national effort to demonstrate our determination and our capacity to sail on the new ocean of space and to master the technology of the space age in all its aspects\u2014for the security of the Free World and the good of all mankind. \u201cThe lunar landing is no stunt. The most important accomplishment will be the development by this Nation of the ability to make the landing, and not the landing itself. Achievement of such ability is worth the great investment in brains and industrial capacity and technological advance that we are making. The lunar landing is a yardstick\u2014a measure of this country\u2019s technological leadership, a measure of the ability of this democracy to \u2018manage,\u2019 if you will, a great engineering and technological undertaking in the national interest.\u201d",

Man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. \u201cThose who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modem invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space. \u201cWe mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it, for the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. \u201cWe have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding. \u201cYet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world\u2019s leading spacefaring nation. \u201cWe sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. \u201cWhether it wlli become a force for good or lli depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean wlli be a sea of peace or a new, terrifying theater of war. \u201cI do not say that we should or wlli go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. \u201cThere is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again......... \u201cWe choose to go to the moon ... in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal wlli serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. \u201cIt is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that wlli be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency. . . . \u201cWe have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public. \u201cTo be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned space flight. But we do not intend to stay behind. In this decade we shall make up and move ahead. . . .\u201d September 12: nasa announced it would launch a special satellite before the end of the year to \u201cobtain information on possible effects of radiation on future statellites and to give the world\u2019s scientific community additional data on the artificial environment created by the [radiation] belt.\u201d The 100-lb. satellite would be launched from Cape Canaveral into an elliptical orbit ranging from about 170-mi. perigee to 10,350-mi. apogee.",

      "story": " Back in Washington after two-day tour of U.S. space facilities, President Kennedy held news conference. Asked why decision was made to extend U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests, the President said: \u201cThere are two reasons. One is that, as you know, because of the blow-up in the pad at Johnston Island and because of the earlier failures of the communication system in the missile, we were not able to carry out these tests which were . . . among the most important, if not the most important of our series. \u201cSo we are going to finish those. In addition, as a result of the earlier tests of this Dominic series, there were certain things learned which we would like to prove out. \u201cSo we have agreed to a limited number of tests in concluding the Dominic series, and also we have taken some steps to prevent a repetition of the incident which caused an increase in the number of electrons in the atmosphere, by lowering the altitude and the yield so that lunar flights will not be further endangered.\u201d Asked whether U.S. position of refraining from competition with U.S.S.R. military space vehicles would condemn U.S. to second place in the mllitary field, President Kennedy replied: \u201cNo, Mr. Alexander. As I said last week, in the first place we are spending $1.5 billion a year on our military space program. What is the key for the success both of peaceful exploration of space as well as the military mastery of space are large boosters, effective control of the capsule, and the ability to rendezvous, and all of the rest, so that there is an obvious usefulness if the situation should require, military usefulness for our efforts, peaceful efforts, in space. \u201cIn addition, as you know, very recently we determined to go ahead with the Titan III, which gives the United States Air Force a very strong weapon if that should become necessary. So that the work that nasa is doing on Saturn and the work the Air Force is doing on Titan and the work being done on the Apollo program and Gemini and the others, all have a national security factor as well as a peaceful factor. . . . \u201cI think the United States is attempting, and this Administration, as you know, is making a very massive effort in space. As I said, we are spending three times what we spent last year in space, and more in this year\u2019s budget than the eight previous years, so that this is a tremendous effort, $5.5 billion as well as the money that we are spending for the military use of space. \u201cAs I say, the size of the booster and the capsule and the control all would have, if the situation required it, a military use. We hope it does not; we hope that space will be used for peaceful purposes. That is the policy of the United States Government, but we shall be prepared if it does not; and in addition, as I said from the beginning, both the Soviet Union and the United States have a capacity to send a missile to each other\u2019s country with a nuclear warhead on it, so that we must keep some perspective as to where the danger may lie. But the United States, in the effort it is making both in the peaceful program and the military program, all of this will increase our security if the Soviet Union should attempt to use space for military purposes.\u201d Asked if he were hopeful that U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative ventures in space exploration were likely in the near future, he replied: \u201cNo. As you know, Dr. Dryden had some conversations in Geneva with regard to the matter, and some progress was made, but it is limited in its scope and we would hope more could be done and more, perhaps, could be done if the atmosphere between the two countries should be improved.\u201d",

We are reaching a clearer definition of that mission as it relates to space. . . . \u201cThe United States is dedicated as a matter of national policy to the peaceful exploitation of the space medium. The United States does not intend to extend the arms race into space. \u201cWe are, however, taking the step to enable us to protect ourselves in the event the Soviets or any other nation were to undertake missions in space that would endanger our security. . .. \u201cThe dual-vehicle orbital experiment of the Soviets, when coupled with their previous claims, seems to indicate that the need for protection against possible threats to our security will be in the near orbital stage of space, rather than farther out. One possible instrument of security that might be useful at this level in space may be found in extending the X-15 and X-20 technology, leading to craft which could operate from surface to orbit and back, and perform defense missions at the edge of the atmosphere. Another might be the permanently manned orbital space station designed for military purposes. Progress toward utilization of such a vehicle for security and protection would be speeded by capitalizing upon the nasa program to acquire knowledge and competence in manned orbital flight. . . . \u201cThese are the principles on which Air Force space program must be based: (a) Ample preparation to utilize the space medium; (b) Ample preparation to defend ourselves in case others choose to extend the threat of aggression to outer space; (c) Concentration on the really important tasks, including today\u2019s job and not just tomorrow\u2019s, and finally, (d) An organizationally disciplined space program\u2014well planned and specific\u2014which fits into overall national plans and objectives. \u201cWe in America have no choice but to extend our defenses as far as they need to be extended to save freedom on earth. . . .\u201d",

      "story": " Secret of radio emissions from planet Jupiter was proposed by physicists Dr. Leon Landovitz of Yeshiva Univ. and Dr. Leona Marshall, New York Univ. They suggest that perhaps Jupiter acts as a gigantic maser, using energy from the sun as its \u201cpumping\u201d energy, to produce the decameter waves. They proposed that Jupiter\u2019s decameter radiation was based on principle that the change of state of an electron with respect to static magnetic field results in either emission or absorption of electromagnetic energy, such as light or radio waves, at frequency that depends upon the magnetic field. There may be a \u201ccascading\u201d of such stimulated emissions from the electrons as the disturbance propagates through the electrically charged layer of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, Dr. Marshall stated. Jupiter\u2019s emission of radio waves was discovered in 1955 by Dr. Bernard Burke and Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin, then of Carnegie Institution of Washington.",

[This concept] overlooks the significant and seldom appreciated fact that learning how to get to the moon, developing the technology which will be required to get there, and employing this technology for many purposes in space, is more important than the lunar landing itself. . . . \u201cCharacterization of our effort solely as a \u2018space race to the moon\u2019 also leads to the mistaken notion that the nation first to conduct a lunar exploration will have assured itself of ultimate and enduring superiority in space.

The Mariner has indicated a typical steady state transverse component of ten gamma or less, and it has clearly shown how the transverse field becomes large (as high as 25 gamma) during geomagnetic storms. In addition to this, the Mariner 2 has provided information on the steady interplanetary field indicating that the radial component is apparently more stable, even under storm conditions, and that there are quiet times when the radial component from the sun is essentially constant. . . . Measurements from the ion chamber [onboard marines ii] have indicated an average radiation level as expected, corresponding to about 1.1 milli-roentgen per hour (about 100 times the cosmic ray intensity at the surface of the earth).... It has been reported by measurements [of the probe\u2019s cosmic dust detector] thus far that the flux of interplanetary dust particles is at least one thousand times less in interplanetary space than in the near vicinity of the earth. The cause of this is unknown. . . . Preliminary data from the [solar plasma detector in the] Mariner indicate abrupt changes in the velocity and intensity of solar winds, and correlated effects on the magnetic fields in space. Measurements show that the particle energies generally range from about 750 electron volts to 2500 electron volts, although some plasma with an energy of 3225 electron volts has been observed. These variations almost certainly were the results of events on the sun, but the exact nature of these events is not yet understood. . . .\u201d",

The X-15 has such capability that it wlli be used in furthering certain space research programs. Already we are making radiation measurements\u2014piggy-back experiments along with the hypersonic research program. Our results with the X-15 have been so encouraging that I think we must soon look beyond the transport that goes to Mach 2 or 3, and begin laying the groundwork for the generation to follow. . . .\u201d",

In magnetic survey, agreement called for U.S. and U.S.S.R. each to launch a satellite equipped with magnetometers during International Year of the Quiet Sun (iqsy), 1964-65. Both countries agreed to use the intervening years to continue their own magnetic measurement research and to exchange the data obtained. In satellite communications, agreement called for U.S. and U.S.S.R. to cooperate during coming year in communications experiments via U.S. passive communications satellite Echo A-12. Future negotiations would consider cooperative efforts in experimental system of active-repeater satellites. Agreement provided that \u201cthe results of these cooperative experiments would be made freely available to all interested states,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Adlai Stevenson said.

In world\u2019s first close interplanetary contact, mariner ii measured and returned temperatures and other characteristics of Venutian surface and its atmosphere; telemetry signals would be analyzed and evaluated by jpl, technical manager of interplanetary programs for nasa. In press conference at nasa Headquarters, jpl Director Dr. William H. Pickering said all instruments onboard mariner ii functioned as planned and the mission was virtually a complete success, nasa Administrator James E. Webb hailed the achievement as \u201can outstanding first in space for this country and for the Free World.\u201d nasa Director of Space Sciences Dr. Homer E. Newell pointed out that the probe\u2019s internal tempera- . tures ranging from 125° F to 200° F had not prevented the scientific experiments from succeeding; temperatures were expected to continue rising as the spacecraft traveled closer to the sun. jpl would continue tracking the probe as long as possible, even though its scientific mission was considered completed. Dr. Newell outlined significant interplanetary data already obtained from the four scientific instruments onboard mariner ii. \u201c. . . The plasma probe revealed a steady \u2018solar wind\u2019 at 250450 miles per second. The magnetometer showed that space contains fields of at least a few gamma and that there are fluctuations by factors of as much as 5 to 10. . . . The cosmic dust detector indicated that the meteoritic particles in space are less numerous than near Earth by a factor of 10,000. . . .\u201d When mariner ii neared Venus, two additional experiments were activated\u2014microwave and infrared radiometers to measure temperatures and identify their sources (surface or atmosphere).",

Forum survey of editors, writers, and publishers: 60% considered present expenditure for U.S. space program fully warranted; 26% probably fully warranted; 8% probably not; 5%, not warranted; and 1%, no response. Asked what should be level of expenditure (relative to gnp) in immediate future, 25% replied sharply higher; 30%, a little higher; 22%, remain at about present ratio; 6%, a little lower; 6%, sharply lower; 11%, no response. 33% said U.S. would probably exceed U.S.S.R. in space achievements by 1970, while 40% said U.S. would approximately equal U.S.S.R. by 1970. 45% said prime objective of U.S. in space was to exceed U.S.S.R. space achievements\u2014but without duplication and inefficiencies of an all-out crash program. 35% said prime objective was to sustain a prudent and orderly program of scientific progress in space achievements, with little regard for who leads in the various aspects of space technology. 16% chose crash program to exceed the Russians in space. As to justification for U.S. space program, 59% said: \u201cBecause of its by-products, both actual and potential, our space program is an excellent dollar investment, over and above its value for military security and international prestige.\u201d 29% chose this statement: \u201cOur space program requires a high dollar expenditure which must be justified\u2014preponderantly if not wholly\u2014m terms of its value for military security and international prestige.\u201d During December: nasa awarded contract to Ford Motor Co. Aero-nutronic Div. for development of camera system to be hard-landed on the moon. To relay photographs of lunar surface back to earth, camera would be used in future Ranger lunar spacecraft and would replace seismometers carried in bangers iii, iv, and v.",

For it was this approach in the development of our icbm that gave the U.S.S.R. their superbooster and the resultant lead in space exploration which the U.S. is still struggling to overcome. The United States cannot afford a second setback of this magnitude. . . . \u201cThe committee is struck by the large amount of manpower and time that both the dod and nasa have devoted to coordination in trying to reach an agreement and the extended delay in starting even the most basic development program.\u201d Committee recommended giving nasa the funding responsibility for continuation of solid-propelled motor effort, since there exists no direct mllitary requirement for the large boosters.",
