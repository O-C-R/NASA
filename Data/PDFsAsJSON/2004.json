      "story": " Astronomers published their analysis of the first observations ever made of a supernova occurring in a binary star, thereby providing crucial support for a theory concerning the most violent type of event in the universe. Supernovas occur when stars exhaust their nuclear fuel reserves and collapse, ejecting their outer layers in a massive explosion. Previously, scientists had regarded the study of supernovas as important for understanding the evolution of galaxies and of the universe, but they had remained uncertain about the origins of supernovas, including whether they occur in solitary or binary star systems. However, the team of astronomers from ESA and the University of Hawaii had used the HST and the W. M. Keck Telescope in Hawaii to observe the remnants of supernova SN 1993J. They had discovered a massive star in close proximity to the star that had caused SN 1993J, demonstrating that supernovas emerge from binary star systems. According to the astronomers, supernovas occur in binary systems when one star collapses, shedding its mass, and a nearby star of comparable size accretes the lost mass.(ESA, \u201cFirst Supernova Companion Star Found,\u201d http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMT0J374OD_ index_0.)",

According to NASA official William F. Readdy, NASA had determined that extremely cold fuel had liquefied air or nitrogen, which subsequently had seeped into a portion of the foam or had collected on nuts and bolts below the foam, eventually expanding and explosively jettisoning a piece of the foam. The foam had shot from the fuel tank, hitting the orbiter and creating a large\u2015and ultimately fatal\u2015gash in its left wing. Before the Columbia tragedy, engineers had believed that when the fuel tanks shed foam, it fell away from the body of the orbiter. Readdy stated that NASA had redesigned the fuel tanks and improved techniques for applying the foam to remedy the problem that had caused the accident to Columbia.(Warren E.

Astronomer Ian Bond of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and his team of researchers had used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify a star located 17,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. The gravitational lensing technique entailed the observation of increases in the brightness of the light of distant stars, caused by the gravitational fields of stars closer to Earth. The astronomers made these observations when a star nearer Earth passed before the lens of a telescope on Earth, between the telescope and a more distant star. When this occurred, the nearer star\u2019s gravity caused the light of the more distant star\u2019s light to become brighter, so that the distant star became more visible to astronomers on Earth.(\u201cThomas H.

Because carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, acts as a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, the research team sought to identify the factors that influence carbon transfer between the atmosphere and soils. Led by Dev S. Niyogi of North Carolina State University, the scientists had used NASA satellite data to examine atmospheric aerosol content and carbon absorption in different ecosystems. They had discovered that high aerosol levels increase carbon absorption in croplands and forests but decrease carbon absorption in grasslands. The researchers suggested that this variation occurs because of the way that aerosols interact with different types of vegetation canopies to affect the dispersion of radiation from sunlight. In the dense vegetation canopies of croplands and forests, aerosols scatter sunlight in a manner that enables more radiation to reach a greater quantity of plant leaves and increases carbon absorption through plant photosynthesis.
