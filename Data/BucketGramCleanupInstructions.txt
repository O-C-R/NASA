*** get Jer to run the scripts again to include up to 2009,
verify that things like moon>FieldTerminology> “solar system” don’t occur twice
*** double check the 1985 pdf in size vs. other pdfs

***Examples of what to do****
Generally – 
if an obvious term comes up multiple times, eg. solar system, combine the numbers/values
Delete terms that clearly shouldn’t be in the diagram [most likely in the gram series]

Grams:
000 miles >> delete - misread by the system, so doesn’t make sense anymore
000 lbs >> delete - same as before
using nasa’s >> delete - out of context, doesn’t really work alone

Entities:
nasa Leg >> delete - doesn’t make sense
Kelly Johnson (engineer) >> Kelly Johnson - get rid if ( )
President-elect Kennedy >> delete - kind of weird
Sean O’Keefe―President George W. Bush >> delete - malformed
George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney >> delete/George Brydges Rodney


// hold off on these files
nn
vbg
//  but if we need to go through them later:
Delete words that clearly don’t belong, eg: i, use, jr, c, msc, mi, etc.
